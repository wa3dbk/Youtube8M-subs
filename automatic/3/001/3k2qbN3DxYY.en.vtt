okay<00:00:01.220> I'm<00:00:02.220> gonna<00:00:02.429> have<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.610> go<00:00:02.760> at<00:00:03.030> explaining

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
okay I'm gonna have a go at explaining

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.950 
okay I'm gonna have a go at explaining
the<00:00:03.770> alternating<00:00:04.770> thumb<00:00:05.390> picking<00:00:06.390> style

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
the alternating thumb picking style

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.919 
the alternating thumb picking style
which<00:00:07.890> would<00:00:08.069> be<00:00:08.160> useful<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.820> something<00:00:09.690> fine

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
which would be useful for something fine

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.499 
which would be useful for something fine
and<00:00:09.960> for<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.400> likes<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.700> streets<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.150> London

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
and for the likes of streets of London

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:22.620 
and for the likes of streets of London
and<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.780> million<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.320> sounds<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.830> go

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.509 

that<00:00:23.320> sort<00:00:23.589> of<00:00:23.650> thing<00:00:23.830> so<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:26.220> not<00:00:27.220> something

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
that sort of thing so it's not something

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:28.830 
that sort of thing so it's not something
I've<00:00:27.609> ever<00:00:27.789> learned<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.179> be<00:00:28.300> particularly

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
I've ever learned to be particularly

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.990 
I've ever learned to be particularly
accurate<00:00:29.019> with<00:00:29.410> generally<00:00:30.340> speaking<00:00:30.579> as<00:00:30.849> long

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
accurate with generally speaking as long

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.249 
accurate with generally speaking as long
as<00:00:31.119> I<00:00:31.210> get<00:00:31.300> my<00:00:31.359> thumb<00:00:31.660> doing<00:00:32.019> what<00:00:32.140> it's

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
as I get my thumb doing what it's

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.869 
as I get my thumb doing what it's
supposed<00:00:32.559> to<00:00:32.649> do<00:00:32.860> more<00:00:33.100> or<00:00:33.250> less<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:33.790> my

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
supposed to do more or less and my

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.700 
supposed to do more or less and my
fingers<00:00:34.210> flailing<00:00:34.720> about<00:00:34.840> in<00:00:35.199> some<00:00:35.410> kind<00:00:35.620> of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
fingers flailing about in some kind of

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.250 
fingers flailing about in some kind of
musical<00:00:36.460> sense<00:00:36.730> that's<00:00:37.449> usually<00:00:37.930> good<00:00:38.050> enough

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
musical sense that's usually good enough

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.979 
musical sense that's usually good enough
for<00:00:38.410> me<00:00:38.760> good<00:00:39.760> guitar<00:00:40.120> players<00:00:40.480> will<00:00:40.629> do<00:00:40.780> this

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
for me good guitar players will do this

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.389 
for me good guitar players will do this
properly<00:00:41.290> so<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:44.230> order<00:00:44.409> to<00:00:44.620> be<00:00:44.710> able<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.070> free

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
properly so in order to be able to free

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.790 
properly so in order to be able to free
be<00:00:45.699> free<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:46.420> easy<00:00:46.629> and<00:00:46.960> loose<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.440> and

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
be free and easy and loose and and

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.790 
be free and easy and loose and and
variable<00:00:48.670> with<00:00:48.879> your<00:00:49.120> finger<00:00:49.870> style<00:00:50.140> it's

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
variable with your finger style it's

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.979 
variable with your finger style it's
very<00:00:51.010> useful<00:00:51.430> to<00:00:51.460> learn<00:00:51.790> a<00:00:51.850> simple<00:00:52.570> one<00:00:52.780> to

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
very useful to learn a simple one to

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.630 
very useful to learn a simple one to
start<00:00:53.199> with<00:00:53.379> and<00:00:53.739> then<00:00:53.920> once<00:00:54.159> you've<00:00:54.309> got<00:00:54.339> the

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
start with and then once you've got the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.189 
start with and then once you've got the
hang<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:55.000> that<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.390> once<00:00:55.540> that's<00:00:55.720> coming

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
hang of that and once that's coming

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.100 
hang of that and once that's coming
freely<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.220> easily<00:00:57.369> as<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:57.790> play<00:00:58.150> then<00:00:58.960> you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
freely and easily as you play then you

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.899 
freely and easily as you play then you
can<00:00:59.290> vary<00:00:59.589> it<00:00:59.769> and<00:01:00.010> mess<00:01:00.159> around<00:01:00.280> with<00:01:00.610> it<00:01:00.670> and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
can vary it and mess around with it and

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.969 
can vary it and mess around with it and
undo<00:01:01.479> some<00:01:01.659> stuff<00:01:01.900> which<00:01:02.290> is<00:01:02.439> kind<00:01:02.710> of<00:01:02.799> what<00:01:02.949> I

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
undo some stuff which is kind of what I

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.130 
undo some stuff which is kind of what I
do<00:01:03.100> so<00:01:03.909> I'll<00:01:04.180> do<00:01:04.330> something<00:01:04.540> very<00:01:04.750> simple

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
do so I'll do something very simple

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.440 
do so I'll do something very simple
which<00:01:05.530> is<00:01:06.189> very<00:01:06.369> useful<00:01:06.580> for<00:01:06.759> something<00:01:07.180> fine

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
which is very useful for something fine

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.999 
which is very useful for something fine
and<00:01:07.840> it<00:01:07.930> goes<00:01:08.140> like<00:01:08.350> this<00:01:08.380> it's<00:01:08.710> called<00:01:08.860> an

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
and it goes like this it's called an

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.950 
and it goes like this it's called an
alternating<00:01:09.430> thumb<00:01:09.610> method<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:10.479> it<00:01:10.630> is<00:01:10.750> based

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
alternating thumb method and it is based

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.870 
alternating thumb method and it is based
on<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.290> principle<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:11.740> your<00:01:11.920> thumb<00:01:12.280> is

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
on the principle that your thumb is

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.719 
on the principle that your thumb is
keeping<00:01:13.509> every<00:01:14.079> b2<00:01:14.470> in<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.619> 4/4<00:01:15.100> time<00:01:15.430> your

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
keeping every b2 in a 4/4 time your

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.149 
keeping every b2 in a 4/4 time your
thumb<00:01:16.060> would<00:01:16.270> be<00:01:16.390> playing<00:01:16.600> one-and<00:01:17.350> two-and

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
thumb would be playing one-and two-and

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.420 
thumb would be playing one-and two-and
or<00:01:18.880> one<00:01:19.210> two<00:01:19.689> three<00:01:20.290> four<00:01:20.829> one<00:01:21.400> two<00:01:21.759> three<00:01:22.240> four

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
or one two three four one two three four

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.679 
or one two three four one two three four
and<00:01:24.430> that<00:01:24.549> never<00:01:24.729> changes<00:01:25.210> no<00:01:25.270> matter<00:01:25.390> what

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
and that never changes no matter what

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:33.100 
and that never changes no matter what
your<00:01:25.840> other<00:01:25.990> fingers<00:01:26.380> are<00:01:26.470> doing

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.290 

okay<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.130> it's<00:01:34.610> called<00:01:34.790> an<00:01:34.880> alternating

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
okay and it's called an alternating

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.060 
okay and it's called an alternating
tongue<00:01:35.630> because<00:01:35.960> your<00:01:36.110> thumb<00:01:36.410> alternates

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
tongue because your thumb alternates

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.390 
tongue because your thumb alternates
between<00:01:37.730> the<00:01:38.060> root<00:01:38.210> note<00:01:38.450> G<00:01:38.920> I'm<00:01:39.920> playing<00:01:40.160> a<00:01:40.220> G

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
between the root note G I'm playing a G

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.690 
between the root note G I'm playing a G
chord<00:01:40.430> here<00:01:40.790> by<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:40.970> way<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.130> root<00:01:43.490> note

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
chord here by the way so you root note

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.150 
chord here by the way so you root note
alternates<00:01:44.240> between<00:01:44.390> G<00:01:46.240> on<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.450> sixth<00:01:47.690> string

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
alternates between G on the sixth string

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:56.469 
alternates between G on the sixth string
and<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:51.680> 5th<00:01:52.640> string<00:01:52.970> which<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:54.050> B<00:01:54.440> so<00:01:55.479> roof

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
and the 5th string which is a B so roof

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.960 
and the 5th string which is a B so roof
and<00:01:56.690> B<00:01:57.260> and<00:01:57.560> in<00:01:57.950> between<00:01:58.130> plays<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.760> fourth

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
and B and in between plays the fourth

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:06.250 
and B and in between plays the fourth
string<00:01:59.240> which<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.140> open<00:02:00.440> D

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.190 

okay<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.760> it<00:02:07.880> alternates<00:02:08.360> between<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:09.050> two

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
okay so it alternates between the two

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.990 
okay so it alternates between the two
based<00:02:09.440> rings<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:09.950> alternates<00:02:10.430> between<00:02:10.580> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
based rings it alternates between the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.810 
based rings it alternates between the
first<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.630> fifth<00:02:11.930> first<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.710> the<00:02:12.770> third

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
first and the fifth first and the third

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.070 
first and the fifth first and the third
that<00:02:13.820> sort<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.240> thing<00:02:14.420> when<00:02:14.660> you're<00:02:14.780> playing<00:02:14.930> a

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
that sort of thing when you're playing a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.970 
that sort of thing when you're playing a
C<00:02:15.320> chord<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:17.270> would<00:02:17.480> go<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:18.110> other<00:02:18.140> way<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
C chord it would go the other way so the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.190 
C chord it would go the other way so the
root<00:02:19.160> note<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.610> on<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.090> fifth<00:02:20.300> string<00:02:20.630> here<00:02:20.990> on

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
root note is on the fifth string here on

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.760 
root note is on the fifth string here on
the<00:02:21.320> C<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.750> play

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.289 

or<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.400> might<00:02:28.550> play

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.280 

doesn't<00:02:35.299> really<00:02:35.420> matter<00:02:35.659> it<00:02:35.810> depends<00:02:36.079> on<00:02:36.140> what

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
doesn't really matter it depends on what

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.170 
doesn't really matter it depends on what
you<00:02:36.379> want<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.560> do<00:02:36.709> for<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.489> exercise<00:02:37.760> I'm

going to show you the alternating thumb

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.629 
going to show you the alternating thumb
method<00:02:40.790> with<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.060> fairly<00:02:41.629> simple<00:02:42.189> finger<00:02:43.189> style

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
method with a fairly simple finger style

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.399 
method with a fairly simple finger style
on<00:02:43.879> the<00:02:44.030> three<00:02:44.239> thing<00:02:44.420> if<00:02:44.629> I<00:02:44.749> can<00:02:44.930> get<00:02:45.079> it<00:02:45.200> right

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.600 

that<00:03:01.840> sort<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.050> thing<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:03.099> it<00:03:03.190> goes<00:03:03.280> like<00:03:03.370> this

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
that sort of thing and it goes like this

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.860 
that sort of thing and it goes like this
