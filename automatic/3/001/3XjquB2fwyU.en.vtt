00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
like a plant was I can't really say why

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.720 
like a plant was I can't really say why
this<00:00:54.810> coating<00:00:55.110> did<00:00:55.440> fail<00:00:55.710> there's<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.340> number

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
this coating did fail there's a number

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.960 
this coating did fail there's a number
of<00:00:57.120> about<00:00:57.660> reasons<00:00:58.230> why<00:00:58.410> wood<00:00:59.250> isn't<00:00:59.489> exactly

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
of about reasons why wood isn't exactly

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.389 
of about reasons why wood isn't exactly
the<00:01:00.120> best<00:01:00.450> type<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.110> material<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.070> enough

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
the best type of material to have enough

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.329 
the best type of material to have enough
horizontal<00:01:03.030> surface<00:01:03.540> outdoors<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:05.009> if<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
horizontal surface outdoors but if you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.910 
horizontal surface outdoors but if you
can't<00:01:05.549> afford<00:01:05.719> VXR<00:01:06.719> or<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.259> exact<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.860> this

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
can't afford VXR or the exact and this

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.440 
can't afford VXR or the exact and this
is<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> way<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> go<00:01:08.579> or<00:01:09.860> if<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.369> we've<00:01:12.240> had

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
is the way to go or if like if we've had

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.910 
is the way to go or if like if we've had
a<00:01:12.479> bad<00:01:12.840> winter<00:01:13.079> and<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> lot<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.680> snow

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
a bad winter and there's a lot of snow

a bad winter and there's a lot of snow
and<00:01:14.130> ice<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.640> has<00:01:14.820> sat<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.479> top<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and ice that has sat on top of it it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.709 
and ice that has sat on top of it it
could<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.710> pulled<00:01:17.070> up<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.490> coating<00:01:18.450> or

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
could have pulled up the coating or

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.669 
could have pulled up the coating or
shovels<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.709> gets<00:01:20.069> worn<00:01:20.369> across<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.469> and<00:01:22.469> a

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
shovels that gets worn across it and a

shovels that gets worn across it and a
lot<00:01:22.829> of<00:01:22.920> times<00:01:23.130> when<00:01:23.429> the<00:01:23.579> wood<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.789> new

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
lot of times when the wood is new

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.669 
lot of times when the wood is new
there's<00:01:24.329> this<00:01:24.479> stuff<00:01:24.689> called<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.079> mill<00:01:25.350> plays

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
there's this stuff called a mill plays

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.830 
there's this stuff called a mill plays
that's<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.159> brand<00:01:26.579> new<00:01:26.729> wood<00:01:26.969> and<00:01:27.299> unless<00:01:27.569> you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that's on brand new wood and unless you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.260 
that's on brand new wood and unless you
get<00:01:28.049> rid<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.289> that<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:29.219> sealer<00:01:29.670> or<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> paint

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
get rid of that the sealer or the paint

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.819 
get rid of that the sealer or the paint
that<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.509> try<00:01:30.719> to<00:01:30.749> put<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.139> top<00:01:31.319> of<00:01:31.499> it<00:01:31.590> won't

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that you try to put on top of it won't

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.699 
that you try to put on top of it won't
soak<00:01:32.219> into<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.819> surface<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.810> merely<00:01:34.139> sits<00:01:34.499> on

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
soak into the surface it merely sits on

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:37.849 
soak into the surface it merely sits on
on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> surface<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.319> never<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.709> its

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
on the surface and it can never do its

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.399 
on the surface and it can never do its
job<00:01:38.069> and<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.819> it<00:01:39.240> never<00:01:39.509> gets<00:01:39.749> into<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.229> wood

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
job and and it never gets into the wood

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.510 
job and and it never gets into the wood
and<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.889> so<00:01:41.039> easily<00:01:41.329> Lyria<00:01:42.329> moves<00:01:42.719> so<00:01:43.520> this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and it's so easily Lyria moves so this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.999 
and it's so easily Lyria moves so this
is<00:01:44.639> definitely<00:01:44.819> a<00:01:45.329> technique<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.319> you<00:01:46.829> may

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
is definitely a technique that you may

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.589 
is definitely a technique that you may
want<00:01:47.249> to<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.459> with<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:47.849> you're<00:01:48.029> unhappy<00:01:48.209> with

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
want to go with if you're unhappy with

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.160 
want to go with if you're unhappy with
the<00:01:48.899> surface<00:01:49.319> or<00:01:49.469> the<00:01:49.499> looks<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:50.009> your<00:01:50.310> deck

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
the surface or the looks of your deck

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.169 
the surface or the looks of your deck
because<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.469> you<00:01:52.679> just<00:01:52.950> paint<00:01:53.429> directly<00:01:53.969> right

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
because if you just paint directly right

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.999 
because if you just paint directly right
over<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.569> then<00:01:54.959> there's<00:01:55.679> all<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.979> other

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
over this then there's all the other

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.459 
over this then there's all the other
areas<00:01:56.639> that<00:01:56.789> are<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.240> continue<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:58.229> fail

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
areas that are going to continue to fail

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.469 
areas that are going to continue to fail
in<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.709> future<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.819> will<00:01:59.999> lift<00:02:00.270> up

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
in the future that will lift up

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.149 
in the future that will lift up
underneath<00:02:00.959> your<00:02:01.349> earth<00:02:01.469> right<00:02:01.679> new<00:02:01.799> coating

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
underneath your earth right new coating

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:02.609 
underneath your earth right new coating
so

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
so

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.959 
so
best<00:02:02.829> thing<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.009> do<00:02:03.159> is<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.579> get<00:02:03.700> rid<00:02:03.850> of

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
best thing you do is just to get rid of

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.410 
best thing you do is just to get rid of
as<00:02:04.090> much<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:05.049> as<00:02:05.079> possible<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.909> tools

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
as much of it as possible and the tools

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.300 
as much of it as possible and the tools
and<00:02:07.600> materials<00:02:07.689> that<00:02:08.140> I'm<00:02:08.500> using<00:02:08.890> for<00:02:09.009> with

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
and materials that I'm using for with

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.650 
and materials that I'm using for with
the<00:02:09.369> job<00:02:09.550> were<00:02:09.700> right<00:02:09.849> over<00:02:09.940> here<00:02:10.209> first<00:02:10.450> we're

acid in it and what it does is it you
put<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.519> on<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.090> let<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.360> sit<00:02:19.480> on<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
put it on and you let it sit on the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.350 
put it on and you let it sit on the
surface<00:02:20.410> for<00:02:20.950> 15<00:02:21.099> -<00:02:21.670> o'clock

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
surface for 15 - o'clock

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.630 
surface for 15 - o'clock
30<00:02:22.720> minutes<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.349> what<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.129> does<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.489> it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
30 minutes and what that does is it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.320 
30 minutes and what that does is it
softens<00:02:24.940> up<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.959> old<00:02:26.290> coal<00:02:26.739> coating<00:02:27.519> so<00:02:28.090> that

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
softens up the old coal coating so that

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.089 
softens up the old coal coating so that
you<00:02:28.780> can<00:02:28.959> just<00:02:29.170> either<00:02:29.290> take<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.709> off<00:02:29.799> with<00:02:30.040> a

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
you can just either take it off with a

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.619 
you can just either take it off with a
brush<00:02:30.400> I'm<00:02:30.670> going<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:30.940> use<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.269> pressure

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
brush I'm going to use the pressure

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.920 
brush I'm going to use the pressure
washer<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.799> again<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.390> very

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
washer but again it's a it's very

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.319 
washer but again it's a it's very
powerful<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:37.209> has<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.920> acid<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.549> and

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
powerful and it has a acid in it and

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.809 
powerful and it has a acid in it and
then<00:02:40.920> after<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.069> we're<00:02:42.280> gonna<00:02:42.370> use<00:02:42.489> the

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
then after that we're gonna use the

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.690 
then after that we're gonna use the
woods<00:02:43.180> right<00:02:43.480> nerve<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.019> that's<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.190> chemical

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
woods right nerve and that's a chemical

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.180 
woods right nerve and that's a chemical
that<00:02:45.849> is<00:02:45.910> used<00:02:46.360> directly<00:02:47.049> after<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:48.010> early

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
that is used directly after the early

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.860 
that is used directly after the early
over<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.640> what<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.910> does<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.269> it<00:02:49.420> brightens

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
over and what that does is it brightens

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.800 
over and what that does is it brightens
the<00:02:50.049> wood<00:02:50.200> back<00:02:50.530> up<00:02:50.849> because<00:02:51.849> your<00:02:52.299> remover

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
the wood back up because your remover

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.250 
the wood back up because your remover
does<00:02:53.049> have<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.620> acid<00:02:54.310> in<00:02:54.819> it<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.299> it's<00:02:56.079> what

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
does have a acid in it and it's what

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.740 
does have a acid in it and it's what
that<00:02:56.290> does<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.040> neutralizes<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:57.970> acid

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
that does is it neutralizes that acid

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.990 
that does is it neutralizes that acid
and<00:02:58.930> returns<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.920> wood<00:03:00.129> to<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.519> bright<00:03:00.730> color

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
and returns the wood to the bright color

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.559 
and returns the wood to the bright color
and<00:03:01.299> not<00:03:01.629> the<00:03:02.079> great<00:03:02.739> color<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.390> wood

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
and not the great color and the wood

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.110 
and not the great color and the wood
brightener<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.110> also<00:03:05.470> good<00:03:05.860> for<00:03:06.099> texts<00:03:06.549> that

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
brightener is also good for texts that

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.629 
brightener is also good for texts that
have<00:03:07.600> grayed<00:03:07.989> out<00:03:08.019> from<00:03:08.620> like<00:03:08.769> from<00:03:09.069> like<00:03:09.160> a<00:03:09.220> UV

again<00:03:26.200> when<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.530> use<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.889> UH<00:03:26.920> pressure

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
again when you use the UH pressure

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.129 
again when you use the UH pressure
washer<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.670> see<00:03:28.120> how<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.329> really<00:03:28.870> want<00:03:29.079> to

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
washer you see how you really want to

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.390 
washer you see how you really want to
know<00:03:29.230> what<00:03:29.440> you're<00:03:29.590> doing<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.889> have<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.099> move

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
know what you're doing you have to move

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.229 
know what you're doing you have to move
in<00:03:30.639> in<00:03:31.419> a<00:03:31.540> fast<00:03:31.989> sweep<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.889> this<00:03:33.849> will

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
in in a fast sweep so that this will

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.129 
in in a fast sweep so that this will
soften<00:03:34.630> up<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.349> yes<00:03:36.340> surface<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:38.019> wood

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
soften up the yes surface of the wood

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.229 
soften up the yes surface of the wood
and<00:03:38.349> it<00:03:38.410> actually<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.950> raises<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.579> drains<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
and it actually it raises the drains a

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.229 
and it actually it raises the drains a
little<00:03:41.200> bit<00:03:41.380> so<00:03:41.590> what<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:41.829> have<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.040> do

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
little bit so what you have to do

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.360 
little bit so what you have to do
afterwards<00:03:43.239> after<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:44.139> dries<00:03:44.349> his<00:03:44.620> sand<00:03:45.220> it

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
afterwards after it dries his sand it

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.879 
afterwards after it dries his sand it
down<00:03:45.400> but<00:03:46.239> this<00:03:46.359> is<00:03:46.510> definitely<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:47.200> best<00:03:47.590> way

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
down but this is definitely the best way

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:48.940 
down but this is definitely the best way
to<00:03:47.919> remove

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
to remove

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.360 
to remove
holding<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.910> fastest<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.290> then<00:03:51.500> after<00:03:52.069> I'm

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
holding the fastest and then after I'm

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.600 
holding the fastest and then after I'm
going<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.610> give<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.849> deck<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.950> two<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.580> three

going to give the deck to two to three

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.850 
going to give the deck to two to three
days<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.000> dry<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.989> I'm<00:03:57.230> going<00:03:57.410> to<00:03:57.470> use<00:03:57.590> my<00:03:57.800> to

the spindles it has a rectangular shape
there<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:10.069> then<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:10.819> have<00:04:11.180> my<00:04:11.690> random<00:04:11.989> four<00:04:12.620> bit

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
there and then I have my random four bit

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.060 
there and then I have my random four bit
here<00:04:13.420> this<00:04:14.420> is<00:04:14.630> unlike<00:04:15.110> a<00:04:15.140> random<00:04:15.590> orbit<00:04:15.950> it

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
here this is unlike a random orbit it

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.580 
here this is unlike a random orbit it
has<00:04:16.190> it<00:04:16.549> has<00:04:16.820> two<00:04:17.600> paths<00:04:17.870> here<00:04:18.079> one<00:04:18.350> on<00:04:18.380> the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
has it has two paths here one on the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.900 
has it has two paths here one on the
outside<00:04:18.739> one<00:04:19.130> on<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.340> inside<00:04:19.459> there's<00:04:19.850> a

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
outside one on the inside there's a

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.260 
outside one on the inside there's a
space<00:04:20.209> in<00:04:20.570> between<00:04:20.630> here<00:04:21.079> and<00:04:21.410> they<00:04:21.919> oscillate

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
space in between here and they oscillate

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.460 
space in between here and they oscillate
independent<00:04:23.270> of<00:04:23.360> one<00:04:23.540> another<00:04:23.570> therefore<00:04:24.050> it

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
independent of one another therefore it

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.520 
independent of one another therefore it
cancels<00:04:24.860> out<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.700> the<00:04:26.210> vibrations<00:04:26.840> caused<00:04:27.139> by

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
cancels out the the vibrations caused by

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.800 
cancels out the the vibrations caused by
each<00:04:27.770> of<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.160> disks<00:04:28.520> which<00:04:28.820> in<00:04:28.970> turn<00:04:29.210> saves<00:04:29.600> or

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
each of the disks which in turn saves or

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.320 
each of the disks which in turn saves or
elbow<00:04:30.139> saves<00:04:31.130> your<00:04:31.280> elbow<00:04:31.639> a<00:04:31.669> lot<00:04:31.940> of<00:04:32.210> the

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
elbow saves your elbow a lot of the

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:39.640 
elbow saves your elbow a lot of the
vibrations<00:04:35.380> so<00:04:37.389> so<00:04:38.389> once<00:04:38.900> again<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.350> is<00:04:39.410> the

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
vibrations so so once again this is the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.800 
vibrations so so once again this is the
best<00:04:40.130> method<00:04:40.370> if<00:04:40.940> you're<00:04:41.150> unhappy<00:04:41.300> with<00:04:41.630> the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
best method if you're unhappy with the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.480 
best method if you're unhappy with the
appearance<00:04:41.870> of<00:04:42.380> your<00:04:42.800> deck<00:04:42.979> and<00:04:43.190> you<00:04:43.250> really

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
appearance of your deck and you really

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.680 
appearance of your deck and you really
just<00:04:43.639> want<00:04:43.820> to<00:04:43.910> get<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.090> lot<00:04:44.300> of<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:44.510> old

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
just want to get a lot of the old

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.990 
just want to get a lot of the old
coating<00:04:45.200> up<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.650> off<00:04:45.770> okay<00:04:46.669> we're<00:04:46.880> gonna

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
coating up and off okay we're gonna

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.360 
coating up and off okay we're gonna
start<00:04:47.330> first<00:04:47.540> by<00:04:47.690> testing<00:04:48.470> out<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:49.220> have

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
start first by testing out you have

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.090 
start first by testing out you have
stripper<00:04:50.030> on<00:04:50.240> a<00:04:50.270> piece<00:04:50.810> of<00:04:50.990> wood<00:04:51.110> here<00:04:51.350> so

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
stripper on a piece of wood here so

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.680 
stripper on a piece of wood here so
we'll<00:04:52.220> put<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.520> on<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:53.120> then<00:04:53.240> we'll<00:04:53.389> let<00:04:53.510> this

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
we'll put it on and then we'll let this

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.750 
we'll put it on and then we'll let this
sit<00:04:54.020> for<00:04:56.440> fifteen<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.830> thirty<00:04:57.860> minutes<00:04:58.460> and

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
sit for fifteen to thirty minutes and

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.850 
sit for fifteen to thirty minutes and
then<00:04:58.880> come<00:04:59.090> back<00:04:59.120> and<00:04:59.479> before<00:05:00.020> we<00:05:00.380> start<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.830> uh

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
then come back and before we start to uh

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.590 
then come back and before we start to uh
spray<00:05:01.190> down<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.400> up<00:05:01.700> chemicals<00:05:02.210> that<00:05:02.330> we<00:05:02.419> want

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
spray down the up chemicals that we want

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.029 
spray down the up chemicals that we want
to<00:05:02.660> do<00:05:02.780> is<00:05:02.900> wet<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.530> others

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
to do is wet the others

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.550 
to do is wet the others
yes<00:05:04.280> surrounding<00:05:04.760> flowers<00:05:05.240> or<00:05:05.810> plants<00:05:06.289> that

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
yes surrounding flowers or plants that

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.290 
yes surrounding flowers or plants that
you<00:05:06.710> have<00:05:06.740> around<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.430> yes<00:05:07.760> siding<00:05:08.150> too

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
you have around and yes siding too

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.960 
you have around and yes siding too
because<00:05:08.570> remember<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:09.470> acid<00:05:09.650> yeah<00:05:10.370> yeah

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
because remember the acid yeah yeah

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.540 
because remember the acid yeah yeah
stripper<00:05:11.450> does<00:05:11.660> have<00:05:11.930> a<00:05:12.169> acid<00:05:12.800> in<00:05:12.919> it<00:05:13.039> so<00:05:13.490> you

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
stripper does have a acid in it so you

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.070 
stripper does have a acid in it so you
definitely<00:05:13.669> want<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.090> keep<00:05:14.240> stuff<00:05:14.539> wet<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:14.990> it

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
definitely want to keep stuff wet and it

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.040 
definitely want to keep stuff wet and it
also<00:05:15.200> helps<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.590> do<00:05:15.800> it<00:05:15.950> on<00:05:16.130> a<00:05:16.160> rainy<00:05:16.460> day<00:05:17.050> light

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
also helps to do it on a rainy day light

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.320 
also helps to do it on a rainy day light
like<00:05:18.380> today<00:05:18.650> where<00:05:19.010> everything<00:05:19.490> is<00:05:19.789> already

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
like today where everything is already

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.629 
like today where everything is already
wet<00:05:20.510> so<00:05:20.539> that<00:05:21.139> definitely<00:05:21.410> helps<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:22.370> we'll

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
wet so that definitely helps so we'll

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.360 
wet so that definitely helps so we'll
just<00:05:22.789> start<00:05:23.030> off<00:05:23.180> by<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.389> wedding<00:05:23.840> gown<00:05:24.250> we<00:05:25.250> have

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
just start off by a wedding gown we have

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.219 
just start off by a wedding gown we have
flowers

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
flowers

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:37.850 
flowers
and<00:05:27.409> siding

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:48.530
