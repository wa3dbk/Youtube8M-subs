00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:08.049
 [Music] 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.030
 hello let's prepare the sauce now 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.110
 tartar the ingredients for the sauce 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:22.560
 tartar are the vegetables mayonnaise 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.560
 with parsley the parsley and capers 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.980
 first of all we must prepare the 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:31.090
 mayonnaise in which we will go to 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.250
 add the vegetables to the corner now 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.510
 these vegetables can be made either 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.280
 fresh than buying pickles in the 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.260
 know jars 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.820
 if we make them fresh we must do it 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.090
 boil water with 20 percent or 30 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.490
 of vinegar and salt when it has reached 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.660
 boiling we go as we did 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.820
 we are going to incorporate some 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.110
 vegetables carrots peas cucumbers 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:06.549
 chopped onion not minced 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.100
 cut thin just blanched the 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.110
 let's get out of the fire but we have it 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.719
 always in his water 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.509
 if instead we had to use that and i 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:19.060
 jar pickles must 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.189
 chop them much more finely because 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.789
 being much more vinegar then one must 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.999
 remove some of the vinegar that is in the 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.819
 jar then we remove the pickles from 

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:33.729
 deliberate jar of vinegar e 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.619
 we chop very very finely and then in 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.189
 a rag with a strong pressure 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.920
 let's fly as much water as possible 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.500
 at that point it goes to incorporate 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.979
 in mayonnaise then we did 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.450
 our vegetables so let's just do it 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:55.049
 light pressure a little 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.130
 pressure to remove some water 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:05.280
 sorrel and we bring our vegetables 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:08.789
 in mayonnaise it is more than sufficient 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.789
 in this way 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:19.030
 then we take clean parsley 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.030
 without the stem and we are going to chop them 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.030
 clumsily 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.780
 in this way 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.760
 and we begin gently to mix the 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.760
 all in scenes 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.980
 here we take the capers 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.630
 et recall these a little more finely 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.380
 after all because as you well know the 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:03.330
 caper is much more intense as a taste 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.790
 therefore it is better than the perception at 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.430
 mouth is more delicate and not with 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.450
 aggressive to cover the taste then of 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:18.140
 all other vegetables always 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.140
 delicately so as not to disassemble 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:34.050
 the mayonnaise we mix the whole is the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.910
 our tartar sauce is ready 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.900
 there is absolutely no need for 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.900
 correct it with salt because the vegetables 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.420
 we would have already salted the water or those in the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.709
 pickled jars are already a 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.380
 so place the caper from a big a 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.730
 also carries a large amount of salt 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.549
 therefore it is more than sufficient 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.610
 all here is the salt that vegetables and 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.610
 capers year this is the tartar sauce 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:11.310
 ready to be tasted with fish 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:14.300
 I read good but I recommend it with 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.300
 boiled salmon 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.129
