00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:11.740
 [Music] 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.170
 very good friends that such good in this 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.460
 video I bring you what would be a test 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:21.369
 of 2015 with the last patch that I've 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.350
 put on weight although the graph already 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.630
 Take the fish well apart from tucked 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.930
 the best graphics of the last one the 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.119
 last of the last one that is motivating and good 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.850
 thinking this what equipment there is 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.180
 very much I with a madrid-barça we are going to 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.370
 try in the bernabéu to see how it looks 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.590
 ok although it comes to images we get to 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.470
 see him at night 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.600
 and that's good to teach my are watching 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.300
 how I still did not cook the filter 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.530
 güestia recarte moto with the filter I will 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.630
 be doing constant tests of 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.059
 how to use and put the sweet filter 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.190
 fx because in addition to the patch itself carries 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.190
 filter food as it is ready 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:09.640
 now I have removed it to sevilla normal the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.460
 difference would be 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.500
 and again the web to make a difference 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.010
 is very big the truth is that already of 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.229
 this way the graphics are already seen not 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.740
 I say at the height of the lawn you can see 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.090
 enough already fairly well apart 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.670
 I'm seeing this one is a stadium 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.220
 new officer and the truth that is seen from 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.230
 luxury 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.360
 so good leave with a little bit of 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:38.440
 gameplay so you can see what everything looks like 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.440
 how everything moves 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.730
 [Applause] 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.630
 oh and I do not know why there is a small vessel 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.360
 is the world shown at the ceremony 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.460
 I do not know why he asks 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.860
 now I have removed the filter and now it has 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.130
 put back when seen with a tone 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.460
 orange when the truth that the 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.460
 filter 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.240
 you see the stadium the truth that is very 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.010
 well done for example the bernabéu that 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.739
 it does not come after it's very well recreated 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.299
 and well there, that's just a 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.310
 little a graphic sample so that from there 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.310
 how it looks 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.790
 I'm going to show you a little how it looks 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.299
 good night what is the sky that also 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.530
 again the sky and how it looks looks more 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.349
 or less everything 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:54.340
 nothing to look at the detail looks very good 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.340
 respect to those that looks great 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.080
 very well the truth 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.380
 the truth is almost as it should look 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.650
 the game and not how they sold it to us 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.650
 Your day 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.170
 and well now I'm going to leave you with some 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.170
 views 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.660
 just a bit like it looks with the 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.260
 filters and spirits being much 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.239
 different in fx and now it's changing 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.030
 quite changes the colors more 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.540
 natural and graphically it looks pretty 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.540
 best 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.180
 as you can see well being a little review of 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.310
 what is what in the patch of some 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.220
 way some stadiums you have to see how 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.230
 they look and good graphically game to me 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.770
 for I like and how much it improves 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.160
 seen in the original game and finally 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.300
 I leave you with another gameplay and graphics 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.420
 so you can see the old stadium 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.580
 trafford that this is an official stadium 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.400
 viewpoints that you have to look nice with 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:23.540
 the stars and everything there is a very 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:28.190
 cool here he had 5 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:31.780
 we do not see without with the twitter 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.850
 and the truth is very good 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.440
 to enable and disable wifi 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.240
 and once you put it on, you have to give it 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.400
 to the scroll lock button or 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.009
 the scroll 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.319
 what you have on the keyboard 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.069
 can already be put and after arriving in the 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.069
 difference of cc 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.840
 and the truth is that if you do not have if 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.210
 like then they want to kill us the monkey 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.680
 until the new one comes out is a good 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.220
 way to have it 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.220
 with this configuration 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.250
 so nothing in the description I will not leave 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.680
 the details of how you have to be 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.830
 good I will leave the links to you 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.070
 patches to the matches so that the 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:21.350
 You can download and you can also Carlos and 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.350
 so you can enjoy this great patch 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.780
 [Music] 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.730
 and well I will make a small view 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.440
 well within the repetition of the game 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.289
 so you can see a little too you do not see 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.420
 at that height as length 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.940
 as it looks looks very, very good 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:47.100
 so nothing guys see you in another 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.100
 new video see you later 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:06:02.120
 [Music] 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.319
 and 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.319
