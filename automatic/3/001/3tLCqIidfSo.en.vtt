want<00:00:26.720> to<00:00:26.900> focus<00:00:27.080> on<00:00:27.529> first<00:00:27.890> of<00:00:28.070> all<00:00:28.570> it's

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
want to focus on first of all it's

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.300 
want to focus on first of all it's
important<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:30.290> I<00:00:30.470> know<00:00:30.919> where<00:00:31.130> they're

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
important that I know where they're

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.160 
important that I know where they're
coming<00:00:31.579> from<00:00:31.700> what<00:00:32.180> experience<00:00:32.870> they've<00:00:32.990> had

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
coming from what experience they've had

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.440 
coming from what experience they've had
in<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.350> past<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:34.120> talked<00:00:35.120> too<00:00:35.270> much<00:00:35.300> about

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
in the past and talked too much about

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:45.549 
in the past and talked too much about
their<00:00:35.960> beading<00:00:43.960> right<00:00:44.960> well<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:45.199> think<00:00:45.289> the

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
their beading right well I think the

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.099 
their beading right well I think the
first<00:00:45.859> meeting<00:00:46.489> is<00:00:46.640> is<00:00:46.940> really<00:00:47.420> important<00:00:47.930> to

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
first meeting is is really important to

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.490 
first meeting is is really important to
for<00:00:48.800> this<00:00:48.920> student<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.059> I'd<00:00:50.750> sort<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:51.199> get<00:00:51.379> to

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
for this student and I'd sort of get to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.660 
for this student and I'd sort of get to
know<00:00:51.530> each<00:00:51.649> other<00:00:52.039> really<00:00:54.100> it's<00:00:55.100> more<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.550> have

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
know each other really it's more to have

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.369 
know each other really it's more to have
a<00:00:55.699> sense<00:00:55.969> of<00:00:56.239> where<00:00:56.600> we're<00:00:56.780> both<00:00:56.929> coming<00:00:57.260> from

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
a sense of where we're both coming from

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.169 
a sense of where we're both coming from
so<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:57.920> we<00:00:58.039> can<00:00:58.250> feel<00:00:58.399> comfortable<00:00:58.550> talking

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
so that we can feel comfortable talking

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.560 
so that we can feel comfortable talking
to<00:00:59.449> each<00:00:59.570> other<00:01:00.760> am<00:01:01.760> I<00:01:01.879> supposed<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.269> get<00:01:02.449> to

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
to each other am I supposed to get to

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.150 
to each other am I supposed to get to
understand<00:01:02.929> the<00:01:03.019> context<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.739> students

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
understand the context of students

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.400 
understand the context of students
working<00:01:04.370> in<00:01:04.790> because<00:01:05.660> I'm<00:01:06.110> not<00:01:06.290> always

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
working in because I'm not always

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.170 
working in because I'm not always
familiar<00:01:06.890> with<00:01:07.010> those<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:08.420> get<00:01:08.540> a<00:01:08.570> range<00:01:08.870> of

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
familiar with those to get a range of

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.520 
familiar with those to get a range of
ideas<00:01:11.180> about<00:01:11.360> what<00:01:11.570> they<00:01:11.720> are<00:01:11.750> interested<00:01:12.200> in

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
ideas about what they are interested in

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.590 
ideas about what they are interested in
the<00:01:12.680> broadest<00:01:13.100> sense<00:01:13.370> and<00:01:14.060> also<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.480> ways

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
the broadest sense and also the ways

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.109 
the broadest sense and also the ways
they<00:01:14.780> like<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.140> work<00:01:15.400> because<00:01:16.400> some<00:01:16.549> students

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
they like to work because some students

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.170 
they like to work because some students
will<00:01:18.040> like<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.070> start<00:01:19.610> with<00:01:19.759> a<00:01:19.790> bigger

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
will like to start with a bigger

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.710 
will like to start with a bigger
approach<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:22.729> perhaps<00:01:22.909> like<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.360> read<00:01:23.540> there

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
approach and perhaps like to read there

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.410 
approach and perhaps like to read there
were<00:01:23.780> lots<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:24.049> reading<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.820> they<00:01:26.150> can<00:01:26.299> be

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
were lots of reading and and they can be

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.660 
were lots of reading and and they can be
very<00:01:26.570> fast<00:01:26.840> where<00:01:27.470> those<00:01:27.829> perhaps<00:01:28.040> might<00:01:28.430> want

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
very fast where those perhaps might want

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.160 
very fast where those perhaps might want
to<00:01:28.790> focus<00:01:29.710> more<00:01:30.970> finally<00:01:31.970> earlier<00:01:32.689> on<00:01:32.899> and

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
to focus more finally earlier on and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.990 
to focus more finally earlier on and
it's<00:01:33.290> getting<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.770> sense<00:01:33.979> of<00:01:34.220> what's<00:01:34.490> going<00:01:34.790> to

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
it's getting a sense of what's going to

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.399 
it's getting a sense of what's going to
help<00:01:35.149> them<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.509> work<00:01:35.659> most<00:01:36.170> effectively

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
help them to work most effectively

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.270 
help them to work most effectively
really

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.650 

what<00:01:44.120> setting<00:01:44.480> they're<00:01:44.630> working<00:01:45.020> in<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:46.660> what

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
what setting they're working in and what

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.640 
what setting they're working in and what
their<00:01:47.930> focus<00:01:48.620> for<00:01:49.250> their<00:01:49.400> project<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:50.650> the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
their focus for their project is the

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.950 
their focus for their project is the
background<00:01:52.070> eyes<00:01:52.340> focus<00:01:52.850> white<00:01:53.270> interests

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
background eyes focus white interests

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.010 
background eyes focus white interests
for<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.200> winners<00:01:54.470> come<00:01:54.740> from<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.550> also<00:01:56.060> the

for the winners come from and also the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.350 
for the winners come from and also the
where<00:01:57.590> they<00:01:57.800> are<00:01:57.950> at<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.610> moment<00:01:59.090> are<00:01:59.210> they

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
where they are at the moment are they

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.820 
where they are at the moment are they
clear<00:01:59.690> about<00:01:59.960> where<00:02:00.260> they're<00:02:00.500> going<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.710> take

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
clear about where they're going to take

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.190 
clear about where they're going to take
their<00:02:01.250> their<00:02:01.670> project<00:02:02.150> so<00:02:02.570> we<00:02:02.690> talked<00:02:03.110> about

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
their their project so we talked about

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.270 
their their project so we talked about
that<00:02:03.560> quite<00:02:04.040> some<00:02:04.460> detail<00:02:05.800> so<00:02:06.800> that<00:02:07.010> they<00:02:07.130> have

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
that quite some detail so that they have

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.690 
that quite some detail so that they have
a<00:02:07.310> very<00:02:07.580> clear<00:02:08.200> plan<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.560> action<00:02:10.070> where<00:02:10.310> where

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
a very clear plan of action where where

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.930 
a very clear plan of action where where
they<00:02:10.820> need<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.000> go<00:02:11.240> next<00:02:11.750> with<00:02:11.990> their<00:02:12.230> project

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
they need to go next with their project

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.490 
they need to go next with their project
sometimes<00:02:13.940> students<00:02:14.540> are<00:02:14.690> very<00:02:14.780> clear

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
sometimes students are very clear

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.010 
sometimes students are very clear
sometimes<00:02:16.310> they're<00:02:16.700> rather<00:02:17.150> vague<00:02:17.420> about

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
sometimes they're rather vague about

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.080 
sometimes they're rather vague about
what<00:02:18.080> they<00:02:18.680> need<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.890> do<00:02:19.130> they<00:02:19.310> just<00:02:19.520> have<00:02:19.790> a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
what they need to do they just have a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.820 
what they need to do they just have a
time<00:02:20.510> for<00:02:22.209> very<00:02:23.209> much<00:02:23.390> reading<00:02:23.870> anything<00:02:24.709> at

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
time for very much reading anything at

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.650 
time for very much reading anything at
all<00:02:25.010> which<00:02:25.459> case<00:02:25.730> they<00:02:25.940> need<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.239> go<00:02:26.360> away<00:02:26.480> and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
all which case they need to go away and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.610 
all which case they need to go away and
refine<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.920> question<00:02:29.260> something<00:02:30.260> else<00:02:30.500> that

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
refine the question something else that

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.320 
refine the question something else that
I<00:02:30.650> think<00:02:30.709> is<00:02:30.980> very<00:02:31.100> important<00:02:32.000> is

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
I think is very important is

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.960 
I think is very important is
establishing<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.290> timeline<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:34.580> know<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.730> like

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
establishing a timeline you know I like

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.840 
establishing a timeline you know I like
to<00:02:35.360> get<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.750> students<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.650> look<00:02:36.980> at<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.310> time

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
to get the students to look at the time

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.920 
to get the students to look at the time
ahead<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:39.620> set<00:02:40.250> themselves<00:02:40.430> targets<00:02:41.209> and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
ahead and to set themselves targets and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.229 
ahead and to set themselves targets and
my<00:02:42.680> advice<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.310> always<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.940> set<00:02:44.530> achievable

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
my advice is always to set achievable

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.240 
my advice is always to set achievable
targets<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.500> think<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:49.299> also<00:02:50.299> like<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:51.250> make

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
targets and I think I also like to make

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.440 
targets and I think I also like to make
sure<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.519> they<00:02:52.850> are<00:02:53.110> aware<00:02:54.820> when<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:56.239> is

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
sure that they are aware when it is

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.560 
sure that they are aware when it is
there<00:02:56.690> needs<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.200> be<00:02:57.850> finishing<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.330> project

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
there needs to be finishing the project

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.820 
there needs to be finishing the project
prior<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.830> submission<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:02.360> so<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.380> battle<00:03:03.709> is

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
prior to submission and so the battle is

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.800 
prior to submission and so the battle is
established

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
established

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.350 
established
I<00:03:06.840> focus<00:03:07.840> on<00:03:07.989> them

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
I focus on them

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.010 
I focus on them
so<00:03:11.040> they<00:03:12.090> talk<00:03:13.090> about<00:03:13.300> I<00:03:13.390> get<00:03:13.599> them<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.870> talk

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
so they talk about I get them to talk

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.130 
so they talk about I get them to talk
about<00:03:14.230> themselves<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.670> work<00:03:15.910> when<00:03:16.840> they<00:03:16.989> work

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
about themselves and work when they work

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.070 
about themselves and work when they work
the<00:03:17.920> way<00:03:18.069> that<00:03:18.099> they<00:03:18.520> study<00:03:21.780> what's<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.900> their

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
the way that they study what's it their

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.940 
the way that they study what's it their
strengths<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.650> weaknesses<00:03:23.739> in<00:03:24.580> studying<00:03:25.950> to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
strengths and weaknesses in studying to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.570 
strengths and weaknesses in studying to
get<00:03:27.099> a<00:03:27.130> sense<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.670> who<00:03:27.849> who<00:03:28.540> they<00:03:28.780> are<00:03:29.580> so

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
get a sense of who who they are so

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.270 
get a sense of who who they are so
that's<00:03:30.880> my<00:03:31.060> main<00:03:31.300> focus<00:03:31.780> that's<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.800> nice<00:03:32.950> time

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
that's my main focus that's a nice time

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.089 
that's my main focus that's a nice time
and<00:03:34.000> then<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.480> talked<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.870> little<00:03:34.989> bit<00:03:35.260> about<00:03:35.470> the

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
and then I talked a little bit about the

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.070 
and then I talked a little bit about the
way<00:03:36.250> that<00:03:36.580> I<00:03:36.730> work<00:03:37.060> with<00:03:37.090> students<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:37.959> the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
way that I work with students and the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.110 
way that I work with students and the
possibilities<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:42.340> ways<00:03:42.489> in<00:03:42.610> which<00:03:42.850> we

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
possibilities and the ways in which we

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.789 
possibilities and the ways in which we
might<00:03:43.390> work<00:03:43.600> together<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.290> we<00:03:44.380> talk<00:03:46.799> most

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
might work together and we talk most

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.830 
might work together and we talk most
students<00:03:48.250> most<00:03:49.060> people<00:03:49.299> with<00:03:49.390> whom<00:03:49.569> I<00:03:49.660> work

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
students most people with whom I work

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.020 
students most people with whom I work
have<00:03:50.080> a<00:03:50.110> have<00:03:51.010> an<00:03:51.099> idea<00:03:51.430> of<00:03:51.489> what<00:03:51.670> they<00:03:51.760> want<00:03:51.910> to

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
have a have an idea of what they want to

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.030 
have a have an idea of what they want to
look<00:03:52.569> at<00:03:52.750> but<00:03:53.140> that's<00:03:53.590> what<00:03:53.799> they<00:03:53.890> were<00:03:53.950> asked

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
look at but that's what they were asked

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.460 
look at but that's what they were asked
to<00:03:54.160> do<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:55.060> it<00:03:55.180> will<00:03:55.269> invariably<00:03:56.110> without

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
to do and it will invariably without

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.770 
to do and it will invariably without
exception<00:03:57.040> be<00:03:57.250> too<00:03:57.400> big<00:03:57.640> so<00:03:58.209> one<00:03:58.360> sense<00:03:58.630> is

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
exception be too big so one sense is

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.500 
exception be too big so one sense is
about<00:03:59.340> trying<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.430> get<00:04:00.610> someone<00:04:00.940> focused<00:04:01.360> down

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
about trying to get someone focused down

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.650 
about trying to get someone focused down
and<00:04:02.260> that's<00:04:02.410> quite<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.709> subtle<00:04:03.510> process<00:04:04.510> I

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
and that's quite a subtle process I

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.130 
and that's quite a subtle process I
think<00:04:04.720> because<00:04:08.519> when<00:04:09.519> people<00:04:10.299> come<00:04:10.570> to<00:04:11.049> you

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
think because when people come to you

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.610 
think because when people come to you
with<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.350> large<00:04:12.359> idea<00:04:13.359> or<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.570> large<00:04:13.930> question<00:04:14.380> or

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
with a large idea or a large question or

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.199 
with a large idea or a large question or
large<00:04:14.890> issue<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:16.590> suppose<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.950> see<00:04:18.669> my<00:04:18.880> role<00:04:19.150> as

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
large issue I suppose I see my role as

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.650 
large issue I suppose I see my role as
trying<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:20.100> help<00:04:21.100> them<00:04:21.459> reveal<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.210> themselves

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
trying to help them reveal to themselves

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.100 
trying to help them reveal to themselves
what<00:04:23.470> they<00:04:23.650> really<00:04:24.340> care<00:04:24.370> about<00:04:24.930> what<00:04:25.930> they're

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
what they really care about what they're

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.880 
what they really care about what they're
really<00:04:26.710> interested<00:04:27.130> in<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.520> think<00:04:28.000> usually<00:04:28.890> as

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
really interested in I think usually as

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.760 
really interested in I think usually as
I've<00:04:30.430> implied<00:04:30.729> they<00:04:30.940> don't<00:04:31.120> really<00:04:31.360> know<00:04:31.660> that

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
I've implied they don't really know that

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.250 
I've implied they don't really know that
themselves<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.250> it's<00:04:33.340> trying<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.960> get<00:04:34.960> there

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
themselves so it's trying to get there

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.140 
themselves so it's trying to get there
without<00:04:35.500> leading<00:04:35.919> because<00:04:36.310> if<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.610> lead<00:04:36.820> you

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
without leading because if you lead you

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.330 
without leading because if you lead you
will<00:04:37.570> inevitably<00:04:37.810> almost<00:04:38.590> never<00:04:38.860> lead<00:04:39.160> in<00:04:39.250> the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
will inevitably almost never lead in the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.370 
will inevitably almost never lead in the
wrong<00:04:39.460> direction

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
wrong direction

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.650 
wrong direction
so<00:04:41.380> that's<00:04:41.590> sort<00:04:41.710> of<00:04:41.800> haunting

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.670 

and<00:04:44.780> knowing<00:04:45.500> when<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.680> keep<00:04:45.950> quiet<00:04:47.500> but<00:04:48.500> when

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
and knowing when to keep quiet but when

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.360 
and knowing when to keep quiet but when
to<00:04:48.830> say<00:04:48.980> something<00:04:49.430> that's<00:04:50.390> the<00:04:50.690> end<00:04:51.370> yes

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
to say something that's the end yes

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.010 
to say something that's the end yes
that's<00:04:52.670> why<00:04:52.790> that's<00:04:52.910> what<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.150> do<00:04:53.300> first<00:04:53.480> try

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
that's why that's what I do first try

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.430 
that's why that's what I do first try
and<00:04:54.110> get<00:04:54.200> a<00:04:54.230> focus<00:04:54.710> and<00:04:55.390> try<00:04:56.390> and<00:04:58.630> find<00:04:59.630> ways<00:04:59.930> of

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
and get a focus and try and find ways of

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.620 
and get a focus and try and find ways of
finding<00:05:00.710> out<00:05:00.950> what<00:05:01.580> they've<00:05:01.820> really<00:05:02.270> always

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
finding out what they've really always

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.570 
finding out what they've really always
what<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.650> problem<00:05:04.100> is<00:05:04.220> what<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.460> itches<00:05:05.500> yeah

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
what the problem is what the itches yeah

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.600 
what the problem is what the itches yeah
getting<00:05:07.580> to<00:05:07.760> know<00:05:07.910> a<00:05:07.940> bit<00:05:08.150> about<00:05:08.180> them<00:05:09.610> getting

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610
