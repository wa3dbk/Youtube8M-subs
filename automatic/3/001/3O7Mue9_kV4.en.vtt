00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.410
 now become an annual event 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.660
 the announcement of the new call of duty is 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.550
 was celebrated this year not only with 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.590
 the controversial microsoft conference of 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.710
 a few weeks ago but with a real e 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.870
 own event for 3 2 give a first with 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.640
 a look that is a chapter for the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.620
 first time there were presented 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.690
 gameplay phases showing if not them e 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.510
 peppino change of course at least one 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.610
 breath of fresh air the companion still 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.170
 once it seems all taken pure 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.690
 benefit from the script of 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.630
 steven gun already author of traffic e 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.800
 Syrian his touch up to already 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.320
 in the most human aspect of the characters 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.180
 which then all interact more 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.700
 realistic with what surrounds them 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.770
 although perhaps the contribution 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.660
 most visible dam in the game e 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.970
 represents their snow figure the 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.770
 step of the skull fears mayor while a 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.410
 purpose side on the internet in social media 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.910
 network all over the world that of lire 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.310
 it will indeed be a very important figure 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.500
 in gameplay by introducing mechanics 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.539
 sine rehn explored in the series on 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.649
 our canine companion will not only be in 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.360
 unable to carry wrong 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.700
 equipment will take part 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.590
 in short, the sorties could be active 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.479
 directly control the departing 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.409
 specific orders or sending is not a 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.990
 discovery of spying on the mill 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.369
 now camera placed over his head 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.520
 but these are just some of the tasks 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.200
 which detects to play the dog will be 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.359
 in fact the intriguing protagonist if it is 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.340
 the style in which we will have to check for 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.649
 bite to land some sentinels 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.299
 not to mention the possibility of 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.880
 use him to flush out the gods 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.740
 hidden enemies finishing them when you learn 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.899
 they will leave you their comfortable covers 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.880
 the adventure therefore although more than here 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.519
 date to respond to tactical repercussions 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.869
 which although explored could 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.370
 embellish not just the playability 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.599
 of the series 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.370
 to accompany these elections a 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.530
 however, there will be many legs 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.849
 if not all the dynamics that the series a 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.709
 always our player 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.480
 the interesting phase will return 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.099
 underwater in a revised version e 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.260
 correct with lots of shooters 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.790
 submarines and will also return 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.860
 daring escapes the last explosion 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.599
 as well as the spectacular videos of the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.819
 predecessors 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.260
 the title seems to admire no to not 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.200
 create that on the point of breaking with the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.450
 past was instead at least feel like joe 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.310
 cole michael suitable and if we can not 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.629
 let us express ourselves on the gameplay of which 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.400
 we have seen on the four pieces 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.650
 they can still rule on 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.010
 technical department a graphic engine of the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.810
 game 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.579
 not only does it seem clearly superior to 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.750
 that of the last chapters but it is 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.459
 proved even a little more 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.080
 sparkling compared to sound videos 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.630
 disclosed 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.700
 the settings then appear 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.260
 slightly more realistic for source of 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.360
 dynamic lighting either 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.980
 clearly superior type free the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.750
 seabed shown in one of the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.780
 pieces for example looked like 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.790
 particularly inspired by the choir 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.260
 makes a marina of various types and reflections 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.250
 of people making up 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.020
 on the water 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.569
 the final result seemed to us more than 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.670
 satisfactory a significant step forward 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.560
 for the series so even if we are not 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.730
 certainly at the levels of the pc version of 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.440
 crysis 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.780
 especially for some small ones 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.300
 texture out of place that and for yield 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.370
 faces of the protagonists e 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.830
 indeed of the main characters are 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.630
 always scattered I see the past but still 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.670
 too little detailed 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.470
 especially if we consider the already 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.910
 known technologies to make procurement 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.030
 that we or if the console generation 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.250
 pc will also direct very nice ones 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.440
 music that thanks to new sounds 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.150
 they want to give depth to one 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.830
 story that at least they say the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.500
 developers should be the point 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.000
 hate of this is new 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.220
 activision seems to have understood 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.690
 that sales are not everything and that for 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.700
 continue to surf on the wave of 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.620
 success the series needs 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.100
 evolve and start telling new ones 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.470
 stories 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.360
 goss aspires to propose 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.280
 a more adult experience experienced by 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.110
 realistic human characters 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.000
 or at least that's what Milan does 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.769
 to the developers to know if there 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.970
 will succeed less we will still have to 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.970
 wait a few more months
