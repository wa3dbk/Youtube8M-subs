00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:11.180
 3 here commenting and I'm going to teach you 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.650
 how to download slender vale 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.920
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.590
 is to go to the link the description is a 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.230
 link mediafire vale 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.050
 well when we are here what 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.050
 we will do will be give you to download 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:34.650
 download good and the download will start 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.160
 we keep it on desktop 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.810
 it's 55 megabytes is very little 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.360
 and us file enter like this 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.740
 what we 're going to do now will be 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.740
 give it to extract here 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.570
 and this folder will come out 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.910
 this folder is very important because it is 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.270
 where is the game then what can you 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.060
 to do is give this icon the collective 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.030
 with slender we give to 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.980
 sometimes direct and direct access 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.970
 we drag to 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.120
 to the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.730
 writer and ready because this is already what 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.630
 I feel 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:23.630
 that we have more we are lucky that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 says controls and credits 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.790
 until the data does not have to be touched 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.690
 no way 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.640
 as you see, it should not be installed 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.640
 and nothing is just explaining there 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.740
 take the screen resolution 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.020
 the quality of the graphics this we give 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.509
 to play and ready 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.880
 because with the program that I am 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.360
 recording does not do not see the law 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.210
