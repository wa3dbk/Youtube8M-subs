forevers lip liner Perfector in that
clear<00:05:50.460> color<00:05:50.910> doesn't<00:05:51.900> give<00:05:52.050> it<00:05:52.169> color<00:05:52.800> name

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
clear color doesn't give it color name

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.360 
clear color doesn't give it color name
it's<00:05:53.310> called<00:05:54.470> crayon<00:05:55.470> transparent

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
it's called crayon transparent

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.330 
it's called crayon transparent
colourless<00:05:56.970> anti<00:05:57.660> feathering<00:05:58.199> lip<00:05:58.650> pencil<00:05:59.130> so

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
colourless anti feathering lip pencil so

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.040 
colourless anti feathering lip pencil so
I<00:05:59.370> guess<00:05:59.580> that's<00:05:59.699> called<00:05:59.970> feathering<00:06:00.660> when<00:06:00.960> it

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
I guess that's called feathering when it

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.350 
I guess that's called feathering when it
bleeds<00:06:01.320> into<00:06:01.770> your<00:06:01.889> wrinkles<00:06:02.880> a<00:06:03.000> little<00:06:03.210> bit

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
bleeds into your wrinkles a little bit

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.100 
bleeds into your wrinkles a little bit
so<00:06:03.539> I<00:06:03.570> use<00:06:03.870> that<00:06:04.139> when<00:06:04.320> I<00:06:04.349> use<00:06:04.620> a<00:06:04.650> really<00:06:05.099> dark

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
so I use that when I use a really dark

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.140 
so I use that when I use a really dark
red<00:06:07.110> or<00:06:07.440> a<00:06:07.500> dark<00:06:07.860> pink<00:06:08.160> because<00:06:08.580> I<00:06:08.669> don't<00:06:08.910> want

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150
