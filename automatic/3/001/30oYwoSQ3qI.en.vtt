batter we have two eggs a little bit of

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.620 
batter we have two eggs a little bit of
milk<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.759> some<00:01:17.909> melted<00:01:18.299> butter<00:01:18.330> in

milk and we have some melted butter in
this<00:01:18.780> recipe<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:20.030> little<00:01:21.030> bit<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.210> salt<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:22.820> get

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this recipe a little bit of salt to get

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.969 
this recipe a little bit of salt to get
those<00:01:23.970> eggs<00:01:24.210> beaten<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:28.680> we're<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
those eggs beaten and now we're going to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.649 
those eggs beaten and now we're going to
add<00:01:29.040> our<00:01:29.130> flour<00:01:31.549> add<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.880> slowly<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.630> you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
add our flour add it in slowly so you

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.749 
add our flour add it in slowly so you
hopefully<00:01:34.079> eliminate<00:01:34.350> any<00:01:34.799> lumps<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.460> may

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
hopefully eliminate any lumps that may

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.859 
hopefully eliminate any lumps that may
occur<00:01:39.140> okay<00:01:40.729> that's<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.820> basic<00:01:42.000> crepe<00:01:42.329> batter<00:01:42.540> I

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
occur okay that's a basic crepe batter I

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.920 
occur okay that's a basic crepe batter I
think<00:01:43.770> I'd<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.950> easier<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.640> pour<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.659> out<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
think I'd be easier to pour it out of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.450 
think I'd be easier to pour it out of
something<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> spout<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.009> i<00:01:47.100> actually

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
something with a spout so i actually

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.520 
something with a spout so i actually
just<00:01:47.490> made<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> batch<00:01:48.030> ahead<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.479> time<00:01:48.659> which<00:01:49.500> is

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
just made a batch ahead of time which is

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.760 
just made a batch ahead of time which is
right<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:49.939> we<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> crepe<00:01:51.509> pan<00:01:51.899> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that's you know that might sound a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.389

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.130 
easy to flip i'm going to give it a
little<00:02:00.270> bit<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.540> better<00:02:02.540> just<00:02:03.540> kind<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.780> swirl

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
little bit of better just kind of swirl

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.080 
little bit of better just kind of swirl
that<00:02:04.170> around<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.740> there<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.520> also<00:02:05.640> gauge

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
that around in there you can also gauge

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.059 
that around in there you can also gauge
how<00:02:06.329> hot<00:02:06.570> your<00:02:06.780> pan<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:07.710> that

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
how hot your pan is as you do that

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.489 
how hot your pan is as you do that
that<00:02:09.340> should<00:02:09.519> be<00:02:09.609> good<00:02:09.729> enough<00:02:10.230> this<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.349> the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:11.499 
that should be good enough this is the

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:19.190 
that should be good enough this is the
fun<00:02:11.680> part

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.930 

make<00:02:20.200> sure<00:02:20.230> it's<00:02:20.770> nice<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.040> thin<00:02:21.490> so<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.760> don't

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
make sure it's nice and thin so I don't

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.290 
make sure it's nice and thin so I don't
overcrowd<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:23.550> I'm<00:02:24.550> just<00:02:24.700> going<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:24.940> give<00:02:25.150> it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
overcrowd it I'm just going to give it

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.240 
overcrowd it I'm just going to give it
all<00:02:27.870> around<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.110> pan<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.650> have<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.800> perfect

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
all around the pan so you have a perfect

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.100 
all around the pan so you have a perfect
circle<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:33.340> should<00:02:33.520> be<00:02:33.550> cooked<00:02:33.820> in<00:02:34.150> about<00:02:34.660> you

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
circle it should be cooked in about you

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.770 
circle it should be cooked in about you
know<00:02:35.140> three<00:02:35.590> or<00:02:35.740> four<00:02:36.250> more<00:02:36.430> seconds<00:02:36.880> it's<00:02:37.660> a

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
know three or four more seconds it's a

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.440 
know three or four more seconds it's a
really<00:02:38.020> quick<00:02:38.260> thing<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.650> make<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:39.210> am<00:02:40.210> going<00:02:40.390> to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
really quick thing to make I am going to

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.010 
really quick thing to make I am going to
flip<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.840> once<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.210> other<00:02:43.360> side<00:02:43.600> gets<00:02:43.840> nice

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
flip it once so the other side gets nice

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.560 
flip it once so the other side gets nice
and<00:02:44.050> golden<00:02:44.680> brown<00:02:45.300> here<00:02:46.300> we<00:02:46.420> go<00:02:48.000> okay<00:02:49.000> not<00:02:49.390> too

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
and golden brown here we go okay not too

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.770 
and golden brown here we go okay not too
bad<00:02:53.130> okay<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:54.490> while<00:02:54.760> it's<00:02:55.150> cooking<00:02:55.360> on<00:02:55.690> the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
already I think I just want to spread a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.910 
already I think I just want to spread a
good<00:03:04.090> layer<00:03:05.700> all<00:03:06.700> around<00:03:07.470> kind<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.560> spread<00:03:08.830> it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
good layer all around kind of spread it

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.160 
good layer all around kind of spread it
around<00:03:09.040> like<00:03:09.280> pizza<00:03:09.910> pie<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.750> are<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:13.960> little

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
around like pizza pie you are a little

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.110 
around like pizza pie you are a little
drizzle<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:15.400> lot<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.030> chocolate<00:03:16.710> okay<00:03:18.120> it

drizzle a lot of chocolate okay it
really<00:03:19.390> only<00:03:19.540> takes<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.990> few<00:03:20.020> more<00:03:20.350> moments<00:03:20.530> to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
really only takes a few more moments to

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.880 
really only takes a few more moments to
cook<00:03:21.160> on<00:03:21.370> each<00:03:21.880> side<00:03:22.240> I<00:03:25.440> think<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.530> key<00:03:26.739> of

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
cook on each side I think the key of

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.490 
cook on each side I think the key of
making<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.760> really<00:03:28.000> great<00:03:28.209> pancake<00:03:28.750> or<00:03:29.020> creep

making a really great pancake or creep

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.170 
making a really great pancake or creep
in<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.130> case<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.580> to<00:03:30.700> keep<00:03:30.850> it<00:03:31.000> nice<00:03:31.120> and

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
in this case is to keep it nice and

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.900 
in this case is to keep it nice and
fluffy<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.840> soft<00:03:32.020> on<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:33.180> inside<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:36.310> that's
