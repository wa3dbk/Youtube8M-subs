00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
image burns because it the files are

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.789 
image burns because it the files are
bigger<00:02:45.120> now<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.810> can't<00:02:46.109> really<00:02:46.169> do<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.530> and

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
bigger now so you can't really do it and

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.170 
bigger now so you can't really do it and
I'm<00:02:46.889> probably<00:02:47.040> talking<00:02:47.430> really<00:02:47.700> loud<00:02:47.970> because

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
I'm probably talking really loud because

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.210 
I'm probably talking really loud because
the<00:02:48.299> camera<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.750> like<00:02:48.900> right<00:02:49.109> in<00:02:49.139> my<00:02:49.290> face<00:02:50.569> true

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
the camera is like right in my face true

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.360 
the camera is like right in my face true
all<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.519> is<00:02:53.579> starting<00:02:54.209> up<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:55.069> recommend<00:02:56.069> to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
all this is starting up I recommend to

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.909 
all this is starting up I recommend to
use<00:02:56.519> verbatim<00:02:57.359> discs<00:02:58.019> because<00:02:58.319> they're<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
use verbatim discs because they're the

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.309 
use verbatim discs because they're the
best<00:02:59.189> and<00:02:59.519> you're<00:03:00.090> paying<00:03:00.329> about<00:03:00.659> a<00:03:00.719> dollar<00:03:01.169> a

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
best and you're paying about a dollar a

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.449 
best and you're paying about a dollar a
disc<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.120> you're<00:03:03.120> saving<00:03:03.389> you<00:03:03.900> know<00:03:04.159> $64<00:03:05.159> and

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
disc and you're saving you know $64 and

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.330 
disc and you're saving you know $64 and
gas<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.719> gamestop<00:03:07.590> which<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:07.889> hope<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.189> don't

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
gas to gamestop which I hope you don't

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.929 
gas to gamestop which I hope you don't
go<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.599> so<00:03:09.889> once<00:03:10.889> this<00:03:11.099> starts<00:03:11.219> up<00:03:11.579> you<00:03:11.760> go<00:03:11.879> to

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
go to so once this starts up you go to

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.129 
go to so once this starts up you go to
write<00:03:12.269> image<00:03:12.599> file<00:03:13.379> to<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.709> disc<00:03:14.870> then<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:15.989> go

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
write image file to the disc then you go

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:24.020 
write image file to the disc then you go
browse<00:03:16.439> for<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.739> file<00:03:19.069> and<00:03:21.019> you<00:03:22.019> do<00:03:22.409> not<00:03:22.849> do<00:03:23.849> not

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
browse for a file and you do not do not

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.689 
browse for a file and you do not do not
choose<00:03:24.449> the<00:03:24.930> big<00:03:25.109> file<00:03:25.379> you<00:03:25.949> choose<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> small

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
choose the big file you choose a small

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:33.229 
choose the big file you choose a small
one<00:03:27.409> and<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:30.150> right<00:03:30.299> speed<00:03:30.720> change<00:03:31.199> it<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:32.250> 2.4

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
one and the right speed change it to 2.4

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.920 
one and the right speed change it to 2.4
x<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:34.400> take<00:03:35.400> off<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.849> test<00:03:36.120> mode<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.569> verify

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
x and take off the test mode and verify

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.699 
x and take off the test mode and verify
because<00:03:38.479> you<00:03:39.479> know<00:03:39.599> image<00:03:39.959> burn<00:03:40.229> really<00:03:40.470> does

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
because you know image burn really does

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.909 
because you know image burn really does
not<00:03:40.889> do<00:03:41.129> that<00:03:42.019> it's<00:03:43.019> just<00:03:43.259> wasting<00:03:43.620> your<00:03:43.739> time

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
not do that it's just wasting your time

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.819 
not do that it's just wasting your time
and<00:03:44.220> if<00:03:44.699> you<00:03:44.819> do<00:03:44.909> it<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.060> 2.4<00:03:45.569> x<00:03:45.689> you<00:03:46.379> will<00:03:46.560> make

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
and if you do it a 2.4 x you will make

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.289 
and if you do it a 2.4 x you will make
sure<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.069> you're<00:03:47.370> not<00:03:47.400> burning<00:03:47.639> too<00:03:48.000> slow<00:03:48.269> or

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
sure that you're not burning too slow or

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.809 
sure that you're not burning too slow or
too<00:03:48.479> fast<00:03:48.709> it's<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.829> perfect<00:03:50.040> speed<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.669> takes

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
too fast it's the perfect speed it takes

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.149 
too fast it's the perfect speed it takes
about<00:03:51.030> 45<00:03:51.629> minutes<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.229> run<00:03:52.379> eight<00:03:52.620> gigs<00:03:52.919> so

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
about 45 minutes to run eight gigs so

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.999 
about 45 minutes to run eight gigs so
i'm<00:03:53.340> pretty<00:03:53.459> sure<00:03:53.669> you<00:03:53.879> can<00:03:54.060> wait<00:03:54.209> 45<00:03:54.720> minutes
