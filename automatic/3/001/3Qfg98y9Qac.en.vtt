00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.520 
then once you finally get all those all
done<00:02:22.980> there's<00:02:25.070> six<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.220> here<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:28.050> plate<00:02:28.320> will

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
done there's six in here this plate will

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.620 
done there's six in here this plate will
actually<00:02:29.070> pull<00:02:29.760> back<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:30.660> enough<00:02:32.300> or<00:02:33.300> this

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
actually pull back just enough or this

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.590 
actually pull back just enough or this
spline<00:02:34.470> will<00:02:34.800> pop<00:02:34.980> loose<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.640> then<00:02:36.210> you'll<00:02:36.420> be

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
spline will pop loose and then you'll be

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.330 
spline will pop loose and then you'll be
able<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.870> print<00:02:37.110> listen<00:02:37.500> Jack<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.160> whole

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
able to print listen Jack the whole

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.450 
able to print listen Jack the whole
clutch<00:02:38.760> system<00:02:39.060> out

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
clutch system out

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.120 
clutch system out
so<00:02:41.690> our<00:02:42.690> book<00:02:42.960> really<00:02:43.200> didn't<00:02:43.530> show<00:02:43.560> how<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.950> do

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
so our book really didn't show how to do

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.220 
so our book really didn't show how to do
this<00:02:44.280> one<00:02:44.580> book<00:02:45.210> we<00:02:45.390> had<00:02:45.570> didn't<00:02:45.930> even<00:02:46.050> tell

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
this one book we had didn't even tell

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.140 
this one book we had didn't even tell
you<00:02:46.350> how<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.530> do<00:02:46.710> this<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.100> take<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.460> part<00:02:47.760> out

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
you how to do this to take this part out

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.230 
you how to do this to take this part out
it<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:48.840> said<00:02:48.990> take<00:02:49.170> these<00:02:49.640> pulse<00:02:50.640> off<00:02:50.880> here

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
it just said take these pulse off here

00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:00.200 
it just said take these pulse off here
so<00:02:53.990> and<00:02:54.990> this<00:02:55.710> clucks<00:02:56.250> came<00:02:56.580> out<00:02:58.940> these<00:02:59.940> we

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
so and this clucks came out these we

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.910 
so and this clucks came out these we
made<00:03:01.070> they're<00:03:02.070> really<00:03:02.370> simple<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.650> just

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
made they're really simple so just

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.400 
made they're really simple so just
spring<00:03:05.730> apart<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.570> smash<00:03:06.810> stuff<00:03:07.020> as<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.260> pull

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
spring apart and smash stuff as you pull

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.150 
spring apart and smash stuff as you pull
the<00:03:07.440> clutch<00:03:07.740> out

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
the clutch out

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.550 
the clutch out
ours<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:09.940> completely<00:03:10.480> busted<00:03:10.840> in<00:03:11.170> here<00:03:11.380> and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
ours is completely busted in here and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.630 
ours is completely busted in here and
sees<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.460> can<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:13.620> spring<00:03:14.620> lever<00:03:14.860> and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
sees that you can the spring lever and

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.540 
sees that you can the spring lever and
the<00:03:16.480> pressure<00:03:16.810> plate<00:03:17.170> moves<00:03:17.470> but<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.190> rest<00:03:18.370> of

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
the pressure plate moves but the rest of

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.520 
the pressure plate moves but the rest of
clutch<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.030> frozen<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.750> stays<00:03:19.990> engage<00:03:20.380> it

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
clutch is so frozen it stays engage it

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.740 
clutch is so frozen it stays engage it
won't<00:03:20.680> disengage

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.050 

so<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.410> is<00:03:25.590> what<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.920> look<00:03:26.100> like<00:03:26.130> as<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.820> comes

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
so this is what it look like as it comes

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:36.020 
so this is what it look like as it comes
out<00:03:28.460> tilt<00:03:29.460> this<00:03:29.580> up<00:03:30.770> quite<00:03:31.770> heavy

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.750 

that's<00:03:36.480> what<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.720> looks<00:03:36.900> like

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.229 

so<00:03:41.330> this<00:03:41.569> top<00:03:41.840> plate<00:03:42.019> here<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:43.010> unbolt<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.610> it

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
so this top plate here you unbolt it it

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.460 
so this top plate here you unbolt it it
slides<00:03:44.599> down<00:03:44.810> an<00:03:45.170> inch<00:03:45.549> you<00:03:46.549> expose<00:03:47.470> this

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
slides down an inch you expose this

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.059 
slides down an inch you expose this
which<00:03:49.220> is<00:03:49.400> wired<00:03:49.700> netted<00:03:50.180> in<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:51.620> do<00:03:51.769> it<00:03:51.890> and

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
which is wired netted in and do it and

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.979 
which is wired netted in and do it and
it<00:03:52.280> pops<00:03:52.400> out<00:03:52.640> just<00:03:52.700> enough<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.540> clear<00:03:53.840> the

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
it pops out just enough to clear the

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.710 
it pops out just enough to clear the
casing<00:03:54.409> on<00:03:54.530> both<00:03:54.680> sides<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:56.239> do<00:03:56.569> of<00:03:56.690> course

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
casing on both sides and do of course

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.030 
casing on both sides and do of course
all<00:03:57.110> these<00:03:57.260> bolts<00:03:57.590> hole<00:03:58.580> you<00:03:58.730> jacks<00:03:59.299> out<00:04:00.040> make

all these bolts hole you jacks out make

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.610 
all these bolts hole you jacks out make

show you where it's got to line up you
got<00:04:23.300> make<00:04:23.389> sure<00:04:23.449> this<00:04:23.660> grease<00:04:23.870> bearing<00:04:24.229> is<00:04:24.410> to

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
got make sure this grease bearing is to

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.260 
got make sure this grease bearing is to
the<00:04:24.860> notch<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.400> shaft<00:04:25.669> on<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.030> tractor

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
the notch and the shaft on the tractor

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.469 
the notch and the shaft on the tractor
I'll<00:04:26.660> show<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:26.960> that<00:04:27.169> now<00:04:29.620> see<00:04:31.240> right<00:04:32.240> there's

I'll show you that now see right there's
a<00:04:32.590> little<00:04:33.590> notch<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.910> got<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.120> make<00:04:35.270> sure

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
a little notch you got to make sure

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.210 
a little notch you got to make sure
that's<00:04:35.600> why<00:04:35.780> ends<00:04:35.930> up<00:04:36.080> when<00:04:36.229> you<00:04:36.320> bolt<00:04:36.530> these

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
that's why ends up when you bolt these

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.870 
that's why ends up when you bolt these
bolts<00:04:37.639> in<00:04:38.139> if<00:04:39.139> that<00:04:39.350> notch<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:40.460> that<00:04:40.520> grease

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
bolts in if that notch and that grease

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.909 
bolts in if that notch and that grease
tube<00:04:41.180> goes<00:04:41.900> down<00:04:42.169> lines<00:04:42.500> up<00:04:42.680> at<00:04:42.770> that

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
tube goes down lines up at that

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.469 
tube goes down lines up at that
otherwise<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.460> will<00:04:43.520> hit<00:04:43.669> on<00:04:43.789> the<00:04:43.880> wall<00:04:44.060> here

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
otherwise it will hit on the wall here

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.900 
otherwise it will hit on the wall here
and<00:04:44.840> your<00:04:45.349> grease<00:04:45.560> will<00:04:45.710> go<00:04:45.860> into<00:04:46.099> here<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:46.760> be

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
and your grease will go into here and be

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.500 
and your grease will go into here and be
forced<00:04:47.150> into<00:04:47.360> your<00:04:47.630> bearing<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:49.430> that's<00:04:50.360> how

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
forced into your bearing so that's how
