00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.230
 ten 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.149
 sure many paid attention to 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.009
 genes at unprofitable to work external 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.039
 power supplies 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.599
 I think this is not even a question 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.119
 what is this raid why is he a poet 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.590
 and the owners are for sure he 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.429
 says a lot 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.699
 what to do with it and how to return the building 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.609
 originally attractive 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.619
 let's find the answers to these questions together 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.620
 and help us as always materials 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.070
 trademarks Kamaz fire fighting 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.490
 implies the decision of three to create 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.650
 first generation pollution 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.589
 the second 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.479
 narrowing the pores of the base due to processing 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.120
 special composition 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.970
 critics application 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.850
 on the surface of water repellent

 film 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.040
 to solve these problems brand 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.010
 smile 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.929
 sometimes specially designed 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:57.960
 of the material 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.120
 each stage is very important 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.880
 we have a difficult job to do but it requires 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.930
 clear instructions 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.650
 failure to apply materials 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.410
 first offender 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.200
 removal of types of pollution 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.550
 mechanically using tough 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.950
 spar years counters 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.520
 day became independent 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.860
 to remove calls more durable 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.200
 holding onto the surface of the phone 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.090
 since all contacts with music 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.000
 trademarks relish it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270
 concentrated solution in this form 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.540
 it should be applied when strong 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.560
 pollution 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.000
 if it became weak 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.280
 and the old men have not yet gone sports 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.050
 recommend 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.090
 he develops taking equal parts 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.950
 preparation wash and so on 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.710
 the remover we use will not allow 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.730
 only dissolve the salt but also give 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.230
 bactericidal base 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.070
 properties 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.050
 so we will spend more 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.010
 surface prevention from 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.430
 fungus infections and criticism 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.610
 itar tass the rest a large number 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.780
 death primer like aut 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.210
 and using wide brushes and malta 1 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.870
 april company 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.350
 in this state leave our landing 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.119
 for 10 15 minutes 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.869
 during this time, the substances contained in the day 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.919
 Primate available in life 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.409
 after the specified time 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.589
 we wash the surface well 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:18.989
 amount of water 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.139
 for this purpose but since it is with 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.729
 special board very kasparov 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.519
 perfect kishlak 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.469
 connected water pipes or 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.239
 just a bucket of water 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.700
 we want to note that the primer remover itself 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.870
 trademarks smile as opposed to 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.480
 similar materials other 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.549
 manufacturers 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.159
 and company products 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.680
 did not explain and will not cause the frigate 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.080
 plants and spoilage 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.510
 the effect so working out depends on the degree 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.479
 surface contamination 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.109
 if you went to start and deep entrenched 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.379
 dispute procedure should be repeated 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.869
 only after the surface is good 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.909
 the height did not proceed to the next stage 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.119
 it is treatment by means 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:00.619
 blocking come wide 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.409
 context of the place of trade materials 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.819
 brand since May there is a primer for this 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:05.619
 goals 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.059
 special components incoming 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:09.759
 the recipes of this product are deep 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:12.420
 penetrates the base and tightens pores 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.920
 creating a barrier to moisture penetration 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.260
 from the atmosphere 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.989
 emigration of salt solutions for example 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.260
 what are the first stage cathifus frame 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.790
 primer like goods and uses 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.659
 same bill of copy roller sediment materials 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.889
 dry surface applied by us 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.099
 primer not only blocks descendants 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.200
 from to the surface but is deep 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.429
 penetrating 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:36.729
 well strengthens incoming from gray 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.009
 ex senator 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.989
 thanks to these properties 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.109
 It is also recommended to use force for 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.829
 surface preparation before 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.699
 painting water-dispersion paints 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.729
 to extend the life painted 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:48.949
 surface 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:50.499
 before proceeding to 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.090
 final stage 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.609
 one reason to dry well 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.159
 at the final stage we will use aquila 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.969
 silicone trade preparations 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:00.819
 su brands due to special 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.829
 silicone additives on the surface 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.419
 base forms abad repulsive 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.129
 film 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.579
 which prevents me from getting wet 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.349
 venerable not learn this primer 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.230
 also designed to protect against 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.840
 wetting and therefore the destruction of the basement 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.370
 buildings cadillac natural stone 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.419
 monument noted from artificial 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.549
 stone chips 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.309
 while there is only in the economy but still 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:25.990
 processed escape 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.849
 having the so-called film and bread flour 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:29.879
 until 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.249
 primer produced in 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:32.569
 concentrated 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.379
 for our case when me by water in 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.259
 one to one ratio 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.830
 to visually make sure 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.770
 reality of declared properties 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.680
 gave pushing primer 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.520
 let's do an easy experiment conditionally 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.630
 Parents brickwork in three parts 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.580
 one area treated with primer 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.990
 and the other is not 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.960
 after complete drying 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.460
 try to start the surface 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.460
 imitate rain 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:08.839
 as you can see the plot is unprocessed 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.860
 continues to delight the year 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.069
 while the last time madam 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.319
 just earlier on 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.650
 many children who according to our work 2 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:23.990
 so work is done 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.880
 we had some loans 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.130
 process basics and do simple 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.169
 experiment 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.319
 all this has increased the return on 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.969
 problems and therefore understanding to approach 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.029
 issues of its elimination 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.509
 It should be noted that this material they 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.569
 will be able to solve problems associated with 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.419
 errors made in the process 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.219
 construction design 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.279
 we are at least 20 years old water but so on and on 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.179
 foundation and other miscalculations but if 

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:52.529
 this attitude is all right and the appearance 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.999
 calls related to namokannya 15 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:56.289
 years of other factors 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.289
 our materials will do an excellent job 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.029
 tasks assigned to them 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.359
 We wish you good mood 

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:03.939
 materials since may
