00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.710 

so<00:01:14.700> having<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.960> smaller<00:01:16.320> group<00:01:16.680> cannot<00:01:17.720> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
so having a smaller group cannot it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.679 
so having a smaller group cannot it
doesn't<00:01:19.049> eliminate<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.970> but<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.119> allows

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
doesn't eliminate it but it just allows

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.420 
doesn't eliminate it but it just allows
for<00:01:22.020> less<00:01:22.200> painful<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.009> doubt<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.400> a
