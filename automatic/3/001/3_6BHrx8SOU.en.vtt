even if I knew what it was it's pretty

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.650 
even if I knew what it was it's pretty
pretty<00:01:42.610> hard<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.300> fix<00:01:43.630> any<00:01:43.990> injury<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.360> very

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
short period of time if it is a

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.639 
short period of time if it is a
substantial<00:01:50.020> injury<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.320> that's<00:01:53.500> why<00:01:53.619> I

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
substantial injury and so that's why I

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.950
