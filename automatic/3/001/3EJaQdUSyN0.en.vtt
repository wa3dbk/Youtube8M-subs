I<00:00:18.949> discovered<00:00:19.949> liner<00:00:20.310> cut<00:00:20.580> printmaking<00:00:21.029> about

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
I discovered liner cut printmaking about

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.620 
I discovered liner cut printmaking about
ten<00:00:22.020> years<00:00:22.199> ago<00:00:22.350> now<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:24.350> found<00:00:25.350> some<00:00:25.650> tools<00:00:26.630> and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
ten years ago now I found some tools and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.410 
ten years ago now I found some tools and
I<00:00:27.930> decided<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.189> go<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.429> making<00:00:29.550> some

Christmas cards one year I'd never done
any<00:00:33.120> printmaking<00:00:33.570> before<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.520> although<00:00:35.520> I'd

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
any printmaking before that although I'd

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.729 
any printmaking before that although I'd
actually<00:00:36.000> studied<00:00:36.360> art<00:00:36.809> at<00:00:36.960> university<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:37.680> I

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
actually studied art at university but I

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.790 
actually studied art at university but I
never<00:00:37.920> done<00:00:38.250> any<00:00:38.460> printmaking<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.559> soon

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800

as<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.660> as<00:00:42.660> soon<00:00:42.840> as<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.050> started<00:00:43.500> using<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.370> line

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
as I as soon as I started using the line

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.940 
as I as soon as I started using the line
out<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.910> was<00:00:45.450> immediately<00:00:46.079> addicted<00:00:46.469> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
out I was immediately addicted I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.880 
out I was immediately addicted I
absolutely<00:00:47.250> loved<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.469> basically<00:00:49.469> for

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
absolutely loved it and basically for

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.260 
absolutely loved it and basically for
the<00:00:49.950> last<00:00:50.129> ten<00:00:50.399> years<00:00:50.430> that's<00:00:50.940> all<00:00:51.090> I've<00:00:51.239> been

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the last ten years that's all I've been

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.590 
the last ten years that's all I've been
doing<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.899> making<00:00:52.500> pictures

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.400 

I<00:00:58.610> like<00:00:59.610> liner<00:00:59.820> cut<00:01:00.090> because<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:01.110> a<00:01:01.200> very

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
I like liner cut because is it's a very

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.189 
I like liner cut because is it's a very
physical<00:01:01.890> medium<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.610> know<00:01:02.640> use<00:01:03.090> tools<00:01:03.450> I<00:01:03.930> use

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
physical medium you know use tools I use

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.480 
physical medium you know use tools I use
a<00:01:04.229> spoon<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.650> rubbing<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.820> pictures<00:01:07.490> it's

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
a spoon for rubbing the pictures it's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.010 
a spoon for rubbing the pictures it's
physically<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.210> know<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.420> know<00:01:09.720> when<00:01:09.900> you've

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
physically you know you know when you've

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.150 
physically you know you know when you've
been<00:01:10.140> printing<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.740> when<00:01:10.920> you've<00:01:11.010> been

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
been printing you when you've been

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.500 
been printing you when you've been
creating<00:01:11.550> things<00:01:11.640> because<00:01:11.940> your<00:01:12.060> arms<00:01:12.360> ache

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
creating things because your arms ache

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.240 
creating things because your arms ache
and<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.409> physicality<00:01:14.010> of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and I kind of like that physicality of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.510 
and I kind of like that physicality of
it<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.690> like<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.840> simplicity<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.650> well<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
it I like the simplicity as well the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.499 
it I like the simplicity as well the
fact<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.470> only<00:01:19.619> use<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.509> limited

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
fact that you can only use a limited

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.900 
fact that you can only use a limited
amount<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.840> colors<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.320> use<00:01:22.740> say<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:23.880> two

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
amount of colors I use say one or two

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.999 
amount of colors I use say one or two
colors<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:24.600> my<00:01:24.750> prints<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
colors with my prints so you have to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.249 
colors with my prints so you have to
think<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.479> things<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> work

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
think about how things are going to work

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.840 
think about how things are going to work
a<00:01:28.440> lot<00:01:28.680> before<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.070> actually<00:01:29.280> create<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
a lot before you actually create the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.999 
a lot before you actually create the
picture<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.479> can't<00:01:31.289> create<00:01:31.619> things<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
picture and you can't create things that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.889 
picture and you can't create things that
are<00:01:32.160> too<00:01:32.310> complex<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.940> have<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.509> fairly

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
are too complex you have to be fairly

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.499 
are too complex you have to be fairly
simple<00:01:34.410> with<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.520> images<00:01:35.880> because<00:01:36.300> liner

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
simple with your images because liner

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.080 
simple with your images because liner
cut<00:01:36.750> doesn't<00:01:37.020> lend<00:01:37.140> itself<00:01:37.440> very<00:01:37.560> well<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:38.090> sew

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
cut doesn't lend itself very well to sew

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.779 
cut doesn't lend itself very well to sew
really<00:01:39.330> really<00:01:39.690> detailed<00:01:39.869> images<00:01:40.560> before<00:01:41.550> I

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
really really detailed images before I

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.700 
really really detailed images before I
actually<00:01:42.000> start<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.780> liner<00:01:42.960> cut<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.530> think

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
actually start on the liner cut I think

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.680 
actually start on the liner cut I think
it's<00:01:43.860> great<00:01:44.160> for<00:01:44.640> me<00:01:44.789> it's<00:01:44.970> quite<00:01:45.119> important

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
it's great for me it's quite important

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.680 
it's great for me it's quite important
to<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:47.250> create<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.580> composition<00:01:47.970> first<00:01:48.479> that's

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
to to create a composition first that's

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.600 
to to create a composition first that's
going<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> work<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:50.190> doing<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> landscape

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
going to work if I was doing a landscape

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.020 
going to work if I was doing a landscape
say<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:52.250> Shefford<00:01:53.250> landscape

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
say a Shefford landscape

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.719 
say a Shefford landscape
I<00:01:54.060> would<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.229> would<00:01:55.950> take<00:01:56.250> some<00:01:56.280> photographs

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
I would I would take some photographs

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.460 
I would I would take some photographs
but<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> might<00:01:57.360> move<00:01:57.570> stuff<00:01:57.810> around<00:01:57.929> within<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
but I might move stuff around within the

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.169 
but I might move stuff around within the
photograph<00:01:58.740> before<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.429> actually<00:01:59.550> started<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
photograph before I actually started to

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.410 
photograph before I actually started to
make<00:02:00.390> sure<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> composition<00:02:01.530> worked<00:02:01.770> right

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
make sure the composition worked right

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.350 
make sure the composition worked right
and<00:02:03.420> then<00:02:04.380> once<00:02:04.710> I've<00:02:04.920> done<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.580> would

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
and then once I've done that I would

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:15.070 
and then once I've done that I would
then<00:02:06.540> transfer<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> image<00:02:07.350> onto<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> liner

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.630 

I<00:02:15.110> work<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.370> fairly<00:02:17.240> small<00:02:17.390> scale<00:02:18.490> most<00:02:19.490> of

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
I work on a fairly small scale most of

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.740 
I work on a fairly small scale most of
my<00:02:19.700> pictures<00:02:20.060> are<00:02:20.180> not<00:02:20.240> much<00:02:20.420> bigger<00:02:20.630> than

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
my pictures are not much bigger than

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.190 
my pictures are not much bigger than
sort<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.860> four<00:02:22.430> maybe<00:02:22.730> some<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.240> three<00:02:23.630> that's

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
sort of a four maybe some a three that's

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.920 
sort of a four maybe some a three that's
primarily<00:02:24.920> dictated<00:02:25.130> by<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.780> materials<00:02:26.780> that

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
primarily dictated by the materials that

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.920 
primarily dictated by the materials that
I<00:02:27.020> use<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.620> liner<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.160> use<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:29.390> is

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
I use and the liner that I use it is

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.780 
I use and the liner that I use it is
really<00:02:30.290> difficult<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.830> create<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.190> liner<00:02:31.430> cut

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
really difficult to create a liner cut

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.430 
really difficult to create a liner cut
there<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.030> really<00:02:32.330> massive<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.900> especially

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
there is really massive and especially

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.500 
there is really massive and especially
trying<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.920> rub<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.460> picture<00:02:34.760> with<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.240> back

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
trying to rub the picture with the back

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.180 
trying to rub the picture with the back
of<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.750> spoon<00:02:35.870> as<00:02:36.200> well<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.380> think<00:02:36.560> it'd<00:02:36.890> be<00:02:36.920> there

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
of a spoon as well I think it'd be there

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.350 
of a spoon as well I think it'd be there
for<00:02:37.310> weeks<00:02:37.490> if<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.210> did<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.450> giant<00:02:38.990> liner<00:02:39.140> cut

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
for weeks if you did a giant liner cut

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.900 
for weeks if you did a giant liner cut
but<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.390> quite<00:02:41.720> like<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.050> fat<00:02:42.200> again<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.910> I'm

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
but I quite like the fat again that I'm

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.910 
but I quite like the fat again that I'm
doing<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.630> size<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.410> scale<00:02:45.650> of<00:02:45.830> the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
doing that the size the scale of the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.890 
doing that the size the scale of the
image<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.280> dictated<00:02:46.820> for<00:02:47.060> me<00:02:47.240> so<00:02:47.420> then<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.780> have

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
image is dictated for me so then I have

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.330 
image is dictated for me so then I have
to<00:02:48.020> think<00:02:48.200> about<00:02:48.350> what<00:02:48.860> is<00:02:48.950> going<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.160> work

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
to think about what is going to work

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.290 
to think about what is going to work
within<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.700> scale<00:02:50.210> I<00:02:51.850> use<00:02:52.850> these<00:02:53.090> quite

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
within that scale I use these quite

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.650 
within that scale I use these quite
small<00:02:53.660> tools<00:02:54.550> which<00:02:55.550> are<00:02:55.850> specifically

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
small tools which are specifically

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.570 
small tools which are specifically
designed<00:02:56.960> for<00:02:57.290> line<00:02:57.680> up<00:02:57.830> cutting<00:02:58.070> they've

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
designed for line up cutting they've

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.580 
designed for line up cutting they've
like<00:02:58.940> very<00:02:59.150> small<00:02:59.420> chisels<00:02:59.870> basically<00:03:00.410> with<00:03:00.560> a

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
like very small chisels basically with a

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.820 
like very small chisels basically with a
sort<00:03:00.800> of<00:03:00.830> au<00:03:01.070> shape<00:03:01.310> or<00:03:01.520> v-shaped<00:03:02.000> end<00:03:02.240> I<00:03:02.830> use

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
sort of au shape or v-shaped end I use

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.970 
sort of au shape or v-shaped end I use
water-based<00:03:04.370> inks<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.560> obviously<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.650> use<00:03:06.830> the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
water-based inks and obviously I use the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.900 
water-based inks and obviously I use the
lino<00:03:07.340> lino<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.450> made<00:03:08.690> from<00:03:09.170> compressed<00:03:09.910> cork

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
lino lino is made from compressed cork

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.930 
lino lino is made from compressed cork
and<00:03:11.180> linseed<00:03:11.540> oil<00:03:12.040> with<00:03:13.040> like<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.370> hessian<00:03:13.730> on

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
and linseed oil with like a hessian on

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.450 
and linseed oil with like a hessian on
the<00:03:14.060> back<00:03:14.380> it's<00:03:15.380> basically<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.980> same<00:03:16.160> liner

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
the back it's basically the same liner

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.130 
the back it's basically the same liner
that's<00:03:16.700> been<00:03:16.970> used<00:03:17.210> since<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.720> start<00:03:17.990> of<00:03:18.050> the

20th century hasn't really changed at
all<00:03:20.560> well<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.590> process<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:23.140> creating<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.200> Lima

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
all well the process of creating a Lima

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.890 
all well the process of creating a Lima
print<00:03:24.709> is<00:03:24.830> fairly<00:03:25.070> simple<00:03:25.400> first<00:03:26.360> of<00:03:26.510> all<00:03:26.660> I

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
print is fairly simple first of all I

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.199 
print is fairly simple first of all I
would<00:03:27.410> transfer<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.280> image<00:03:28.520> onto<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.970> lino

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
would transfer the image onto the lino

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.150 
would transfer the image onto the lino
from<00:03:29.690> my<00:03:29.810> sketch<00:03:30.110> as<00:03:30.320> my<00:03:30.470> drawings<00:03:30.830> are<00:03:31.010> the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
from my sketch as my drawings are the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.570 
from my sketch as my drawings are the
using<00:03:31.400> tracing<00:03:31.790> paper<00:03:31.940> or<00:03:32.209> carbon<00:03:32.660> paper<00:03:33.580> then

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
using tracing paper or carbon paper then

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.820 
using tracing paper or carbon paper then
I<00:03:34.820> would<00:03:34.940> start<00:03:35.150> cutting<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:36.110> tools<00:03:36.470> and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
I would start cutting it with tools and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.520 
I would start cutting it with tools and
then<00:03:37.820> eventually<00:03:38.120> once<00:03:38.660> I'd<00:03:38.840> finished<00:03:39.050> the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
then eventually once I'd finished the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.699 
then eventually once I'd finished the
cutting<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.000> was<00:03:41.120> happy<00:03:41.390> with<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:41.690> then<00:03:42.350> I

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
cutting and I was happy with it then I

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.050 
cutting and I was happy with it then I
would<00:03:42.980> roll<00:03:43.190> some<00:03:43.400> ink<00:03:43.550> onto<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.910> liner<00:03:46.060> place

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
would roll some ink onto the liner place

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.990 
would roll some ink onto the liner place
some<00:03:47.300> paper<00:03:47.510> on<00:03:47.660> top<00:03:47.870> really<00:03:48.170> carefully<00:03:49.000> and

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
some paper on top really carefully and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.170 
some paper on top really carefully and
then<00:03:50.150> rub<00:03:50.480> with<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.050> back<00:03:51.290> of<00:03:51.560> my<00:03:51.709> spoon<00:03:52.180> to

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
then rub with the back of my spoon to

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.970 
then rub with the back of my spoon to
push<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.810> ink<00:03:53.959> onto<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.380> paper<00:03:54.500> from<00:03:54.890> the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
push the ink onto the paper from the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.699 
push the ink onto the paper from the
liner<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.550> then<00:03:56.209> eventually<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.290> would<00:03:57.410> peel

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
liner and then eventually I would peel

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.800 
liner and then eventually I would peel
it<00:03:57.830> off<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.130> hopefully<00:03:59.120> have<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.420> good<00:03:59.540> print

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
it off and hopefully have a good print

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.350 
it off and hopefully have a good print
at<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.020> end<00:04:00.140> of<00:04:00.230> that
