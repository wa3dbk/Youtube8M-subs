00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.150 
that we see on the Moto G and this is
fairly<00:01:55.510> decent<00:01:56.500> when<00:01:56.650> it<00:01:56.770> comes<00:01:56.980> to

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
fairly decent when it comes to

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.760 
fairly decent when it comes to
performance<00:01:57.610> on<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.090> windows<00:01:58.420> phones<00:01:58.770> there

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
performance on the windows phones there

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.190 
performance on the windows phones there
is<00:01:59.860> 512<00:02:00.550> MB<00:02:00.820> of<00:02:00.850> RAM<00:02:01.000> 8gb<00:02:01.330> internal<00:02:01.600> memory<00:02:02.170> and

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
there is a microSD slot under the hood

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.510 
there is a microSD slot under the hood
of<00:02:04.660> this<00:02:04.930> phone<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:05.680> you<00:02:05.740> can<00:02:05.950> expand<00:02:06.370> the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.310 
of this phone so you can expand the
memory<00:02:06.550> let<00:02:07.270> me<00:02:07.390> open<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.750> hood<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.050> show<00:02:08.259> you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
memory let me open the hood and show you

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.620 
memory let me open the hood and show you
what<00:02:08.619> lies<00:02:08.830> beneath<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:09.970> under<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.360> hood<00:02:10.509> you

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
what lies beneath so under the hood you

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.500 
what lies beneath so under the hood you
get<00:02:10.840> two<00:02:11.050> SIM<00:02:11.290> card<00:02:11.530> slots<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.580> sim<00:02:12.820> one<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.270> on

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
get two SIM card slots the sim one is on

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.540 
get two SIM card slots the sim one is on
the<00:02:13.660> inside<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.560> cannot<00:02:14.920> hotso<00:02:15.310> have<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
the inside so you cannot hotso have the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.790 
the inside so you cannot hotso have the
same<00:02:15.790> but<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.510> sim<00:02:16.720> 2<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.410> other<00:02:17.530> side

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
same but the sim 2 is on the other side

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.070 
same but the sim 2 is on the other side
there<00:02:18.490> is<00:02:18.520> also<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.880> micro<00:02:19.300> SD<00:02:19.570> card<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.930> can

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
there is also a micro SD card you can

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.230 
there is also a micro SD card you can
expand<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.530> memory<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.520> supports<00:02:22.030> micro

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
expand the memory and it supports micro
