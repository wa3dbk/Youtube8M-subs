00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.270 

but<00:03:43.850> as<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.120> said<00:03:44.180> not<00:03:44.390> much<00:03:44.690> has<00:03:44.900> changed<00:03:48.280> got

but as I said not much has changed got

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.800 
but as I said not much has changed got
your<00:03:49.430> standard<00:03:50.320> HDMI<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:52.670> think<00:03:53.360> they've<00:03:53.480> added

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
your standard HDMI I think they've added

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.980 
your standard HDMI I think they've added
the<00:03:54.700> USB<00:03:55.700> 3<00:03:56.800> to<00:03:57.800> USB<00:03:58.160> 3<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.790> normal<00:03:59.150> USB

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150
