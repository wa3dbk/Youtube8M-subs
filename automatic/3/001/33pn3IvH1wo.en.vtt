00:00:00.087 --> 00:00:04.087
I was the only one uninformed
about the cancellation.

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:07.797
Can't believe the punks left me out
like that. Do they think I'm a dummy?

00:00:07.797 --> 00:00:10.963
- So, you came back from the airport?
- Yeah.

00:00:10.963 --> 00:00:19.087
But, I guess Chairman Choi felt bad
and offered to set you up on a date.

00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:22.087
A date?
I'm not interested, father.

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:24.087
Why not?

00:00:24.087 --> 00:00:29.087
Is it because you're still not
over that woman? Is that the reason?

00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:32.630
No, no.
It's not like that.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.880
Apparently, this lady graduated
from oriental medical school this year.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.087
It would be nice to have
a doctor in the house.

00:00:39.087 --> 00:00:42.087
Hey, is someone here?

00:00:42.087 --> 00:00:45.338
Who? Who would be here?
No one's here.

00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:48.087
Then, why are there
two rice bowls?

00:00:48.087 --> 00:00:53.087
Well, one is for you.

00:00:53.087 --> 00:00:57.087
I didn't even call,
so how did you know I was coming?

00:00:57.087 --> 00:00:58.630
Oh, that...

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.087
...telepathically.

00:01:01.087 --> 00:01:03.129
What's this?

00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:09.087
Father, I love you.

00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:13.254
I won't say anything to my father,
so you don't need to avoid me.

00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:17.087
- That might get you really fired.
- Thank you.

00:01:17.087 --> 00:01:20.671
I will pay you for the clothes
first thing, once I get paid.

00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:25.087
And just ask me if you need anything.
I will do it repently.

00:01:25.087 --> 00:01:27.087
That's okay.
Oh, I'm late!

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:31.087
Yo, bro.
Give me a shot to go on the show.

00:01:31.087 --> 00:01:34.047
I gave it my all to prepare.

00:01:34.047 --> 00:01:36.087
- You said you'd do anything?
- Yes, of course.

00:01:36.087 --> 00:01:38.838
Then, grab him.

00:01:39.087 --> 00:01:42.005
What the, brother?
Am I not making my singing debut?

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.087
- Go to work.
- I feel betrayed. Bro!

00:01:45.087 --> 00:01:49.630
- Let me go. I said let go!
- Sorry, Chief Ssam.

00:01:54.087 --> 00:01:55.713
Are you done packing?

00:01:55.713 --> 00:02:00.087
Yeah, I am going to make you
really happy to be living with me.

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:04.922
Who was that?
Who were you talking to?

00:02:04.922 --> 00:02:07.087
Uh, it was the wrong number.

00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:10.087
He has set you up on a date.

00:02:10.087 --> 00:02:13.213
A date?
I'm not interested, father.

00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:17.213
Huh? What's this?

00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:21.338
Father, I love you.

00:02:24.713 --> 00:02:29.087
Is he seeing someone?

00:02:29.087 --> 00:02:32.838
I couldn't find the right time to tell
my father about the situation.

00:02:32.838 --> 00:02:35.129
But, I didn't purposely hide it from him.
I'm going to tell him.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.421
Yup, I definitely will.
I will tell him no matter what.

00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:43.213
You know you've been saying that
over and over for the past 30 minutes?

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:46.254
Did I?
Alright.

00:02:46.254 --> 00:02:50.338
I'm going to tell him right now,
so you stay put.

00:02:50.338 --> 00:02:55.087
- Jin-haeng!
- Oh, hide, hide. Hide!

00:02:56.254 --> 00:03:01.087
- Jin-haeng, you!
- What is it? Do you need something?

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:05.171
I have something to tell you.
Let's talk outside.

00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:10.087
I'm sure you have
a lot to tell me.

00:03:17.087 --> 00:03:21.087
No wonder you don't want
to go on that date.

00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:23.588
You're already seeing someone.

00:03:23.588 --> 00:03:26.087
What?
What are you talking about?

00:03:26.087 --> 00:03:31.087
You brought her home, cooked for her.
and even fooled around in the room.

00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:35.755
You have an aggressive side to you.

00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:38.087
A woman?
It's not like that.

00:03:38.087 --> 00:03:42.630
Then what? Why else would you
hide someone under the covers?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.087
How old is she?
What's her occupation?

00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:48.630
Anyways, it's a good thing.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.379
Frankly, I was worried that you'd never
want to see another woman again.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.797
It's not like that, father.

00:03:56.797 --> 00:04:05.087
Yeah yeah. I'll give you some privacy.
I can be quite liberal.

00:04:05.087 --> 00:04:06.171
Wait.

00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:09.087
Hey, let me say hi.

00:04:09.087 --> 00:04:14.087
- What? Say hi?
- There's no need to act coy.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:18.421
- Let's see her face. Tell her to come out.
- No, I can't do that. I'll just come clean.

00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:22.087
What's there to say?
I'll know once I see her face.

00:04:22.087 --> 00:04:24.087
Miss, come out here!

00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:30.087
Don't be shy and come out here.

00:04:32.087 --> 00:04:35.087
If you don't come outside,
I'm going in.

00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:37.213
Don't do this, father.
I'll tell you everything.

00:04:37.213 --> 00:04:44.338
Why do you keep saying that?
Miss! Miss, I'm going in there!

00:04:44.338 --> 00:04:47.838
No, father!

00:05:10.087 --> 00:05:13.171
It's you.
You...

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:19.087
Hello.

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:25.087
You-- why are you--
Why is he here?

00:05:25.087 --> 00:05:29.087
Father, Shi-wan is going
to live with us.

00:05:29.087 --> 00:05:34.713
- He has no play to stay.
- What the heck did you say? You!

00:05:35.588 --> 00:05:37.713
Are you okay?
