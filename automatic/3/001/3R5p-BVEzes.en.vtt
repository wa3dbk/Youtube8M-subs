00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
all right you to the other day I got a

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.200 
all right you to the other day I got a
request<00:00:03.950> to<00:00:04.950> make<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.460> video<00:00:05.730> on<00:00:05.790> how<00:00:06.180> to

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
request to make a video on how to

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.270 
request to make a video on how to
install<00:00:06.420> an<00:00:07.080> equalizer<00:00:07.500> how<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.919> hook<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:08.130> up

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
install an equalizer how to hook it up

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.259 
install an equalizer how to hook it up
and<00:00:08.400> whatnot<00:00:08.599> so<00:00:09.599> here<00:00:10.019> goes<00:00:10.170> nothing<00:00:11.150> from<00:00:12.150> my

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
and whatnot so here goes nothing from my

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.990 
and whatnot so here goes nothing from my
head<00:00:12.450> unit<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.590> subwoofer<00:00:14.309> output<00:00:14.490> and

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
head unit I have a subwoofer output and

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.200 
head unit I have a subwoofer output and
I<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.900> front<00:00:16.800> output<00:00:17.190> or<00:00:17.520> might<00:00:17.880> be<00:00:17.910> rear

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
I have a front output or might be rear

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.349 
I have a front output or might be rear
output<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.869> other<00:00:19.020> anyway<00:00:20.359> when

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
output one of the other anyway when

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.730 
output one of the other anyway when
you're<00:00:21.449> hooking<00:00:21.630> up<00:00:21.810> an<00:00:21.930> equaliser<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
you're hooking up an equaliser the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.620 
you're hooking up an equaliser the
subwoofer<00:00:23.070> output<00:00:23.220> isn't<00:00:23.970> necessarily

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
subwoofer output isn't necessarily

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.259 
subwoofer output isn't necessarily
needed<00:00:25.160> if<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.430> either<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.789> front<00:00:27.000> or<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
needed if you do either the front or the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.200 
needed if you do either the front or the
rear<00:00:27.390> RCA<00:00:27.869> outputs<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> head<00:00:28.769> unit

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
rear RCA outputs from the head unit

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.460 
rear RCA outputs from the head unit
that's<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.300> full<00:00:30.510> range<00:00:30.750> signal<00:00:31.109> which<00:00:31.260> gives

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
that's a full range signal which gives

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.650 
that's a full range signal which gives
you<00:00:31.560> high<00:00:31.679> as<00:00:31.740> mids<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.219> lows<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.520> bass<00:00:32.969> so

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you high as mids and lows for bass so

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
you high as mids and lows for bass so
what<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> equalizer<00:00:34.950> does<00:00:35.190> or<00:00:35.370> some<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.670> them

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
what the equalizer does or some of them

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.270 
what the equalizer does or some of them
anyway<00:00:36.200> will<00:00:37.200> actually<00:00:37.530> break<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.980> between

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
anyway will actually break up between

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 
anyway will actually break up between
your<00:00:38.790> front<00:00:39.059> frequencies<00:00:39.690> your<00:00:40.500> rear

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
your front frequencies your rear

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.740 
your front frequencies your rear
frequencies<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:41.730> subwoofer<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.450> then<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
frequencies your subwoofer and then the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.750 
frequencies your subwoofer and then the
master<00:00:43.110> volume<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.860> has<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> fader<00:00:44.309> between

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
master volume and it has a fader between

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.090 
master volume and it has a fader between
front<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.090> rear<00:00:45.210> because<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.379> take<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
front and rear because it will take the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.310 
front and rear because it will take the
full<00:00:47.280> range<00:00:47.460> signal<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.030> actually<00:00:48.840> split<00:00:49.200> it

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
full range signal and actually split it

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.029 
full range signal and actually split it
so<00:00:50.250> that's<00:00:50.489> what<00:00:50.610> I've<00:00:50.700> done<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.879> ran<00:00:51.149> my<00:00:51.800> see<00:00:52.800> I

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
so that's what I've done I ran my see I

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.330 
so that's what I've done I ran my see I
ran<00:00:53.640> my<00:00:53.879> input<00:00:54.449> from<00:00:54.840> my<00:00:54.989> CD<00:00:55.289> player<00:00:55.340> into

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
ran my input from my CD player into

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.119 
ran my input from my CD player into
there<00:00:56.520> into<00:00:56.879> CD<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.480> aux<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> an

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
there into CD or aux you can have a an

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.229 
there into CD or aux you can have a an
auxilary<00:00:59.489> input<00:00:59.640> if<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> want<00:01:02.030> then<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.090> have

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
auxilary input if you want then I have

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.440 
auxilary input if you want then I have
my<00:01:03.390> subwoofer<00:01:03.840> output<00:01:04.040> my<00:01:05.040> front<00:01:05.760> outputs<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
my subwoofer output my front outputs and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.420 
my subwoofer output my front outputs and
my<00:01:06.659> rear<00:01:06.810> outputs<00:01:07.260> all<00:01:07.500> three<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.010> those<00:01:08.130> go

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
my rear outputs all three of those go

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.719 
my rear outputs all three of those go
back<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.330> back<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.780> amplifier

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.580 

so<00:01:14.729> pretty<00:01:15.420> much<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.200> pretty

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
so pretty much it is pretty

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.719 
so pretty much it is pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> most<00:01:17.939> part<00:01:19.729> you

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
self-explanatory for the most part you

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
self-explanatory for the most part you
got<00:01:20.850> your<00:01:21.000> ground<00:01:21.210> wire<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.799> your

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
got your ground wire you have your

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.600 
got your ground wire you have your
remote<00:01:23.189> wire<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:23.880> will<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.680> blue

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
remote wire which will go to the blue

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.160 
remote wire which will go to the blue
wire<00:01:26.880> from<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.270> head<00:01:27.390> unit<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.780> also<00:01:27.900> goes

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
wire from the head unit that also goes

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.960 
wire from the head unit that also goes
back<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.530> amplifiers<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.100> turn<00:01:29.610> those<00:01:29.820> on

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
back to your amplifiers to turn those on

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.940 
back to your amplifiers to turn those on
and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.990> power<00:01:31.140> wire<00:01:31.470> which<00:01:31.770> is

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and then your power wire which is

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.649 
and then your power wire which is
anything<00:01:32.280> when<00:01:32.759> when<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> keys<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> pretty

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
anything when when the keys on so pretty

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.090 
anything when when the keys on so pretty
much<00:01:36.780> anytime<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.259> keys<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.619> sometimes

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
much anytime your keys on sometimes

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.289 
much anytime your keys on sometimes
sometimes<00:01:38.460> they'll<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:38.700> lights<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.150> mine

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
sometimes they'll have lights like mine

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.310 
sometimes they'll have lights like mine
lights<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.630> blue<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:41.460> pretty<00:01:41.670> much<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
lights up blue and that's pretty much it

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.510 
lights up blue and that's pretty much it
like<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.130> might<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.340> showed

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
like I like I think I might have showed

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.210 
like I like I think I might have showed
before<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.619> splits<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:47.009> four

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
before I have a splits out for four

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.910 
before I have a splits out for four
different<00:01:47.520> frequency<00:01:48.380> adjustments<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
different frequency adjustments for the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
different frequency adjustments for the
Front's<00:01:50.310> three<00:01:50.970> different<00:01:51.299> adjustments<00:01:51.810> for

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
Front's three different adjustments for

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.530 
Front's three different adjustments for
the<00:01:51.960> rear<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.950> subwoofer<00:01:53.430> volume<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.970> then<00:01:54.420> my

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the rear my subwoofer volume and then my

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.170 
the rear my subwoofer volume and then my
master<00:01:54.899> volume<00:01:55.079> with<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> fader<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.670> that's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
master volume with the fader so that's

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.800 
master volume with the fader so that's
pretty<00:01:57.360> much<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:58.189> I<00:01:59.189> hope<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.210> helps<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.689> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
pretty much it I hope this helps if you
