for behind which um it with for drones
fine<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.690> think<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.020> little<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.679> allows<00:02:10.920> you

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
fine I think it's a little it allows you

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.140 
fine I think it's a little it allows you
to<00:02:11.129> continue<00:02:11.459> producing<00:02:11.640> circlings

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to continue producing circlings

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.790 
to continue producing circlings
obviously<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:13.020> goes

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
obviously so goes

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.590 
obviously so goes
you're<00:02:14.190> gonna<00:02:14.340> uh<00:02:14.400> disappearing<00:02:15.300> building

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
you're gonna uh disappearing building

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.450 
you're gonna uh disappearing building
whatever<00:02:15.870> yeah<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.710> know<00:02:17.010> he<00:02:17.130> still<00:02:17.310> got<00:02:17.400> the

but<00:02:18.930> he's<00:02:19.110> going<00:02:19.350> for<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.950> all<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.850> he's

he's got for drones back here mining and

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.870 
he's got for drones back here mining and
in<00:02:28.020> fact<00:02:28.200> if<00:02:28.380> he<00:02:28.500> continues<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.040> mind<00:02:29.460> you

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
in fact if he continues to mind you

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.490 
in fact if he continues to mind you
might<00:02:30.060> even<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.330> enough<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> third<00:02:31.080> spine

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500

natural<00:03:01.440> expansion<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.340> what<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.670> ghost

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
natural expansion and what is ghost

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.220 
natural expansion and what is ghost
users<00:03:03.180> are<00:03:03.270> waiting<00:03:03.540> for<00:03:03.570> he<00:03:03.810> has<00:03:03.990> enough

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
users are waiting for he has enough

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.440 
users are waiting for he has enough
money<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.560> think<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.370> make<00:03:05.520> two<00:03:05.730> spines<00:03:06.060> where

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
money I think to make two spines where

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.730 
money I think to make two spines where
are<00:03:06.660> his<00:03:06.810> spine<00:03:07.050> crawlers<00:03:07.410> it's<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.650> gonna

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
are his spine crawlers it's just gonna

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.920 
are his spine crawlers it's just gonna
fight<00:03:08.100> with<00:03:08.130> drones<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.910> Spencer<00:03:09.570> egglings

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
fight with drones and Spencer egglings

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.900 
fight with drones and Spencer egglings
not<00:03:10.620> even<00:03:10.920> gonna<00:03:11.040> build<00:03:11.280> spines<00:03:11.550> that's<00:03:11.790> how

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
not even gonna build spines that's how

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.120 
not even gonna build spines that's how
confident<00:03:12.420> i<00:03:12.510> use<00:03:12.660> i<00:03:12.870> guess<00:03:13.050> spine<00:03:13.680> crawler<00:03:13.920> at

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
confident i use i guess spine crawler at

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.590 
confident i use i guess spine crawler at
the<00:03:14.250> natural<00:03:14.640> gets<00:03:14.790> cancelled<00:03:15.150> off<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.420> oh<00:03:15.570> my

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
the natural gets cancelled off and oh my

just a sick strategy by go see user and
why<00:03:43.050> isn't<00:03:43.260> he<00:03:43.380> building<00:03:43.620> strong<00:03:43.830> crawlers<00:03:44.160> I

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
why isn't he building strong crawlers I

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.490 
why isn't he building strong crawlers I
mean<00:03:44.340> he's<00:03:44.459> got<00:03:44.670> um<00:03:45.270> actually<00:03:45.630> just<00:03:45.930> not<00:03:46.320> gonna

mean he's got um actually just not gonna
build<00:03:46.770> spines<00:03:47.010> he's<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:47.370> gonna<00:03:47.459> continue<00:03:47.670> to

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
build spines he's just gonna continue to

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000 
build spines he's just gonna continue to
make<00:03:48.120> more<00:03:48.239> zerglings<00:03:48.780> why<00:03:48.989> not<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.410> guess<00:03:49.709> and

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
natural expansion was a wise idea but

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.530 
natural expansion was a wise idea but
I'm<00:04:10.230> all<00:04:10.500> honestly<00:04:10.920> what<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.519> hell<00:04:11.760> can<00:04:12.090> he<00:04:12.150> do
