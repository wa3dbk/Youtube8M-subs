00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Mars Expedition Projects are not on you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.700
 mankind dreams of interplanetary 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.649
 flight we have a few decades 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.960
 private initiative organizers mars 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.849
 one selected the top hundred candidates from 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.559
 200 thousand people wanting to establish 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.360
 human settlement on mars 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.340
 NASA scientists are actively developing 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.410
 seeking to implement a similar project 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.910
 however an obstacle to long 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.650
 flight can become space 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.320
 long-term radiation exposure 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.330
 destructive for man having in his 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.710
 disposal of leading scientists and a dozen 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.289
 specialized research 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.149
 centers in this area turned us not 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.030
 able to solve the problem of radiation and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.860
 appealed to the public for help 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.570
 agency offers 29 thousand dollars 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.430
 anyone who can find a way to reduce 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.040
 cosmic radiation exposure 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.840
 as far as possible however candidates 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.239
 project mars one does not seem to pay 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.649
 attention to the danger of radiation is possible 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.199
 in part it's all about motivating 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.239
 commercials I want to fly on 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.280
 mars not to go down in history i 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.890
 want to inspire people around the world this 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.199
 our chance to re-make the world into space 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.199
 such is our nature such is our destiny 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.030
 impressive but nasa turning 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.310
 help in finding ways to reduce 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.619
 exposure risks explains that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.060
 stay in deep space more than 150 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.869
 days can lead to cancer 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.979
 radiation diseases can damage 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.909
 cardiovascular and nervous systems 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.710
 also eyes 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.539
 and modern technologies allow 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.390
 reach the red planet in three hundred days 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:44.460
 which is twice as long as the flight 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.259
 to mars is different because astronauts 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.600
 going to deep space will 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.179
 influenced by incredibly powerful 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.280
 galactic cosmic rays of their 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.409
 radiation exposure is much stronger 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.810
 than u radiation which met on 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.200
 its way astronauts during the flight to 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.360
 the moon 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.700
 so travel to mars is fraught 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.130
 big risks in particular the current 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.330
 mission may affect health 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.060
 of cardio-vascular system 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.340
 the work of the brain and the body as a whole mission 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.200
 to the moon were very short and occupied 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.360
 less than a week so astronauts 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.220
 were exposed to cosmic radiation in 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.910
 much less so than those who 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.910
 fly to mars
