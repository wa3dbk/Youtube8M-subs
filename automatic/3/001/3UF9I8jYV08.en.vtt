well dance this together we talked a
little<00:02:41.390> bit<00:02:41.569> about<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.959> lead<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.290> follow<00:02:42.470> for

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
little bit about the lead and follow for

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.539 
little bit about the lead and follow for
you<00:02:46.120> starting<00:02:47.120> with<00:02:47.180> position<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:48.099> go<00:02:49.099> outside

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
you starting with position to go outside

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.550 
you starting with position to go outside
a<00:02:49.610> position<00:02:50.209> through<00:02:50.390> make<00:02:50.810> some<00:02:51.079> contact

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
a position through make some contact

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.160 
a position through make some contact
with<00:02:51.709> their<00:02:51.829> upper<00:02:52.099> thigh<00:02:52.310> we<00:02:52.940> go<00:02:53.090> back<00:02:53.360> we're

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
with their upper thigh we go back we're

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.750 
with their upper thigh we go back we're
gonna<00:02:54.260> do<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.440> little<00:02:54.620> OMA<00:02:55.010> gaze<00:02:55.280> or<00:02:55.459> like

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
gonna do a little OMA gaze or like

gonna do a little OMA gaze or like
cradles<00:02:56.360> we<00:02:57.110> finish<00:02:57.470> with<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.370> Box<00:03:00.250> slightly

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
cradles we finish with the Box slightly

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.500 
cradles we finish with the Box slightly
turning<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.819> left<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.269> we'll<00:03:02.360> do<00:03:02.450> it

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
turning to the left and we'll do it

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.500 
turning to the left and we'll do it
again<00:03:02.630> I'll<00:03:03.790> let's<00:03:04.790> start<00:03:05.000> from<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.299> side

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
again I'll let's start from this side

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.839 
again I'll let's start from this side
you<00:03:05.540> can<00:03:05.840> see<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.860> contact<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.519> we<00:03:07.640> make

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
you can see the the contact that we make

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.670 
you can see the the contact that we make
from<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.209> thigh<00:03:10.090> two<00:03:11.110> three<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.470> this

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
from the thigh two three so this

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.970 
from the thigh two three so this
pressure<00:03:12.950> here<00:03:13.599> just<00:03:14.599> enough<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.530> displace

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
pressure here just enough to displace

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.059 
pressure here just enough to displace
her<00:03:16.340> foot<00:03:17.049> creating<00:03:18.049> an<00:03:18.139> Amagi<00:03:18.470> or<00:03:18.889> an

her foot creating an Amagi or an
adornment<00:03:19.430> here<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.660> can<00:03:20.840> see<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.170> point<00:03:21.500> of

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
adornment here you can see the point of

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:29.929 
adornment here you can see the point of
contact<00:03:22.190> very<00:03:22.430> high<00:03:22.639> on<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:23.000> thigh

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:39.410 

we'll<00:03:30.939> try<00:03:31.120> from<00:03:31.299> this<00:03:31.510> side

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.750 

it's<00:03:40.290> also<00:03:40.470> important<00:03:40.950> here<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.250> maintain

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
it's also important here to maintain

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.830 
it's also important here to maintain
contra<00:03:42.300> body<00:03:42.510> movement<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:45.450> we're<00:03:45.630> always

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
contra body movement so we're always

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.660 
contra body movement so we're always
facing<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> lady<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:53.220> polar<00:03:53.459> is

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
facing the lady the polar is

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.370 
facing the lady the polar is
embellishment<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.390> must<00:03:54.720> be<00:03:54.870> something<00:03:55.110> that

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
embellishment it must be something that

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.520 
embellishment it must be something that
is<00:03:55.530> led<00:03:55.830> I<00:03:56.610> should<00:03:57.240> say<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.480> action<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.140> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
is led I should say the action of the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.020 
is led I should say the action of the
displacement<00:03:59.400> should<00:03:59.550> be<00:03:59.670> led<00:03:59.880> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
displacement should be led the

displacement should be led the
embellishment<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.780> added<00:04:01.200> by<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.380> follower

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
embellishment is added by the follower

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.970 
embellishment is added by the follower
let<00:04:02.459> me<00:04:02.550> show<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.790> what<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.060> mean<00:04:03.360> here<00:04:03.770> I<00:04:04.770> do

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
let me show you what I mean here I do

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.060 
let me show you what I mean here I do
this<00:04:05.310> action<00:04:05.640> because<00:04:06.330> it's<00:04:06.720> lead<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.380> feel

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
this action because it's lead I feel

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.250 
this action because it's lead I feel
George<00:04:08.370> moving<00:04:08.730> towards<00:04:09.060> me<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.720> moved<00:04:10.200> back

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
George moving towards me so I moved back

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.229 
George moving towards me so I moved back
with<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.739> little<00:04:11.040> pressure<00:04:11.280> from<00:04:11.580> his<00:04:11.730> leg<00:04:11.970> I

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
with a little pressure from his leg I

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.350 
with a little pressure from his leg I
cross<00:04:12.959> over<00:04:13.250> again<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.520> part<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.209> an

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
cross over again this part is an

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.780 
cross over again this part is an
embellishment<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.260> they<00:04:16.410> added<00:04:16.650> lift<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.700> the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
embellishment so they added lift of the

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.970 
embellishment so they added lift of the
lower<00:04:18.000> leg<00:04:18.329> is<00:04:18.630> something<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.500> do<00:04:19.560> on<00:04:19.680> my

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
lower leg is something that I do on my

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.250 
lower leg is something that I do on my
own<00:04:20.010> but<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.030> should<00:04:21.209> be<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.390> result<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:22.079> the

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
own but it should be a result of the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
own but it should be a result of the
initial<00:04:22.650> displacement<00:04:24.560> so<00:04:25.560> maybe<00:04:25.770> we<00:04:25.950> can<00:04:26.100> do

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
initial displacement so maybe we can do

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.100 
initial displacement so maybe we can do
it<00:04:26.400> from<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.730> other<00:04:26.760> side<00:04:27.210> one<00:04:27.540> time<00:04:27.780> George

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
it from the other side one time George

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.390 
it from the other side one time George
you<00:04:28.260> can<00:04:28.440> see<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.650> little<00:04:28.919> bit<00:04:29.040> better<00:04:29.190> from

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
you can see a little bit better from

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.430 
you can see a little bit better from
this<00:04:29.610> side<00:04:30.260> now<00:04:31.260> really<00:04:31.590> slow<00:04:31.830> for<00:04:32.190> you

this<00:04:34.440> part<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:34.950> being<00:04:35.190> led<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:36.450> initial

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
this part is being led the initial

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.380 
this part is being led the initial
crossing<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.680> my<00:04:37.830> leg<00:04:38.100> this<00:04:38.760> part<00:04:39.150> is<00:04:39.300> an
