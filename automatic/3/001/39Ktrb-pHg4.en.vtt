00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.420 

now<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.289> want<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> keep<00:00:25.860> hitting<00:00:26.310> it

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
in a circular motion and it will

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.340 
in a circular motion and it will
eventually<00:00:43.699> give<00:00:44.750> it's<00:00:45.750> actually<00:00:46.140> not<00:00:46.290> that
