00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello now let's see some 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.560
 important features of the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.200
 renal physiology 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.150
 I'm about to understand the terms 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.889
 fundamentals that will be bad for 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.170
 talk to him physically, as we have 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.550
 seen in the video on grenet the unit 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.880
 functional that practically this 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.279
 structure that you see here schematized 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.199
 in error as we have seen is found 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.869
 in the so-called cortical part of the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.340
 kidney that is the external part because it was the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.610
 more internal than metal 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.040
 instead we find only a part of 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.110
 this structure that just as well 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.690
 see here is this bag in which 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.450
 this bag in fact here you see cortical 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.190
 and marrow then a portion of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.200
 this structure that takes fron 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 is found in the cortex and a part 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.550
 instead of this structure, yes 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.920
 found in the medulla 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.320
 as we have just seen the neutron 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.530
 which we repeat represent unity 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.270
 functional of the king consists of various 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.440
 however, portions in the first place have this 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.019
 trouble structure 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.369
 this structure practically rewards 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.439
 the name essentially of corpuscles of the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.630
 malpighi that just a structure 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.400
 formed from this first portion also 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.740
 you see here what is called capsule of 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.200
 beaumont and this portion instead of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.509
 there are some notes that receive vases 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.430
 they come from the renal artery and forms 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.170
 romero essentially the capillaries 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.180
 then glomerulate this structure 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.730
 it is called renal glomerulus ed 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.220
 just the very doorway structure 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.010
 this bag instead of see next 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.500
 it is called pct which would be a tubule 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.780
 proximal contour after the tuber 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.280
 we have this other proximal contract 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.490
 duffel bag here called all'upa 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.010
 huvelle that is bend dl the bend dl from mine 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.960
 goes down into the medulla and then goes back up 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.740
 in the cortex in the form of a tube 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.360
 contorted instead precisely distal then 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.870
 you contact me in the next tube 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.760
 contracted distal the mound against 3 of 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.310
 stay as short in two parts one 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.690
 the professor is proximal and distal 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.790
 to be means that this comes 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.830
 first and this comes after this 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.300
 portion of being together for example 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.770
 another portion of another's salt 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.140
 doubt converge in this structure 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.520
 which is called a collecting duct 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.840
 hence precisely the collecting duct tubules 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.300
 practically dublin then converge in the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.650
 duct collector bigger now 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.320
 let's see some features 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.180
 important on physiology to remember 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.610
 the kidney works like a kind of 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.680
 filter because the capacity precisely of 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.290
 receive blood through the evening 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.910
 renal this blood arrived in this 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.850
 structure that takes the name of cover lo 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.830
 keeps filtered to be filtered because 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.870
 because the structure of these capillaries 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.540
 blumer times makes it possible to have it 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.280
 as a kind of colander saying 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.950
 lawn where there are small holes 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.480
 which allow the filtering of blood 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.480
 so not part of the blood comes 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.330
 filtered and will pass into the twisted tube 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.300
 precisely proximal the other against two 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.950
 proximal will occur as you see here 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.099
 resorptions 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.360
 that is, what has been filtered comes 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.430
 reabsorbed see for example comes 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.099
 filtered water only etc. come 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.650
 reabsorbed once this is done then 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.920
 it passes from the vLa loop where it always comes 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.330
 this is precisely the absorption 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.780
 continuous condition like this 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.360
 predict higuain these types of these 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.849
 types of substances with which you are 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.230
 happy greens also indicate how 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.630
 in this case practically one 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.519
 secretion so we have one 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.760
 critical term filtration you need 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.680
 remember the reabsorption la 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.110
 secretion and here we have another 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.180
 important term that the registration that is 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.230
 when I came of these processes 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.630
 filtration resorption and secretion 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.120
 we have in the end precisely the so-called 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.370
 elimination of the so-called registration 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.519
 which is precisely the formation of urine e 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.959
 what remains in all those processes 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.599
 secretion reabsorption filtration 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.640
 they precisely form the urine that it will be 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.769
 the so-called excretore nole then 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.079
 the renal inscription will carry the 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.060
 soaking the wet so you have to 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.800
 remember as always these three terms 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.790
 important figuration secretion 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.609
 between a reabsorption point and precisely 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.319
 also the registration deadline 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.030
 and so in general the terms he must 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:28.490
 remember that he wanted to follow everything 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.689
 stay updated on the videos you register 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.520
 theater my channel 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.520
 I'll wait for your next son, hello
