00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
it hangs backwards because our high

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.569 
it hangs backwards because our high

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.690 
ponytail is going to need the extensions
to<00:01:20.270> flow<00:01:20.929> and<00:01:21.259> lay<00:01:21.649> nicely<00:01:22.009> in<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.490> same

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
to flow and lay nicely in the same

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.999 
to flow and lay nicely in the same
direction<00:01:22.820> as<00:01:23.270> our<00:01:23.539> hair<00:01:23.810> growth<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.200> so

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
direction as our hair growth is so

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.919 
direction as our hair growth is so
there's<00:01:25.460> going<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.759> be<00:01:25.789> a<00:01:25.880> fourth<00:01:26.329> extension
