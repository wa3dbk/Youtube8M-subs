 in grand thef auto 5 we incarnate a 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.210
 threesome of robbers with very bad fleas

 michael is a rock star of the 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.060

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.870

 game wins to be narrated from several 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.750
 angles and has a greater 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.700
 depth in telling us the lives 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.740
 deprived of their heroes for example 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.960
 Michael is the head of a family 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.030
 dysfunctional home with some children and some 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.160
 things as despicable as him 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.050
 franklin is a small-time bully who 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.840
 lives with his aunt in a bad neighborhood of the 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.479
 saints and trevor trevor is simply 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.780
 trevor a time bomb always at 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.390
 burst 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.220
 with you 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.110
 and so 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.700
 as much as the fire benefits in 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.800
 the plot of having several 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.170
 characters the truth is that the best is 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.210
 what's playable in many missions we're going 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.040
 solitary but when two or 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.720
 more protagonists is great to be able to 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.030
 change between them in the middle of the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.640
 action we can also do it in 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.140
 the open world whenever we want 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.980
 discovering where they are and what they do in 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.980
 every moment 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.470
 science 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.570
 at the beginning we can have certain 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.520
 feeling of lack of control before 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.560
 lives of our protagonists because 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.360
 when we do not see them they change clothes or they 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.520
 move without our permission among others 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.110
 things but it will not be long before 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.360
 that we realize how little 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.640
 it matters when everything is so fun 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.530
 in fact there are many things to do 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.840
 to improve or just to entertain us 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.880
 the gigantic map of this launch 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.980
 the biggest rock star has done 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.630
 until now and certainly not all 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.630
 they have to do with killing people 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.380
 with the passage of the game you will do with a 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.600
 house more in line with the new train of 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.930
 life that you are going to take a look at the 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.050
 tele beam yoga and also you know 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.450
 relax a bit, but be careful with the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.680
 bad rolls of certain substances do not 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.680
 lose your head 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.819
 you also have a mobile that is again 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.480
 the nerve center of your social life 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.480
 call surfing send emails all one 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.840
 good 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.439
 To make matters worse, we're going to earn a lot 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.360
 money in the campaign but you do not 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.730
 worry because there are lots of ways 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.069
 to spend it from those that do not go beyond what 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.260
 aesthetic up the various treats 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.450
 thousands of dollars but there are also 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.310
 very useful and between them we stay 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.200
 with the purchase of properties that we 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.670
 allow extra income and 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.670
 unlock more missions 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.950
 But where does all that money the 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.840
 City of the Saints is like a lover 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.209
 capricious that will give us everything while 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.620
 let's have the pockets full when 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.739
 let's zero the current account 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.239
 will play work and that's when gta 5 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.239
 He brings out the best of himself 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.680
 you are welcome 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.510
 normal missions will allow us 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.489
 get out of the way with some wads of 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.010
 dollars but if we want a pinch of 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.989
 you really have to organize a blow the 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.209
 decide how we will do it and draw a plan 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.530
 is part of our duties and 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.900
 we also have to choose who we 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.239
 accompanies and we already bring a bank or a 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.220
 jewelry or a gigantic merchant ship 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.709
 there is always more than one way to do it 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.930
 and we are come or choose 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.430
 as the only thing that matters is to treat 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.430
 to catch as much as possible 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.370
 if we can avoid hitting a better shot 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.110
 what better but it will be difficult and often 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.240
 we will end up enjoying the incredible 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.520
 action scenes proposed by the game 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.620
 the shootings are even better than the 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.169
 of the fourth installment and there are lots of 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.639
 weapons plus each character has a 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.199
 special ability that will put us 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.199
 things a little easier 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.600
 as always the vehicles are the kings 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.550
 of the cotarro and the world of the campaign 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.470
 It is full of places to discover and 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.470
 be it by land sea or air 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.680
 gta 5 is not only an admirable product 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.900
 from the playable but also from the 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.060
 visual to say that it is the open world more 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.740
 powerful market is a no-brainer and 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.660
 it must be made clear that it even exceeds 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.120
 graphically to many blockbusters 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.040
 with linear campaigns the keys are 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.660
 in characters made with a love 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.660
 impressive and in some scenarios 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.370
 amazing and full of details 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.490
 special mention for physics the 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.639
 lighting and for the water really 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.639
 shocking is 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.010
 as for the sound the music includes 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.660
 dozens of licensed songs but 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.850
 also has own score for 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.889
 first time in the series contributing from 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.470
 fantastic way to create tension in the 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.750
 Highlights the audio effects 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.699
 they are hyper realistic and the title counts 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.440
 with subtitles in our language and a 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.889
 extraordinary dub in version 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.889
 original 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.250
 rockstar has made you wait a long time 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.319
 to see a new gta but our 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.419
 patience has been rewarded 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.490
 thanks auto 5 is much more than what 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.770
 we expected and it is confirmed as one of 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.099
 the best games of this generation is 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.650
 addictive shocking and hilarious and 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.520
 still missing online gta but that's 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.110
 another story 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.110
 long life the saints 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.980
