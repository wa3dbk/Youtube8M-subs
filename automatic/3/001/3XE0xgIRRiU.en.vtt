00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.870
 I talked about youtube everything you see 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.879
 here talking about the most visited channel 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.799
 Here's a good texture here. 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.110
 fun minecraft I really liked the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.799
 foot structure said troadec 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.460
 then people first the forum is a 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.900
 thing for you is that it has not changed the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:29.939
 The character has not changed at all. 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:32.669
 but nobody thinks nobody answered 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.920
 I asked a channel video. 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.390
 but it is so in every little primate 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.840
 pates and just pulling the bag of others 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.840
 great you 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.450
 so on youtube nowadays you only 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.829
 can grow in this way but then it 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:59.329
 that 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:16.590
 although for me to do but it's cool like this 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:20.860
 is the stone of the 5th b and the stone context 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:25.090
 normal normal 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.910
 the evil is normal normal I hereby leave it clear 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.010
 on your facebook what is this 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:35.980
 for others I mend the crew but one thing 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:38.110
 I have with the impulses up is the texture 1.7 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.460
 1 sets arranged Trumbo 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.280
 is version 1.6 that has just released're 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.260
 I'm with the texture not our posture 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.970
 it was just a point 7 that has just launched 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:58.990
 together with her right now 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:02:00.910
 and there is the lapis lazuli cap glass 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.009
 or people in the world was none right 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.520
 changed a bit because the different stone 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.869
 But I think it's changed the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.030
 gold 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.380
 I think it has changed a little bit a few 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.120
 things 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.830
 The guys I think I do not know but I think 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.080
 I 'll probably leave it there where 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:23.170
 this texture and look I think I know 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.350
 now would not have coal is one of the names 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:32.620
 of things in the creed but what happens here 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:36.310
 This is something in the process. 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:40.320
 the block of gold golden mouth gold got 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.840
 me down block gold I like it cool 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.420
 normal differential in your block of 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.730
 iron but with very cool to do 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.420
 some buildings made it fun 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.420
 iron mouth 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.709
 much has changed 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.459
 visit a man who changed what he did not visit 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.349
 It does not change much a video but she 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.500
 stayed a little cooler is more or 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.910
 less this a little more fun but 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:19.790
 freaked out on that day 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:21.410
 there we will see the voice until it is and I am 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.970
 enjoying constructing things already 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.160
 here guys here I think I'm going 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.690
 make another person look like I am 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.670
 building here is making a video 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:34.160
 building time well from the other 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:43.670
 side here a differentiated thing with the 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:47.600
 Mother who is different from here is a click. 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.299
 My government changed my government quite well. 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:57.319
 cool the good time face another thing 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:04:00.500
 different is that emerald emerald 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:04.120
 how little cool daddy in it 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.670
 released to each side 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.200
 kraft mouth a little diamond and stayed 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.100
 It's not okay to do the same. 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.780
 buildings the fun good 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.250
 So I'm going to build something else in this 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.930
 map here study I built here to 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.970
 to walk cheerful because it shows how it is 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.700
 that it is a miracle that the computer 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.130
 computer but at the time it remembers how everything 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.840
 another much play on the computer 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.320
 Bad computer, damn good 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.070
 so let me let the low 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.070
 currency in service 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:49.510
 the United said that it moves about 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.820
 stone do not spoil the planting of 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.890
 tidy chuchu back right 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.390
 but I think it 's this galera I hope 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.400
 enjoyed this mix is a pec 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.580
 pec sector I think it is light with a 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.850
 A little faster I was not fast in the 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.530
 unicredit but with leozinho hoped that 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.710
 I think it's a little less she leaves 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.360
 Faster is always sparse details 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.330
 microsoft small square was 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.040
 just like I think is I hope you 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.710

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.180
