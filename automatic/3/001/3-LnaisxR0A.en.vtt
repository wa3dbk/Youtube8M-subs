the<00:00:41.820> game<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.270> thought<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.719> liked<00:00:42.899> discipline<00:00:43.410> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the game I thought we liked discipline I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
the game I thought we liked discipline I
think<00:00:43.789> right<00:00:44.789> now<00:00:45.000> when<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.270> look<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.570> our

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
think right now when you look at our

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.660 
think right now when you look at our
team<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.260> say<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.739> love<00:00:46.920> our<00:00:46.950> team<00:00:47.280> on

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
team and I say it I love our team on

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.470 
team and I say it I love our team on
paper<00:00:49.280> but<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.520> tend<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.149> frontrunners

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
paper but we tend to be frontrunners

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.619 
paper but we tend to be frontrunners
when<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.559> get<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> good<00:00:52.920> lead<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.850> relax<00:00:54.239> and

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
when we get a good lead we relax and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
when we get a good lead we relax and
teams<00:00:55.020> take<00:00:55.680> advantage<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.460> then

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
teams take advantage of it and then

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.060 
teams take advantage of it and then
you're<00:00:57.090> caught<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.800> tough<00:00:58.949> to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you're caught you know and it's tough to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.340 
you're caught you know and it's tough to
turn<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.340> back<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.609> its<00:01:00.270> rear<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.840> game<00:01:01.050> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
turn it back on its rear in a game that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.500 
turn it back on its rear in a game that
you<00:01:01.559> outscored<00:01:02.309> team<00:01:02.520> three<00:01:02.879> quarters<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you outscored team three quarters and

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.679 
you outscored team three quarters and
lose<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> game<00:01:04.610> but<00:01:05.610> our<00:01:05.790> third<00:01:06.030> quarter<00:01:06.240> was<00:01:06.479> so

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
lose a game but our third quarter was so

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.880 
lose a game but our third quarter was so
bad<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:08.250> know<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> look<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:08.880> 24<00:01:09.390> 27<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.170> 27<00:01:10.770> is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
bad you know you look at 24 27 and 27 is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.950 
bad you know you look at 24 27 and 27 is
what<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.790> scored<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.210> three<00:01:12.420> quarters<00:01:12.780> when

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
what we scored in three quarters when

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
what we scored in three quarters when
you<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.170> those<00:01:13.320> numbers<00:01:13.670> with<00:01:14.670> our<00:01:14.880> defense

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
you see those numbers with our defense

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.760 
you see those numbers with our defense
you<00:01:15.450> would<00:01:15.570> say<00:01:15.720> bony<00:01:15.960> probably<00:01:16.350> won<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> game

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you would say bony probably won the game

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.390 
you would say bony probably won the game
and<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.400> gave<00:01:17.549> up<00:01:17.610> 36<00:01:18.270> points<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> quarter

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
and we gave up 36 points in a quarter

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.310 
and we gave up 36 points in a quarter
and<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.850> really<00:01:21.119> believe<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.509> i<00:01:21.720> believe<00:01:21.990> we

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
and I really believe this i believe we

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.590 
and I really believe this i believe we
could<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.590> scored<00:01:22.680> zero<00:01:22.890> points<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
could have scored zero points in the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.969 
could have scored zero points in the
third<00:01:24.810> quarter<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.380> should<00:01:25.530> never<00:01:25.740> give

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
third quarter and we should never give

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.109 
third quarter and we should never give
up<00:01:26.100> 36<00:01:26.490> points<00:01:27.049> but<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.080> did<00:01:28.350> 30<00:01:29.280> 60<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> Ellen

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
up 36 points but we did 30 60 of Ellen

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.190 
up 36 points but we did 30 60 of Ellen
you<00:01:30.329> know<00:01:30.450> us<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.720> gain<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.079> there<00:01:33.200> I'll

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you know us to gain right there I'll

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.840 
you know us to gain right there I'll
call<00:01:34.530> some<00:01:34.740> different<00:01:35.009> assessment<00:01:35.430> from<00:01:35.610> some

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
call some different assessment from some

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.280 
call some different assessment from some
different<00:01:36.150> things<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.750> know<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.229> the

most part we just and get it done I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.280 
most part we just and get it done I
think<00:01:40.770> we're<00:01:40.890> better<00:01:41.009> than<00:01:41.159> 11<00:01:41.640> points<00:01:42.290> we

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
think we're better than 11 points we

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.690 
think we're better than 11 points we
definitely<00:01:43.590> got<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.710> put<00:01:43.920> forth<00:01:44.159> better<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
definitely got to put forth better a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.020 
definitely got to put forth better a
better<00:01:45.000> effort<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:46.049> executing<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:47.850> will

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
better effort in executing and we will
