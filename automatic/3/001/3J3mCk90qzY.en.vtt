00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 in this video we will tell how to do 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.919
 the handle on the broom is thinner because as if 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.080
 you will not do that now 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.650
 I will show the pen you get immense 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.089
 sizes 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:19.590
 that's how it happens when you tied 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.529
 here you take all three bunches and here 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.080
 that 's what i said 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.189
 the little thing you put in the middle 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.850
 so here is a hand separate take the legs 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.700
 and that's where trying as low as possible but so 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.700
 so as not to break the whole thing cut off 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.649
 can do it a few times though 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.590
 cut one at a time without any difference 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.260
 the fact is we no longer need to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.379
 there was no such thing in the middle 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.719
 the only thing again, do not do 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.510
 this outside so that when you put it down 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.960
 a bunch you got everything beautiful after 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.110
 how you tied all three bundles 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.710
 must also be cut in this 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.080
 same place 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.100
 otherwise you have a pen that is stolen fat 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.180
 and well, not very convenient for this already 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.990
 several sheets 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.920
 it is possible or in one it is already very 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.640
 convenient because of the thickness too seregin here 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.960
 you can choose by a little bit to 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:37.979
 convenient and exactly the same here cut out 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 pulling like all other times 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.119
 and that is, if the pen is still thick and you can 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.970
 will cut again i will say more 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:53.330
 even need to tie 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.970
 and if you knit four times then after 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.520
 here this mating 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.880
 it is better not to cut the handle because 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.760
 if you're still cutting out, then you 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.640
 break strength but 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.870
 since i am three kind 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:16.550
 knit just like me before 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.250
 showed cut out the middle here 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.350
 snatches see how much you need 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.070
 cut to get finally 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.070
 pen 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:59.380
 who means you need and okay she 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.380
 will be
