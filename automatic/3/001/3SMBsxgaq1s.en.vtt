up I haven't been dancing for three

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.179 
up I haven't been dancing for three
months<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.930> think<00:00:22.109> I'm<00:00:22.199> doing<00:00:22.410> better<00:00:22.619> than<00:00:22.740> you

months I think I'm doing better than you
I<00:00:23.220> think<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.670> broken<00:00:23.970> ankle<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.330> probably

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
I think a broken ankle is probably

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.750 
I think a broken ankle is probably
comparable<00:00:24.930> way<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.160> really<00:00:26.609> have

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
comparable way to but I really have

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.580

of<00:01:24.720> looks<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.080> bulldog<00:01:25.799> basically<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
of looks like a bulldog basically and it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.460 
of looks like a bulldog basically and it
is<00:01:27.090> because<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.630> full<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.140> actually

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
is because it's a full but it's actually

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.069 
is because it's a full but it's actually
a<00:01:28.500> full<00:01:28.680> 4x4<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.150> idea<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.689> is

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
a full 4x4 and the idea is that is

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.810 
a full 4x4 and the idea is that is
something<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.470> want<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.829> take<00:01:32.100> off<00:01:32.280> road<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
something you want to take off road and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.240 
something you want to take off road and
I<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:33.750> feel<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.040> that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
I can really feel that it's like that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.069 
I can really feel that it's like that

like it's running and custard a bit of
the<00:03:19.920> time<00:03:20.130> but<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:20.790> know<00:03:20.910> what<00:03:21.090> it's<00:03:21.239> got

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
the time but you know what it's got

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.960 
the time but you know what it's got
great<00:03:21.840> fuel<00:03:22.139> consumption<00:03:22.739> 5.5<00:03:23.459> liters<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
great fuel consumption 5.5 liters to the

great fuel consumption 5.5 liters to the
hundred<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.540> what<00:03:24.690> Renault<00:03:24.989> claims<00:03:25.290> you'll

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
hundred is what Renault claims you'll

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.379

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
probably get close to that and it's like

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.210 
probably get close to that and it's like
any<00:03:27.569> diesel<00:03:27.870> really<00:03:28.349> you<00:03:28.500> just<00:03:28.620> need<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.889> kind

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
of look for the right gear most of the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.539 
of look for the right gear most of the
time<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:31.049> if<00:03:31.319> you<00:03:31.530> do<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.739> lot<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.040> urban
