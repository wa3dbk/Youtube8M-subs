this is amazing it is more of a dry

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.020 
this is amazing it is more of a dry
formula<00:05:47.270> it's<00:05:48.080> not<00:05:48.320> clumpy<00:05:49.220> it's<00:05:49.580> it<00:05:49.970> really

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
formula it's not clumpy it's it really

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.279 
formula it's not clumpy it's it really
makes<00:05:50.660> my<00:05:50.840> lashes<00:05:51.020> look<00:05:51.260> soft<00:05:51.860> they<00:05:52.130> feel<00:05:52.250> soft

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
which is incredible like they feel so

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.240

nice<00:05:56.539> and<00:05:56.750> soft<00:05:56.930> I<00:05:57.110> hate<00:05:57.380> mice<00:05:57.620> Cara<00:05:57.979> that

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
nice and soft I hate mice Cara that

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.460 
nice and soft I hate mice Cara that
makes<00:05:58.940> your<00:05:59.210> lashes<00:05:59.449> feel<00:05:59.840> really<00:06:00.110> dry<00:06:00.349> and<00:06:00.380> I

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
makes your lashes feel really dry and I

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.249 
makes your lashes feel really dry and I
think<00:06:00.740> that<00:06:01.220> the<00:06:01.789> argan<00:06:02.150> oil<00:06:02.330> and<00:06:02.599> this<00:06:02.750> really

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:03.259 
think that the argan oil and this really

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.020 
think that the argan oil and this really
helps<00:06:03.560> condition<00:06:04.099> them<00:06:04.280> and<00:06:04.580> make<00:06:04.849> them

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
helps condition them and make them

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.700 
helps condition them and make them
really<00:06:05.210> soft<00:06:05.630> and<00:06:05.840> look<00:06:06.080> really<00:06:06.380> nice<00:06:06.470> and

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
really soft and look really nice and

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.270 
really soft and look really nice and
fluffy

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
fluffy

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.760 
fluffy
it<00:06:07.430> was<00:06:07.520> very<00:06:07.789> buildable<00:06:08.330> and<00:06:08.810> really<00:06:09.440> easy<00:06:09.650> to

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
it was very buildable and really easy to

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.200 
it was very buildable and really easy to
do<00:06:09.979> a<00:06:10.010> second<00:06:10.400> coat<00:06:10.490> you<00:06:10.639> could<00:06:10.789> probably<00:06:10.940> even

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
do a second coat you could probably even

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.719 
do a second coat you could probably even
do<00:06:11.419> 3<00:06:11.720> or<00:06:11.750> 4<00:06:11.870> coats<00:06:12.289> with<00:06:12.470> this<00:06:12.620> mascara<00:06:13.099> that's
