satellite<00:00:59.640> today<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:01.109> design

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
satellite today with the design

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.039 
satellite today with the design
essential<00:01:02.190> natural<00:01:02.930> defining<00:01:03.930> crew<00:01:04.619> gel<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
essential natural defining crew gel and

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.120 
essential natural defining crew gel and
when<00:01:07.049> you're<00:01:07.170> familiar<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.530> ever<00:01:07.770> they<00:01:08.010> have

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
when you're familiar with ever they have

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.310 
when you're familiar with ever they have
to<00:01:08.400> style<00:01:08.729> needs<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.360> defining<00:01:09.720> cream<00:01:10.049> gel

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
to style needs is the defining cream gel

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.990 
to style needs is the defining cream gel
and<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> curl<00:01:11.450> stretching<00:01:12.470> cream

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
and then it's the curl stretching cream

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.840 
and then it's the curl stretching cream
but<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.210> saw<00:01:15.450> my<00:01:15.780> hair<00:01:16.650> type<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:19.320> fine<00:01:20.070> print

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
but they saw my hair type the fine print

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.240 
but they saw my hair type the fine print
job<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> nice<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:21.990> me<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.040> just

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
job with the nice one for me so I'm just

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
job with the nice one for me so I'm just
going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.520> take<00:01:23.790> some<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.600> put<00:01:24.840> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
going to take some of that and put it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.120 
going to take some of that and put it
all<00:01:25.670> over<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.210> section<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:30.860> think<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> can

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
all over this section I think you can

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.179 
all over this section I think you can
use<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.820> online<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.650> washing<00:01:34.650> go<00:01:34.829> here

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
use this one online like washing go here

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.719 
use this one online like washing go here
too<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:36.380> you'll<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.590> how<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> find<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.490> gets

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
too but you'll see how to find it gets

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.109 
too but you'll see how to find it gets
in<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.000> minute<00:01:42.920> if<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> consistent

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
in a minute if you have a consistent

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:54.240 
in a minute if you have a consistent
texture<00:01:45.570> all<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.740> way<00:01:46.860> throughout

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.010 

you<00:01:54.790> kind<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.150> start<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.510> see<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:55.810> definition

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
you kind of start to see the definition

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:06.750 
you kind of start to see the definition
right<00:01:56.590> there<00:02:02.520> okay<00:02:05.250> I'm<00:02:06.250> just<00:02:06.280> going<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.640> put

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
right there okay I'm just going to put

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:14.310 
right there okay I'm just going to put
some<00:02:06.790> around<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.420> edges<00:02:12.930> you're<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.170> going

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
some around the edges you're just going

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.780 
some around the edges you're just going
to<00:02:14.380> begin<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.800> clone<00:02:15.040> roll<00:02:17.160> if<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.310> can't<00:02:18.550> call

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
to begin to clone roll if you can't call

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.320 
to begin to clone roll if you can't call
you<00:02:19.030> can<00:02:19.180> also<00:02:19.330> do<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> flat<00:02:20.140> twist<00:02:21.120> will<00:02:22.120> work

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
you can also do a flat twist will work

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:33.380 
you can also do a flat twist will work
too

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.630 

so<00:02:34.390> how<00:02:35.380> do<00:02:35.440> they're<00:02:35.740> both<00:02:35.770> brilliant<00:02:36.190> and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
so how do they're both brilliant and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.990 
so how do they're both brilliant and
take<00:02:36.970> down<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.270> middle<00:02:41.640> I'm<00:02:42.640> going<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.850> put

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
take down the middle I'm going to put

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.870 
take down the middle I'm going to put
some<00:02:43.030> order<00:02:43.270> crude<00:02:44.050> outline<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.890> then<00:02:45.700> we'll

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
some order crude outline and then we'll

00:02:45.880 --> 00:03:11.840 
some order crude outline and then we'll
going<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:47.710> do<00:02:47.890> chalky<00:02:48.430> twists

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.820 

as<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.510> can<00:03:13.630> see<00:03:13.840> like<00:03:14.020> soon<00:03:14.230> as<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.410> put<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.710> on

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
as you can see like soon as I put it on

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
as you can see like soon as I put it on
it's<00:03:15.450> starting<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.570> find<00:03:16.960> a<00:03:17.230> little<00:03:17.260> bit<00:03:19.980> so

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
calm it through I mentioned going to

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:46.080 
calm it through I mentioned going to
section<00:03:32.140> at<00:03:32.470> all

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.790

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
you want to make them kind of chunky

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.130 
you want to make them kind of chunky
because<00:03:48.280> it's<00:03:49.269> not<00:03:49.420> going<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.720> be<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.900> finish

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
because it's not going to be the finish

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.610 
because it's not going to be the finish
