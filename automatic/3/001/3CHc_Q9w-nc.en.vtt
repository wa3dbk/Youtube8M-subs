next thing we'll do is tap the hole I've

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.560 
next thing we'll do is tap the hole I've
got<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:04.340> quarter<00:02:05.340> twenty<00:02:05.550> tap<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:08.330> we'll<00:02:09.330> run

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
got a quarter twenty tap and we'll run

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:21.050 
got a quarter twenty tap and we'll run
it<00:02:09.720> through<00:02:16.040> make<00:02:17.040> sure<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:17.430> centered<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
it through make sure it's centered the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
this is a pointed tap so it'll kind of

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:50.970 
this is a pointed tap so it'll kind of
center<00:02:26.700> itself<00:02:27.150> as<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.540> runs<00:02:27.780> through

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:13.600 

it's<00:02:51.980> through<00:02:52.370> now<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.030> we'll<00:02:53.240> back<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.510> off

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:21.280 

got<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.180> nice<00:03:14.480> thread<00:03:14.900> in<00:03:15.140> there

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.759 

and<00:03:22.150> we<00:03:23.150> could<00:03:23.390> use<00:03:23.599> it<00:03:23.780> just<00:03:23.989> like<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.290> is<00:03:24.439> but

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
and we could use it just like it is but

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.319 
and we could use it just like it is but
I'll<00:03:24.920> touch<00:03:25.189> it<00:03:25.370> up<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.610> little<00:03:25.730> bit<00:03:25.970> on<00:03:26.150> the
