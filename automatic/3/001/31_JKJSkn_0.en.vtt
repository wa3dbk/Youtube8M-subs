00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
been the most fun game mode but I think

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.490 
been the most fun game mode but I think
king<00:03:04.819> of<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.030> city<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.450> because<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.200> mode

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
king of the city is because in that mode

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.800 
king of the city is because in that mode
the<00:03:06.799> game<00:03:06.829> ends<00:03:07.280> quicker<00:03:07.549> why<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.239> this<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.540> good

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
the game ends quicker why is this a good

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.509 
the game ends quicker why is this a good
thing<00:03:09.079> because<00:03:09.409> the<00:03:09.709> overall<00:03:10.010> gameplay

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
thing because the overall gameplay

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.000 
thing because the overall gameplay
isn't<00:03:10.909> really<00:03:11.150> that<00:03:11.180> fun<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:12.049> controls<00:03:12.769> for

respectively<00:03:25.879> but<00:03:26.390> trying<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.750> get<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.079> game

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
respectively but trying to get the game

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.349 
respectively but trying to get the game
to<00:03:27.290> register<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:27.950> slam<00:03:28.310> rather<00:03:28.700> than<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:28.970> swipe

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
to register a slam rather than a swipe

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.110 
to register a slam rather than a swipe
is<00:03:29.599> tiring<00:03:29.959> I'd<00:03:30.620> say<00:03:30.799> about<00:03:30.950> 80%<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.909> time

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
is tiring I'd say about 80% of the time

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.940 
is tiring I'd say about 80% of the time
when<00:03:32.329> I<00:03:32.359> wanted<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.750> slam<00:03:33.049> something<00:03:33.409> the<00:03:33.769> game

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
when I wanted to slam something the game

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.589 
when I wanted to slam something the game
thought<00:03:34.129> I<00:03:34.190> wanted<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.670> swipe<00:03:34.970> which<00:03:35.269> became

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
thought I wanted a swipe which became

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.080 
thought I wanted a swipe which became
aggravating<00:03:36.290> very<00:03:36.560> quickly<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:37.640> that's<00:03:37.849> one

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
aggravating very quickly so that's one

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.670 
aggravating very quickly so that's one
annoyance<00:03:38.540> but<00:03:38.720> there<00:03:38.870> are<00:03:38.989> also<00:03:39.170> others

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
annoyance but there are also others

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.920 
annoyance but there are also others
which<00:03:39.920> at<00:03:40.069> first<00:03:40.099> may<00:03:40.760> seem<00:03:41.000> small<00:03:41.209> but<00:03:41.599> they

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
which at first may seem small but they

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.449 
which at first may seem small but they
add<00:03:42.079> up<00:03:42.230> quickly<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.739> just<00:03:42.980> decrease<00:03:43.280> the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
add up quickly and just decrease the

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.550 
add up quickly and just decrease the

overall fun of the game one of which is
it<00:03:45.709> can<00:03:45.739> be<00:03:45.859> difficult<00:03:46.160> in<00:03:46.609> determining<00:03:47.150> if

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
it can be difficult in determining if

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.059 
it can be difficult in determining if
you've<00:03:47.480> completely<00:03:47.959> destroyed<00:03:48.079> a<00:03:48.500> section<00:03:48.950> of

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
you've completely destroyed a section of

you've completely destroyed a section of
a<00:03:49.130> building<00:03:49.489> or<00:03:49.579> not<00:03:49.609> I<00:03:49.970> would<00:03:50.299> usually<00:03:50.569> have

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
a building or not I would usually have

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.569 
a building or not I would usually have
to<00:03:51.109> count<00:03:51.349> how<00:03:51.470> many<00:03:51.680> punches<00:03:51.919> I've<00:03:52.220> dealt<00:03:52.459> to

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
to count how many punches I've dealt to

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.699 
to count how many punches I've dealt to
each<00:03:52.609> section<00:03:53.030> I<00:03:53.389> wish<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:53.989> didn't<00:03:54.260> have<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.560> do

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
each section I wish I didn't have to do

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.650 
each section I wish I didn't have to do
this<00:03:54.889> as<00:03:55.040> often<00:03:55.340> as<00:03:55.489> I<00:03:55.519> had<00:03:55.849> I<00:03:56.090> think<00:03:56.510> my

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
this as often as I had I think my

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.150 
this as often as I had I think my
biggest<00:03:56.900> complaint<00:03:57.470> is<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.919> gameplay

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
biggest complaint is that the gameplay

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.250 
biggest complaint is that the gameplay
seems<00:03:58.609> slow<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.239> because<00:03:59.569> it<00:03:59.690> does<00:03:59.930> it

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
seems slow and because it does it

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.220 
seems slow and because it does it
decreases<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:00.889> fun<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:01.519> can<00:04:01.669> get<00:04:01.819> boring

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
decreases the fun and can get boring

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.180 
decreases the fun and can get boring
fortunately<00:04:03.230> this<00:04:03.379> doesn't<00:04:03.739> happen<00:04:03.889> all<00:04:04.160> the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
fortunately this doesn't happen all the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.430 
fortunately this doesn't happen all the
time<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.819> is<00:04:05.180> fun<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.569> destroy<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.049> buildings

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
time it is fun to destroy the buildings

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.080 
time it is fun to destroy the buildings
but<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:06.769> can<00:04:06.919> also<00:04:07.129> grab<00:04:07.430> people<00:04:07.819> from<00:04:07.970> the

graphics<00:04:54.620> look<00:04:54.770> pretty<00:04:55.010> good

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
graphics look pretty good

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.540 
graphics look pretty good
though<00:04:55.740> I'm<00:04:55.860> not<00:04:56.040> sure<00:04:56.220> if<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.430> developers

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
though I'm not sure if the developers

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.909 
though I'm not sure if the developers
are<00:04:57.120> trying<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.479> go<00:04:57.660> for<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.900> cartoony<00:04:58.470> look<00:04:58.620> or

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
are trying to go for a cartoony look or

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.740 
are trying to go for a cartoony look or
a<00:04:58.949> realistic<00:04:59.580> look<00:04:59.790> or<00:05:00.060> a<00:05:00.090> hybrid<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.660> two

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
a realistic look or a hybrid of the two

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.750 
a realistic look or a hybrid of the two
I<00:05:01.139> think<00:05:01.650> one<00:05:01.860> thing<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.130> makes<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.580> game

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
I think one thing that makes the game

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.090 
I think one thing that makes the game
unfortunately<00:05:03.540> not<00:05:03.690> as<00:05:03.870> fun<00:05:04.110> or<00:05:04.320> exciting<00:05:04.500> as

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
unfortunately not as fun or exciting as

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.400 
unfortunately not as fun or exciting as
it<00:05:05.220> could<00:05:05.430> be<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:06.000> music<00:05:06.389> it's<00:05:06.840> too<00:05:07.110> soft

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
it could be is the music it's too soft

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.870 
it could be is the music it's too soft
with<00:05:07.680> all<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.919> sound<00:05:08.130> effects<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.699> game

with all the sound effects of the game

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.060 
with all the sound effects of the game
going<00:05:09.180> on<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.600> it<00:05:09.840> seems<00:05:10.020> too<00:05:10.380> generic<00:05:10.919> and

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
going on and it seems too generic and

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:18.839 
going on and it seems too generic and
pretty<00:05:11.280> forgettable

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.830 

never<00:05:19.689> line<00:05:19.990> me<00:05:20.199> again

packed onto the disk as well

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.490 
packed onto the disk as well
I<00:05:35.400> thought<00:05:35.879> this<00:05:36.030> was<00:05:36.240> very<00:05:36.449> cool<00:05:36.719> I<00:05:36.990> didn't

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
I thought this was very cool I didn't

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.869

have<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:37.650> much<00:05:37.889> fun<00:05:38.129> with<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.400> original

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:38.879 
have that much fun with the original

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.330

however<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.479> n64<00:05:39.990> version<00:05:40.229> is<00:05:40.680> really<00:05:40.949> fun

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
however the n64 version is really fun

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.610 
however the n64 version is really fun
actually<00:05:42.210> I<00:05:42.240> think<00:05:42.389> this<00:05:42.750> one<00:05:42.930> is<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.080> best<00:05:43.349> of
