00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
how to create an indirect cooking zone

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.270 
how to create an indirect cooking zone
that<00:01:37.200> means<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> flames<00:01:37.979> aren't

that means that the flames aren't

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.039 
that means that the flames aren't
directly<00:01:38.460> hitting<00:01:38.970> whatever<00:01:39.390> protein<00:01:39.780> food

vegetable whatever you got going on but
then<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.659> causing<00:01:43.229> itself<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> nice

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
then it's causing itself to have a nice

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.300 
then it's causing itself to have a nice
gentle<00:01:45.119> ER<00:01:45.210> heat<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.680> grill<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.189> have
