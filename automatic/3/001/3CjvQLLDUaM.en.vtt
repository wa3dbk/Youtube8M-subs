the<00:04:07.110> pattern<00:04:07.829> number<00:04:07.920> from<00:04:08.250> my<00:04:08.400> wish<00:04:08.640> list<00:04:08.970> and

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
the pattern number from my wish list and

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.210 
the pattern number from my wish list and
added<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.660> my<00:04:09.870> inventory<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.070> don't

added it to my inventory so that I don't

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.130 
added it to my inventory so that I don't
repurchase<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.269> same<00:04:12.480> pattern<00:04:12.840> because

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
repurchase the same pattern because

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.590
