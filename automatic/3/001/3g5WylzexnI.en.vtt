 but do not think the sport thesis is not for the day 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.170
 finally for a lifetime 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.860

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.440

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.960
 do exercises in these from which the sport is whatever 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.920

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.150
 training 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.850
 this also tells us that it is important 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.940
 equipment is an important thing to do treatment for a suitable sneaker 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.939
 in proper clothing 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.280
 important length of any and every exercise whether cycling is 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.359
 the stretching 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.719
 It's a key per hour keeping your success 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.820

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.340
 do exercises 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.979
 so if you want to give that dried up 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.110
 and then yes but do not forget that the posture is very important 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.590
 you should avoid 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.770
 a forced friction above the 90 degrees of the knee should avoid an extension of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.070
 near zero degree force of the knee 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 that's right 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.140
 not to the bank, do not get too high and too low of tony should not 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.400
 being so far away to prevent you from doing a forced fraction with the world 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.690
 these care will suffice to maintain 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.690
 and without beans 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.169

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.680
 pleasant and makes you appreciate all the natural beauty that the city offers 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:25.919

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.989
 know if the bike pre-conditions is also interesting 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.469
 people at that time on the beach passes a person to a bicycle that 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.829
 child is very small for the size of the person or the person 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.369
 also slightly overweight 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:44.829
 in the cute little mutton do not wear a shorts of 40 hours all that goes 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.829
 play against is something better development 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:51.799
 pablo a show of leisure but also of the 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.649
 of the improvement I made all this person 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.760
 as we already mentioned the service has some varieties 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.360
 and one of them is a thorn and was created in 1995 in the United States by 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.559
 south african dionatan gutemberg 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:07.829
 better known as dione said 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.959
 to meet your training needs without being 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.089
 conditions and to get closer to his wife was 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.959
 pregnant 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.599
 develop your bike 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.749
 your own garage to be able to 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:23.899
 improve training 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:25.799
 I became more successful 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.359
 nothing in the test that he was training when he started to have 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:31.589
 a greater control 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.979
 more intensity see 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:38.419
 if this is already the cardiac monitoring a company was interested in the project 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.849
 of law started to monitor 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.549
 the intensity of the effort 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.229
 it began 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.339
 is marketed 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:49.530
 thorn tactic 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.440
 but inside the academies perfect conditions for your training 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.699
 in addition to calling those precursors of those who need someone to stimulate 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.659
 This is going to be an hour and a half. 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:08.440
 that strengthens more every day that does not give more that you learned alone 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.470
 The motivational side next to you is to focus one more side of you. 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.139
 focused on an activity 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.299
 furthermore seul 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.889
 the factor of social integration that is too big and does not 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.990
 I take motivation much better when it comes to a group with 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.559
 Are you training alone? 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:29.210
 the mayor since we are talking about cycling 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.389
 It is good to keep in mind that story that does this activity every day but 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.990
 knee problems 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.360
 usually a basis for you to affirm 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.340
 that you could bring a great loss even a small loss pro 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.909
 your knee in relation to cycling 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.740
 if it can 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.509
 Do you have any spinal pain? 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.769
 some pain over the kosovo to sit for a long time 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.409
 but in relation to June but this increases seems a lot more a minute 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:02.059
 than anything else because even if you think 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:07.169
 is bad the of the ways you recover knees operated one of the forms of you 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.659
 gaining muscle from the thigh so as not to overload the knee is precisely 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.319
 in times and work on a bicycle 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.210
 You can pedal on the street. 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.449
 on the Internet 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:19.669
 the spinning 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.729
 The important thing is to exercise 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.999
 I think now you feel like pedaling 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.699
 after this triumph on the side and gives luck
