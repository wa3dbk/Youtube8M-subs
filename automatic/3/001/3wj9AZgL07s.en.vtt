challenging<00:02:03.240> last<00:02:03.810> year<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
challenging last year and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.790 
challenging last year and
you<00:02:05.210> know<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:05.780> think<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.229> was<00:02:06.320> great<00:02:06.409> learning

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
you know I think it was great learning

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.900 
you know I think it was great learning
for<00:02:06.830> me<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:08.479> know<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.600> think<00:02:08.690> IPL<00:02:09.670> was<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.700> very

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
for me you know I think IPL was a very

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.300 
for me you know I think IPL was a very
different<00:02:11.270> space<00:02:11.390> as<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:11.900> coach<00:02:12.350> compared<00:02:13.040> to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
different space as a coach compared to

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.240 
different space as a coach compared to
international<00:02:13.760> coaching<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.350> think<00:02:16.190> I

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
international coaching and I think I

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.140 
international coaching and I think I
took<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.490> lot<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.700> learning<00:02:17.030> out<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.569> last<00:02:17.840> year
