drill<00:06:01.270> simple<00:06:01.630> to<00:06:01.690> do<00:06:01.840> I<00:06:01.870> made<00:06:02.140> a<00:06:02.169> little<00:06:02.500> jig

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
drill simple to do I made a little jig

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.170 
drill simple to do I made a little jig
that<00:06:02.980> holds<00:06:03.250> them<00:06:03.370> in<00:06:03.430> there<00:06:03.610> nice<00:06:03.820> and<00:06:03.850> secure

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
that holds them in there nice and secure

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.000 
that holds them in there nice and secure
so<00:06:05.020> I<00:06:05.080> can<00:06:05.520> work<00:06:06.520> them<00:06:06.669> around<00:06:06.850> both<00:06:07.360> edges<00:06:08.010> but

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
so I can work them around both edges but

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.340 
so I can work them around both edges but
uh<00:06:09.130> soon<00:06:09.700> as<00:06:09.730> I<00:06:09.880> can<00:06:10.030> get<00:06:10.120> that<00:06:10.300> done<00:06:10.540> I'll

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
uh soon as I can get that done I'll

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.810 
uh soon as I can get that done I'll
shoot<00:06:11.740> a<00:06:11.800> video<00:06:11.950> of<00:06:12.160> that
