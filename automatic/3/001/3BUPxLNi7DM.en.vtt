alright<00:00:00.930> guys<00:00:01.079> as<00:00:01.380> you<00:00:01.530> can<00:00:01.709> see<00:00:01.920> this<00:00:02.159> is

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
alright guys as you can see this is

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.970 
alright guys as you can see this is
called<00:00:02.820> temp<00:00:03.259> you<00:00:04.259> can<00:00:04.410> see<00:00:04.529> that<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.770> current

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
called temp you can see that the current

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.179 
called temp you can see that the current
temperatures<00:00:05.370> right<00:00:05.759> now<00:00:05.790> are<00:00:06.440> about<00:00:07.440> you

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
temperatures right now are about you

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.379 
temperatures right now are about you
know<00:00:08.630> 6866<00:00:09.630> average<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.969> this<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.150> where<00:00:12.300> it

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
know 6866 average and this is where it

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.900 
know 6866 average and this is where it
says<00:00:12.540> low<00:00:12.980> now<00:00:13.980> as<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.309> see<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.670> high

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
says low now as you can see on the high

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.420 
says low now as you can see on the high
now<00:00:15.630> then<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.049> goes<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.260> crazy<00:00:16.830> temperatures

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
now then it goes to crazy temperatures

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.109 
now then it goes to crazy temperatures
97<00:00:18.420> degrees<00:00:18.720> 90<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.260> 94<00:00:19.770> 92<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.029> on

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
97 degrees 90 to 94 92 and this is on

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.050 
97 degrees 90 to 94 92 and this is on
the<00:00:21.210> 4<00:00:21.480> cause<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.350> i7<00:00:22.920> 920<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.640> obviously

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the 4 cause on the i7 920 that obviously

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.519 
the 4 cause on the i7 920 that obviously
I<00:00:24.090> mean<00:00:24.359> come<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.080> temperature<00:00:25.470> is

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
I mean come on that temperature is

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.330 
I mean come on that temperature is
ridiculous<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:26.550> like<00:00:27.050> it's<00:00:28.050> too<00:00:28.560> much<00:00:28.590> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
ridiculous it's like it's too much to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.560 
ridiculous it's like it's too much to
too<00:00:29.670> much<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.210> if<00:00:31.050> if<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.920> starts<00:00:32.369> low<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:33.000> 60

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
too much and if if it starts low on 60

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.220 
too much and if if it starts low on 60
degrees<00:00:33.870> Celsius<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:35.190> thus<00:00:35.579> worrying<00:00:36.390> so

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
degrees Celsius then thus worrying so

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.060 
degrees Celsius then thus worrying so
yeah<00:00:37.980> I'm<00:00:38.070> recording<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.000> compare

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
yeah I'm recording this so I can compare

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.330 
yeah I'm recording this so I can compare
with<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.370> film<00:00:42.030> alright<00:00:42.420> ultra<00:00:42.989> 120<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.250> you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
with the film alright ultra 120 so you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.310 
with the film alright ultra 120 so you
can<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:44.670> currently<00:00:45.149> with<00:00:45.780> these<00:00:46.140> statistics

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
can see currently with these statistics

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.990 
can see currently with these statistics
that<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> temperature

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that you can see in the temperature

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.560 
that you can see in the temperature
readings<00:00:48.360> I'm<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> stock<00:00:49.620> fund<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.610> yeah

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
readings I'm on the stock fund so yeah

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.470 
readings I'm on the stock fund so yeah
let's<00:00:51.899> see<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.440> thermal<00:00:52.920> right<00:00:53.480> 120

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
let's see what the thermal right 120

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.279 
let's see what the thermal right 120
ultra<00:00:55.140> extreme<00:00:55.610> Wow<00:00:56.629> okay<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.050> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
ultra extreme Wow okay we have it this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.060 
ultra extreme Wow okay we have it this
is<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.710> thermal<00:00:59.129> right<00:00:59.489> Ultra<00:01:00.180> 120<00:01:01.070> CPU

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
is the thermal right Ultra 120 CPU

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.579 
is the thermal right Ultra 120 CPU
cooler<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.049> big<00:01:04.350> heat

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
cooler as you can see it's a big heat

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.480 
cooler as you can see it's a big heat
sink<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.720> buy<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.200> own<00:01:07.490> 120

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
sink and you have to buy your own 120

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.910 
sink and you have to buy your own 120
millimeter<00:01:09.090> fun<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.439> blow<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
millimeter fun so it can blow with it

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.660 
millimeter fun so it can blow with it
this<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.340> I've<00:01:11.549> got<00:01:11.760> has<00:01:12.060> LED<00:01:12.990> lights<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
this one I've got has LED lights the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.870 
this one I've got has LED lights the
corners<00:01:14.670> four<00:01:15.090> corners<00:01:15.799> as<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.520> I've

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
corners four corners as you can see I've

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.050 
corners four corners as you can see I've
applied<00:01:18.869> thermal<00:01:19.680> paste<00:01:19.979> into<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.490> beasts<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
applied thermal paste into the beasts of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.090 
applied thermal paste into the beasts of
the<00:01:21.740> heat<00:01:22.740> sink

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the heat sink

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.749 
the heat sink
unto<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.640> top<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:25.820> i7<00:01:26.820> chip<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.759> hopefully

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
unto the top of the i7 chip so hopefully

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.560 
unto the top of the i7 chip so hopefully
once<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.060> thing<00:01:30.360> starts<00:01:31.369> no<00:01:32.369> work<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.909> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
once this thing starts no work and I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.600 
once this thing starts no work and I
mean<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.079> look<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.369> highest

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
mean just look at this is the highest

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.749 
mean just look at this is the highest
thing<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.509> considerably<00:01:37.079> higher<00:01:37.430> than<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
thing it's considerably higher than the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
thing it's considerably higher than the
graphics<00:01:39.119> card<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:40.200> does<00:01:40.439> say<00:01:40.619> something

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
graphics card which does say something

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.770 
graphics card which does say something
and<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.220> fact<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.790> fitted<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.450> strongly

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and in fact it's fitted in so strongly

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.630 
and in fact it's fitted in so strongly
it<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.439> support<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.040> weight<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.490> whole

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it can support the weight of the whole

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
it can support the weight of the whole
mother<00:01:44.880> look<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.540> literally<00:01:46.110> holding<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
mother look and literally holding the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.480 
mother look and literally holding the
whole<00:01:46.829> motherboard<00:01:47.399> from<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:49.560> know<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.890> CPU

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
whole motherboard from you know the CPU

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.440 
whole motherboard from you know the CPU
and<00:01:51.329> heatsink<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:53.700> reason<00:01:54.060> why<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> have

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and heatsink and the reason why I have

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.889 
and heatsink and the reason why I have
to<00:01:54.630> strip<00:01:54.990> open<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.890> PC<00:01:56.210> was<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
to strip open the PC was the that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.749 
to strip open the PC was the that
let<00:01:58.799> me<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:59.070> show<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.460> something

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
let me just show you and do something

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.420 
let me just show you and do something
risky<00:01:59.909> here<00:02:00.290> as<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.649> see<00:02:01.860> if<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.130> put<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
risky here as you can see if I put the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.109 
risky here as you can see if I put the
camera<00:02:02.579> at<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:04.020> see<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> base<00:02:04.469> I

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
camera at this you can see the base I

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.800 
camera at this you can see the base I
had<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.270> pop<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.659> bracket<00:02:06.960> down<00:02:07.229> there<00:02:07.530> and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
had to pop that bracket down there and

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.940 
had to pop that bracket down there and
unfortunately<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.840> couldn't<00:02:10.200> do<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.649> bracket

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
unfortunately I couldn't do that bracket

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.040 
unfortunately I couldn't do that bracket
through<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> gap<00:02:12.270> which<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.750> call<00:02:12.959> the

have<00:02:14.260> deliberately<00:02:14.740> left<00:02:14.980> for<00:02:15.640> instances

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
have deliberately left for instances

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.620 
have deliberately left for instances
like<00:02:16.270> this<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:18.550> guess<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.240> guess<00:02:19.420> it's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
like this so I guess I guess it's

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.120 
like this so I guess I guess it's
because<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.290> size<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.830> motherboard

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
because the size of the motherboard

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.870 
because the size of the motherboard
under<00:02:21.819> location<00:02:22.390> which<00:02:22.660> I've<00:02:22.840> put<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.730> PSU<00:02:24.730> in

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
under location which I've put the PSU in

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.300 
under location which I've put the PSU in
there<00:02:25.720> anyway<00:02:26.020> this<00:02:26.980> has<00:02:27.160> worked

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
there anyway this has worked

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.690 
there anyway this has worked
successfully<00:02:27.930> I've<00:02:28.930> actually<00:02:29.620> found<00:02:30.040> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
successfully I've actually found the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.400 
successfully I've actually found the
main<00:02:30.970> problem<00:02:31.360> I've<00:02:31.450> found<00:02:31.750> was<00:02:31.870> this<00:02:32.020> was<00:02:32.230> the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
main problem I've found was this was the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.910 
main problem I've found was this was the
easiest<00:02:32.800> thing<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:34.090> was<00:02:34.300> these<00:02:34.920> these

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
easiest thing and it was these these

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.550 
easiest thing and it was these these
basically<00:02:36.640> fit<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.600> top<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.410> bottom

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
basically fit in the top and the bottom

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.270 
basically fit in the top and the bottom
and<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:40.060> basically<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:41.620> know<00:02:41.650> they<00:02:41.980> just

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
and you basically you know they just

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.229 
and you basically you know they just
they<00:02:42.670> hold<00:02:43.000> tight<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.630> fun<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.940> was<00:02:46.030> so

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
they hold tight the fun but it was so

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.840 
they hold tight the fun but it was so
hard<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.570> put<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.080> didn't<00:02:47.320> know<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:48.550> was

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
hard to put in and I didn't know it was

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.460 
hard to put in and I didn't know it was
just<00:02:48.940> confusing<00:02:49.120> but<00:02:49.660> anyway<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.989> must<00:02:50.170> do<00:02:50.320> that

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
just confusing but anyway I must do that

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.949 
just confusing but anyway I must do that
the<00:02:50.560> end<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.860> day<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.610> as<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.780> can<00:02:52.900> see

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
the end of the day and as you can see

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.820 
the end of the day and as you can see
these<00:02:53.350> these<00:02:54.180> are<00:02:55.180> supposed<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.709> stop<00:02:56.709> the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
these these are supposed to stop the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.900 
these these are supposed to stop the
vibration<00:02:57.010> these<00:02:57.880> little<00:02:58.120> rubber<00:02:58.330> kind<00:02:58.690> of

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
vibration these little rubber kind of

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.930 
vibration these little rubber kind of
stickers<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.690> yes<00:03:02.380> pretty<00:03:02.650> cool<00:03:02.830> so<00:03:03.459> I'm<00:03:03.819> gonna

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
stickers so yes pretty cool so I'm gonna

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.180 
stickers so yes pretty cool so I'm gonna
be<00:03:04.120> putting<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.450> buck<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.080> I'm<00:03:05.620> gonna<00:03:05.830> see

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
be putting this buck and I'm gonna see

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.020 
be putting this buck and I'm gonna see
what<00:03:06.550> temperature<00:03:07.060> readings<00:03:07.420> we<00:03:08.380> get<00:03:09.000> okay<00:03:10.000> so

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
what temperature readings we get okay so

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.620 
what temperature readings we get okay so
I've<00:03:10.480> plugged<00:03:11.260> everything<00:03:11.590> in<00:03:12.330> as<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.450> can

see here it's not my stuff anyway and
screens<00:03:18.160> are<00:03:18.549> there<00:03:19.920> bottommost

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
screens are there bottommost

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.650 
screens are there bottommost
everything's<00:03:22.090> ready<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.390> go

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
everything's ready to go

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.350 
everything's ready to go
I've<00:03:23.440> not<00:03:23.680> booted<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.579> can<00:03:24.790> you

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
I've not booted this you can you

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.000 
I've not booted this you can you
know<00:03:25.480> see<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:26.049> size<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.470> this<00:03:26.590> thing<00:03:26.650> look

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
know see the size of this thing look

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.080 
know see the size of this thing look
it's<00:03:27.670> literally<00:03:28.360> just<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:30.430> know<00:03:30.519> sticking<00:03:30.880> up

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
it's literally just you know sticking up

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.090 
it's literally just you know sticking up
I<00:03:31.239> mean<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.600> was<00:03:31.840> worried<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.530> case<00:03:32.890> will

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
I mean I was worried that the case will

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.300 
I mean I was worried that the case will
nicely<00:03:33.250> be<00:03:33.549> able<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.820> close<00:03:34.110> but<00:03:35.110> just<00:03:36.040> look<00:03:36.190> at

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
nicely be able to close but just look at

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.020 
nicely be able to close but just look at
the<00:03:36.370> size<00:03:36.579> of<00:03:36.700> this<00:03:36.760> thing

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
the size of this thing

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.830 
the size of this thing
oh<00:03:37.209> by<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.019> way<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.350> fun<00:03:38.620> has<00:03:38.860> LEDs<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:40.090> it

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
oh by the way the fun has LEDs so it

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.160 
oh by the way the fun has LEDs so it
should<00:03:41.280> light<00:03:42.280> up<00:03:42.540> that's<00:03:43.540> for<00:03:43.750> fire<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.109> out

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
should light up that's for fire it out

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.650 
should light up that's for fire it out
but<00:03:45.010> something<00:03:45.760> good<00:03:46.030> about<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.299> Asus

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
but something good about the Asus

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.630 
but something good about the Asus
Rampage<00:03:47.109> is<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:48.010> fact<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.280> there's<00:03:48.549> an

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
Rampage is the fact that there's an

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.210 
Rampage is the fact that there's an

press<00:04:15.250> it

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.860 

there<00:04:19.120> we<00:04:19.269> go

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
there we go

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.270 
there we go
things<00:04:21.470> fired<00:04:21.829> up

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.170 

we<00:04:24.850> can<00:04:25.030> see<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.360> bright<00:04:25.720> LEDs

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.680 

all<00:04:30.690> right<00:04:30.860> but<00:04:31.860> funds<00:04:32.490> working<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.360> funds

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
all right but funds working that funds

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.939 
all right but funds working that funds
working<00:04:35.060> so<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.419> think<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:37.380> can<00:04:37.500> kind<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.770> see

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
working so I think you can kind of see

with anything it was just block thought
there'd<00:06:02.490> be<00:06:02.580> something<00:06:02.759> up<00:06:03.979> luckily<00:06:04.979> it's

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
there'd be something up luckily it's

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.340 
there'd be something up luckily it's
just<00:06:06.539> the<00:06:06.810> graphics

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.580 

so<00:06:10.920> it's<00:06:11.100> got<00:06:11.250> power<00:06:11.900> everything's<00:06:12.900> up<00:06:13.110> this

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
so it's got power everything's up this

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:20.040 
so it's got power everything's up this
is<00:06:13.800> blue<00:06:14.360> this<00:06:15.360> is<00:06:15.540> red

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.659 

and<00:06:20.370> we<00:06:21.370> have<00:06:21.520> booted<00:06:23.099> for<00:06:24.099> the<00:06:24.160> first<00:06:24.400> time

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
and we have booted for the first time

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:30.960 
and we have booted for the first time
with<00:06:25.240> the<00:06:25.449> thermal<00:06:25.870> right<00:06:26.229> Ultra<00:06:27.180> 120<00:06:29.789> the<00:06:30.789> fun

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
with the thermal right Ultra 120 the fun

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.480 
with the thermal right Ultra 120 the fun
that<00:06:31.090> I<00:06:31.150> bought<00:06:31.360> is<00:06:31.599> a<00:06:31.629> 12<00:06:32.050> volt<00:06:33.300> 1700<00:06:34.300> rpm<00:06:34.449> I

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
that I bought is a 12 volt 1700 rpm I

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.879 
that I bought is a 12 volt 1700 rpm I
think<00:06:36.750> the<00:06:37.750> change<00:06:37.990> in<00:06:38.110> CP<00:06:38.440> founds<00:06:38.770> me

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
think the change in CP founds me

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.770 
think the change in CP founds me
successful<00:06:39.400> check<00:06:40.120> the<00:06:40.210> temperatures<00:06:40.599> now

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.279 

now<00:06:43.780> the<00:06:43.840> lows<00:06:44.349> 30s<00:06:45.250> the<00:06:46.090> highs<00:06:46.330> 41<00:06:46.960> degrees

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289 
now the lows 30s the highs 41 degrees

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:48.839 
now the lows 30s the highs 41 degrees
Celsius<00:06:47.740> I<00:06:47.979> don't<00:06:48.310> know<00:06:48.370> about<00:06:48.460> you<00:06:48.639> but<00:06:48.789> I

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 
think this is a lot better than the

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:53.100 
think this is a lot better than the
stock<00:06:50.560> fun<00:06:51.360> so<00:06:52.360> yeah<00:06:52.569> I<00:06:52.720> hope<00:06:52.840> you've<00:06:53.050> enjoyed

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
the video you know it was really sticky

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.570 
the video you know it was really sticky
on<00:06:55.810> and<00:06:55.990> off<00:06:56.110> and<00:06:56.650> the<00:06:56.889> reason<00:06:57.130> for<00:06:57.159> that<00:06:57.310> is<00:06:57.430> is

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
on and off and the reason for that is is

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.430 
on and off and the reason for that is is
because<00:06:57.659> usually<00:06:58.659> I've<00:06:58.960> got<00:06:59.139> a<00:06:59.169> little

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
because usually I've got a little

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.620 
because usually I've got a little
bleeder<00:06:59.620> with<00:06:59.830> me<00:06:59.979> doing<00:07:00.310> the<00:07:00.490> recording<00:07:00.909> but

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
bleeder with me doing the recording but
