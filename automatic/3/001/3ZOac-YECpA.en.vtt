polishing<00:00:59.780> compound<00:01:00.460> with<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.489> polishing

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
polishing compound with a polishing

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.600 
polishing compound with a polishing
wheel<00:01:02.750> which<00:01:03.110> is<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.290> coarse<00:01:03.649> wheel<00:01:03.980> for

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
wheel which is a coarse wheel for

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.789 
wheel which is a coarse wheel for
polishing<00:01:05.479> all<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.810> heavy<00:01:06.020> Nick's<00:01:06.380> out<00:01:06.619> and

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
polishing all the heavy Nick's out and

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
he'll go to a lighter grade on a

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.239 
he'll go to a lighter grade on a
different<00:01:10.939> wheel<00:01:11.179> okay<00:01:11.810> over<00:01:12.139> here<00:01:12.469> we'll<00:01:13.069> go

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:13.249 
different wheel okay over here we'll go

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:15.999 
different wheel okay over here we'll go
to<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.719> white<00:01:14.719> compound<00:01:15.259> we<00:01:15.530> use<00:01:15.649> a<00:01:15.679> white

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
to a white compound we use a white

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.129 
to a white compound we use a white
compound<00:01:16.549> on<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:16.880> wheel<00:01:17.149> where's<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:17.990> lake

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:18.139 
compound on that wheel where's the lake

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:21.069 
compound on that wheel where's the lake
up<00:01:18.319> right<00:01:19.189> here<00:01:19.340> it's<00:01:19.909> a<00:01:20.060> white<00:01:20.299> here

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
up right here it's a white here

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.249 
up right here it's a white here
well<00:01:21.380> white<00:01:21.619> compound<00:01:22.130> okay<00:01:22.759> then<00:01:23.719> we<00:01:23.869> your

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
well white compound okay then we your

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.260 
well white compound okay then we your
date<00:01:24.439> yak<00:01:24.649> should<00:01:24.859> go<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.039> next<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.850> then<00:01:25.969> from

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
date yak should go to next and then from

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.149 
date yak should go to next and then from
there<00:01:26.509> once<00:01:26.749> it's<00:01:26.959> been<00:01:27.109> done<00:01:27.350> then<00:01:27.799> you<00:01:27.920> go<00:01:28.100> to

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
there once it's been done then you go to

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.349 
there once it's been done then you go to
your<00:01:28.429> grain<00:01:28.899> grain<00:01:29.899> drop-down<00:01:30.880> okay<00:01:31.880> that's<00:01:32.299> a

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
your grain grain drop-down okay that's a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.959 
your grain grain drop-down okay that's a
Sarah<00:01:32.569> green<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.709> then<00:01:33.859> should<00:01:34.130> be<00:01:34.249> done<00:01:34.459> okay

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
Sarah green and then should be done okay

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.419 
Sarah green and then should be done okay
so<00:01:35.209> we<00:01:35.450> go<00:01:35.569> for<00:01:35.779> black<00:01:36.049> to<00:01:36.499> white<00:01:36.649> to<00:01:36.709> gray

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
so we go for black to white to gray

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.519 
so we go for black to white to gray
right<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:37.939> that<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.659> wheels<00:01:38.899> change<00:01:39.289> at<00:01:39.439> the

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:39.529 
right and that the wheels change at the

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:42.639 
right and that the wheels change at the
same<00:01:39.709> yes<00:01:39.889> right<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:40.759> become<00:01:41.170> softer<00:01:42.170> softer

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
same yes right you become softer softer

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.160 
same yes right you become softer softer
okay<00:01:43.189> it's<00:01:43.369> they're<00:01:43.549> coarser<00:01:43.999> wheel<00:01:44.209> this<00:01:44.929> is

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
okay it's they're coarser wheel this is

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.959 
okay it's they're coarser wheel this is
finer<00:01:45.529> and<00:01:45.920> there's<00:01:46.249> our<00:01:46.340> number<00:01:46.579> that's

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
finer and there's our number that's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:47.949 
finer and there's our number that's
actually<00:01:47.329> on<00:01:47.420> this<00:01:47.539> one

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
actually on this one

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.980 
actually on this one
no<00:01:48.200> okay<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:48.889> it's<00:01:49.130> just<00:01:49.189> course<00:01:49.810> that's<00:01:50.810> what

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
no okay so it's just course that's what

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.629 
no okay so it's just course that's what
of<00:01:51.079> course<00:01:51.259> we<00:01:51.439> looks<00:01:51.679> like<00:01:51.859> we're<00:01:52.609> just

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
of course we looks like we're just

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:53.739 
of course we looks like we're just
trying<00:01:52.909> to<00:01:52.939> give<00:01:53.090> them<00:01:53.119> instruction<00:01:53.630> on<00:01:53.719> what

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
trying to give them instruction on what

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:54.969 
trying to give them instruction on what
he<00:01:54.170> needs<00:01:54.349> to<00:01:54.409> do<00:01:54.529> because<00:01:54.649> he's<00:01:54.829> going<00:01:54.920> to

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
he needs to do because he's going to

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.969 
he needs to do because he's going to
start<00:01:55.189> doing<00:01:55.310> more<00:01:55.579> of<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.899> and<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.380> then

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
start doing more of this and and then

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.069 
start doing more of this and and then
this<00:01:58.099> is<00:01:58.249> the<00:01:58.369> medium<00:01:58.670> wheel<00:01:58.880> with<00:01:59.749> the<00:01:59.779> white

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
this is the medium wheel with the white

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:00.960 
this is the medium wheel with the white
compound

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
compound

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.220

right<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.500> over<00:02:02.710> here<00:02:02.890> we've<00:02:03.040> got<00:02:04.050> this<00:02:05.050> is

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
right and over here we've got this is

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.950 
right and over here we've got this is
the<00:02:05.380> softer<00:02:05.920> softer<00:02:06.400> softer<00:02:06.970> with<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.720> green

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
the softer softer softer with the green

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.810 
the softer softer softer with the green
cop-out<00:02:08.500> right<00:02:08.740> there<00:02:08.950> that's<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.430> actual

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
cop-out right there that's the actual

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.210 
cop-out right there that's the actual
coin<00:02:10.060> Fournier<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.380> compounds<00:02:11.890> come<00:02:12.070> in

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
coin Fournier and the compounds come in

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.970 
coin Fournier and the compounds come in
this<00:02:12.370> kind<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:13.200> block<00:02:14.200> form<00:02:14.560> right<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.740> here's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
this kind of block form right and here's

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.650 
this kind of block form right and here's
the<00:02:18.160> tree<00:02:18.520> okay<00:02:21.060> okay<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.180> how<00:02:22.300> do<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.480> apply

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
the tree okay okay and how do you apply

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.910 
the tree okay okay and how do you apply
them<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.020> wheel<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.260> just<00:02:23.440> brought<00:02:23.740> up

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
them to the wheel you just brought up

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.830 
them to the wheel you just brought up
again<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:24.190> if<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.490> do<00:02:24.670> is<00:02:24.820> it<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.210> wheel<00:02:25.540> how

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
again so if you do is it on a wheel how

00:02:25.840 --> 00:03:36.309 
again so if you do is it on a wheel how
do<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.050> private<00:02:26.470> it

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:04:04.730 

you

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:19.979 

Shh

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.990 

is<00:04:20.410> what<00:04:20.650> they<00:04:20.769> look<00:04:20.949> like<00:04:20.979> just<00:04:21.340> as<00:04:21.489> he<00:04:21.669> starts

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
is what they look like just as he starts

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.080 
is what they look like just as he starts
into<00:04:22.330> number<00:04:23.289> two<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:24.460> already<00:04:24.669> move<00:04:24.849> that

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
into number two to already move that

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.940 
into number two to already move that
much<00:04:25.330> in<00:04:25.539> terms<00:04:25.690> of<00:04:25.900> change<00:04:26.550> so<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:27.639> can<00:04:27.759> see
