00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.500
 Do you speak marombas? Connect with you already. 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.470
 saw the fan page that I divulged there myself 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.560
 I'm going to compete again in jandira now. 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.039
 is a city means within the great 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.610
 SÃ£o Paulo , November 17 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.710
 preparation was very sudden there 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.560
 I decided a little before the end of 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.730
 October the team plus or minus one month only 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.700
 of preparation 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.739
 I've been waiting a week and a half already 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.969
 played in the final stretch, we'll see the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.860
 result that will give 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.170
 I think it's going to be nice that I 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.320
 I'm using is and how are you doing? 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.960
 europe fasting 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.870
 Good, I'll make a video of a subject. 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.480
 Nice because a lot of people argue this. 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.320
 that is not possible but it is possible that I 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.770
 I'll talk 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.500
 within the right measures to have a 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.479
 lean mass gain and at the same time 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.340
 a fat loss how would that be with 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.979
 a lot of people say that the first one you have 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.729
 to diet to earn after 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.100
 losing would be an off and the corner but not 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.350
 necessarily a basic rule this is 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.299
 a good thing is for a 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.549
 bodybuilder who, for example, has to 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.069
 make a very big gain a call 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.939
 for after a very fat kiss 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:32.939
 This is the big mass hypothesis. 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.119
 for example a normal person who is not 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.119
 futuristic and she already has a size bearing 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.509
 with more or less athletic or do not have 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.240
 too much body fat and want to start 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.450
 have a development it can yes 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.319
 do a diet and we have two same time 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.950
 just put a diet is in her diet 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:58.560
 the right foods and with my 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.109
 right arguments at the right time 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.189
 the carbohydrates property would be good 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:09.840
 sweet potato oats brown rice banana 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.800
 the proteins the egg chicken fish pedro 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.740
 there 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.980
 that person alone shall replace the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.230
 bad food for the good things of the day 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.360
 her day she will already have a gain of 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.390
 mass and fat loss 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.660
 I'm late with the bad fats from the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.490
 food she ate and eaten 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.050
 good calories good foods for 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.400
 start eating then for one person 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.300
 normal so much that already enough trains 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.270
 time before dedicating myself to the 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.600
 Futurism I came from a diet in four 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.450
 years that I had never done a kant 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.830
 I just kept a book and clean as the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.440
 certain foods 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.780
 I had an exceptional gain of mass 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.210
 fat and a minimum fat so much that the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.270
 My BF is no more, and fat. 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.570
 the fat percentage never exceeded 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:08.070
 15 percent that is the amount 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.020
 beyond the limit for a person reaches the 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.730
 From this it starts to get a bit 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.700
 boring to lose 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.650
 so guys this is all there is to the tip that 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.600
 If you want me to fool myself but the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.150
 brand at the same time fat loss 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.840
 make a diet with the correct foods 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.360
 and not much is followed the calories of the day 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.390
 the day for example if you are a person 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.080
 which has a caloric loop per day of three 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.110
 thousand is 3 thousand calories you want 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.020
 gain lean mass and lose fat you 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.330
 It has to stay more or less but machine 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.030
 in the calorie range beyond three thousand 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.870
 12 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.790
 there are 3,500 as perfect foods because 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.520
 will have at the same time an average of one 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.590
 call and will have how to take a bit of 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.780
 Fat even you stay a little bit 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.600
 above the calories because of 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.900
 good properties of food and your 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.060
 correct time in academia understand and 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.040
 logic has its implementation as 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.520

 pre-workout push things is also 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:25.900
 during that day avoid the bullshit is the 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.040
 fats during the week try to follow 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.080
 from Monday to Friday governed without trying 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.930
 I could not climb a little thing to the 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.950

 I now in the case in accounts I can not 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.140
 To do this is a totally 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.030
 followed to the right 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.630
 but when we take off that we took from 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.330
 type under more calories without 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.490
 worry as a future competition I 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.180
