secret basically a slight east there
elite<00:00:59.670> membership<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.690> think<00:01:00.809> within<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289

doing the old companion leaders then
that's<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.570> basically<00:04:41.930> home<00:04:42.920> you<00:04:43.190> can't

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
that's it basically home you can't

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.460 
that's it basically home you can't
become<00:04:43.490> well<00:04:43.790> again<00:04:44.000> I'm<00:04:44.930> not<00:04:45.110> sure<00:04:45.260> what<00:04:45.410> the

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
become well again I'm not sure what the

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.810 
become well again I'm not sure what the
stipulations<00:04:45.980> are<00:04:46.100> regarding<00:04:46.520> whether<00:04:46.670> you

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
stipulations are regarding whether you

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.060 
stipulations are regarding whether you
get<00:04:46.970> bit<00:04:47.570> when<00:04:47.960> you<00:04:48.050> get<00:04:48.140> bit<00:04:48.350> in<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.590> wild<00:04:48.890> by

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
get bit when you get bit in the wild by

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.890 
get bit when you get bit in the wild by
werewolf<00:04:49.430> I<00:04:49.700> think<00:04:49.940> once<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.180> cures<00:04:50.510> set<00:04:50.780> you

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
werewolf I think once the cures set you

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.980 
werewolf I think once the cures set you
can<00:04:51.080> revert<00:04:51.740> back<00:04:51.890> so<00:04:52.640> there's<00:04:53.450> a<00:04:53.540> ring<00:04:53.750> at

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
can revert back so there's a ring at

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.510 
can revert back so there's a ring at
Brandt<00:04:54.260> that<00:04:54.380> assertions<00:04:54.950> ring<00:04:55.160> that'll

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
Brandt that assertions ring that'll

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.220 
Brandt that assertions ring that'll
actually<00:04:55.610> become<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.390> werewolf<00:04:56.870> on<00:04:57.140> the

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
actually become a werewolf on the

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.440 
actually become a werewolf on the
middlee<00:04:57.620> so<00:04:58.070> if<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:58.250> do<00:04:58.340> want<00:04:58.550> to<00:04:58.640> think<00:04:59.270> even

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
middlee so if you do want to think even

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.700 
middlee so if you do want to think even
if<00:04:59.570> you<00:04:59.690> think<00:04:59.840> you<00:04:59.930> can<00:05:00.140> extinguish<00:05:00.530> the

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
if you think you can extinguish the

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.440 
if you think you can extinguish the
curse<00:05:01.070> and<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:01.520> can<00:05:01.669> still<00:05:01.820> use<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.150> ring<00:05:02.300> to

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
curse and you can still use the ring to

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.330 
curse and you can still use the ring to
become<00:05:02.690> wealth<00:05:02.900> so<00:05:03.590> basically<00:05:04.040> what<00:05:04.220> I<00:05:04.280> would

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
become wealth so basically what I would

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.360 
become wealth so basically what I would
do<00:05:04.550> is<00:05:04.700> get<00:05:05.360> all<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.530> athletic<00:05:06.530> artifacts<00:05:07.130> and

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
do is get all the athletic artifacts and

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.890 
do is get all the athletic artifacts and
then<00:05:07.490> keep<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:07.940> glamorous<00:05:08.270> head<00:05:08.510> like<00:05:08.660> I<00:05:08.690> said

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
then keep the glamorous head like I said

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.390 
then keep the glamorous head like I said
and<00:05:09.080> then<00:05:09.169> if<00:05:09.260> you<00:05:09.350> do<00:05:09.500> want<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:10.240> get<00:05:11.980> ready<00:05:12.980> so

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
and then if you do want to get ready so

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.980 
and then if you do want to get ready so
