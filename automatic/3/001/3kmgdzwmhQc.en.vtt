00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.889
 has Russia to refuse the 90 tank 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.930
 and look at the German model 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.029
 leopard some russian generals 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.310
 consider that German armored vehicles 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.189
 They are higher quality and more reliable 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.550
 however experts differ from that 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.550
 opinion 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.820
 in Saudi Arabia when traveling a 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.579
 1500 kilometers of desert 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.680
 the abrahams the leopard and the t90 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.930
 they proved their strength the victory won 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.550
 the t90 in extreme conditions of 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.710
 accumulations of sand and high 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.410
 temperatures and then during practices 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.829
 of shooting the Russian war tank highlighted 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.440
 for its viability the t90 and the leopard 2 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.359
 6 have never met in combat 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.489
 open but experts simulated such 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.260
 situation with mathematical methods it 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.300
 evaluated the results of an assumption 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.460
 confrontation between 10 German tanks 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.710
 and 10 Russian armored vehicles on the ground 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.350
 cleared according to the data obtained 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.870
 the leopard would not get close to the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.940
 t 90 not even at shooting distance 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.190
 the Russian model has a system of 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.900
 guided weaponry your rockets are capable 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.390
 to reach the opponent to a 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 distance of up to 5 kilometers while 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.700
 what 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.410
 the shooting distance of the German tank 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.970
 It's only two and a half kilometers 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.520
 in a head-to-head combat 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.040
 we are on the surface we advance some 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.930
 the attack begins against the others but 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.260
 as they approach a distance of 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.410
 shot we already finished with 60% of 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.200
 their cars without affecting those of 90 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.660
 in addition the German leopard costs 340 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.780
 million rubles that is 4 times and 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.850
 average more expensive than the t90 to spend the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.650
 same sum russia can acquire four 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.600
 national armored vehicles or a tank 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.720
 foreign but being the correlation in 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.479
 combat from 1 to 4 the leopard does not have 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.320
 no chance to win over 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.320
 of 90
