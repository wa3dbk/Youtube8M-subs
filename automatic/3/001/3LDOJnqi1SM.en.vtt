hair<00:00:15.139> tutorials<00:00:15.590> in<00:00:15.709> a<00:00:15.770> while<00:00:15.920> so<00:00:16.520> I<00:00:16.940> thought

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
hair tutorials in a while so I thought

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.090 
hair tutorials in a while so I thought
this<00:00:17.420> would<00:00:17.660> be<00:00:17.690> kind<00:00:17.780> of<00:00:17.990> cool<00:00:18.170> it's<00:00:18.740> really

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
this would be kind of cool it's really

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.010 
this would be kind of cool it's really
pretty<00:00:19.369> and<00:00:19.640> great<00:00:20.180> for<00:00:20.390> like<00:00:20.540> a<00:00:20.630> night<00:00:20.810> out<00:00:20.990> or

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
pretty and great for like a night out or

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.300 
pretty and great for like a night out or
something<00:00:21.680> like<00:00:21.800> that

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
something like that

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.890 
something like that
I<00:00:22.340> already<00:00:22.850> fought<00:00:23.150> in<00:00:23.300> my<00:00:23.420> hair<00:00:23.630> today

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
I already fought in my hair today

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.330 
I already fought in my hair today
because<00:00:24.110> I<00:00:24.200> think<00:00:24.260> it<00:00:24.500> works<00:00:24.710> best<00:00:25.040> with

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
because I think it works best with

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.180 
because I think it works best with
either<00:00:26.240> flat<00:00:26.750> or<00:00:26.780> I<00:00:27.110> guess<00:00:27.470> curly<00:00:27.890> hair<00:00:28.040> would

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
either flat or I guess curly hair would

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.520 
either flat or I guess curly hair would
look<00:00:28.370> cute<00:00:28.550> too<00:00:28.820> but<00:00:29.450> definitely<00:00:30.260> not<00:00:30.350> my

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
look cute too but definitely not my

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.010 
look cute too but definitely not my
normal<00:00:30.740> poofy<00:00:31.280> hair<00:00:31.310> I<00:00:31.640> also<00:00:32.119> already<00:00:32.419> parted

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
normal poofy hair I also already parted

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.900 
normal poofy hair I also already parted
my<00:00:33.200> hair<00:00:33.230> right<00:00:33.559> here<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.010> side<00:00:34.219> it's<00:00:34.730> not

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
my hair right here to the side it's not

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.250 
my hair right here to the side it's not
a<00:00:34.940> super<00:00:35.300> straight<00:00:35.539> part<00:00:35.780> you<00:00:35.960> can<00:00:36.109> make<00:00:36.230> a

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
a super straight part you can make a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.450 
a super straight part you can make a
straighter<00:00:37.159> or<00:00:37.579> not<00:00:38.109> it's<00:00:39.109> your<00:00:39.320> choice<00:00:39.559> so

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
straighter or not it's your choice so

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.970 
straighter or not it's your choice so
basically<00:00:40.820> what<00:00:41.120> a<00:00:41.149> lace<00:00:41.420> braid<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:42.170> is<00:00:42.469> it's

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
basically what a lace braid is is it's

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.059 
basically what a lace braid is is it's
um<00:00:43.219> a<00:00:43.730> French<00:00:44.659> braid<00:00:44.960> but<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.379> only<00:00:45.559> take<00:00:45.859> hair

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:46.069 
um a French braid but you only take hair

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:48.520 
um a French braid but you only take hair
from<00:00:46.280> one<00:00:46.579> side<00:00:46.879> which<00:00:47.420> would<00:00:47.600> be<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:47.870> top<00:00:48.079> and

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
from one side which would be the top and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.309 
from one side which would be the top and
so<00:00:49.339> that's<00:00:50.210> what<00:00:50.690> we're<00:00:50.809> gonna<00:00:50.899> do<00:00:51.140> today

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
so that's what we're gonna do today

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:53.529 
so that's what we're gonna do today
except<00:00:51.949> we're<00:00:52.129> gonna<00:00:52.219> make<00:00:52.429> it<00:00:52.579> Dutch<00:00:52.850> so

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
except we're gonna make it Dutch so

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.939 
except we're gonna make it Dutch so
instead<00:00:53.989> of<00:00:54.079> doing<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.350> French<00:00:54.559> braid<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:54.859> do

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
instead of doing the French braid you do

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.290 
instead of doing the French braid you do
a<00:00:54.979> Dutch<00:00:55.249> braid<00:00:55.460> which<00:00:55.729> is<00:00:55.879> also<00:00:56.239> an

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
a Dutch braid which is also an

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.209 
a Dutch braid which is also an
inside-out<00:00:56.749> braid<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.440> um<00:00:59.019> so<00:01:00.019> basically<00:01:00.319> if

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
inside-out braid and um so basically if

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.660 
inside-out braid and um so basically if
that<00:01:02.120> makes<00:01:02.359> sense<00:01:02.479> here<00:01:03.019> I'll<00:01:03.170> shut<00:01:03.469> you<00:01:03.670> so

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
that makes sense here I'll shut you so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.010 
that makes sense here I'll shut you so
you're<00:01:04.790> just<00:01:04.879> gonna<00:01:05.000> start<00:01:05.299> with<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.510> section

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
you're just gonna start with a section

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.350 
you're just gonna start with a section
right<00:01:06.320> about<00:01:06.740> here<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.900> split<00:01:08.900> it<00:01:09.020> into<00:01:09.140> three

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
right about here and split it into three

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.640 
right about here and split it into three
sections<00:01:11.360> like<00:01:12.050> this<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.960> normally<00:01:15.440> when<00:01:15.530> you

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
sections like this and normally when you

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.370 
sections like this and normally when you
do<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:15.770> French<00:01:16.070> braid<00:01:16.310> you'd<00:01:16.490> go<00:01:16.670> inwards<00:01:17.540> but

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
do a French braid you'd go inwards but

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.630 
do a French braid you'd go inwards but
instead<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.830> that<00:01:19.010> we're<00:01:19.280> gonna<00:01:19.370> go<00:01:19.990> outwards

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
instead of that we're gonna go outwards

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.580 
instead of that we're gonna go outwards
if<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:22.850> makes<00:01:23.060> any<00:01:23.180> sense<00:01:23.480> and<00:01:23.870> so<00:01:24.470> you're

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
if that makes any sense and so you're

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.420 
if that makes any sense and so you're
gonna<00:01:24.650> braid<00:01:25.270> like<00:01:26.270> this<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.950> when<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.190> take

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
gonna braid like this and when you take

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.310 
gonna braid like this and when you take
hair<00:01:28.790> you're<00:01:29.300> just<00:01:29.420> gonna<00:01:29.540> take<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:29.870> from<00:01:30.140> the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
hair you're just gonna take it from the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.380 
hair you're just gonna take it from the
top

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
top

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.180 
top

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.920 
you take it right there from the top
braid<00:01:39.710> it<00:01:39.890> in<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.480> normally<00:01:41.480> you<00:01:41.600> take<00:01:41.750> here

from<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.170> bottom<00:01:42.440> but<00:01:42.560> you're<00:01:42.680> gonna<00:01:42.800> skip

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
from the bottom but you're gonna skip

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.480 
from the bottom but you're gonna skip
that<00:01:43.340> right<00:01:43.520> now<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:46.960> take<00:01:48.220> more<00:01:49.220> hair<00:01:49.460> from

the top and you're going to end the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.360 
the top and you're going to end the
beginnings<00:01:52.700> pull<00:01:53.240> tight<00:01:53.710> but<00:01:54.710> when<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.070> come

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
beginnings pull tight but when you come

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.620 
beginnings pull tight but when you come

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
around the other side

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.180 
around the other side
you're<00:01:56.810> gonna<00:01:56.900> want<00:01:57.140> just<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.650> get<00:01:57.770> looser<00:01:58.100> and
