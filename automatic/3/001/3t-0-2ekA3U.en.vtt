00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
because once you pick it up you don't

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.090 
because once you pick it up you don't
want<00:00:40.460> it<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.790> roll<00:00:41.000> away<00:00:41.300> on<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:42.010> before<00:00:43.010> and

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
you pick the motorcycle off if it's

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.209 
you pick the motorcycle off if it's
falling<00:00:44.780> on<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.050> right<00:00:45.320> side<00:00:45.590> you're<00:00:46.070> going

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
falling on the right side you're going

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.069 
falling on the right side you're going
to<00:00:46.280> come<00:00:46.460> around<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:46.969> offside<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.690> extend

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
to come around to the offside and extend

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.840 
to come around to the offside and extend
your<00:00:48.170> side<00:00:48.469> stance<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.100> that<00:00:49.250> when<00:00:49.430> you<00:00:49.579> get<00:00:49.730> it

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
your side stance so that when you get it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.240 
your side stance so that when you get it
upright<00:00:50.360> it'll<00:00:50.899> just<00:00:50.930> gently<00:00:51.469> fall<00:00:51.739> onto<00:00:52.070> the

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
upright it'll just gently fall onto the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.520 
upright it'll just gently fall onto the
side<00:00:52.550> stance<00:00:52.879> now<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:53.540> helps<00:00:53.840> a<00:00:53.930> lot<00:00:54.079> if<00:00:54.320> you've

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
side stance now it helps a lot if you've

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.770 
side stance now it helps a lot if you've
got<00:00:54.770> engine<00:00:55.039> guards<00:00:55.610> on<00:00:55.760> your<00:00:56.480> motorcycle

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
got engine guards on your motorcycle

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.930 
got engine guards on your motorcycle
because<00:00:57.350> not<00:00:57.649> only<00:00:57.680> does<00:00:58.100> this<00:00:58.219> protect<00:00:58.670> your

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
because not only does this protect your

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.029 
because not only does this protect your
leg<00:00:59.180> if<00:00:59.420> when<00:00:59.690> you<00:00:59.809> drop<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.050> bike<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.620> all

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
leg if when you drop the bike and all

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.380 
leg if when you drop the bike and all
the<00:01:01.160> parts<00:01:01.460> that<00:01:01.550> stick<00:01:01.850> out<00:01:01.969> like<00:01:02.030> your

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
the parts that stick out like your

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.209 
the parts that stick out like your
mirror<00:01:02.660> is<00:01:02.809> grub's<00:01:03.050> saddlebags<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:03.860> Glaus

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.219 
mirror is grub's saddlebags and Glaus

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.389 
mirror is grub's saddlebags and Glaus
but<00:01:04.909> also<00:01:05.059> once<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.750> bike<00:01:05.899> fall<00:01:06.259> it<00:01:06.560> doesn't

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
but also once the bike fall it doesn't

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.039 
but also once the bike fall it doesn't
fall<00:01:07.579> all<00:01:07.819> the<00:01:07.850> way<00:01:07.999> down<00:01:08.119> on<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.509> ground<00:01:08.600> and

fall all the way down on the ground and

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.410 
fall all the way down on the ground and
it's<00:01:09.200> much<00:01:09.409> easier<00:01:09.439> to<00:01:09.950> pick<00:01:10.249> up<00:01:10.490> when<00:01:11.209> you<00:01:11.299> go

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420
