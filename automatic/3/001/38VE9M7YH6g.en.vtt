00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
mud down in the muzzle yeah sometimes I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.900 
mud down in the muzzle yeah sometimes I
just<00:00:46.920> don't<00:00:47.100> realize<00:00:47.399> they<00:00:47.550> might<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.820> that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
just don't realize they might have that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.340 
just don't realize they might have that
mud<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.239> there<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.600> obstruction<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.230> we're

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
mud in there that obstruction so we're

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
mud in there that obstruction so we're
gonna<00:00:49.440> take<00:00:49.739> try<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:50.730> evenly<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.120> possible

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
gonna take try it as evenly as possible

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.650 
gonna take try it as evenly as possible
take<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.110> mud<00:00:52.410> put<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.129> each<00:00:53.280> gun<00:00:53.660> in

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
take this mud put it in each gun in

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.180 
take this mud put it in each gun in
increments<00:00:54.930> make<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.680> larger<00:00:55.920> each

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
increments make it a little larger each

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.650 
increments make it a little larger each
time<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.640> much<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.090> take<00:00:57.239> four<00:00:57.539> they

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
time so much they can take four they

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.170 
time so much they can take four they
probably<00:00:58.469> can't<00:00:58.710> fire<00:00:58.920> any<00:00:59.129> more<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.940> happens

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
probably can't fire any more it happens

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.649 
probably can't fire any more it happens
so<00:01:00.750> we're<00:01:00.870> gonna<00:01:00.989> make<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.350> happen<00:01:02.780> Cole<00:01:05.659> Cole

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
so we're gonna make it happen Cole Cole

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.149

so<00:04:29.040> that's<00:04:29.190> not<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.430> whole<00:04:29.640> lot<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:29.820> mud<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.240> could

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
so that's not a whole lot of mud I could

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.970 
so that's not a whole lot of mud I could
see<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.960> momentum<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.680> shotgun

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
see that the momentum of a shotgun

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.760 
see that the momentum of a shotgun
falling<00:04:32.670> into<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.690> mud<00:04:33.870> out<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.140> boat<00:04:34.380> would

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
falling into the mud out of a boat would

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.790 
falling into the mud out of a boat would
get<00:04:34.950> at<00:04:35.070> least<00:04:35.220> two<00:04:35.490> inches<00:04:35.850> of<00:04:36.030> mud<00:04:36.620> into<00:04:37.620> the

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
get at least two inches of mud into the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.590 
get at least two inches of mud into the
muzzle<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:38.460> as<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:38.790> can<00:04:38.910> see<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.270> neither<00:04:39.480> one

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
muzzle so as you can see the neither one

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.430 
muzzle so as you can see the neither one
of<00:04:39.630> them<00:04:39.780> fared<00:04:39.990> very<00:04:40.080> well

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
of them fared very well

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.970 
of them fared very well
the<00:04:41.220> Remington<00:04:41.520> blew<00:04:41.880> out<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.060> top<00:04:42.980> maybe

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
the Remington blew out the top maybe

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.260 
the Remington blew out the top maybe
it's<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.220> little<00:04:44.310> bit<00:04:44.430> different<00:04:44.700> steel<00:04:45.030> you

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
it's a little bit different steel you

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.510 
it's a little bit different steel you
can<00:04:45.390> actually<00:04:45.690> look<00:04:45.810> at<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.050> steel<00:04:46.430> look<00:04:47.430> at

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
can actually look at the steel look at

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.860 
can actually look at the steel look at
these<00:04:47.670> two<00:04:47.850> next<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.210> each<00:04:48.240> other<00:04:48.510> and<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:48.720> can

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
these two next to each other and you can

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.600 
these two next to each other and you can
see<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.290> gauge<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.740> steel<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.220> Remington

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
see the gauge of the steel the Remington

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.710 
see the gauge of the steel the Remington
actually<00:04:50.910> is<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.030> little<00:04:51.210> bit<00:04:51.330> thicker<00:04:51.510> gauge

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
actually is a little bit thicker gauge

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.050 
actually is a little bit thicker gauge
steel<00:04:52.020> in<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.260> Mossberg<00:04:52.760> you<00:04:53.760> can<00:04:53.910> pretty

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
steel in the Mossberg you can pretty

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.760 
steel in the Mossberg you can pretty
much<00:04:54.150> see<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.630> but<00:04:54.780> with<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.140> eye<00:04:55.170> right<00:04:55.500> there

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
much see it but with the eye right there

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.340 
much see it but with the eye right there
so<00:04:56.070> maybe<00:04:56.970> that's<00:04:57.180> why<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.390> didn't<00:04:57.810> feather<00:04:58.170> at

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
so maybe that's why I didn't feather at

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.020 
so maybe that's why I didn't feather at
the<00:04:58.500> end<00:04:58.710> make<00:04:58.920> a<00:04:58.950> flower<00:04:59.250> like<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.640> Mossberg

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
the end make a flower like the Mossberg

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.060 
the end make a flower like the Mossberg
did<00:05:00.330> but<00:05:01.080> uh<00:05:01.110> yeah<00:05:01.410> Chadha<00:05:01.680> neither<00:05:01.920> one<00:05:02.040> of

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
did but uh yeah Chadha neither one of

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.130 
did but uh yeah Chadha neither one of
these<00:05:02.220> fare<00:05:02.520> very<00:05:02.550> well<00:05:02.820> now<00:05:03.420> this<00:05:03.990> is

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
these fare very well now this is

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.930 
these fare very well now this is
actually<00:05:04.470> in<00:05:04.590> two<00:05:04.950> pieces<00:05:05.130> now<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.820> was

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
actually in two pieces now it was

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.910 
actually in two pieces now it was
detached<00:05:06.240> from<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.600> lower<00:05:06.840> tube<00:05:07.140> so<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.800> think

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
detached from the lower tube so I think

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.860 
detached from the lower tube so I think
that<00:05:08.190> one<00:05:08.340> actually<00:05:08.520> stayed<00:05:08.880> attached<00:05:09.240> yeah<00:05:09.840> I

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
that one actually stayed attached yeah I

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.810 
that one actually stayed attached yeah I
did<00:05:10.140> where<00:05:10.920> it's<00:05:11.040> connected<00:05:11.400> out<00:05:11.520> right<00:05:11.670> here

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
did where it's connected out right here

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.770 
did where it's connected out right here
on<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:12.000> end<00:05:12.090> of<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.210> barrel<00:05:12.450> this<00:05:12.570> one's

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
on the end of the barrel this one's

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.530 
on the end of the barrel this one's
actually<00:05:16.040> well<00:05:17.040> sadly<00:05:17.760> enough<00:05:18.030> I<00:05:18.180> can<00:05:18.360> say

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
actually well sadly enough I can say

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.730 
actually well sadly enough I can say
this<00:05:18.660> I'm<00:05:18.840> a<00:05:18.870> little<00:05:19.110> disappointed<00:05:19.710> that

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
this I'm a little disappointed that

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.590 
this I'm a little disappointed that
these<00:05:20.250> didn't<00:05:20.670> do<00:05:20.760> a<00:05:20.790> little<00:05:20.970> better<00:05:21.210> once<00:05:21.420> you

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
these didn't do a little better once you

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.150 
these didn't do a little better once you
suspected<00:05:22.200> this<00:05:22.320> I<00:05:22.530> mean<00:05:22.650> that's<00:05:22.770> why<00:05:22.860> we<00:05:23.010> kind

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
suspected this I mean that's why we kind

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.980 
suspected this I mean that's why we kind
of<00:05:23.280> waited<00:05:24.000> a<00:05:24.150> little<00:05:24.270> bit<00:05:24.420> in<00:05:24.630> our<00:05:24.750> segment

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
of waited a little bit in our segment

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.500 
of waited a little bit in our segment
before<00:05:25.290> we<00:05:25.500> did<00:05:25.710> this<00:05:25.920> but<00:05:26.250> I'm<00:05:26.850> disappointed

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
before we did this but I'm disappointed

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.670 
before we did this but I'm disappointed
that<00:05:27.540> we<00:05:27.750> didn't<00:05:27.960> get<00:05:28.020> to<00:05:28.140> do<00:05:28.260> more<00:05:28.440> with<00:05:28.590> the

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
that we didn't get to do more with the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.320 
that we didn't get to do more with the
Mossberg<00:05:29.160> we<00:05:29.430> actually<00:05:29.820> may<00:05:29.910> get<00:05:30.090> another

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
Mossberg we actually may get another

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.850 
Mossberg we actually may get another
Mossberg<00:05:30.780> 500<00:05:31.320> and<00:05:31.410> run<00:05:31.530> it<00:05:31.650> through<00:05:31.680> some

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
Mossberg 500 and run it through some

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.370 
Mossberg 500 and run it through some
more<00:05:32.130> gun<00:05:32.310> bullies<00:05:32.700> this<00:05:33.300> Remington<00:05:33.870> maybe<00:05:34.200> we

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
more gun bullies this Remington maybe we

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.320 
more gun bullies this Remington maybe we
got<00:05:34.530> a<00:05:34.590> lemon<00:05:34.830> this<00:05:35.370> thing<00:05:35.610> has<00:05:35.760> been<00:05:35.790> horrible

truck the remington cannot handle
anything<00:05:57.720> the<00:05:58.080> finish<00:05:58.380> is<00:05:58.530> just<00:05:58.650> awful<00:05:59.130> where

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
anything the finish is just awful where

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.160 
anything the finish is just awful where
the<00:05:59.430> Mossberg<00:05:59.850> has<00:06:00.120> handled<00:06:00.480> it<00:06:00.570> just<00:06:00.600> fine

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
the Mossberg has handled it just fine

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.890 
the Mossberg has handled it just fine

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
so the remington would not have lasted

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.720 
so the remington would not have lasted
