00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.990
 so hello i just wanted to go here 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.160
 very briefly just imagine something 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.860
 certainly for you as well 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.639
 could be interesting 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.529
 many of you we have the groko three 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.279
 great camera of course we too 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.630
 very much like to use for flying for 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.869
 first boston tea or stop over 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.519
 take aerial photos or take photos great 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.519
 camera has only a very big one 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.460
 disadvantage if we send you to the copter 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.620
 hang around and she falls off vinegar 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.500
 under the very big that the front 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.530
 lens scratched and who once a 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.660
 such had such a case and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 knows what the trouble is 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.739
 Of course, that's not great 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.460
 in advance, any preparations 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.840
 met to prevent just that 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.300
 Of course you are just that one has 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.140
 that looks from the side that the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.180
 lens actually protrudes so easily and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.550
 scratching pretty fast 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.539
 can happen 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.530
 I was wondering what I was doing here 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.270
 for example, even if I have them through the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.979
 There is an option to transport 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.600
 as I hold the lens in the protected 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.720
 I can do it without the original 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.530
 had to transport housing had for it 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.090
 I'm from the hardware store that ever 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.630
 posted 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:27.630
 if you can read it i had it myself 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.689
 chair hats or tischbein 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.250
 hats this super Eight Eccentric 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.890
 have pieces I think will get a euro 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.840
 30 of them I have a cap 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.600
 took 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.000
 what do they look like and they work out? 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.970
 So you are wonderful when you do that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.460
 format a hero kameralinsen diameter 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.040
 than 22 millimeters you should then 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.110
 at the legs legs 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.790
 Also take care that the 220 mm 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.350
 to have 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.479
 they have to be used before you can use them 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.310
 once heated in hot water 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.049
 then they are very flexible and 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.390
 then you can give them a little bit and 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.479
 then they get their really pretty 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.039
 just on the lens on it you can 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.920
 either directly use it now 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.580
 or just cut you would have in the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 principle only that the lid course 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.650
 a little bit longer and then I would already have 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.080
 the best protection I have now 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.200
 I wanted to have that I was in 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.640
 the location am at the groko filter 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.650
 I could already use the internet 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.150
 Have a look what is there, everything gives 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.360
 Most filters had found you so 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.730
 that you have relatively expensive special filters 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.000
 but everything I had ever seen 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.950
 be attached to the original housing 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.370
 had 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.769
 he always needed the heavy cow 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.660
 pro housing what we naturally during 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.819
 of the fly can replace all of them 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.500
 Especially since we are so many you can also 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.849
 campbells use that means I have 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.530
 somehow looked that I find something 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.599
 that also without this housing 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:07.050
 works then did the following 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.060
 I took a cap 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.409
 this is a bit smaller than what I am 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.790
 but now theoretically has taken over 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.310
 which already work 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.590
 I had originally taken one 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:23.790
 cap of an old one of an old one 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:27.569
 Objectively the thing has 45 55 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:32.129
 mm had in the middle exactly the 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:40.799
 middle hole a birth of 22 23 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:46.920
 millimeter so i basically 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:51.240
 my table cap a ring in exactly 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:55.890
 could use the middle 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:59.460
 and the result is then read that 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:03.810
 me as I then glued that 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:07.440
 I basically have such a thing too 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:13.530
 Last but not least I have taken one 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:17.430
 uv filter where I the uv filter itself 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:21.090
 I beat this out 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.730
 thread was with the help of the profit bin 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.290
 I am now able to do whatever I like 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:31.440
 filter I would like to use on 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.510
 to put my camera in with help 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.240
 this adapter I'll say it all 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:42.240
 short about the gopro now I have here 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:48.270
 My a holder I will now 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.400
 Put simply here right and 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.080
 she already has it 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.130
 I hope that everything is okay 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.270
 seems to be bombproof right now 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.410
 nothing can happen 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.280
 So I have mine here too 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.140
 Thread in the case I have here now 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.780
 a polfilter it could theoretically 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.590
 Also a UV shield was a nd filter that 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.270
 always be 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:16.280
 and I can just do it here 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:22.410
 put on it and already I have a great 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:25.680
 super filter housing which I also use 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.570
 can protect a lens 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.620
 but I do not think that has anything in total 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:35.340
 much tastes says the caps 1 euro 30 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.630
 I had the lid of objective anyway 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.090
 then I need a bit 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.030
 glue and then just just a whole 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.980
 cheap uv filter you look at ebay 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.050
 or order my ideas at amazon 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.480
 the cost can somehow be five to eight 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.580
 Euro 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.320
 As a basis for keeping more filters on 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.310
 to be able to screw and otherwise become 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.380
 Maybe you in one or 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.780
 a filter anyway have it here 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.910
 I can say yes, I say great now 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.780
 made fun it was relatively easy 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.730
 implement 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.460
 and I'm curious about the first one 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.630
 experience in flying I hope too 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.030
 and that is of course still the 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.540
 question how does that affect now if 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.250
 we used a GÃ¼mbel 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.660
 it will definitely suit me 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.430
 not the problem I just hope 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.320
 that he can do it with the 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.980
 additional weight what you in principle 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.480
 but I'm a little bit forward 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.890
 Just let me surprise you 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.810
 the people in any case without gimbel 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:32.520
 fly where we only have your camera 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.470
 Use this bracket on everyone 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.990
 case already optimally in any case 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.120
 to protect your camera yourself 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.830
 okay that's it and me 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.830
 have fun to copy it
