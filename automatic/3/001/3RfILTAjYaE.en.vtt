take out in that to us arguing how to
have<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.590> this<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.490> what<00:04:32.670> it<00:04:32.790> is<00:04:33.030> this<00:04:33.960> ship<00:04:34.290> is

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
have it this is what it is this ship is

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.920 
have it this is what it is this ship is
like<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:36.230> nice<00:04:37.230> but<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:38.010> like<00:04:38.630> I'm<00:04:39.630> gonna<00:04:40.050> put<00:04:40.320> it

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
like a nice but is like I'm gonna put it

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.660 
like a nice but is like I'm gonna put it
just<00:04:42.930> say<00:04:43.170> it's<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.500> biggest<00:04:43.950> thing<00:04:44.100> I<00:04:44.250> built

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
just say it's the biggest thing I built

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.870 
just say it's the biggest thing I built
I<00:04:44.760> guess<00:04:45.260> that<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.740> whole<00:04:46.980> ship<00:04:47.340> took<00:04:47.550> over<00:04:47.730> a

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
I guess that the whole ship took over a

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.780 
I guess that the whole ship took over a
thousand<00:04:48.480> blocks<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:49.020> build<00:04:49.250> so<00:04:50.250> it<00:04:50.550> took<00:04:50.730> a

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
thousand blocks to build so it took a

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.210 
thousand blocks to build so it took a
long<00:04:51.270> time

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
long time

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.280 
long time
Aki<00:04:53.220> it<00:04:53.790> didn't<00:04:54.120> even<00:04:54.240> take<00:04:54.480> a<00:04:54.510> day<00:04:54.780> actually

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
Aki it didn't even take a day actually

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.030 
Aki it didn't even take a day actually
took<00:04:56.100> like<00:04:56.310> two<00:04:56.520> hours<00:04:57.620> there's<00:04:58.620> like<00:04:58.800> the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
took like two hours there's like the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.910 
took like two hours there's like the
Jets<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.700> all<00:04:59.820> that<00:05:00.889> that's<00:05:01.889> like<00:05:02.190> too<00:05:03.000> cold

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
Jets and all that that's like too cold

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.980 
Jets and all that that's like too cold
don't<00:05:04.920> let<00:05:05.130> say<00:05:05.400> that's<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.180> more<00:05:06.389> higher

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
don't let say that's the more higher

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.780 
don't let say that's the more higher
clip<00:05:07.440> jet<00:05:07.770> those<00:05:08.670> are<00:05:08.790> just<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:09.090> small<00:05:09.480> little
