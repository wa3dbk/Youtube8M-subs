00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.109
 the 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.109
 that 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.780
 long 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.780
 side effects 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.250
 London 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.580
 how to 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.910
 wander as he does that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.290
 the other camp vacated 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.670
 half in the lead 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.970
 that gets stuck 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.000
 I think it's not necessarily to be expected 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Doris Doppler thank you for throwing one 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.840
 were in the fall 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 I hope that we Germany 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820
 there would have his predictions 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.470
 Werner MÃ¼ller 4 percent 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.350
 well below two percent 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.590
 Not everything is more a city of angels with a smile through there 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.760
 would be great in Worms 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.240
 Zeitgeist at work 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.930
 spd vice perfect 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.770
 Holdener the abstinent 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.830
 the users with subtropical waters can do that 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.060
 training 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.250
 England has to 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.640
 To develop the shipping company, the fish, each transmitter will be free land 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.470
 Before the actual fishing is first the government 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.730
 access to the damp is locked but Roman has the key and 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.730
 hit as the gate to nasty little paradise 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.150
 The beautiful mixed forest with some ancient trees presents itself in the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.359
 most beautiful colors 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:17.799
 golden october 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.159
 how he can not be more beautiful 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.870
 Of course Wolfgang Dromann can not take her eyes off the water 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.529
 to let 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.229
 no wonder at the beautiful Enschede which is in the middle of the streambed 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.219
 the flag bearer is allowed to stay undisturbed 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.789
 Gang through the district not finished 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:41.719
 but who has thought that then finally fished is who knows the 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.619
 Austrian bad her motto is always with calm and once one 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:48.970
 hearty snack now right on the water 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.260
 for this, Romand's brother Helmut has worried he has been sold 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.029
 is remembered 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.579
 finally it is well-fortified ANZ fish water 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.669
 Wolfgang first presents a damper of the fly fishing expert 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.349
 It does not take long to notice the first bite of a brown trout 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:31.319
 a small but fine specimen that of course long ago set back 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.319
 becomes 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:45.509
 For example, Romand will try something like electricity with the nymph 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.989
 even with him it does not take long until the first competitive game under t 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.029
 a beautiful English defends itself to capacity 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.309
 a real Abbott head 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:03.429
 CNN reports 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.429
 surely put the defense 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.749
 After a few more, they will find their way to a good piece of electricity 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:15.779
 down to business 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:19.559
 Daniel rings rise to the surface of the fish betrayed 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:22.680
 Wolfgang now tries it with the troupe fly 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.289
 the thirsty squirrel can not be disturbed by Prof 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.129
 Sarah s 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:39.129
 the kids to join in invites 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.409
 Russell will be released 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.360
 Meanwhile, the castle Herberstein comes in sight 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.729
 directly opposite Silvie Domann a nymph while Wolfgang at the dry 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.729
 remains again 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.810
 this time, falling in first is successful Roman has a combative 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.569
 Rainbow trout on the hook
