00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:28.090
 and I also like it a lot 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.090
 about how my fears look like 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.030
 facebook and I also found out 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.590
 what 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.590
 and with brightness we need 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.520
 and the chemicals 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.810
 then in today's video 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.790
 show my most important 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.620
 and we must consider them all to 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.640
 study our hair and have it very 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.680
 beautiful 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.320
 well let's start with the most tricks 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.409
 important for the hair then 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.840
 before going to bathe always in what 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.090
 possible let's do a little massage 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.759
 all our scalp as 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.009
 this will make the circulation activate and 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.520
 It will also ensure a good cleaning of 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.710
 our hair 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.320
 also girls remember please 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.820
 whenever you are going to have the pool 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.570
 use a swimming cap to protect 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.570
 our hair 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.320
 now it's time to look at how it should be 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.680
 do a proper wash of our 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.680
 hair 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.550
 it is important to take some time 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.280
 long to pamper our hair and 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.380
 which is very important in our care 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.190
 staff then let's take the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.860
 time to massage us very well and 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.890
 Spread us all the shampoo from the root 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.640
 towards the tips for everything all everything 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.640
 everywhere 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.370
 and more importantly you took the time 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.430
 necessary to take you absolutely 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.130
 all the remains of the shampoo I know that 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.380
 recommend washing the hair twice 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.880
 per week but really I can not 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.650
 do it then this is me I try to 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.130
 wash it day by day but almost always 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.500
 it's almost all three then it's very 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.440
 important to do it very well to achieve 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.440
 have it clean most of the type 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.380
 this step is very important please do not 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.080
 forget to put a conditioner on your 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.819
 hair after shampoo I put it on 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.760
 means to tips because I have the hair 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.069
 pretty greasy I leave it for about 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.630
 how many minutes maximum two minutes and 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.240
 ready 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.550
 he rinsed it very well and started playing 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.590
 all my hair 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.200
 as you see it is something that you should 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.810
 enjoy because it is part of you 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.470
 it is a very important part to take care of her 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.540
 please a lot 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.370
 at the time of drying not in our 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.290
 hair do not do it look for mind 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.080
 we simply roll up the mules that 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.850
 absorb water and ready when 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.830
 let's go do it, we're just going to 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.400
 Gently dry our tips the 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.650
 hair and ready this point is also 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.800
 very important please wish networks in 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.070
 the end of it very gently from the 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.570
 points up this is important 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.270
 They also do it with a brush 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.410
 adequate if they have one like this one that 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.320
 It has some tips like points 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.020
 that makes you massage while 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.970
 you comb on your scalp this 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.430
 stimulate as I said the 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.140
 circulation of your hair and therefore not 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.620
 really mistreat these supports are 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.630
 highly recommended please is important 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.780
 that they invest in for your sugar 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.670
 to this point that follows better said them 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.340
 cause for now many days cut the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.459
 hair with imaginary friends and I 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.900
 I cut my hair and I but you have to 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.930
 do it because if you are not going to 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.470
 they really do not do it and you see them 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.710
 hair really very very opaque with some 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.050
 very ugly tips then really 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.310
 do this it is important that they do 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.990
 I do not tell them to cut 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.360
 centimeters they carry the hairdresser and I 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.530
 they really cut a lot but then 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.090
 I learned to cut myself 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.090
 I just take it all fell towards 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.120
 go ahead and cut me a few tips 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.270
 nothing more then I do this every two 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.790
 months or three months and really what I 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.330
 cut is very very scarce 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.370
 this what warner will do according to how 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.020
 you have the hair if you do not 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.690
 they care pretty new they are going to have the 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.280
 need to cut yourself in a lot but 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.840
 I suppose they have it damaged 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.190
 first time and they're going to have to cut it 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.190
 enough but not after 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.000
 for him 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.140
 very much practice 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.170
 and also 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.740
 is 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.719
 go starting 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.240
 we expected
