00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.659 
could definitely put some ball hinge
knees<00:04:25.020> just<00:04:25.530> because<00:04:25.770> it

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
knees just because it

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.850 
knees just because it
adds<00:04:26.939> a<00:04:27.120> lot<00:04:27.270> despite<00:04:27.810> not<00:04:28.139> having<00:04:28.169> ball<00:04:28.710> hands

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
adds a lot despite not having ball hands

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.309 
adds a lot despite not having ball hands
ankles<00:04:29.249> ball<00:04:29.939> hands<00:04:30.090> knees<00:04:30.270> are<00:04:30.539> still<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.870> huge

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
ankles ball hands knees are still a huge

right<00:05:04.979> here<00:05:05.009> and<00:05:05.430> then<00:05:06.389> wonder<00:05:06.599> where<00:05:06.719> it

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:06.779 
right here and then wonder where it

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:16.070 
right here and then wonder where it
opens<00:05:07.849> it<00:05:08.849> opens<00:05:08.969> on<00:05:09.479> this<00:05:09.719> side<00:05:14.840> let's<00:05:15.840> see

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
opens it opens on this side let's see

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.579 
opens it opens on this side let's see
but<00:05:16.979> this<00:05:17.189> one<00:05:17.400> has<00:05:17.789> a<00:05:17.819> little<00:05:18.719> peg<00:05:19.110> right

can easily clip it on his backpack just
like<00:05:24.659> that<00:05:25.129> and<00:05:26.129> I'm<00:05:26.819> assuming<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.419> string

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
like that and I'm assuming the string

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.110 
like that and I'm assuming the string
the<00:05:27.900> black<00:05:28.110> string<00:05:28.469> you<00:05:28.770> can<00:05:28.949> tie<00:05:29.729> it<00:05:29.759> around

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
the black string you can tie it around

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.439 
the black string you can tie it around
and<00:05:30.479> then<00:05:30.750> loop<00:05:31.529> it<00:05:31.650> around<00:05:31.710> and<00:05:32.400> even<00:05:33.240> hang

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
and then loop it around and even hang

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.140 
and then loop it around and even hang
this<00:05:33.659> uh<00:05:34.069> the<00:05:35.069> grappling<00:05:35.430> hook<00:05:35.490> like<00:05:35.849> right<00:05:36.120> on

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
this uh the grappling hook like right on

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.240 
this uh the grappling hook like right on
the<00:05:36.330> side<00:05:36.599> of<00:05:36.750> his<00:05:36.870> pack<00:05:37.080> I'm<00:05:37.740> not<00:05:37.949> going<00:05:38.099> to<00:05:38.159> go

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
the side of his pack I'm not going to go

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.740 
the side of his pack I'm not going to go
into<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.550> trouble<00:05:38.819> of<00:05:38.939> trying<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.270> put<00:05:39.479> it<00:05:39.569> on

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
into the trouble of trying to put it on

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.240 
into the trouble of trying to put it on
right<00:05:40.020> now<00:05:40.169> because<00:05:40.349> I<00:05:40.589> don't<00:05:40.830> think<00:05:41.069> I<00:05:41.099> have<00:05:41.219> a

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
right now because I don't think I have a

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.110 
right now because I don't think I have a
lot<00:05:41.460> of<00:05:41.490> time<00:05:41.819> at<00:05:42.000> least<00:05:42.409> so<00:05:43.409> but<00:05:44.370> yeah<00:05:44.879> you

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
lot of time at least so but yeah you

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.760 
lot of time at least so but yeah you
guys<00:05:45.240> get<00:05:45.419> the<00:05:45.569> point<00:05:45.750> it's<00:05:46.020> going<00:05:46.289> to<00:05:46.349> be<00:05:46.500> like

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
guys get the point it's going to be like

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.230 
guys get the point it's going to be like
looped<00:05:47.189> around<00:05:47.279> like<00:05:47.580> that<00:05:47.729> and<00:05:47.789> it's<00:05:48.149> going

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
looped around like that and it's going

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.570 
looped around like that and it's going
to<00:05:48.330> go<00:05:48.479> up<00:05:48.629> so<00:05:48.839> you<00:05:49.379> can<00:05:49.620> definitely<00:05:49.770> use<00:05:50.550> a

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
to go up so you can definitely use a

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.920 
to go up so you can definitely use a
zipline<00:05:51.409> that's<00:05:52.409> really<00:05:52.680> cool<00:05:52.889> and<00:05:53.689> let's<00:05:54.689> see

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
zipline that's really cool and let's see

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.719 
zipline that's really cool and let's see
we've<00:05:55.800> got<00:05:55.889> his<00:05:56.039> blaster<00:05:56.520> right<00:05:56.669> here<00:05:57.500> and

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
we've got his blaster right here and

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:04.029 
we've got his blaster right here and
seems<00:05:59.729> like<00:05:59.849> it<00:06:00.000> can<00:06:00.379> clip<00:06:01.379> onto<00:06:01.620> somewhere

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
seems like it can clip onto somewhere

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.249 
seems like it can clip onto somewhere
let's<00:06:05.039> see<00:06:05.539> but<00:06:06.539> I'll<00:06:06.659> definitely<00:06:06.839> have<00:06:07.110> him

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
let's see but I'll definitely have him

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.249 
let's see but I'll definitely have him
hold<00:06:07.439> it<00:06:07.589> first

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 
hold it first

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.480 
hold it first
you<00:06:10.259> can<00:06:10.379> definitely<00:06:10.529> hold<00:06:10.889> on<00:06:11.039> to<00:06:11.189> it<00:06:11.310> and

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
you can definitely hold on to it and

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.540 
you can definitely hold on to it and
he's<00:06:12.240> got<00:06:12.419> two<00:06:12.569> blaster<00:06:12.930> pistols<00:06:13.339> though<00:06:14.339> he's

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
he's got two blaster pistols though he's

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.100 
he's got two blaster pistols though he's
doesn't<00:06:14.969> have<00:06:15.210> any<00:06:15.389> working<00:06:15.569> holsters

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
doesn't have any working holsters

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.809 
doesn't have any working holsters
unfortunately<00:06:17.270> but<00:06:18.649> if<00:06:19.649> we<00:06:20.069> get<00:06:20.250> to<00:06:20.399> if<00:06:20.550> I<00:06:20.639> can

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
unfortunately but if we get to if I can

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.749 
unfortunately but if we get to if I can
only<00:06:20.969> open<00:06:21.449> this<00:06:21.629> thing<00:06:22.159> if<00:06:23.159> I<00:06:23.279> can<00:06:23.339> only<00:06:23.580> open

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
only open this thing if I can only open

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.869 
only open this thing if I can only open
his<00:06:23.969> pack<00:06:24.180> then<00:06:24.419> it'll<00:06:24.990> be<00:06:25.110> easier<00:06:25.789> because<00:06:26.789> I

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:26.879 
his pack then it'll be easier because I

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.429 
his pack then it'll be easier because I
think<00:06:27.599> you<00:06:27.930> can<00:06:28.110> put<00:06:28.289> his<00:06:28.520> glasses<00:06:29.520> in<00:06:29.759> there

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:30.439 
think you can put his glasses in there

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:33.920 
think you can put his glasses in there
yep<00:06:31.469> I<00:06:31.680> can<00:06:32.430> pretty<00:06:32.610> much<00:06:32.699> put<00:06:32.969> his<00:06:33.060> twin<00:06:33.300> his
