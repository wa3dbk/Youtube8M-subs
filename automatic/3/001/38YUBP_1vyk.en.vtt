to pick up book one as soon as I can but
I<00:03:55.980> heard<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.430> if<00:03:56.670> when<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.239> do<00:03:57.360> start<00:03:57.540> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
I heard that if when you do start the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.509 
I heard that if when you do start the
series<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.260> should<00:03:58.290> have<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.070> other<00:03:59.220> books

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
series you should have the other books

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.009 
series you should have the other books
so<00:03:59.820> that<00:03:59.880> way<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.120> can<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:00.360> keep<00:04:00.630> on<00:04:00.810> reading

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
so that way you can just keep on reading

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.960 
so that way you can just keep on reading
them<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.320> you<00:04:02.130> don't<00:04:02.310> have<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.549> wait<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.880> get

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970

them and you don't have to wait to get
the<00:04:03.090> next<00:04:03.269> book<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:03.720> that's<00:04:04.080> why<00:04:04.170> I<00:04:04.200> went<00:04:04.320> ahead
