however<00:00:38.219> you've<00:00:38.610> got<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:38.940> wary<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.450> combo

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
however you've got to be wary of a combo

it's<00:00:41.790> very<00:00:42.090> very<00:00:42.660> difficult<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.500> out<00:00:43.710> of

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
it's very very difficult to get out of

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.610 
it's very very difficult to get out of
so<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.660> combo<00:00:46.110> we're<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> concentrate

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
so that combo we're going to concentrate

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.420 
so that combo we're going to concentrate
on<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.910> lock<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.660> Horus<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.070> can't

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
on it is a lock of Horus so you can't

with those then his dragon deck is
extremely<00:00:59.370> basic<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.390> let's<00:01:00.629> look<00:01:00.750> at<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
extremely basic so let's look at the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.740 
extremely basic so let's look at the
support<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.590> combo<00:01:02.070> he's<00:01:02.760> got<00:01:03.030> one

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
support of this combo he's got one

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.530

Horace<00:01:04.110> level<00:01:04.379> 82<00:01:04.799> level<00:01:05.460> six<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.939> two<00:01:06.240> level

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
Horace level 82 level six and two level

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.530 
Horace level 82 level six and two level
4<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.560> luckily<00:01:07.890> he<00:01:08.040> hasn't<00:01:08.340> been<00:01:08.460> given<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.180> load

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
4 so luckily he hasn't been given a load

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.109 
4 so luckily he hasn't been given a load
of<00:01:09.720> Horus<00:01:09.990> monsters<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.700> still<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
of Horus monsters but it can still be a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.120 
of Horus monsters but it can still be a
pain<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.570> wrong<00:01:12.780> circumstance<00:01:13.530> so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
pain in the wrong circumstance so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.240 
pain in the wrong circumstance so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.960 
things even though he does have quite a
bit<00:02:01.260> of<00:02:01.380> trap<00:02:01.650> negation<00:02:02.160> I<00:02:02.340> would<00:02:02.670> run<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
bit of trap negation I would run the

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.150 
bit of trap negation I would run the
most<00:02:03.120> potent<00:02:03.690> traps<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.710> things<00:02:05.010> like

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
most potent traps so things like

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.749 
most potent traps so things like
torrential<00:02:05.490> tribute<00:02:06.020> mirror<00:02:07.020> force<00:02:07.759> maybe

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
torrential tribute mirror force maybe

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
torrential tribute mirror force maybe
even<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.119> solemn<00:02:09.450> judgment<00:02:09.960> or<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> dimensional

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
even a solemn judgment or a dimensional

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.250 
even a solemn judgment or a dimensional
prison<00:02:11.180> but<00:02:12.180> keep<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> trap<00:02:12.660> traps<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.230> a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
prison but keep the trap traps to a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.610 
prison but keep the trap traps to a
minimum<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:13.770> around<00:02:14.070> five<00:02:14.400> tracks<00:02:14.790> I'd<00:02:15.030> say

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
minimum so around five tracks I'd say

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.290 
minimum so around five tracks I'd say
other<00:02:16.620> than<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.040> run<00:02:17.400> chainable<00:02:17.790> spills<00:02:18.150> of

things you can use things like book of
moon<00:02:22.230> may<00:02:22.890> even<00:02:23.160> shrink<00:02:23.700> yourself<00:02:24.000> if<00:02:24.480> you

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
moon may even shrink yourself if you

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
moon may even shrink yourself if you
really<00:02:24.930> wanted<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:26.270> but<00:02:27.270> don't<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.260> shrink

against these Horace monsters because
that's<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.180> stupid<00:02:32.030> other<00:02:33.030> than<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.860> I

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
that's just stupid other than that I

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.040 
that's just stupid other than that I
would<00:02:35.730> concentrate<00:02:36.330> on<00:02:36.600> having<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.870> lot<00:02:37.020> of

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
would concentrate on having a lot of

would concentrate on having a lot of
effect<00:02:37.530> monsters<00:02:38.100> in<00:02:38.310> your<00:02:38.370> deck<00:02:38.730> as<00:02:39.240> well

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
effect monsters in your deck as well

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.870 
effect monsters in your deck as well
although<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.530> can<00:02:40.950> use<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.190> skill<00:02:41.490> drain<00:02:41.670> deck

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
although you can use a skill drain deck

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.940 
although you can use a skill drain deck
against<00:02:42.270> him<00:02:42.600> if<00:02:42.840> he<00:02:43.020> gets<00:02:43.230> raw<00:02:43.410> decree<00:02:43.800> out

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
against him if he gets raw decree out

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.280 
against him if he gets raw decree out
then<00:02:44.580> that's<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.630> you're<00:02:45.780> skilled<00:02:45.990> rain's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
then that's it you're skilled rain's

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.340 
then that's it you're skilled rain's
gone<00:02:46.530> basically<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:48.330> run<00:02:48.720> things<00:02:49.050> where<00:02:49.260> you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
gone basically so run things where you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.010 
gone basically so run things where you
can<00:02:49.500> pop<00:02:49.770> monsters<00:02:50.070> up<00:02:50.220> grave<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:51.020> plague

can pop monsters up grave like plague
spread<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.350> zombie<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:52.830> then<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.280> can<00:02:53.430> use<00:02:53.520> it

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
spread a zombie and then you can use it

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.540 
spread a zombie and then you can use it
as<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.760> tribute<00:02:54.000> for<00:02:54.270> things<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.540> Caius<00:02:55.550> which

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
as a tribute for things like Caius which

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
it's only two forbidden chalice and then

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.610 
it's only two forbidden chalice and then
it<00:03:15.000> increases<00:03:15.090> your<00:03:15.540> attack<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:16.140> depending
