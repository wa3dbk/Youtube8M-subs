the<00:01:31.870> sticky<00:01:32.110> overhang<00:01:32.560> pieces<00:01:32.980> then<00:01:33.400> take

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
the sticky overhang pieces then take

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.980 
the sticky overhang pieces then take
your<00:01:33.760> time<00:01:33.820> cutting<00:01:34.240> along<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.660> outline<00:01:34.960> of

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
your time cutting along the outline of

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.320 
your time cutting along the outline of
the<00:01:35.260> image

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
the image

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.790 
the image
I<00:01:39.450> find<00:01:40.450> it<00:01:40.570> helps<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.960> turn<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.320> image<00:01:41.530> as<00:01:41.680> you

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
I find it helps to turn the image as you

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.590

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.030 
with your scissors keeping them open as
you<00:01:46.120> turn<00:01:46.300> and<00:01:46.570> cutting<00:01:47.290> when<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:47.740> scissors

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
you turn and cutting when the scissors

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.800
