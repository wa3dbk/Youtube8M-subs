for the summer which a lot of guys want

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.299 
for the summer which a lot of guys want
to<00:00:31.800> they<00:00:32.669> start<00:00:33.000> hitting<00:00:33.149> rocks<00:00:34.010> they<00:00:35.010> start

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
to they start hitting rocks they start

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.760 
to they start hitting rocks they start
beating<00:00:35.489> things<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.450> when<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.320> happens

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
beating things up here when that happens

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.200 
beating things up here when that happens
and<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> start<00:00:38.250> bending<00:00:38.489> things<00:00:38.879> there's

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and I start bending things there's

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.520 
and I start bending things there's
really<00:00:39.390> nothing<00:00:39.840> because<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.140> kind<00:00:40.410> of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
really nothing because it's kind of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.090 
really nothing because it's kind of
vulnerable<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> what<00:00:42.210> happens<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:43.040> this<00:00:44.040> is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
vulnerable so what happens is this is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.190 
vulnerable so what happens is this is
how<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.579> plow<00:00:44.760> plate<00:00:45.059> actually<00:00:45.300> sits<00:00:45.899> kind

piece of steel flat stock across the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.969 
piece of steel flat stock across the
front<00:01:11.869> then<00:01:12.869> underneath<00:01:13.170> what<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.590> did<00:01:13.799> was<00:01:13.950> we

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
front then underneath what we did was we

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.440 
front then underneath what we did was we
boxed<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.720> bottom<00:01:17.119> right<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:20.640> what

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
boxed in the bottom right here and what

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
boxed in the bottom right here and what
we<00:01:21.600> did<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.229> added<00:01:22.500> another<00:01:22.860> piece<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
we did was we added another piece of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.780 
we did was we added another piece of
flat<00:01:23.670> bar<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:25.040> now<00:01:26.040> there's<00:01:26.490> pros<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
flat bar in here now there's pros and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.620 
flat bar in here now there's pros and
cons<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.570> because<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.329> only<00:01:30.450> give

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
cons to this because you can only give

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.120 
cons to this because you can only give
something<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.140> much<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> beat<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.799> before

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
something so much of a beat and before

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.370 
something so much of a beat and before
you<00:01:32.220> start<00:01:32.280> beating<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> machine<00:01:33.380> but

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you start beating up on the machine but

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.090 
you start beating up on the machine but
for<00:01:34.590> your<00:01:34.710> average<00:01:34.890> guy<00:01:35.600> who<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:36.979> such<00:01:37.979> an

extremist like this guy this is why you
really<00:01:43.770> wouldn't<00:01:44.040> need<00:01:44.689> much<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.780> any<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.229> it

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119

right here
I<00:01:54.619> made<00:01:55.619> these<00:01:55.799> pieces<00:01:56.130> up<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.100> they<00:01:59.280> do

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
I made these pieces up and what they do

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.420 
I made these pieces up and what they do
is<00:01:59.930> instead<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.079> right<00:02:01.320> now<00:02:02.509> when<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:04.430> are

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
going to crash into a rock and that rock

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.930 
going to crash into a rock and that rock
is<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.690> hit<00:02:09.899> right<00:02:10.140> here<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.940> it's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
is going to hit right here and it's

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.960 
is going to hit right here and it's
going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> start<00:02:12.420> bending<00:02:12.720> everything<00:02:13.290> up

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
going to start bending everything up

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.100 
going to start bending everything up
breaking<00:02:14.970> your<00:02:15.000> plow<00:02:15.270> mount<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.750> busting

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
breaking your plow mount and busting

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.690 
breaking your plow mount and busting
things<00:02:16.320> apart<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.800> making<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.370> can't

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
things apart and making it so you can't

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.820 
things apart and making it so you can't
align<00:02:17.910> your<00:02:18.120> plow<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:19.110> next<00:02:19.410> time<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.680> go<00:02:19.770> to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
align your plow the next time you go to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.320 
align your plow the next time you go to
put<00:02:20.040> your<00:02:20.070> plow<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.750> instead<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.900> that

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
put your plow on instead of that

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.440 
put your plow on instead of that
happening<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.510> take<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.350> piece<00:02:25.620> right<00:02:25.860> here

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
happening I take this piece right here

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.330 
happening I take this piece right here
and<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:29.220> made<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.090> goes<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:30.800> exactly<00:02:31.800> like

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
and I made it so it goes in exactly like

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.260 
and I made it so it goes in exactly like
your<00:02:32.490> plow<00:02:32.670> would<00:02:33.920> now<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.610> gate<00:02:35.820> gives<00:02:36.120> you

what<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.800> did<00:02:41.130> for<00:02:41.370> an<00:02:41.459> added<00:02:41.790> feature<00:02:42.000> was

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
what I did for an added feature was

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.740 
what I did for an added feature was
first<00:02:43.980> thing<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.820> goes<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.240> with<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.420> same

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
first thing is it goes in with the same

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.710 
first thing is it goes in with the same
pin<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.160> would<00:02:47.459> use<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:48.030> mount<00:02:48.450> your

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
pin that you would use to mount your

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.540 
pin that you would use to mount your
plow<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:50.730> pen<00:02:51.000> goes<00:02:51.209> right<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.570> back

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
plow that pen goes right in the back

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.820 
plow that pen goes right in the back
snaps<00:02:53.550> right<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:54.170> now<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.230> piece<00:02:55.500> doesn't

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
snaps right in now the piece doesn't

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.949 
snaps right in now the piece doesn't
come<00:02:55.920> out<00:02:56.010> however<00:02:56.670> that's<00:02:57.450> what<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.780> got

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
right and which might be okay in some

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.660 
right and which might be okay in some
applications<00:03:02.459> but<00:03:02.610> what<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.760> did<00:03:03.739> was<00:03:04.739> we<00:03:05.459> weld

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670
