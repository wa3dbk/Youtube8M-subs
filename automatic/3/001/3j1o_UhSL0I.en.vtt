00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.039 
mug here and there was own different
reason<00:02:02.670> why<00:02:02.790> people<00:02:03.180> would<00:02:03.299> do

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
reason why people would do

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.820 
reason why people would do
add<00:02:04.590> milk<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:06.360> -<00:02:06.810> they're<00:02:07.020> fine<00:02:07.619> bone

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
add milk or not - they're fine bone

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.469 
add milk or not - they're fine bone
china<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.520> depending<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> quality

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
china because depending on the quality

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.930 
china because depending on the quality
of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.630> china<00:02:10.400> very<00:02:11.400> much<00:02:11.490> depended<00:02:11.850> on

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
of the china very much depended on

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.120 
of the china very much depended on
whether<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.390> hot<00:02:12.569> water<00:02:12.930> from<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.380> tea<00:02:13.650> would

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
whether the hot water from the tea would

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.699 
whether the hot water from the tea would
actually<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:14.430> crack<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.180> multiple<00:02:15.630> cup<00:02:15.870> so

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
actually then crack the multiple cup so

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.670 
actually then crack the multiple cup so
it<00:02:16.920> was<00:02:17.069> very<00:02:17.190> much<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:18.330> way<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.110> letting<00:02:19.500> people

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
it was very much a way of letting people

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.340 
it was very much a way of letting people
know<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.310> your<00:02:20.630> cups<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.780> saucers<00:02:21.989> were

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
know that your cups and saucers were

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.110 
know that your cups and saucers were
finest<00:02:22.800> quality<00:02:23.190> because<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.670> could<00:02:23.850> pour

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
finest quality because you could pour

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.490 
finest quality because you could pour
directly<00:02:24.780> into<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.980> empty<00:02:26.850> mug<00:02:27.239> or<00:02:27.450> cut<00:02:27.690> from

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
directly into the empty mug or cut from

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.710 
directly into the empty mug or cut from
the<00:02:28.709> teapot<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.100> boiling<00:02:29.459> hot<00:02:29.580> water<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.120> you

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
the teapot to boiling hot water and you

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.190 
the teapot to boiling hot water and you
wouldn't<00:02:30.959> risk<00:02:31.739> cracking<00:02:32.370> any<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:32.940> your<00:02:33.200> cups

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
wouldn't risk cracking any of your cups

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.340 
wouldn't risk cracking any of your cups
and<00:02:34.410> saucers<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:36.360> was<00:02:36.480> very<00:02:36.690> common<00:02:36.930> that

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
and saucers so it was very common that

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.280 
and saucers so it was very common that
anybody<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.040> had<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> cheaper<00:02:39.060> range<00:02:39.290> china

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
anybody that had a cheaper range china

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.110 
anybody that had a cheaper range china
would<00:02:40.530> have<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.739> put<00:02:41.010> milk<00:02:41.310> into<00:02:41.760> their<00:02:41.910> mugs

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
would have to put milk into their mugs

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.630 
would have to put milk into their mugs
first<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.780> help<00:02:43.050> balance<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.100> heat<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.459> keep

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
first to help balance the heat and keep

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.150 
first to help balance the heat and keep
the<00:02:44.670> heat<00:02:44.970> at<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> lower<00:02:46.080> temperature<00:02:46.320> so

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
the heat at a lower temperature so

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.860 
the heat at a lower temperature so
that's<00:02:47.489> that's<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.150> old<00:02:48.300> days<00:02:48.480> that's<00:02:48.780> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
that's that's the old days that's the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.020 
that's that's the old days that's the
history<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.590> isn't<00:02:49.860> important<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.430> that's

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
history that isn't important and that's

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.850 
history that isn't important and that's
filled<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.480> tongue<00:02:51.690> quite<00:02:51.900> nicely<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.590> this

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
filled the tongue quite nicely so this

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.890 
filled the tongue quite nicely so this
has<00:02:52.980> been<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.280> there<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.670> good<00:02:53.970> while<00:02:54.480> now<00:02:54.510> I've

so you can see there's quite a bit

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.759 
so you can see there's quite a bit
strength<00:03:19.069> there<00:03:19.340> even<00:03:20.120> though<00:03:20.209> I<00:03:20.239> have<00:03:20.769> rather

know<00:03:25.760> almost<00:03:25.970> two<00:03:26.299> whole<00:03:26.450> minutes<00:03:26.659> of<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.140> and

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
know almost two whole minutes of it and

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.850 
know almost two whole minutes of it and
there<00:03:28.579> we<00:03:28.640> have<00:03:28.879> a<00:03:29.120> really<00:03:30.079> nice<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.290> strong<00:03:30.650> cup

of<00:03:30.890> tea

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
of tea

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.160 
of tea
and<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:31.730> think<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.420> mixture<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.810> the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
and I think it's a mixture of the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.399 
and I think it's a mixture of the
quality<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.590> tea<00:03:33.769> no<00:03:34.159> a<00:03:34.189> quick<00:03:34.400> sip<00:03:36.549> lovely

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
quality of the tea no a quick sip lovely

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.500 
quality of the tea no a quick sip lovely
good<00:03:39.409> milk<00:03:39.829> I<00:03:40.069> personally<00:03:40.819> always<00:03:40.909> use<00:03:41.150> full

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
good milk I personally always use full

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.869 
good milk I personally always use full
fat<00:03:41.659> milk<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:42.019> think<00:03:42.290> milk<00:03:42.409> adds<00:03:42.709> texture<00:03:43.340> and

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
fat milk I think milk adds texture and

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.670 
fat milk I think milk adds texture and
whenever<00:03:44.060> I've<00:03:44.239> tried<00:03:44.629> milk<00:03:45.140> where<00:03:45.470> it's

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
whenever I've tried milk where it's

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.890 
whenever I've tried milk where it's
fully<00:03:46.010> skim<00:03:46.340> reading<00:03:46.579> semi-skimmed<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.720> lose

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
fully skim reading semi-skimmed you lose

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.660 
fully skim reading semi-skimmed you lose
something<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.829> teal<00:03:49.040> always<00:03:49.430> tastes

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
something and the teal always tastes

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.599 
something and the teal always tastes
quite<00:03:50.349> watery<00:03:51.349> is<00:03:51.799> only<00:03:52.010> working<00:03:52.280> explain

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
quite watery is only working explain

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.970 
quite watery is only working explain
that<00:03:52.730> even<00:03:52.849> though<00:03:53.060> causes<00:03:53.739> 99.9<00:03:54.739> percent

that even though causes 99.9 percent

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.729 
that even though causes 99.9 percent
water<00:03:55.159> so<00:03:56.150> for<00:03:56.239> something<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.930> really<00:03:57.260> helps
