00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
they've really don't understand

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.010

basketball<00:04:38.710> that<00:04:39.520> they<00:04:39.760> hear<00:04:40.210> what<00:04:40.540> they<00:04:40.690> want

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
basketball that they hear what they want

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.100 
basketball that they hear what they want
to<00:04:41.110> hear<00:04:41.170> and<00:04:41.680> they<00:04:42.190> get<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.430> fitted<00:04:43.150> real<00:04:43.540> quick

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
to hear and they get a fitted real quick

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.130

I think LeBron James wasn't listening to
I<00:04:49.150> think<00:04:49.270> LeBron<00:04:49.690> James<00:04:50.080> really<00:04:50.320> took<00:04:50.530> that

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.420 
I think LeBron James really took that
