 this may happen sooner than you imagine are colorful with infinity 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.470
 of shapes and colors and that 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.289
 may be the only reason to compare a series for many of the people 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.540
 however, observe these precautions 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.910
 The Federal Procurator's Office recommends that you avoid buying them 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.489
 in informal stores 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.420
 that is to say in the streets avenues or markets because in this season 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.399
 There are products for sale from countries such as China and South 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:47.420
 from Guatemala 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.970
 which in many cases does not meet the quality requirements 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.330
 to conform the eleven be of quality they must have the legend nom 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.890
 tell 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.270
 the acronym of the official Mexican standard certifies it as a safe product 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.049
 this no matter if with it 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.350
 they also state that their origin is from china they explain that they must meet 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.729
 with the official Mexican standard which is 0 0 3 for lights and 24 for 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.409
 guarantees forcing that cable look zero points 5 centimeters enough 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.990
 to resist the intensity of the light without having the overheating that has 

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:27.159
 caused fire in recent years the two are from the cable depends on the number of 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.600
 focuses that each series contains, usually the measure must be 5 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:35.719
 millimeters for those of 100 lights do not place them also say in the 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.950
 inside their homes or on the facades this type of series that have 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.330
 a lower range in the wiring 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.170
 besides that if they are not counted 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.710
 whatever it is with a protected circuit ie 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.550
 that if the fuses automatically get disconnected the series and this 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.060
 avoided a short circuit 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.520
 in turn can cause a sinister avoid placing multiple pins in a 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.880
 single power outlet 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.359
 You help before going to sleep and do not overload the contacts of 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.130
 that the series do not work with molten lamps because the others can 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.840
 overheat and explode 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.210
 another recommendation 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.310
 is that lights should be turned off during the day at bedtime and always 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.530
 to leave home and is that the national certification association 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.810
 electric 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.990
 esteem that this Christmas will sell 50 million series throughout the country 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.260
 of which 66 percent are going to be pirated or doubtful products 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.669
 origin 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:31.409
 will generate losses of 132 million pesos to informal trade is estimated and 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.869
 is that three minutes a department of 100 square meters can be seen 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:38.669
 completely engulfed in flames and how they see this video a small 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:40.980
 room like those of most can burn 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.720
