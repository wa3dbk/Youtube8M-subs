00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.110
 It's also very important, and you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.570
 to leave a Pokémon from Levo 40 on 1st 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.049
 this is more of a question of 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.659
 call the pokémon with the same level I 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.360
 I think this really exists then 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.430

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.420
 will find several pokémons of cam 40 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.940
 just grab one and leave it in front and 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.960
 make this scheme of the bay 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.960

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:07.360
 Tai O human boy 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.640

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.190
 I gave you two, brother. 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.569
 It's worth it, you guys, look at it. 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.560
 it appeared dairy and damn expensive nor 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.040
 I'm believing 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.530
 not really and as you have seen there in the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.829
 title I'll try to catch the dairy 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.319
 using only one ball because 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.849
 The only one I have so wish me 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.849
 lucky and let's go 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.840
 And that's the fucking gal, I'm a fuck. 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.060
 I'm a crazy fuck 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.550
 I just captured a late scheme 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:28.120
 because good normal frei our guys do not 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.220
 this one deserves the name that will mark the 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.050
 story knows what the name will be like 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.350
 his 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:39.090
 This one, my god, I'm not believing. 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:43.330
 stark space 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.259

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.520

 our I'm here a while you do not 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:56.349
 are on but then after teaching 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.930
 this tactic for him to appear and capture 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:01.259
 the nuance with a ball because I think 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.259
 at least I deserve a like in the galera 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:06.639
 now let's have a look at it here 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.560
 we do not even believe 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.930
 dropped the card still the galley they catch 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.680
 Sorry, man, and I had it. 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.470
 one because one ball 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:23.080
 oh boy this was so awesome 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:29.260

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:39.490
 one because normal ball there then 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.750
 see here it is a kind of dragon type 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.889
 psychic 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.080
 he does not suffer ground-type attack 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:50.380
 annotated annotations nature seen in 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:55.050
 route 110 with level 40 rock 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:59.650
