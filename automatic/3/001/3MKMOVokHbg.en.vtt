never I'm going to built quite a few of
these<00:00:33.210> cars<00:00:33.540> I've<00:00:33.870> never<00:00:34.020> seen<00:00:34.260> anything<00:00:34.500> like

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
these cars I've never seen anything like

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.690 
these cars I've never seen anything like
this<00:00:35.989> large<00:00:36.989> five<00:00:37.380> millimeter<00:00:37.890> LEDs<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this large five millimeter LEDs in the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.430 
this large five millimeter LEDs in the
front<00:00:39.030> which<00:00:39.270> are<00:00:39.420> way<00:00:39.660> too<00:00:39.719> big<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.260> gaudy

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
front which are way too big and gaudy

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.740 
front which are way too big and gaudy
for<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.860> small<00:00:41.129> car<00:00:41.370> actually<00:00:42.090> too<00:00:42.420> big<00:00:42.600> even

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
for a small car actually too big even

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.470 
for a small car actually too big even
for<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.110> 18<00:00:43.410> scale<00:00:43.710> cars<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.250> anyway<00:00:44.670> again<00:00:45.450> I

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
for the 18 scale cars but anyway again I

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.430 
for the 18 scale cars but anyway again I
didn't<00:00:45.840> build<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.379> thinkin<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:48.440> you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
didn't build this one thinkin this you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.740 
didn't build this one thinkin this you
see<00:00:49.770> some<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> wiring<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.449> said<00:00:51.629> it's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
see some of the wiring like I said it's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.860 
see some of the wiring like I said it's
just<00:00:51.809> all<00:00:52.430> exposed<00:00:53.430> nothing's<00:00:54.390> really<00:00:54.480> tied

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
just all exposed nothing's really tied

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.340 
just all exposed nothing's really tied
down<00:00:55.170> real<00:00:55.469> well<00:00:57.050> probably<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> main<00:00:58.320> reason

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
down real well probably the main reason

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.319 
down real well probably the main reason
this<00:00:58.859> car<00:00:59.129> isn't<00:00:59.309> working<00:00:59.760> something<00:01:00.000> ended

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
this car isn't working something ended

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.360 
this car isn't working something ended
up<00:01:00.420> shorting<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.289> we're<00:01:01.980> cutting<00:01:02.280> today

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
up shorting out but we're cutting today

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.939 
up shorting out but we're cutting today
I<00:01:02.460> want<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.730> take<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> lot<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.480> wiring

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
I want to take out a lot of this wiring

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.340 
I want to take out a lot of this wiring
trimble<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.250> down<00:01:06.110> combined<00:01:07.110> some

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
trimble out of this down combined some

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.719 
trimble out of this down combined some
ground<00:01:07.619> wires<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:09.020> get<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> working<00:01:10.439> again

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
ground wires and get it working again

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.429 
ground wires and get it working again
also<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.330> car<00:01:12.689> back<00:01:12.720> together<00:01:13.110> I

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
also to get this car back together I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.620 
also to get this car back together I
guess<00:01:13.710> when<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> Builder<00:01:14.310> made<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.509> they

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
guess when the Builder made it so they

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.070 
guess when the Builder made it so they
cut<00:01:15.810> some<00:01:16.020> holes<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> interior<00:01:18.080> which

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
cut some holes in the interior which

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.570 
cut some holes in the interior which
really<00:01:19.290> isn't<00:01:19.470> necessary<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.340> everything

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
really isn't necessary to get everything

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.539 
really isn't necessary to get everything
to<00:01:20.820> fit<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.150> there<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:21.979> somebody<00:01:22.979> some<00:01:23.250> people

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
to fit in there but somebody some people

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.800 
to fit in there but somebody some people
obviously<00:01:23.820> build<00:01:24.299> things<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.570> little<00:01:24.659> bit

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
obviously build things a little bit

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.810 
obviously build things a little bit
differently<00:01:25.229> than<00:01:25.439> others<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.520> there<00:01:26.729> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
differently than others and there you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
differently than others and there you
can<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.180> large<00:01:27.720> LEDs<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.290> there<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
can see the large LEDs and there in the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.840 
can see the large LEDs and there in the
back<00:01:29.040> package<00:01:29.520> tray<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.979> then<00:01:31.979> also<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:34.850> gas

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
back package tray and then also the gas

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.679 
back package tray and then also the gas
tank<00:01:36.150> has<00:01:36.750> been<00:01:36.780> cut<00:01:37.170> away<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:38.270> large<00:01:39.270> sweep

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
tank has been cut away the large sweep

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
not up to standard as far as I'm

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.460 
not up to standard as far as I'm
concerned<00:01:49.470> ways<00:01:50.189> uh<00:01:50.430> ways<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.810> cars<00:01:52.140> built

actually<00:01:55.649> did<00:01:55.770> drill<00:01:55.950> some<00:01:56.070> holes<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
actually did drill some holes in the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.179 
actually did drill some holes in the
bottom<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.439> chassis<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.770> car<00:01:58.860> there

bottom of the chassis of the car there

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.649 
bottom of the chassis of the car there
for<00:01:59.369> some<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.670> sound<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.060> come<00:02:00.240> asshole

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
for some of the sound to come asshole

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.510 
for some of the sound to come asshole
least<00:02:01.200> they<00:02:01.320> went<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.649> far<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.310> guess

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
least they went that far with it I guess

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
least they went that far with it I guess
we're<00:02:02.759> busy<00:02:03.149> cutting<00:02:03.329> holes<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.780> figured<00:02:04.049> girl

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
we're busy cutting holes I figured girl

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.450 
we're busy cutting holes I figured girl
in<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.409> few<00:02:04.560> extra<00:02:04.680> holes<00:02:05.009> wouldn't<00:02:05.369> hurt

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
in a few extra holes wouldn't hurt

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.589 
in a few extra holes wouldn't hurt
anything<00:02:06.229> but<00:02:07.229> there<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.590> I'll<00:02:08.599> get

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
anything but there we have it I'll get

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.300 
anything but there we have it I'll get
this<00:02:09.840> car<00:02:10.080> together<00:02:10.229> no<00:02:10.679> circuit<00:02:11.039> board<00:02:11.220> too

this car together no circuit board too
involved<00:02:11.520> with<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.879> one

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
involved with this one

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.360 
involved with this one
there<00:02:12.430> was<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:13.350> did<00:02:14.350> have<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.530> one<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.100> fourth

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
there was a did have a one of the fourth

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.750 
there was a did have a one of the fourth

tone siren kits installed in it selling
board<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.180> actually<00:02:19.540> used<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:21.450> rest<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
board it's actually used the rest of the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.490 
board it's actually used the rest of the
all<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.880> LEDs<00:02:25.030> are<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.600> random<00:02:25.780> flashing

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
all the LEDs are just random flashing

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.710 
all the LEDs are just random flashing
which<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.340> probably<00:02:27.640> why<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.300> lot<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.569> this

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
which is probably why a lot of this

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.110 
which is probably why a lot of this
wiring<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:29.319> here<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.560> can<00:02:29.680> see<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.130> if<00:02:30.970> you

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
wiring is here you can see the if you

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.610 
wiring is here you can see the if you
actually<00:02:31.270> see<00:02:31.569> some<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.870> resistors<00:02:32.440> down

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
actually see some of the resistors down

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.059 
actually see some of the resistors down
here<00:02:32.770> on<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.890> bottom<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:35.410> does<00:02:35.590> kind<00:02:35.800> of<00:02:35.830> group

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
here on the bottom it does kind of group

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.160 
here on the bottom it does kind of group
resistors<00:02:36.700> together<00:02:37.030> usually<00:02:37.600> I<00:02:37.840> build<00:02:38.110> these

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
resistors together usually I build these

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.070 
resistors together usually I build these
cars<00:02:38.440> i'll<00:02:38.620> put<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.800> resistor<00:02:39.250> on<00:02:39.340> each<00:02:39.550> LED

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
cars i'll put a resistor on each LED

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.940 
cars i'll put a resistor on each LED
makes<00:02:41.080> for<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.290> neater<00:02:41.470> flash<00:02:43.320> just<00:02:44.320> actually

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
makes for a neater flash just actually

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.229 
makes for a neater flash just actually
looks<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.220> lot<00:02:45.340> better<00:02:45.580> than<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.880> being<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> lot

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
looks a lot better than to being a lot

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.520 
looks a lot better than to being a lot
neater<00:02:46.420> instead<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.870> cramming<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.260> bunch<00:02:47.440> of

you<00:02:51.130> know<00:02:51.160> ground<00:02:51.550> wires<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.150> hop<00:02:52.360> or

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
you know ground wires and hop or

positive wires or another with a car but

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.449 
positive wires or another with a car but
anyway<00:02:55.570> it<00:02:55.660> makes<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.900> lot<00:02:56.280> thanks<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.340> lot

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
anyway it makes a lot thanks a lot

anyway it makes a lot thanks a lot
neater<00:02:57.670> appearance<00:02:58.209> what's<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.450> car's

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
neater appearance what's the car's

neater appearance what's the car's
finish<00:02:58.989> if<00:02:59.110> you<00:02:59.170> do<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.590> way<00:02:59.800> anyway

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
finish if you do it that way anyway

finish if you do it that way anyway
again<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.510> not<00:03:01.540> my<00:03:01.989> car<00:03:02.260> don't<00:03:02.650> confuse

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
again this is not my car don't confuse

again this is not my car don't confuse
this<00:03:03.160> with<00:03:03.220> anything<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:03.790> would<00:03:03.940> possibly<00:03:04.209> even

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
this with anything I would possibly even

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.770 
this with anything I would possibly even
sell<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.350> little<00:03:06.340> on<00:03:06.459> build<00:03:06.730> even<00:03:07.090> for<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.600> keep
