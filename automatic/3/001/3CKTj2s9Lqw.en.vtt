 single pickets here in the vicinity 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.570
 McDonalds restaurant a couple of days ago 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.870
 Ladin Zhirinovsky called on all residents 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.210
 Russia to boycott McDonalds as 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.710
 representative of american business like 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.210
 a company that is very clear 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.489
 associated with the American way 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.870
 living with their culture and plus to everything 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.719
 you need to add this 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.939
 really junk food is foods 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.740
 which badly affect the metabolism i 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.430
 mcdonalds victim himself at one time 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.050
 when i had 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.180
 failing to eat manganese for up to 2 months 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.280
 gained 9 pounds of weight earned himself 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.610
 lifelong gastritis mcdonalds and not 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.160
 was our city for many years to the end 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.810
 90s and we lived normally 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.700
 fed and today I see there only 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.010
 schoolchildren do not understand about walking 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.780
 training sessions or they are in free 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.310
 time that is, they are engaged in pussy 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.310
 instead of sports sections they chew 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.680
 hamburgers get fat and in 30 years die from 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.590
 heart attack we have a huge national 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.899
 kitchen and completely optional 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.640
 without glutamate sodium it chokes 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.859
 poison it all must feed pigs 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.810
 sorry for the expression will not people 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.850
 open pies and follow 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.729
 the quality of the products supplied themselves 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.920
 plus the most important thing is definitely an agent 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.929
 American business and we are united 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.979
 states showed how negative they were 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.140
 belong to Russia 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.509
 so I see no reason for 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.009
 which this company should continue 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.170
 work in Russia now they have 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.939
 may close voluntarily and may 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.160
 can somehow be assimilated 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.819
 McDonalds so to speak under our Russian 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.540
 coloring dumplings borscht burgers 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.209
 mcdonalds 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.670
 as a pop culture phenomenon as a phenomenon 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.110
 food culture so why do something 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.510
 adapt variable then with us and so 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.610

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.980
 symbol of american culture nasty 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.420

 I am not dependent on clothes 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:56.340
 I support our Russian seem 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:58.900
 Please, that is such an opinion that 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.810
 build subway Samara prevents it 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.790
 mcdonalds how do you think here it is 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.169
 is the stumbling block 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.519
 or have the city administration and 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.409
 this institution here for a long time 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.269
 trial by gender 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.879
 that they do not give land 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.650
 Roughly speaking if McDonald's will carry the 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:22.690
 all subways will ride in a year 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.639
 block the road here 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.470
 construction activities for a while 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.380
 will have to close mcdonalds to 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.409
 surely incur certain losses but 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.289
 but the city will say hello 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.169
 Please do you see as so 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.229
 say fast food chains 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.580
 alternative to mcdonalds in samara 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.849
 alternative but in principle alternative 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.510
 you can always find that is if you think 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:52.360
 why why sure yes here 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.539
 american some kind of food really 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.880
 earlier there was a fast-food chain 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.770
 various donuts sold that is it 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.470
 really liked the population 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.539
 its domestic much better than 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.479
 West but you might as well do 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.669
 something its not mcdonalds people 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.880
 all the same where it is necessary will walk 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.849
 eat that is it will be a help but 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.529
 this is again the city administration minor 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.409
 private there are ours 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.659
 people they organize after all and all this 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.179
 Hello, please tell me 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:27.639
 Here is an opinion that McDonalds 

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:30.429
 it's not just a fast food chain 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.639
 and this part of the cunning plan of the United 

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:35.799
 states of america and world government 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.739
 directed against Russia what exactly is 

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:41.949
 through these transgenes and fats through gamow 

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:44.139
 they want to weaken our nation like you 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.329
 consider from really so or just 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.979
 beautiful legends 

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:48.699
 I think in any case what is needed 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.320
 support domestic 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:55.350
 manufacturer and why pay 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.110
 American firms here tell 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.300
 Please, Iâ€™m the nearest one from here. 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.820
 we want to have a bite 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.510
 surely let's not go macdon spa tonight 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.030
 picket 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.250
 but where do you go 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:13.890
 may be the nearest address direction 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:16.320
 stops fast-food chains that 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:19.500
 moving from place to place us in 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.410
 Mostly on stops there are on frequent 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.420
 or where a large cross network such 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.070
 fast food 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.620
 good afternoon please tell me here 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.230
 today as we see all the action against 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.530
 mcdonalds restaurant chains like you 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.200
 Do you think there are restaurants in the menu 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.300
 there may be some conditional products 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.910
 saying useful which can 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.670
 eat or exactly 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:49.110
 all harmful and so to say bad i don't 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.790
 eat at sunrise knowing me this is not 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:57.270
 interested in herding me in principle not 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:07:01.130
 interests know a certain raiden in 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:06.600
 McDonald's menu is unknown to you 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:09.650
 thank you after listening to all the opinions I came to 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:13.170
 The following conclusion is McDonald Samara 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.350
 is subject to immediate closure enough 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:18.600
 feed us the washington hawks 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:22.140
 table uncle Sam need to pound 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.550
 boards and we will choose quality 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.940
 and healthy food 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:29.100
 give the Soviet dumplings was with you 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.370
 Andrei Artemov and mediaportal other 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.370
 city
