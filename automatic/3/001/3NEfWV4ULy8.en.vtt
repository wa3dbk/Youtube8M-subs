00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.349
 hi there, you're on the blitz fan channel and with 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.890
 by you i am 701 and today we will talk about 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.730
 tank fv215b recently published a review 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.520
 with plenty 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.090
 tsiferok and in the same video within 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.630
 rubrics 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.630
 x-factor i will tell about my impression 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.570
 and about your opinion about this car and begin 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.320
 we have traditionally from booking or 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.540
 booking does not matter our reservation is not 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.120
 for tanking the food in this review we 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.370
 we will often compare this car with t110 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.739
 again as they are very similar as by 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.680
 characteristics and tasks in combat 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.840
 so here going back to armor tank we 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.350
 we can only if we are very, very 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 lucky to catch the ricochet tower though 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.789
 has a rather large bowl of cheeks very 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.879
 easily penetrate even armor piercing 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.440
 to the upper housing shells have broneliste 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.359
 we are armored well and we can them 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.780
 tank however rear location 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.180
 towers will not allow us to profitably tank 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.100
 because of the shelters so most often your 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.950
 the casing will be fully open and therefore 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.270
 Again, we are all punch so to 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.460
 second line tank 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.119
 no, you canâ€™t call him that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.340
 really break out but not alone 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.130
 otherwise you will play fast and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.420
 the pleasure of battle will not get many 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.869
 believe that this tank can 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.000
 to tank overboard and this is again a lottery 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.610
 if you're lucky and the opponent will 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.710
 for example with cumulatives up to the screen of you 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.350
 will save and in principle you are about trading but 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.659
 in most cases, the board is not at all 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.090
 part of there how that is worth beating 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.090
 strikes further we touch the mobility and 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.850
 it is again comparable to t110 e5 we 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.939
 pretty cool spinning fast going 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 like a country for a heavy tank fast 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.600
 allowing us at some point either 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.090
 retreat 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.040
 either change position but quickly 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.680
 and as a place for example a position you are not 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.170
 change so you still have to 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.750
 correctly choose the direction and in order 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.730
 let the taste of the review remain pleasant 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.190
 first we'll talk about the disadvantages of a 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.650
 there I did not mention in the review but which 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.470
 really extremely important and lack of 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.180
 this is called kritu imost 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.819
 I don't know how engineers 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.150
 laid out there modules but in whatever place 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:32.290
 you are not bummed at you either creed bk 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.390
 either fire well we arrived great tank 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.599
 really criticized in all places 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.269
 where not plus 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.940
 carry a 4m and then of course we would 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:47.230
 felt just fine so 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.510
 what if you suddenly decide to tank that 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.730
 principle already not entirely reasonable 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.290
 the decision then you can safely get ready 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.379
 either to desertion 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.379
 one of the crew members either to fire 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.030
 or crit of all kinds of other modules 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.239
 And finally, how could you have 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.390
 guess if you looked of course my 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:11.739
 review this gun is the sweetest and tastiest 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.569
 part of this tank is just awesome 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.049
 it's really great, I crate 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.690
 I consider carefully the best weapon in the game 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.910
 more comfortable gameplay of course in 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.370
 shooting plan I'm not in this game yet 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.519
 met maybe my opinion will change 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.370
 but at the moment I think this is the best 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.340
 but we have a tool in the game 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.060
 mastodons like there for example is-7 or 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.299
 e100 who skillfully hide their bottom 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.359
 frontal detail and punch them hard 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.519
 well nobody canceled gold she has 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.799
 just transcendental and breaking through if you well 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.250
 not at all mogot and too lazy to target 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.290
 You can safely charge the golden shells and 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.989
 forward and then we do all we break through and 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.510
 if all this is still flavored and adrenaline 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.980
 fan and one hundred percent crew 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.329
 you will be you crazy tpm just 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.720
 incredible for both heavy tank and 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:10.299
 Certainly somewhat higher than t110 e5 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.959
 conclusion what do you want property 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.150
 do it I liked the tank but 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.900
 if your hands are not straight like 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.239
 rulers 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.530
 play it will be almost 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.000
 impossible yes this tank is very very very 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.040
 skill dependent 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.250
 so if you are ready for heavy 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.410
 a challenge yes surely is your choice and 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.360
 if you are actually ready 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.910
 hide in a heavy tank they 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.430
 tease and shoot crazy 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.100
 dpm and we are breaking through to anyone who can 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.560
 you will meet regardless of armor this 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.560
 definitely your choice but if you 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.110
 want gameplay simpler anything 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.510
 such relax after work then 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.020
 certainly worth looking away 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.330
 another tank and on this today, all over the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.800
