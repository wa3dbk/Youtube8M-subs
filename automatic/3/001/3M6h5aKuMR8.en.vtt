00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.940
 Christian Grilz has in his 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.340
 master thesis a technical check 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.810
 the function of the so-called bio 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.880
 solar house carried out 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.340
 this is a house in the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.590
 hausconcept surrounds an outer shell 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.449
 the real house stays in between 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.490
 a room filled with air as 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.290
 Thermal insulation and as a wet regulator 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.150
 the air layer in the facades serves 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.230
 is with a winter garden and in the 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.210
 attic connected 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.070
 Christian Grilz has an extensive 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.809
 basic study both by means of 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.400
 theoretical calculations as well 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.350
 by means of practical measurements in 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.600
 completed projects 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.790
 the main focus is on eco-energy 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.660
 but technicians on the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.370
 flow simulation placed around the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.989
 Behavior of the air cushion layers 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.059
 realistic to examine 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.579
 the goal of my flow simulation 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.199
 Burda she knows about the 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.160
 flow course and the 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.379
 Temperature curve in the air gap or in the 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.360
 Aerial of the winter garden and the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.190
 Rooftop of the building profits 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.750
 I have two reasons for that 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.600
 summer and simulated in winter 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.100
 Special attention was paid to the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.190
 summer meeting of the building 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.869
 were directed special 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.560
 vents and shadows in 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.649
 the model was incorporated and these were 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.390
 then calculated and 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.759
 Optimization suggestions were from it 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.830
 The special thing is that this is derived 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.220
 house concept not yet 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.869
 has been scientifically studied 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.000
 and mister grill zotter comprehensive 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.360
 calculations of basic research 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.030
 operated and then ultimately has 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.280
 The simulation performed very much 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.270
 were extensive and a limit of it 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.660
 go where it is currently 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.280
 flow simulation is possible but with 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.259
 a lot of skill and effort or then 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.090
 mastered this task 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.550
 this is especially valuable because of that 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.369
 because the client has this concept 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.560
 want to implement and above all in one 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.569
 would like to duplicate the settlement and you 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.679
 multiply that error and that can 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.679
 avoid it now
