are<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.309> ready<00:00:34.250> let's<00:00:35.250> consider<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.149> case<00:00:36.320> 11

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
are we ready let's consider the case 11

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.670 
are we ready let's consider the case 11
versus<00:00:40.700> 666<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.540> least<00:00:42.870> common<00:00:43.440> multiple

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
versus 666 is the least common multiple

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.340 
versus 666 is the least common multiple
of<00:00:44.460> 6<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.390> 11<00:00:45.570> right<00:00:47.300> what<00:00:48.300> we'll<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.020> draw

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
of 6 and 11 right what we'll do is draw

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.049 
of 6 and 11 right what we'll do is draw
a<00:00:49.590> grid<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.340> 66<00:00:51.300> columns<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.370> then<00:00:53.370> separate

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
a grid of 66 columns and then separate

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.020 
a grid of 66 columns and then separate
that<00:00:54.329> into<00:00:54.690> equal<00:00:55.379> blocks<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.190> sixes<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.480> 11s

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
that into equal blocks of sixes and 11s

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.399 
that into equal blocks of sixes and 11s
you<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.750> next<00:01:00.930> picture<00:01:02.870> each<00:01:03.870> green

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.219 
you see in the next picture each green
box<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.220> six<00:01:05.760> columns<00:01:06.390> wide<00:01:08.240> 11<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.540> these<00:01:09.810> make

wide 6 of these make 66 columns now you
could<00:01:25.560> see<00:01:25.830> precisely<00:01:26.400> how<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:28.020> 11<00:01:28.770> green

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
could see precisely how the 11 green

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
could see precisely how the 11 green
dots<00:01:29.720> fit<00:01:30.720> over<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.770> six<00:01:32.159> red<00:01:32.729> dots<00:01:35.960> for<00:01:36.960> 22
