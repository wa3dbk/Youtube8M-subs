00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.380
 I do not know 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.269
 a little bit about the ford brand and 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.220
 Ford has just presented a few days ago 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.270
 also the new ford age a flower of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.340
 made to have an opportunity to 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.820
 know her just in the autoshow of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.490
 This year's Detroit changed radically 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.009
 the exterior design of the front 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.070
 of the new made we see a loss already 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.410
 not as solid as the previous one much more 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.360
 much more stylized dynamics in this 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.760
 occasion also the side lines will 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.719
 they accentuate more than they let see a vehicle 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.609
 much more sporty much more current in 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.589
 your designs and in your delivery and good 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.589
 seen he was the perfect scenario for 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.449
 that the presentation of this 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:54.390
 off-road brand ford while 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.999
 that made her creation mark fields want 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.120
 more who is already in the final stretch of 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:02.940
 become the CEO of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.980
 Ford Motor Company now that the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.659
 substitution of Mr. alan mulally good 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.960
 Mr. Ivory is also a great 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.760
 friend of Mr. bill ford plan we are going to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.250
 be going to be directing shortly and 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.829
 it was he who made the announcement 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.880
 of presentation already of this new form 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.890
 2015 the presentation was made 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.869
 content within the framework of the start of 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.079
 train conferences that the manufacturer of 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.240
 Ford cars every year there in 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.920
 vigor and that somehow he served 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.619
 also to publicize this 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.509
 van the first stop of the renovated 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.069
 Ford urban off-road in the 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.530
 distributors or concessionaire will be 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.810
 North America from 2015 onwards 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.909
 of giving to the market of South America europe and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.270
 asia pacifico with sale plans in more 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.100
 from 100 markets around the world 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.020
 there was talk of somehow some 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.630
 characteristics of the vehicle we still 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.390
 they let see the motorization but it is spoken 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.520
 that next year will already be 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.560
 also here with us in the market 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.039
 Mexican and will obviously add to all 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.479
 the range of products or the portfolio that 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.369
 today the ford brand is offering in 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.349
 mexico now that important also in 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.470
 this in that segment where the form is 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.569
 there are not many competitors because the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.090
 segment that is strongly competed is 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.700
 the segment of the medium sessions in 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.650
 where they have skype that is today one 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.080
 of valuable sites with EcoBoost 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.940
 clear not of 2 liters 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.220
 but in the segment where it will be made 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.470
 that is going to compete with those who are going 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.180
 little bit more down the crossovers and 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.090
 you better mind with premium brands 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.130
 that are not necessarily the ones that have 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.040
 in your vis like that of such will be for 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.900
 example 5 will be x 3 will be the region and mou 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.970
 against whom keeping proportions 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.260
 can compete because in addition to here 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.260
 the platform itself is also detached 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.260
 that I got married like this is from lincoln like that 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.870
 let's see how how success goes 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.670
 that the previous generation had in fact 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.080
 it was very good there were moments in the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.450
 which was said that maybe a 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.130
 a little bit of variants in the same delivery 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.540
 engines would be very good because 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.120
 it only came with the six engine 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.190
 cylinders then if we can have a 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.140
 has done with variants in engines where 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.900
 we can have a notorious bulls of two 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.480
 liters with 200 horses 240 caballitos 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.360
 it would go very well and have one for all 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.340
 those 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.590
 still nostalgic for the great 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.970
 one engine one six engine 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.750
 cylinders that you are delivering that you 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.470
 like 295 290 horsepower 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.630
 Well look now I have to give 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.610
 variants in a product that I think you 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.380
 it's going very well we invite you to follow 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.280
 questioning the information with 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.280
