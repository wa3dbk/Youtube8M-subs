is<00:00:32.840> what<00:00:33.050> we<00:00:33.170> call<00:00:33.200> our<00:00:33.590> actual<00:00:34.250> bodywork<00:00:34.730> and

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
is what we call our actual bodywork and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.430 
is what we call our actual bodywork and
repairing<00:00:35.480> methods<00:00:37.450> we<00:00:38.450> will<00:00:38.480> demonstrate<00:00:38.780> on

methods to obtain and achieve a perfect
finish<00:00:52.480> as<00:00:53.480> you<00:00:53.660> can<00:00:53.809> see<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:55.730> repair<00:00:56.120> that<00:00:56.150> is

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
finish as you can see the repair that is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.950 
finish as you can see the repair that is
now<00:00:56.809> using<00:00:57.290> a<00:00:57.470> sanding<00:00:57.860> block<00:00:58.210> with<00:00:59.210> 80s<00:00:59.690> grit

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
now using a sanding block with 80s grit

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.459 
now using a sanding block with 80s grit
paper<00:01:01.270> is<00:01:02.270> flattened<00:01:02.750> down<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.079> body<00:01:03.260> filler

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
paper is flattened down the body filler

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.900 
paper is flattened down the body filler
and<00:01:04.390> using<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.479> crosshatch<00:01:06.110> motion<00:01:06.910> which

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
and using a crosshatch motion which

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.609 
and using a crosshatch motion which
basically<00:01:08.300> means<00:01:08.660> is<00:01:08.869> moving<00:01:09.259> from<00:01:09.440> the

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
basically means is moving from the

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.889 
basically means is moving from the
forward<00:01:10.009> and<00:01:10.039> backwards<00:01:10.490> motion<00:01:10.729> left<00:01:11.690> and

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
forward and backwards motion left and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.580 
forward and backwards motion left and
right<00:01:12.050> and<00:01:12.350> then<00:01:12.440> up<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:12.770> down<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:15.259> reason

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
right and then up and down the reason

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.980 
right and then up and down the reason
for<00:01:15.740> this<00:01:15.890> is<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:17.030> ensure<00:01:17.180> that<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.840> body

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
for this is to ensure that the body

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.740 
for this is to ensure that the body
filler<00:01:18.289> is<00:01:18.890> smooth<00:01:19.550> into<00:01:19.940> all<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.360> contours

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
filler is smooth into all the contours

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.719 
filler is smooth into all the contours
and<00:01:20.899> crevices<00:01:21.410> of<00:01:21.590> each<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.130> individual

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
and crevices of each and individual

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:32.890 
and crevices of each and individual
panel<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.890> may<00:01:28.070> take<00:01:28.630> anywhere<00:01:29.630> between<00:01:30.039> 15<00:01:31.900> to

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
panel it may take anywhere between 15 to

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.110 
panel it may take anywhere between 15 to
maybe<00:01:33.140> an<00:01:33.320> hour<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.710> actually<00:01:34.189> achieve<00:01:34.490> this

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.090 

yeah

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.969 

as<00:01:45.100> you<00:01:45.250> can<00:01:45.399> see<00:01:45.579> the<00:01:45.820> action<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.829> the

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
as you can see the action that the

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.819 
as you can see the action that the
parameter<00:01:48.369> is<00:01:48.640> using<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.229> forwards<00:01:50.740> and

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
parameter is using is a forwards and

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.210 
parameter is using is a forwards and
backwards<00:01:51.009> motion<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.320> can't<00:01:53.530> also<00:01:53.890> top

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
backwards motion if you can't also top

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.490 
backwards motion if you can't also top
right<00:01:54.460> hand<00:01:54.670> side<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.630> can<00:01:55.840> see<00:01:55.869> that<00:01:56.079> the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
right hand side you can see that the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.469 
right hand side you can see that the
body<00:01:56.829> filler<00:01:57.100> is<00:01:57.250> actually<00:01:57.670> feathered<00:01:58.149> into

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
body filler is actually feathered into

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.410 
body filler is actually feathered into
the<00:01:58.659> actual<00:01:58.990> original<00:01:59.229> framework<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:01.240> is

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
the actual original framework this is

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.710 
the actual original framework this is
paramount<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.520> baby<00:02:03.729> fella<00:02:04.030> isn't

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
paramount if the baby fella isn't

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.999 
paramount if the baby fella isn't

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.520 
best results as the human hand is neck
fat<00:02:36.360> hence<00:02:37.360> that's<00:02:37.599> why<00:02:37.750> we<00:02:38.019> use<00:02:38.170> within

final process of what we call finding
golf<00:04:13.920> will<00:04:14.880> begin<00:04:17.000> we<00:04:18.000> do<00:04:18.150> this<00:04:18.330> using<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.720> finer

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
golf will begin we do this using a finer

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.940 
golf will begin we do this using a finer
grade<00:04:19.290> of<00:04:19.440> paper<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.989> paper<00:04:22.260> is<00:04:22.440> measured<00:04:22.800> in

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
grade of paper the paper is measured in

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.690 
grade of paper the paper is measured in
grip<00:04:23.190> very<00:04:23.460> much<00:04:24.320> from<00:04:25.320> forties<00:04:25.860> which<00:04:26.460> is<00:04:26.670> a

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
grip very much from forties which is a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.650 
grip very much from forties which is a
very<00:04:27.060> very<00:04:27.300> coarse<00:04:27.750> grip<00:04:28.550> down<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.880> three

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
very very coarse grip down to three

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.280 
very very coarse grip down to three
twenties<00:04:31.170> which<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:31.890> a<00:04:31.920> very<00:04:32.190> very<00:04:32.400> fine<00:04:32.670> grip

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
twenties which is a very very fine grip

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.010 
twenties which is a very very fine grip
the<00:04:34.290> reason<00:04:34.680> for<00:04:34.860> this<00:04:35.010> is<00:04:35.850> that<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.750> finer

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
the reason for this is that the finer

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.260 
the reason for this is that the finer
the<00:04:37.260> grit<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.860> finer<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.730> finish<00:04:39.000> on<00:04:39.150> the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
the grit the finer the finish on the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.750 
the grit the finer the finish on the
paint

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
paint

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.540 
paint
when<00:04:41.760> primer<00:04:42.030> is<00:04:42.180> applied<00:04:42.920> to<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.040> finally

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
when primer is applied to the finally

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.030 
when primer is applied to the finally
prepared<00:04:44.970> panel<00:04:45.950> using<00:04:46.950> three<00:04:47.160> twenties

family<00:04:50.040> will<00:04:50.160> add<00:04:50.280> air<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.900> very<00:04:52.110> very

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
family will add air to the very very

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.530 
family will add air to the very very
fine<00:04:52.620> sketches<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.910> three<00:04:54.090> twenties

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
fine sketches of the three twenties

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.990 
fine sketches of the three twenties
leaves<00:04:54.780> behind<00:04:55.020> this<00:04:56.010> will<00:04:56.220> be<00:04:56.340> demonstrated

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
leaves behind this will be demonstrated

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:09.990 
leaves behind this will be demonstrated
in<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.180> next<00:04:57.450> chapter

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.760 

so<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.630> idea<00:05:10.960> is<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.230> start<00:05:11.260> off<00:05:11.560> with<00:05:11.590> a

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
so the idea is you start off with a

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.840 
so the idea is you start off with a
course<00:05:12.010> trade<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.760> then

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.120 

by<00:05:16.390> using<00:05:16.630> a<00:05:16.780> finer<00:05:17.020> grit<00:05:17.260> paper<00:05:17.530> well<00:05:17.980> this

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
by using a finer grit paper well this

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.880 
by using a finer grit paper well this
will<00:05:18.460> also<00:05:18.640> ensure<00:05:19.380> that<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.530> amount<00:05:20.770> of

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
will also ensure that the amount of

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.370 
will also ensure that the amount of
primer<00:05:21.190> needed<00:05:21.700> to<00:05:22.090> cover<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.390> repair<00:05:22.840> or<00:05:23.140> be

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
primer needed to cover the repair or be

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:37.780 
primer needed to cover the repair or be
less

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.389 

yeah

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:43.399 

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:46.399 

okay
