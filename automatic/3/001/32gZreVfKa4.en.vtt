00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.300
 hello guys in this video we will learn 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.570
 to create these beautiful masks e 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.520
 made very simple to make lace 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.980
 but of great effect as you can 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.930
 see from the perfect images for the 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.919
 carnival or for a party in 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.919
 mask between friends 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.039
 we see what materials we need there 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.199
 it will serve as a base for tulle 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.210
 obviously you can choose the color 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.519
 which you like most of the glitter crowd 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.219
 also this one of the color that you like most 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.620
 a lead imitation tube for 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.180
 glass painting I leave its golden but 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.100
 you can also choose this one from 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:59.269
 color that you like most about the film 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:01.219
 for food and paper scotch if 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.719
 do you want to use this mask for the 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.670
 St. Patrick's Day 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.659
 you can use a drilling machine like 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.719
 this 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.090
 in the shape of a clover and decorate the 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:14.259
 your mask with many motifs 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.259
 small green clovers 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.950
 you will also need a photocopy with the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.560
 form of a mask 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.880
 I chose this one that reminds me of lace 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.340
 I put the link below for you 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.649
 download it and now let's see how 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.179
 support the photocopy with the print 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.960
 of the mask on your plan of 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.670
 work 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.759
 Take the pieces of scotch 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.020
 paper and secure the photocopy at 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.479
 work plan 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.969
 in this way positioned above the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.850
 your photocopy a piece of film 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:49.619
 food and even though this is 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.880
 well with the paper scotch will have to 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.399
 be well pesio 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.350
 now take your tulle 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.299
 cut out a rectangle in which you are 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.549
 enter the form of the mask but 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.170
 stay abundant and this too a 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.170
 fix it with the paper tape 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.910
 now take your glitter glue 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.250
 start spending it flush following 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.610
 all the sinuous lines they represent 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.740
 the lace of your mask for 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.230
 this operation try to be the 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.570
 as accurate as possible take the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.720
 your time to do it and don't have 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.720
 hurry 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.080
 cover all the lines with glue 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.770
 main representing the contours 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.770
 of your mask 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.189
 it is essential that the glue stick 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.470
 glitterata has a regulator a 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.920
 spout like this to help you 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.920
 in the operation 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.799
 after passing the glitter glue 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.659
 I take my paint tube effect 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.489
 lead and then I go to apply them on 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.310
 its elongated spout that I need 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.079
 to spread the color continuously 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.280
 then with the golden color 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.079
 to follow all the lines that 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.859
 they represent a piece of mine 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.200
 mask painting made lead has 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.659
 a very different consistency than 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.319
 that glitter and therefore is very different 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.209
 the drawing up 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.659
 the weave of golden threads will result 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.489
 in fact much more precise and once 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.109
 let it be all well dried 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.090
 this is the result 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.909
 when you see we removed the piece 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.400
 of tulle and voila one was formed 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.400
 wonderful lace effect mask 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.190
 now all that remains is to take some scissors 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.410
 and cut the crowds all along the 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.200
 perimeter of the mask but not 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.810
 cut out from too much thread left 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.519
 at least a half centimeter of space between 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.519
 the mask and the tulle 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.350
 and that's what you want to get 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.969
 now all that remains is to attach the rubber band 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.080
 which will allow us to wear the 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:38.759
 mask 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.610
 to do this there are 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.590
 certainly many different methods 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.569
 I decided to cut the pieces 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.969
 of golden paper and cut out a piece of 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.740
 elastic after having obviously taken the 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.229
 measurements of the circumference of mine 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.330
 head and now with vinavil glue 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.069
 go and simply paste 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.840
 the elastic on both sides of the 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.319
 mask then spread a veil of 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.349
 vinyl glue in this way 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:06.000
 place the elastic on the glue 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:09.590
 pass another layer of glue over it 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.590
 the elastic in this way 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.390
 and go and close it with the two 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.250
 small pieces of paper 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.680
 for this operation you can decide to 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.849
 also use two small pieces if desired 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.490
 of cloth 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.619
 you have to trap the elastic with the 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.409
 glue inside the two pieces of 

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:30.599
 paper this way and now 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.659
 repeat the same operation on the other 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:36.709
 side and this is the result once 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.709
 applied the elastic 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.200
 good guys our effect mask 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.110
 lace is completed with a lot of elastic 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.150
 to be able to apply it to the face with this 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.220
 system you can create an infinite number of 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.620
 different masks with many different shapes 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.210
 and many different colors depending on the 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.960
 your good taste and yours 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.590

 what do you think about me like the effect 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.400
