00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 At the beginning of the year I receive many challenges at these times. 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.639
 own ability to overcome difficulties we'll see now 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.520
 stories of people who have encountered 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.520
 and give great examples of overcoming 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.650
 the road seems longer tiring 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.760
 the body still takes time to respond to the controls of the brain according to witnesses 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.759
 This bike was piloted when it crossed a 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.339
 hit by a car 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.550
 were 11 days of hospitalization in uti in severe condition 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.940
 the medical team performed an emergency surgery to implant a reinforcement 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.280
 in the boy's clasp 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.050
 with the impact of the accident 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.300
 the brain moved in the skull in the optic nerve was injured 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.080
 making Gustavo have the temporary temptations a vision 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.480
 distortion similar to this 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.680
 he says that the most difficult moment was the return of the command 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.940
 many of your relatives 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.740
 following the incident 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.870
 two sons of the Libyan leader in prison being very well recognized 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.340
 then almost out of my way I went to meet him 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.030
 the accident closed the stable to appreciation plus life 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.190
 the people in difficulty today is the limit that we have to look at the bid 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.480
 with the result he arrived at the end term 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.460
 today the pact of the country raising interest 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.680
 The next minute there was no way we're feeling 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.150
 life can be compared to the corridor being of doors no one knows what's coming 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.250
 from the front 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.490
 some have reserved joys others open to success but not always 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.729
 surprises are good as we like there is need isis I had to 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.160
 other exits despite the barriers this moment can be a 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.010
 great chance and overcoming anyone who has traveled this route knows that the other 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.150
 side to always a hope sooner or later a new opportunity can 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.300
 appear 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.300
 it's time to start a new life 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.430
 after 26 years as a teacher was assaulted and who taught a lesson to 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.110
 to lighten 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.870
 five years ago she faced cancer, has undergone treatments but in 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.160
 January of last year the disease returned in the uterus and ovaries once again she 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.150
 underwent surgery chemotherapy sessions and saw something that images and 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.469
 modify 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:34.489
 but courage overcame fear the result of the medication was a success 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:40.819
 the cancer has disappeared now clear is with healthy self-esteem recovered 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.149
 unhappy 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.489
 can not exist on-site 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.060
 why the adversities of life are for what - growth 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.319
 We always get stronger. 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.150
 March 2010 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.080
 SÃ£o Paulo said he disappeared from the taxi stand where he worked three students 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.610
 who asked for a run confessed the crimes they told the police that 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.559
 attacked run over and threw the sixth tac from a bridge 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:13.869
 a 67-year-old man was found twenty-two hours later by firefighters with 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.039
 various body wounds 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:21.129
 he had head trauma stayed in about a month in the uti and after that 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.419
 left the hospital he went into depression the experience changed to 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.819
 always the life of his accursed 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.939
 when I came to realize what was happening to me 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.569
 I thought I would not go any more because I was 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.829
 full of wires and iron 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.799
 lots of stuff that I 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.629
 It's like leaving that line. 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:44.769
 I'm just not 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.669
 doing is physically running barefoot 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.129
 but I do things my daughter is after the midfield 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:53.489
 job 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.579
 if I were to do it to me 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.069
 my life is practically normal
