00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
apply a few thin coats rather than one

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.430 
apply a few thin coats rather than one
thick<00:02:03.130> coat<00:02:03.190> if<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:03.880> apply<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:05.020> coat<00:02:05.289> that's

thick coat if you apply a coat that's

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.139 
thick coat if you apply a coat that's
too<00:02:05.649> thick<00:02:05.920> it's<00:02:06.459> going<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.729> end<00:02:06.880> up<00:02:06.940> looking

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
too thick it's going to end up looking

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.880 
too thick it's going to end up looking
weird<00:02:07.959> you're<00:02:08.259> going<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.440> have<00:02:08.560> it's<00:02:08.709> going<00:02:08.830> to

be kind of Blacky and uneven looking so
I<00:02:11.260> always<00:02:11.739> recommend<00:02:11.860> do<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.700> couple<00:02:13.120> thin

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.869 
I always recommend do a couple thin
coats<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:13.959> then<00:02:14.319> not<00:02:14.680> only<00:02:15.040> will<00:02:15.340> your<00:02:15.459> object

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879
