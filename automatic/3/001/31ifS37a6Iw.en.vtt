00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
interesting tech gadgets for all of us

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.410 
interesting tech gadgets for all of us
and<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:32.319> has<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.340> mysterious<00:02:33.849> energy<00:02:34.300> of

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
and it has the that mysterious energy of

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.880 
and it has the that mysterious energy of
Neptune<00:02:34.989> on<00:02:35.260> its<00:02:35.410> day<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:36.540> also<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:38.440> like<00:02:38.860> to

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
Neptune on its day and also I like to

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.040 
Neptune on its day and also I like to
mention<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:40.000> rival<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.569> Apple<00:02:40.900> which<00:02:41.020> is

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
mention that the rival of Apple which is

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.350 
mention that the rival of Apple which is
Samsung<00:02:42.150> also<00:02:43.150> has<00:02:43.620> exactly<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:45.370> same

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
Samsung also has exactly the same

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.610 
Samsung also has exactly the same
Neptune<00:02:47.200> energy<00:02:47.709> on<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.220> name<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:50.470> would

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
Neptune energy on that name so it would

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.370 
Neptune energy on that name so it would
be<00:02:50.739> very<00:02:50.770> interesting<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.640> see<00:02:51.940> how<00:02:52.180> these<00:02:52.930> two

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
be very interesting to see how these two

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.449 
be very interesting to see how these two
business<00:02:54.190> Giants<00:02:54.930> fare<00:02:55.930> as<00:02:56.170> time<00:02:57.130> progresses

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
business Giants fare as time progresses

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.920 
business Giants fare as time progresses
both<00:02:58.060> carrying<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.590> same<00:02:59.830> energy<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.930> Neptune

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
both carrying the same energy of Neptune

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.100 
both carrying the same energy of Neptune
so<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.160> my<00:03:03.280> take<00:03:03.519> on<00:03:03.549> number<00:03:03.910> seven<00:03:04.209> until

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
so that is my take on number seven until

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.860 
so that is my take on number seven until
they<00:03:05.350> meet<00:03:05.560> again
