and the mac app store for 499 in my
opinion<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> steel<00:01:16.920> because<00:01:17.460> um

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
opinion it's really a steel because um

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
opinion it's really a steel because um
it's<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.110> great<00:01:19.259> deal<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.070> enable<00:01:20.340> these

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
it's a great deal you can enable these

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.609 
it's a great deal you can enable these
really<00:01:21.030> awesome<00:01:21.060> features<00:01:21.750> which<00:01:22.020> alone<00:01:22.350> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
really awesome features which alone I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.350 
really awesome features which alone I
think<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.100> worth<00:01:23.250> five<00:01:23.490> dollars<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.150> lot

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
think are worth five dollars it's a lot

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
think are worth five dollars it's a lot
easier<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.900> use<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.200> device<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.369> makes

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
easier to use your device and just makes

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.390 
easier to use your device and just makes
it<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.060> lot<00:01:27.299> more<00:01:27.360> fun<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.810> use<00:01:27.930> also<00:01:28.170> while<00:01:29.100> you

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
it a lot more fun to use also while you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.700 
it a lot more fun to use also while you
can<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:30.479> access<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:32.070> Xcode<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.710> develop

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
can get access to Xcode and develop

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.109 
can get access to Xcode and develop
applications<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:37.290> don't<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.670> if

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
applications and you don't have to if

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.380 
applications and you don't have to if
you<00:01:39.570> buy<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.990> 499<00:01:40.770> app<00:01:41.189> instead<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.119> getting

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
you buy the 499 app instead of getting

the hundred-dollar Apple Developer

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.950 
the hundred-dollar Apple Developer
Program<00:01:43.950> per<00:01:44.369> year<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.600> steel

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
Program per year it's really a steel

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.200 
Program per year it's really a steel
because<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> one-time<00:01:46.890> fee<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.549> five

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
because it's a one-time fee of five

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.980 
because it's a one-time fee of five
dollars<00:01:48.659> instead<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.170> 99<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> year<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.270> you're

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
dollars instead of 99 a year so you're

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.899 
dollars instead of 99 a year so you're

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
between the applications I noticed that

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.280 
between the applications I noticed that
it<00:05:50.950> was<00:05:50.980> a<00:05:51.160> little<00:05:51.430> bit<00:05:51.610> buggy<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.270> it<00:05:52.960> didn't

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
it was a little bit buggy and it didn't

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.590 
work sometimes that's the only one
swiping<00:05:55.840> left<00:05:55.870> and<00:05:56.230> right<00:05:56.410> but<00:05:57.100> um<00:05:57.340> I<00:05:57.850> mean

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
swiping left and right but um I mean

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.470 
swiping left and right but um I mean
it's<00:05:58.870> not<00:05:59.080> fully<00:05:59.560> in<00:05:59.890> like<00:06:00.310> it's<00:06:00.700> not<00:06:00.970> part<00:06:01.330> of

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
it's not fully in like it's not part of

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.210 
it's not fully in like it's not part of
the<00:06:01.630> software<00:06:01.990> yet<00:06:02.290> I<00:06:02.530> mean<00:06:02.710> Apple<00:06:03.040> hasn't

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220

release people are thinking is just
something<00:06:14.530> Apple's<00:06:15.070> trying<00:06:15.400> seeing<00:06:16.330> whether

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
something Apple's trying seeing whether

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.990
