fuel<00:00:35.770> right<00:00:36.070> actually<00:00:36.700> our<00:00:37.180> first<00:00:37.360> model<00:00:37.660> year

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
fuel right actually our first model year

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.330 
fuel right actually our first model year
was<00:00:38.020> nineteen<00:00:38.410> ninety-eight<00:00:38.710> but<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.130> team

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
was nineteen ninety-eight but the team

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.049 
was nineteen ninety-eight but the team
was<00:00:39.489> formed<00:00:39.790> in<00:00:40.060> 1994<00:00:40.960> 1995<00:00:41.650> had<00:00:42.430> a<00:00:42.460> small

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
was formed in 1994 1995 had a small

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.819 
was formed in 1994 1995 had a small
fleet<00:00:43.329> of<00:00:43.539> development<00:00:44.230> vehicles<00:00:44.590> that<00:00:44.680> they

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
fleet of development vehicles that they

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.860 
fleet of development vehicles that they
loaned<00:00:45.100> out<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.370> fleet<00:00:45.789> clients<00:00:46.239> for<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.510> couple

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
loaned out to fleet clients for a couple

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.569 
loaned out to fleet clients for a couple
years<00:00:47.109> and<00:00:47.289> tested<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.800> viability<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.489> the

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
years and tested the viability and the

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.549 
years and tested the viability and the
durability<00:00:48.940> so<00:00:49.480> originally<00:00:49.989> it<00:00:50.079> was<00:00:50.230> it<00:00:50.469> was

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
durability so originally it was it was

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.380 
durability so originally it was it was
designed<00:00:50.920> for<00:00:51.160> fleets<00:00:51.460> yeah<00:00:52.000> there<00:00:52.239> are<00:00:52.359> a

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
designed for fleets yeah there are a

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.020 
designed for fleets yeah there are a
number<00:00:52.449> of<00:00:52.750> federal<00:00:53.199> air<00:00:53.649> quality<00:00:54.030> issues

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
number of federal air quality issues

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.790 
number of federal air quality issues
that<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.629> car<00:00:55.809> was<00:00:55.960> actually<00:00:56.079> designed<00:00:56.649> to

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
that the car was actually designed to

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.220 
that the car was actually designed to
satisfy<00:00:57.300> natural<00:00:58.300> gas<00:00:58.449> is<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.690> very<00:00:58.960> clean

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
satisfy natural gas is a very clean

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.049 
satisfy natural gas is a very clean
burning<00:00:59.440> fuel<00:00:59.590> it<00:00:59.890> burns<00:01:00.160> very<00:01:00.340> hot<00:01:00.429> and<00:01:00.850> very

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
burning fuel it burns very hot and very

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.389 
burning fuel it burns very hot and very
thoroughly<00:01:01.359> so<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.260> co2<00:01:02.469> emitted<00:01:03.129> out<00:01:03.219> the

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
thoroughly so the co2 emitted out the

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.150 
thoroughly so the co2 emitted out the
tailpipe<00:01:03.640> is<00:01:03.910> actually<00:01:04.449> 25%<00:01:05.260> less<00:01:05.530> than<00:01:06.130> a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
tailpipe is actually 25% less than a

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.830 
tailpipe is actually 25% less than a
gasoline-powered<00:01:06.730> vehicle

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.929 

so<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.590> different<00:01:11.890> engine<00:01:12.250> does<00:01:12.430> it<00:01:12.579> there's

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
so the different engine does it there's

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.310 
so the different engine does it there's
a<00:01:13.000> function<00:01:13.420> different<00:01:13.780> as<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:13.960> perform

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
a function different as a perform

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.350 
a function different as a perform
difference<00:01:14.740> because<00:01:15.549> the<00:01:15.700> field<00:01:15.909> does<00:01:16.149> burn

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
difference because the field does burn

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.749 
difference because the field does burn
hot<00:01:16.659> we<00:01:17.049> beefed<00:01:17.320> up<00:01:17.530> several<00:01:18.250> internal

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
hot we beefed up several internal

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.999 
hot we beefed up several internal
components<00:01:19.360> in<00:01:20.110> order<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.560> take<00:01:20.770> that

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
components in order to take that

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.609 
components in order to take that
additional<00:01:21.250> heat<00:01:21.909> and<00:01:22.180> stress<00:01:22.600> gasoline<00:01:23.470> is<00:01:23.590> a

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
additional heat and stress gasoline is a

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.380 
additional heat and stress gasoline is a
very<00:01:23.860> efficient<00:01:24.340> fuel<00:01:24.549> now<00:01:24.880> there's<00:01:25.060> a<00:01:25.090> lot<00:01:25.270> of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
very efficient fuel now there's a lot of

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.889 
very efficient fuel now there's a lot of
energy<00:01:25.869> in<00:01:26.020> gasoline<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:27.189> other<00:01:27.310> forms<00:01:27.729> of

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
energy in gasoline the other forms of

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.480 
energy in gasoline the other forms of
alternative<00:01:28.899> fuels<00:01:29.170> aren't<00:01:29.470> as<00:01:29.710> energy

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
alternative fuels aren't as energy

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.039 
alternative fuels aren't as energy
efficient<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.330> pounds<00:01:31.630> per<00:01:31.720> pan<00:01:31.899> right

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
efficient the pounds per pan right

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.230 
efficient the pounds per pan right
exactly<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:32.830> what<00:01:33.340> we've<00:01:33.490> done<00:01:33.670> with<00:01:33.850> natural

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
exactly so what we've done with natural

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.179 
exactly so what we've done with natural
gas<00:01:34.390> is<00:01:34.630> we've<00:01:34.810> gone<00:01:34.990> from<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.560> 10<00:01:36.039> to<00:01:36.159> 1

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
gas is we've gone from a 10 to 1

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.830 
gas is we've gone from a 10 to 1
compression<00:01:36.640> ratio<00:01:37.270> that's<00:01:37.509> in<00:01:37.720> the

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
compression ratio that's in the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.899 
compression ratio that's in the
gasoline-powered<00:01:38.350> Civic<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.340> twelve<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:39.820> a

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
gasoline-powered Civic to twelve and a

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.669 
gasoline-powered Civic to twelve and a
half<00:01:39.939> to<00:01:40.210> one<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.810> recapture<00:01:41.229> some<00:01:41.409> of<00:01:41.619> that

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
half to one to recapture some of that

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.770 
half to one to recapture some of that
lost<00:01:41.950> energy<00:01:42.189> that<00:01:42.729> is<00:01:42.850> inherent<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.569> fuel

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
lost energy that is inherent in the fuel

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.570 
lost energy that is inherent in the fuel
ok<00:01:44.289> does<00:01:44.619> that<00:01:44.649> change<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.159> performance<00:01:45.280> I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
ok does that change the performance I

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.710 
ok does that change the performance I
mean<00:01:45.729> how<00:01:45.819> many<00:01:45.970> horsepower<00:01:46.209> are<00:01:46.390> we<00:01:46.450> talking

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
mean how many horsepower are we talking

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.230 
mean how many horsepower are we talking
about<00:01:46.780> actually<00:01:47.289> it's<00:01:47.890> almost<00:01:48.220> seamless<00:01:48.640> and

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
about actually it's almost seamless and

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.389 
about actually it's almost seamless and
the<00:01:49.390> natural<00:01:49.720> gas<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.649> platform<00:01:51.220> makes

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
the natural gas of the platform makes

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.240 
the natural gas of the platform makes
113<00:01:52.299> horse<00:01:52.659> what's<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.289> regular<00:01:53.619> Civic<00:01:53.920> yeah

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
113 horse what's a regular Civic yeah

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.120 
113 horse what's a regular Civic yeah
gasoline-powered<00:01:54.909> Civic<00:01:55.659> is<00:01:55.780> 140<00:01:56.590> okay<00:01:56.890> so

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
gasoline-powered Civic is 140 okay so

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.399 
gasoline-powered Civic is 140 okay so
drivability<00:01:57.819> wise<00:01:57.970> it's<00:01:58.569> it's<00:01:59.020> virtually

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
drivability wise it's it's virtually

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.779 
drivability wise it's it's virtually
seamless<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> driver<00:02:00.189> he's<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.610> car

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
seamless to a driver he's the car

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.460 
seamless to a driver he's the car
heavier<00:02:01.119> because<00:02:01.539> there<00:02:01.840> is<00:02:01.929> a<00:02:01.959> tank<00:02:02.259> in<00:02:02.380> the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
heavier because there is a tank in the

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.120 
heavier because there is a tank in the
back<00:02:02.500> right

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
back right

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.760

actually<00:02:03.610> it's<00:02:03.970> approximately<00:02:04.689> 50<00:02:05.439> pounds

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
actually it's approximately 50 pounds

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.380 
actually it's approximately 50 pounds
heavier<00:02:05.830> overall<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:06.880> it's<00:02:07.000> really<00:02:07.179> not<00:02:07.330> a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
heavier overall so it's really not a

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.449 
heavier overall so it's really not a
weight<00:02:07.689> issue<00:02:07.869> it's<00:02:08.560> really<00:02:08.649> simply<00:02:09.399> a

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
weight issue it's really simply a

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.600 
weight issue it's really simply a
horsepower<00:02:10.060> oh<00:02:10.830> let<00:02:11.830> me<00:02:11.890> ask<00:02:12.040> this<00:02:12.160> other<00:02:12.400> than

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
horsepower oh let me ask this other than

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.070 
horsepower oh let me ask this other than
you<00:02:13.030> pretty<00:02:13.209> much<00:02:13.360> putting<00:02:13.599> your<00:02:13.750> trunk<00:02:13.959> space

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
you pretty much putting your trunk space

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.810 
you pretty much putting your trunk space
in<00:02:14.349> half<00:02:14.500> what's<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.280> purpose<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.760> that

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
in half what's the purpose of that

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.819 
in half what's the purpose of that
compression<00:02:16.239> tank<00:02:17.079> like<00:02:17.320> what<00:02:17.500> why<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.680> that

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
compression tank like what why is that

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.740 
compression tank like what why is that
necessary<00:02:18.100> in<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.790> process<00:02:19.180> because<00:02:19.390> natural

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
necessary in the process because natural

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.960 
necessary in the process because natural
gas<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:20.109> a<00:02:20.140> compressed<00:02:20.769> fuel<00:02:21.220> physicists

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
gas is a compressed fuel physicists

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.030 
gas is a compressed fuel physicists
guess<00:02:22.120> it's<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.900> pion<00:02:23.109> it's<00:02:23.290> literally

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
guess it's the pion it's literally

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.190 
guess it's the pion it's literally
larger<00:02:24.489> than<00:02:24.640> earth<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.450> yeah<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.840> has<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.109> be

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
larger than earth so yeah it has to be

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.559 
larger than earth so yeah it has to be
pressure<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.890> know<00:02:26.980> pressurized<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.940> then

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
pressure you know pressurized and then

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.800 
pressure you know pressurized and then
at<00:02:28.920> 3,600<00:02:29.920> at<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.130> tank<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.850> has<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.660> be

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
at 3,600 at the tank it has to be

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.229 
at 3,600 at the tank it has to be
stepped<00:02:32.769> down<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.519> back<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.030> motor

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
stepped down to the back of the motor

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.030 
stepped down to the back of the motor
where<00:02:34.660> it's<00:02:34.780> injected<00:02:35.319> into<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.650> cylinders

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
where it's injected into the cylinders

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.620 
where it's injected into the cylinders
all<00:02:36.400> right<00:02:36.549> so<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.790> there<00:02:36.940> any<00:02:37.060> talk<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.480> making

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
all right so is there any talk of making

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.599 
all right so is there any talk of making
this<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.870> buy<00:02:38.140> fuel<00:02:38.470> essentially<00:02:39.280> having<00:02:39.459> the

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
this a buy fuel essentially having the

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.819 
this a buy fuel essentially having the
gas<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.269> natural<00:02:40.569> gas<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:41.139> Delta<00:02:41.560> price

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.680 
gas and the natural gas the Delta price
difference<00:02:42.190> between<00:02:42.549> gasoline<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.630> natural

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
difference between gasoline and natural

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.400 
difference between gasoline and natural
gas<00:02:44.079> is<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.590> small<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.609> the<00:02:45.970> US<00:02:46.209> market<00:02:46.630> 50<00:02:47.260> to

one of the first things you notice about
getting<00:03:27.520> in<00:03:27.640> this<00:03:27.730> Civic<00:03:28.150> is<00:03:28.360> its<00:03:28.660> well<00:03:29.440> a

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
getting in this Civic is its well a

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.210 
getting in this Civic is its well a
civic<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:31.180> inside<00:03:31.630> looks<00:03:32.290> just<00:03:32.650> like<00:03:32.890> any

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
civic the inside looks just like any

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.080 
civic the inside looks just like any
other<00:03:33.430> civic<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:34.030> fact<00:03:34.300> if<00:03:34.599> you<00:03:35.080> kidnapped<00:03:35.620> me

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
other civic in fact if you kidnapped me

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.460 
other civic in fact if you kidnapped me
blindfolded<00:03:37.090> me<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.270> stuck<00:03:37.720> me<00:03:37.900> in<00:03:37.930> this<00:03:38.170> car

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
blindfolded me and stuck me in this car

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.010 
blindfolded me and stuck me in this car
then<00:03:39.069> I<00:03:39.190> called<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.790> cops<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.569> cop<00:03:40.750> said

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
then I called the cops and the cop said

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.690 
then I called the cops and the cop said
what<00:03:41.200> kind<00:03:41.319> of<00:03:41.440> car<00:03:41.650> are<00:03:41.680> you<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.100> I<00:03:42.280> would<00:03:42.459> say

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
what kind of car are you and I would say

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.270 
what kind of car are you and I would say
a<00:03:43.000> Civic<00:03:43.810> because<00:03:44.290> that's<00:03:44.470> how<00:03:44.620> much<00:03:44.860> like<00:03:45.250> a

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
a Civic because that's how much like a

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.030 
a Civic because that's how much like a
civic<00:03:45.760> this<00:03:45.940> looks<00:03:46.209> very<00:03:46.590> smooth<00:03:47.590> there's

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
civic this looks very smooth there's

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.800 
civic this looks very smooth there's
nothing<00:03:48.310> different<00:03:48.519> about<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.910> steering<00:03:49.209> all

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
nothing different about the steering all

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.720 
nothing different about the steering all
right<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.110> let's<00:03:50.290> really<00:03:50.470> test<00:03:50.739> these<00:03:51.370> wheels

lots of natural gas around me where does

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.890 
lots of natural gas around me where does
natural<00:04:30.400> gas<00:04:30.520> come<00:04:30.790> from<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.540> comes<00:04:31.660> from<00:04:31.840> a

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
natural gas come from it comes from a

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.600 
natural gas come from it comes from a
variety<00:04:32.140> different<00:04:32.320> places<00:04:32.800> I<00:04:33.040> mean<00:04:33.280> it's

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
variety different places I mean it's

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.100 
variety different places I mean it's
coming<00:04:33.910> from<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.120> same<00:04:34.330> place<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.570> gasoline

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
coming from the same place that gasoline

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.680 
coming from the same place that gasoline
is<00:04:35.410> under<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.860> ground<00:04:36.210> rotting<00:04:37.210> vegetable

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
is under the ground rotting vegetable

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.570 
is under the ground rotting vegetable
matter<00:04:37.840> from<00:04:38.200> thousands<00:04:38.860> millions<00:04:39.220> of<00:04:39.370> years

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
matter from thousands millions of years

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.910 
matter from thousands millions of years
ago<00:04:39.730> is<00:04:40.450> creating<00:04:41.080> natural<00:04:41.200> gas<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.830> earth

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
ago is creating natural gas in the earth

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.530 
ago is creating natural gas in the earth
and<00:04:42.160> that<00:04:42.250> gets<00:04:42.490> pumped<00:04:42.700> up<00:04:42.910> out<00:04:43.120> when<00:04:43.420> they're

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
and that gets pumped up out when they're

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.790 
and that gets pumped up out when they're
taking<00:04:43.900> gasoline<00:04:44.320> out<00:04:44.440> of<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.560> ground

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
taking gasoline out of the ground

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.190 
taking gasoline out of the ground
there's<00:04:45.520> also<00:04:45.700> natural<00:04:45.940> gas<00:04:46.300> fields<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:47.170> can

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
there's also natural gas fields you can

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.200 
there's also natural gas fields you can
also<00:04:47.350> get<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:47.830> from<00:04:47.890> rotting<00:04:48.100> garbage<00:04:48.280> or

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
also get it from rotting garbage or

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.480 
also get it from rotting garbage or
rotting<00:04:49.660> vessel<00:04:49.960> that<00:04:50.050> matter<00:04:50.260> today<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:50.680> get

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
rotting vessel that matter today so get

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.310 
rotting vessel that matter today so get
it<00:04:51.640> from<00:04:51.850> some<00:04:52.210> landfills<00:04:52.720> or<00:04:52.960> actually

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
it from some landfills or actually

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.230 
it from some landfills or actually
piping<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.830> right<00:04:53.980> off<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.130> top<00:04:54.430> Wow<00:04:54.910> so<00:04:55.120> that

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
piping it right off the top Wow so that

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.330 
piping it right off the top Wow so that
life<00:04:55.540> in<00:04:55.750> it<00:04:55.930> kind<00:04:56.140> of<00:04:56.230> sign<00:04:56.530> it<00:04:56.770> off<00:04:56.890> as<00:04:57.190> the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
life in it kind of sign it off as the

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.980 
life in it kind of sign it off as the
garbage<00:04:57.670> rots<00:04:57.910> away<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:58.300> that's<00:04:58.660> where<00:04:58.900> it

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
garbage rots away so that's where it

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.470 
garbage rots away so that's where it
becomes<00:04:59.140> really<00:04:59.260> a<00:04:59.500> renewable<00:04:59.950> fuel<00:05:03.480> all

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
becomes really a renewable fuel all

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.670 
becomes really a renewable fuel all
right<00:05:04.600> so<00:05:04.810> I'm<00:05:04.900> ready<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.200> get<00:05:05.320> out<00:05:05.440> of<00:05:05.470> here

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
right so I'm ready to get out of here

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.680 
right so I'm ready to get out of here

nozzle from here and connect it to the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.300 
nozzle from here and connect it to the
vehicle<00:05:10.690> it's<00:05:10.930> very<00:05:11.350> different<00:05:11.560> for<00:05:11.740> gasoline

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
vehicle it's very different for gasoline

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.250 
vehicle it's very different for gasoline
yeah<00:05:12.940> very<00:05:13.180> similar<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.840> what<00:05:13.930> we<00:05:14.020> use<00:05:14.230> for

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
yeah very similar to what we use for

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.560 
yeah very similar to what we use for
hydrogen<00:05:14.950> so<00:05:15.220> if<00:05:15.280> you<00:05:15.370> guys<00:05:15.520> oh<00:05:15.669> yeah<00:05:15.910> yeah<00:05:16.090> on

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
hydrogen so if you guys oh yeah yeah on

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.570 
hydrogen so if you guys oh yeah yeah on
the<00:05:16.690> play<00:05:16.840> I<00:05:16.870> just<00:05:17.080> -<00:05:17.530> miss<00:05:17.740> refueling<00:05:18.220> all

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
the play I just - miss refueling all

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.100 
the play I just - miss refueling all
right<00:05:18.730> so<00:05:19.060> you<00:05:19.120> remove<00:05:19.419> that<00:05:19.480> little<00:05:19.780> cover

right so you remove that little cover
yeah<00:05:20.470> for<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:20.980> nozzle<00:05:21.660> plug<00:05:22.660> it<00:05:22.780> in<00:05:22.870> here

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
yeah for the nozzle plug it in here

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.210 
yeah for the nozzle plug it in here
and<00:05:24.689> turn<00:05:25.080> this<00:05:25.319> thing<00:05:25.379> until<00:05:25.830> it<00:05:25.949> makes<00:05:26.069> a

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
and turn this thing until it makes a

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:33.080 
and turn this thing until it makes a
noise<00:05:26.400> and<00:05:26.819> swipe<00:05:27.720> your<00:05:27.750> card<00:05:31.729> so<00:05:32.729> Phil

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
noise and swipe your card so Phil

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.469 
noise and swipe your card so Phil
completion<00:05:33.840> is<00:05:34.469> based<00:05:34.919> on<00:05:35.189> the<00:05:36.150> amount<00:05:36.389> of

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
completion is based on the amount of

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.610 
completion is based on the amount of
pressure<00:05:36.750> because<00:05:37.020> it's<00:05:37.319> going<00:05:37.469> to<00:05:37.530> be

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
pressure because it's going to be

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.730 
pressure because it's going to be
filling<00:05:37.919> it<00:05:38.159> up<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:38.909> backing<00:05:39.389> up<00:05:39.539> it's

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
filling it up and backing up it's

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.520 
filling it up and backing up it's
working<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:40.860> get<00:05:41.009> the<00:05:41.189> tank<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:41.629> 3600<00:05:42.629> psi<00:05:42.840> okay

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
working to get the tank to 3600 psi okay

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.020 
working to get the tank to 3600 psi okay
there's<00:05:44.069> a<00:05:44.129> home<00:05:44.250> refueling<00:05:44.580> station<00:05:44.849> called

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
there's a home refueling station called
