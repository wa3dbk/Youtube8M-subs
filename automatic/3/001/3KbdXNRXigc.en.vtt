00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
link up this or in the description of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
link up this or in the description of
this<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.310> his<00:01:11.549> actual<00:01:11.759> clip<00:01:12.270> someone<00:01:12.810> posted

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
this to his actual clip someone posted

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.300 
this to his actual clip someone posted
it<00:01:14.030> but<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.390> basically<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.439> same<00:01:16.770> pattern

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it but it's basically the same pattern

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.109 
it but it's basically the same pattern
in<00:01:17.549> three<00:01:17.850> octaves<00:01:18.329> I<00:01:18.630> am<00:01:19.439> tuned<00:01:19.860> down<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
in three octaves I am tuned down like a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.300 
in three octaves I am tuned down like a
half<00:01:21.420> step<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.470> may<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:22.710> sound<00:01:22.950> exactly

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
half step so it may not sound exactly

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.330 
half step so it may not sound exactly
right<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.649> but<00:01:25.649> this<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.039> the<00:01:26.159> pattern

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
right with you but this is the pattern

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.320 
right with you but this is the pattern
real<00:01:26.759> slow

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.240 

okay<00:01:35.690> very<00:01:36.380> important<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:36.710> get<00:01:36.830> that<00:01:36.950> slide

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
okay very important you get that slide

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:46.990 
okay very important you get that slide
from<00:01:37.580> two<00:01:37.730> to<00:01:37.880> three<00:01:37.910> on<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.720> a<00:01:38.750> string<00:01:41.170> okay

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.070 

okay<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.060> with<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.450> when<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.660> start<00:01:48.900> on<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
okay so with that when you start on the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.100 
okay so with that when you start on the
second<00:01:49.410> fret<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.770> low<00:01:49.980> E<00:01:50.160> string

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.980 

you<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.160> same<00:01:56.370> pattern<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.330> starting<00:01:57.900> on

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
you do the same pattern on starting on

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.630 
you do the same pattern on starting on
the<00:01:58.080> D<00:01:58.230> string<00:01:58.260> on<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:58.920> fourth<00:01:59.160> fret

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.540 

in<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.690> same<00:02:07.870> pattern<00:02:08.319> starting<00:02:08.830> on<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.160> B

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
in the same pattern starting on the B

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.270 
in the same pattern starting on the B
string<00:02:09.610> on<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.210> seventh<00:02:10.509> fret<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.920> new<00:02:15.040> tat
