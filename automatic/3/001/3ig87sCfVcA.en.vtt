00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
it like tingling the big tingles more

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.950 
it like tingling the big tingles more
than<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.860> Amin<00:03:14.100> meant<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.520> this<00:03:15.210> really

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
than the Amin meant in this really

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.720 
than the Amin meant in this really
tingles<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.770> could<00:03:16.920> really<00:03:17.220> feel<00:03:17.340> it

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
like penetrating your scalp and that's

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.330 
like penetrating your scalp and that's
the<00:03:21.630> only<00:03:21.990> I<00:03:22.020> think<00:03:22.260> difference<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.220> I've

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
the only I think difference that I've

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.490 
the only I think difference that I've
noticed<00:03:23.580> in<00:03:24.000> terms<00:03:24.270> of<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.780> product<00:03:25.290> like

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
noticed in terms of the product like

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.100 
noticed in terms of the product like
this<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.580> intense<00:03:27.150> so<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.570> get<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:27.900> a

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
this one is intense so you get like a

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.260 
this one is intense so you get like a
really<00:03:28.590> good<00:03:28.950> deep<00:03:29.190> condition<00:03:29.700> with<00:03:29.850> this<00:03:30.000> one

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
really good deep condition with this one

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.660 
really good deep condition with this one
well<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.810> feel<00:03:31.140> like<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:32.250> moisture

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
well I feel like it and the moisture

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.790 
well I feel like it and the moisture
retention<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.420> also<00:03:34.050> really<00:03:34.290> good<00:03:34.440> with<00:03:34.500> this

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
retention is also really good with this

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.100 
retention is also really good with this
one<00:03:36.380> otherwise<00:03:37.380> then<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:39.030> mean<00:03:39.360> it's<00:03:39.690> a

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
one otherwise then that I mean it's a

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.340 
one otherwise then that I mean it's a
really<00:03:40.680> good<00:03:40.830> product<00:03:41.780> as<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:43.050> said<00:03:43.230> in<00:03:43.320> my

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
really good product as I said in my

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.790 
really good product as I said in my
previous<00:03:43.620> video<00:03:44.040> it's<00:03:44.760> about<00:03:45.030> 80<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.290> 95

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
previous video it's about 80 to 95

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.800 
previous video it's about 80 to 95
percent<00:03:46.830> natural<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:48.030> terms<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.690> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
percent natural in terms of the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.420 
percent natural in terms of the
ingredients<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.560> that's<00:03:50.010> something<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.370> don't

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
ingredients and that's something I don't

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.100 
ingredients and that's something I don't
really<00:03:50.790> want<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.150> quote<00:03:51.360> me<00:03:51.510> on<00:03:51.540> because

been able to retain a lot of links and I

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.940 
been able to retain a lot of links and I
don't<00:04:53.480> think<00:04:53.660> that's<00:04:53.900> just<00:04:54.230> solely<00:04:54.620> because

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
don't think that's just solely because

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.540 
don't think that's just solely because
of<00:04:55.190> you<00:04:55.880> know<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.210> product<00:04:56.690> but<00:04:57.500> also<00:04:57.800> because

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
of you know the product but also because

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.290 
of you know the product but also because
of<00:04:58.790> you<00:04:59.030> know<00:04:59.270> my<00:04:59.540> regimen<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:01.250> I<00:05:01.700> think<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.090> can

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
of you know my regimen and I think I can

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.900 
of you know my regimen and I think I can
swap<00:05:02.720> out<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.590> know<00:05:03.710> products<00:05:04.190> every<00:05:04.520> now<00:05:04.670> and

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
swap out you know products every now and

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.360 
swap out you know products every now and
then<00:05:05.030> but<00:05:05.900> I'm<00:05:06.080> really<00:05:06.530> really<00:05:06.710> trying<00:05:07.190> to<00:05:07.280> be

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
then but I'm really really trying to be

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.430 
then but I'm really really trying to be
as<00:05:07.490> consistent<00:05:07.850> as<00:05:08.090> possible<00:05:08.270> with<00:05:09.050> you<00:05:09.350> know

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
as consistent as possible with you know

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.840 
as consistent as possible with you know
at<00:05:09.680> least<00:05:09.740> you<00:05:09.980> know<00:05:10.130> watching<00:05:10.610> every<00:05:10.820> week

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
at least you know watching every week

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.580 
at least you know watching every week
deep<00:05:11.570> conditioning<00:05:12.140> every<00:05:12.290> week<00:05:12.970> sealing<00:05:13.970> and

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
deep conditioning every week sealing and

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.560 
deep conditioning every week sealing and
moisturizing<00:05:15.590> so<00:05:16.250> I<00:05:16.550> think<00:05:16.820> that<00:05:17.000> also<00:05:17.270> plays

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
moisturizing so I think that also plays

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.210 
moisturizing so I think that also plays
a<00:05:17.600> part<00:05:17.720> I'm<00:05:18.170> not<00:05:18.200> going<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.590> give<00:05:18.800> all<00:05:19.010> the

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
a part I'm not going to give all the

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.560 
a part I'm not going to give all the
glory<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:20.230> win<00:05:21.230> but<00:05:21.680> it<00:05:22.490> really<00:05:22.880> has<00:05:23.060> been<00:05:23.360> a

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
glory to win but it really has been a

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.260 
glory to win but it really has been a
good<00:05:23.990> cleanser<00:05:24.380> for<00:05:24.560> me<00:05:24.680> I<00:05:24.860> have<00:05:25.640> found<00:05:25.940> out
