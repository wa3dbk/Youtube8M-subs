so that we were like figuring out

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.600 
so that we were like figuring out
obviously<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.890> double-checking<00:01:41.460> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
obviously just double-checking that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.490

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that that in fact was cop right we've

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.480 
that that in fact was cop right we've
never<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.439> we've<00:01:46.590> seen<00:01:46.770> garter<00:01:47.009> snakes<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
basically what happened was that it bit

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.649 
basically what happened was that it bit
him<00:01:58.710> actually<00:01:59.280> right<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> face<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.240> when

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
him actually right in the face and when

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.179 
him actually right in the face and when
we<00:02:00.810> were<00:02:00.930> capturing<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> snake<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.829> put<00:02:02.130> it

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
we were capturing the snake and put it

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.770 
we were capturing the snake and put it
in<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> bucket<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.880> didn't<00:02:03.030> hurt<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.270> nothing<00:02:03.390> I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
in a bucket we didn't hurt or nothing I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.539 
in a bucket we didn't hurt or nothing I
guess<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:04.829> thought<00:02:04.979> we'd<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> bring<00:02:05.460> it

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
