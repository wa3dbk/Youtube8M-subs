00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
I look at it like is Peyton Manning

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.690 
I look at it like is Peyton Manning
still<00:02:59.320> in<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.530> right<00:02:59.830> now<00:02:59.890> at<00:03:00.490> this<00:03:00.640> moment

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
still in it right now at this moment

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.699 
still in it right now at this moment
right<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.540> then<00:03:01.690> should<00:03:01.840> he<00:03:02.020> be<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.590> the

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
right so then should he be it so the

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.080 
right so then should he be it so the
other<00:03:02.830> two<00:03:02.980> guys<00:03:03.100> are<00:03:03.280> up<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.550> think<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:03.970> can

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
other two guys are up I think you can

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.940 
other two guys are up I think you can
make<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.240> case<00:03:04.510> for<00:03:04.570> both<00:03:04.990> players<00:03:05.230> for<00:03:05.650> Adrian

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
make a case for both players for Adrian

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.130 
make a case for both players for Adrian
Peterson<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.580> Peyton<00:03:06.910> Manning<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.330> whoever

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
Peterson and Peyton Manning and whoever

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.930 
Peterson and Peyton Manning and whoever
whoever<00:03:08.560> gets<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.070> MVP<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.430> don't<00:03:09.760> think<00:03:09.880> you

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
whoever gets the MVP I don't think you

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.490 
whoever gets the MVP I don't think you
can<00:03:10.060> argue<00:03:10.120> against<00:03:10.690> either<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.990> them<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.260> think

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
can argue against either of them I think

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.449 
can argue against either of them I think
they're<00:03:11.620> both<00:03:11.740> think<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.070> can't<00:03:12.280> bill

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
they're both think you can't bill

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.360 
they're both think you can't bill
because<00:03:13.420> Peyton<00:03:13.959> Manning<00:03:14.410> injured<00:03:14.890> that

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
because Peyton Manning injured that

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.610 
because Peyton Manning injured that
Adrian<00:03:15.820> Peterson<00:03:16.150> guy<00:03:16.239> injured<00:03:16.720> right<00:03:17.050> rg3

Adrian Peterson guy injured right rg3
not<00:03:18.070> injured<00:03:18.400> until<00:03:18.670> now<00:03:18.820> right<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.080> think

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
not injured until now right so I think

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.030 
not injured until now right so I think
he's<00:03:20.470> better<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:23.080> all<00:03:23.380> right<00:03:23.560> now<00:03:23.890> I'm

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
he's better so all right now I'm

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.729 
he's better so all right now I'm

still<00:03:26.980> think<00:03:27.070> Peyton<00:03:27.430> Manning<00:03:27.640> she<00:03:27.760> win

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.210 
still think Peyton Manning she win

because he's been any longer ok for

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.979 
because he's been any longer ok for
Peyton<00:03:30.489> Manning<00:03:30.760> should<00:03:30.970> win<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.269> MVP<00:03:31.390> yeah
