00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
that four times and each side or you

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.780 
that four times and each side or you
know<00:02:49.629> you<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:49.989> fund<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.349> it<00:02:51.250> doesn't<00:02:51.700> really

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
know you can fund it it doesn't really

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.759 
know you can fund it it doesn't really
matter<00:02:52.180> if<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.450> don't<00:02:52.569> do<00:02:52.810> all<00:02:53.260> eight<00:02:53.739> legs

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
matter if you don't do all eight legs

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.170 
matter if you don't do all eight legs
it's<00:02:54.459> not<00:02:54.640> really<00:02:54.849> going<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.060> make<00:02:55.120> a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
it's not really going to make a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.160 
it's not really going to make a
difference<00:02:55.540> because<00:02:55.660> you're<00:02:55.900> going<00:02:56.049> to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
difference because you're going to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:15.640 
difference because you're going to
overlap<00:02:56.709> them<00:02:56.920> quite<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.280> lot<00:02:57.519> on<00:02:57.730> each<00:02:58.329> side

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.020 

the<00:03:16.650> spider<00:03:16.920> on<00:03:17.100> this<00:03:17.250> now<00:03:17.430> we're<00:03:17.700> not<00:03:17.820> going

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the spider on this now we're not going

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.730 
the spider on this now we're not going
to<00:03:18.090> create<00:03:18.270> any<00:03:18.570> legs<00:03:18.870> because<00:03:19.290> he's<00:03:19.470> just

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
to create any legs because he's just

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.190 
to create any legs because he's just
going<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:19.980> be<00:03:20.130> dangling<00:03:20.670> from<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.390> web<00:03:21.600> from<00:03:22.020> the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
going to be dangling from a web from the

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.660 
going to be dangling from a web from the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.250 

and<00:03:42.190> then<00:03:43.060> for<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.330> pinkie<00:03:43.660> we're<00:03:43.870> just<00:03:44.050> going

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
and then for the pinkie we're just going

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.380 
and then for the pinkie we're just going
to<00:03:44.350> create<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.710> one<00:03:45.070> great<00:03:45.280> beat<00:03:45.640> web<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.180> then

to create a one great beat web and then

00:03:46.390 --> 00:04:42.010 
to create a one great beat web and then
put<00:03:46.630> two<00:03:46.840> little<00:03:47.200> spiders<00:03:47.710> on<00:03:47.890> it

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.970 

therefore<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.110> index<00:04:43.440> now<00:04:43.620> we're<00:04:43.860> doing

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
therefore the index now we're doing

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.160 
therefore the index now we're doing
another<00:04:44.250> corner<00:04:44.700> web<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.210> in<00:04:45.360> one<00:04:45.540> great<00:04:45.900> big

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
another corner web and in one great big

00:04:46.170 --> 00:05:31.290 
another corner web and in one great big
spider

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.909 

now<00:05:32.300> once<00:05:32.479> all<00:05:32.570> of<00:05:32.690> your<00:05:32.810> spiders<00:05:33.290> are<00:05:33.440> dry<00:05:33.620> and

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
now once all of your spiders are dry and

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
going to take very long we're going to

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.320 
going to take very long we're going to
come<00:05:36.979> in<00:05:37.100> with<00:05:37.130> some<00:05:37.430> white<00:05:37.610> acrylic<00:05:37.940> paint

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.480 
and create some little eyes for each of
the<00:05:40.639> spiders

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
the spiders

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.400 
the spiders
you<00:05:43.490> may<00:05:43.669> need<00:05:43.940> to<00:05:44.000> vary<00:05:44.540> the<00:05:44.720> size<00:05:44.960> of<00:05:45.169> your

sorts<00:05:53.060> of<00:05:53.150> different<00:05:53.300> things<00:05:53.479> now<00:05:54.200> once<00:05:54.530> that

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
sorts of different things now once that

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.379 
sorts of different things now once that
white<00:05:54.979> acrylic<00:05:55.430> paint<00:05:55.639> is<00:05:55.940> dry<00:05:56.180> we're<00:05:56.360> going

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
white acrylic paint is dry we're going

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.180 
white acrylic paint is dry we're going
to<00:05:56.570> come<00:05:56.720> back<00:05:56.750> in<00:05:57.050> with<00:05:57.169> some<00:05:57.440> yellow<00:05:57.650> colors

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
to come back in with some yellow colors

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.219 
to come back in with some yellow colors
really<00:05:58.550> really<00:05:58.850> bright<00:05:59.060> neon<00:05:59.600> yellow<00:05:59.780> polish

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
really really bright neon yellow polish

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:07.009 
really really bright neon yellow polish
and<00:06:01.030> color<00:06:02.030> in<00:06:02.210> the<00:06:02.330> eyes<00:06:02.449> with<00:06:02.780> that

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:07.019 

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:09.809 

our<00:06:08.019> step<00:06:08.259> is<00:06:08.469> to<00:06:08.649> create<00:06:08.919> the<00:06:09.069> little<00:06:09.249> pupils

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
our step is to create the little pupils

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.029 
our step is to create the little pupils
inside<00:06:10.299> each<00:06:10.599> of<00:06:10.779> those<00:06:10.929> eyes<00:06:11.259> I'm<00:06:11.619> using<00:06:11.799> the

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
inside each of those eyes I'm using the

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.219 
inside each of those eyes I'm using the
tiniest<00:06:12.549> dotting<00:06:12.849> tool<00:06:13.059> I<00:06:13.089> have<00:06:13.269> although<00:06:14.110> I

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
tiniest dotting tool I have although I

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.019 
tiniest dotting tool I have although I
wish<00:06:14.499> I'd<00:06:14.649> used<00:06:14.679> a<00:06:15.039> pin<00:06:15.279> because<00:06:15.759> that

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:16.029 
wish I'd used a pin because that

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:17.789 
wish I'd used a pin because that
probably<00:06:16.419> would<00:06:16.659> have<00:06:16.749> been<00:06:16.929> much<00:06:17.199> better<00:06:17.469> and

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:17.799 
probably would have been much better and

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:19.529 
probably would have been much better and
because<00:06:18.249> it<00:06:18.399> would<00:06:18.729> have<00:06:18.789> been<00:06:18.849> smaller<00:06:19.360> than

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
because it would have been smaller than

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.419 
because it would have been smaller than
what<00:06:19.839> I've<00:06:19.959> got<00:06:20.259> so<00:06:20.559> you<00:06:21.099> need<00:06:21.249> something

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:21.429 
what I've got so you need something

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:37.060 
what I've got so you need something
really<00:06:21.909> really<00:06:22.179> really<00:06:22.360> time

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.290 

lastly<00:06:38.070> once<00:06:38.280> everything<00:06:38.699> is<00:06:38.729> dry<00:06:38.940> and<00:06:39.150> fill

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
lastly once everything is dry and fill

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.760 
lastly once everything is dry and fill
it<00:06:39.419> all<00:06:39.540> in<00:06:39.570> with<00:06:39.750> the<00:06:39.900> blue<00:06:40.020> quality<00:06:40.350> top<00:06:40.560> coat

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
it all in with the blue quality top coat

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.939 
it all in with the blue quality top coat
I'm<00:06:40.979> using<00:06:41.009> accessory<00:06:42.320> now<00:06:43.320> because<00:06:43.620> I<00:06:43.650> use

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:43.949 
I'm using accessory now because I use

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:46.189 
I'm using accessory now because I use
neon<00:06:44.190> polish<00:06:44.639> in<00:06:44.820> this<00:06:44.970> it<00:06:45.330> glows<00:06:45.780> under<00:06:45.960> my

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
neon polish in this it glows under my

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.939 
neon polish in this it glows under my
