need<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.189> quite<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> bit<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.670> work<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.029> so

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
need to do quite a bit of work to it so

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.660 
need to do quite a bit of work to it so
for<00:00:27.689> now<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.080> think<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.650> works<00:00:28.859> pretty<00:00:29.070> good<00:00:29.340> I

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
for now I think this works pretty good I

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.089 
for now I think this works pretty good I
also<00:00:30.210> removed<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.840> automatic<00:00:31.650> electric

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
choke and installed the manual one that

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.860 
choke and installed the manual one that
I<00:00:34.110> built<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.860> kit<00:00:35.390> much<00:00:36.390> better<00:00:36.630> cuz<00:00:36.840> I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
I built out of a kit much better cuz I

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.479 
I built out of a kit much better cuz I
can<00:00:37.020> finally<00:00:37.260> control<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.920> seems<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> have

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
can finally control that seems to have

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.970 
can finally control that seems to have
made<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.670> good<00:00:38.910> improvement<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.590> comp<00:00:40.800> cam

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
made a good improvement the comp cam

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.470 
made a good improvement the comp cam
actually<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.430> running<00:00:41.730> quite<00:00:41.940> nice<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.420> it

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
actually is running quite nice and it

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.910 
actually is running quite nice and it
seems<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.260> lot<00:00:43.410> better<00:00:43.590> than<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
seems to like it a lot better than the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.400 
seems to like it a lot better than the
old<00:00:44.070> cam<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:48.140> for<00:00:49.140> all<00:00:49.260> those

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
old cam that was in it and for all those

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.279 
old cam that was in it and for all those
who<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.820> engine<00:00:51.239> tones<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.809> much<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
who like the engine tones as much as I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.560

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
do is goofy as it may seem I guess it's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.240 
do is goofy as it may seem I guess it's
