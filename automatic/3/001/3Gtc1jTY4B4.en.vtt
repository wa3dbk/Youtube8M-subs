hello this is the presentation of my

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.130 
hello this is the presentation of my
interpretation<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:05.210> wall-e<00:00:06.210> robot<00:00:06.390> so

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
interpretation of the wall-e robot so

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.259 
interpretation of the wall-e robot so
based<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:07.770> image<00:00:08.189> here<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.670> tried<00:00:09.090> to

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
based on this image here I tried to

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.530 
based on this image here I tried to
trade<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.870> same<00:00:10.469> look<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.550> feel<00:00:11.639> as<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
trade the same look and feel as the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.039 
trade the same look and feel as the
Wally<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.460> here's<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.670> design<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.030> my<00:00:15.360> track

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
Wally so here's the design of my track

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.609 
Wally so here's the design of my track
threads<00:00:16.430> so<00:00:17.430> I've<00:00:17.520> got<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.730> yellow<00:00:18.619> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
threads so I've got the yellow the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.429 
threads so I've got the yellow the
yellow<00:00:19.650> one<00:00:19.980> from<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> bulldozer<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.439> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
yellow one from the bulldozer and the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.250 
yellow one from the bulldozer and the
black<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:22.859> here<00:00:23.070> from<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.460> ski-doo<00:00:24.260> get

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
black one here from the ski-doo get

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.589 
black one here from the ski-doo get
loans<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.830> free<00:00:26.070> rolling<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.420> that's

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
loans are just free rolling so that's

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.299 
loans are just free rolling so that's
the<00:00:27.660> threads<00:00:27.990> here<00:00:28.400> there<00:00:29.400> are<00:00:29.670> controlled<00:00:30.570> by

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
the threads here there are controlled by

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.520 
the threads here there are controlled by
2<00:00:32.309> power<00:00:32.640> function<00:00:33.090> motors<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:33.960> now<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.469> is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
2 power function motors here now this is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.319 
2 power function motors here now this is
a<00:00:34.620> prototype<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.700> putting<00:00:35.880> my<00:00:36.059> pieces

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
a prototype a I'm just putting my pieces

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.970 
a prototype a I'm just putting my pieces
together<00:00:36.860> to<00:00:38.450> get<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> feel<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.710> I'm<00:00:40.829> going

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
together to get a feel of what I'm going

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.940 
together to get a feel of what I'm going
to<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.129> working<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:41.910> size-wise<00:00:42.950> so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
to be working with here size-wise so

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.520 
to be working with here size-wise so
these<00:00:44.610> two<00:00:44.850> motors<00:00:45.120> here<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> arm

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
these two motors here are for the arm

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.639 
these two motors here are for the arm
controls<00:00:46.980> I've<00:00:47.760> got<00:00:48.480> my<00:00:48.629> arms<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.469> work

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
controls I've got my arms here that work

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
controls I've got my arms here that work
on<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.010> pivot<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:52.039> I<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> motor<00:00:54.360> here

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
on a pivot and I can have a motor here

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.080 
on a pivot and I can have a motor here
to<00:00:55.020> open<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.649> close<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.039> claws<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.780> right<00:00:57.989> now

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
to open and close the claws so right now

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.220 
to open and close the claws so right now
you<00:01:00.090> got<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> opening<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.750> closing<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you got the opening in the closing of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.609 
you got the opening in the closing of
the<00:01:01.320> claws<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.660> let's<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.870> how<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> higher

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the claws and let's see how the higher

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.460 
the claws and let's see how the higher
function<00:01:05.010> works<00:01:05.220> here's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.820> power<00:01:06.060> function

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
function works here's a power function

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.149 
function works here's a power function
I've<00:01:07.470> got<00:01:07.850> of<00:01:08.850> course<00:01:09.619> this<00:01:10.619> thing<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.979> all

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
I've got of course this thing is all

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.460 
I've got of course this thing is all
falling<00:01:11.520> apart<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:12.090> because<00:01:12.630> I've<00:01:13.229> been<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
falling apart here because I've been a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.450 
falling apart here because I've been a
very<00:01:13.979> prototype<00:01:14.610> ish<00:01:14.820> mode<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.630> now

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
very prototype ish mode right now

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.440 
very prototype ish mode right now
actually<00:01:17.460> i'm<00:01:17.520> posting<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:17.909> video<00:01:18.090> because

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
actually i'm posting this video because

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.420 
actually i'm posting this video because
i<00:01:18.570> need<00:01:18.720> some<00:01:18.840> ideas<00:01:20.659> here<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.780> go<00:01:22.009> we<00:01:23.009> got<00:01:23.220> one

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
i need some ideas here we go we got one

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.270 
i need some ideas here we go we got one
arm<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:23.970> independent<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.770> their

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
arm here independent the one on their

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
arm here independent the one on their
independent<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.270> course<00:01:28.080> all<00:01:28.320> those<00:01:28.530> will<00:01:28.829> be

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
independent of course all those will be

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.130 
independent of course all those will be
controlled<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.640> NXT<00:01:29.970> once<00:01:30.360> i<00:01:30.600> connect

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
controlled with the NXT once i connect

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.880 
controlled with the NXT once i connect
my<00:01:31.259> infrared<00:01:32.040> link<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:34.079> NXT<00:01:34.259> will<00:01:34.710> be

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
my infrared link to it the NXT will be

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.160 
my infrared link to it the NXT will be
located<00:01:35.100> somewhere<00:01:35.880> around<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.479> i<00:01:36.780> haven't

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
located somewhere around here i haven't

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.429 
located somewhere around here i haven't
quite<00:01:37.350> decided<00:01:37.619> how<00:01:38.250> yet<00:01:39.259> this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.350> my

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
quite decided how yet this is my

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.499 
quite decided how yet this is my
interpretation<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> head<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.240> was<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> very

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
interpretation of the head it was a very

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.530 
interpretation of the head it was a very
hard<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.350> figure<00:01:43.500> out<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.070> i<00:01:44.970> think<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
hard one to figure out but i think it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.260 
hard one to figure out but i think it
kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.990> looks<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.909> kind<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.000> looks<00:01:48.180> like

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
kind of looks like kind of looks like

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.819 
kind of looks like kind of looks like
that<00:01:48.509> I've<00:01:48.899> seen<00:01:49.170> nice<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:49.530> though<00:01:49.710> on

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
that I've seen nice one though on

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.399 
that I've seen nice one though on
YouTube<00:01:50.280> interesting<00:01:51.000> ideas<00:01:51.329> 1<00:01:52.259> i've<00:01:52.380> seen

YouTube interesting ideas 1 i've seen
very<00:01:52.860> recently<00:01:53.340> was<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.880> use<00:01:54.090> these<00:01:54.360> uh<00:01:54.420> these

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
very recently was to use these uh these

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.940 
very recently was to use these uh these
tubes<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:57.180> my<00:01:57.360> tubes<00:01:57.719> are<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> boxes<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.710> to

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
tubes or my tubes are the boxes with to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.160 
tubes or my tubes are the boxes with to
these<00:01:59.340> guys<00:01:59.610> here

these guys here
I've<00:02:01.470> seen<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:01.920> who<00:02:02.040> used<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.700> use<00:02:02.909> those<00:02:03.210> that

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
I've seen one who used to use those that

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.179 
I've seen one who used to use those that
would<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.780> been<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.900> good<00:02:04.049> idea<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.680> attribute

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
would have been a good idea to attribute

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.969 
would have been a good idea to attribute
those<00:02:05.460> actually<00:02:06.240> i<00:02:06.270> might<00:02:06.390> redo<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:06.979> anyways

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
those actually i might redo it anyways

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.830 
those actually i might redo it anyways
I'll<00:02:08.910> get<00:02:09.060> these<00:02:09.209> little<00:02:09.330> thing<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.690> our

I'll get these little thing that our
kind<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.200> looks<00:02:10.380> like<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.649> head<00:02:11.450> now<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.569> kind

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
kind of looks like the head now it kind

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.180 
kind of looks like the head now it kind
of<00:02:12.840> looks<00:02:13.020> like<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.230> head<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.800> course<00:02:13.830> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
of looks like the head and of course the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.320 
of looks like the head and of course the
head<00:02:14.340> will<00:02:14.550> be<00:02:14.870> motorized<00:02:15.870> as<00:02:16.110> well<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:18.090> here's

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
head will be motorized as well so here's

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.540 
head will be motorized as well so here's
my<00:02:18.420> sensor<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.410> middle<00:02:19.620> here<00:02:19.650> that's<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
my sensor in the middle here that's the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.590 
my sensor in the middle here that's the
head<00:02:20.730> design<00:02:21.709> pretty<00:02:22.709> interesting<00:02:23.160> one<00:02:23.600> sort

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
head design pretty interesting one sort

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.559 
head design pretty interesting one sort
of<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:24.810> it

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.739 

so<00:02:28.230> my<00:02:28.530> one<00:02:29.329> mommy<00:02:30.829> mommy<00:02:32.209> that's<00:02:33.209> my<00:02:33.389> wall<00:02:33.599> you

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:33.749 
so my one mommy mommy that's my wall you

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:37.910 
so my one mommy mommy that's my wall you
head<00:02:34.019> for<00:02:34.620> now<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:36.060> everything's<00:02:36.420> wobbly<00:02:36.930> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
head for now so everything's wobbly the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.360 
head for now so everything's wobbly the
idea<00:02:38.219> is<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:39.060> see<00:02:39.659> if<00:02:39.959> everything<00:02:40.439> will<00:02:40.829> fit<00:02:41.069> in

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
idea is to see if everything will fit in

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.030 
idea is to see if everything will fit in
a<00:02:41.519> square<00:02:41.969> box<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:43.260> believe<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.590> will<00:02:43.709> be

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
a square box and I believe I will be

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.660 
a square box and I believe I will be
able<00:02:44.219> to<00:02:44.430> fit<00:02:44.879> everything<00:02:45.769> in<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.980> square<00:02:47.340> box

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
able to fit everything in a square box

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.750 
able to fit everything in a square box
you<00:02:48.060> see<00:02:48.269> square<00:02:48.629> box<00:02:48.900> here<00:02:49.260> I'll<00:02:50.250> have<00:02:50.519> place

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
you see square box here I'll have place

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.599 
you see square box here I'll have place
for<00:02:50.969> my<00:02:51.090> battery<00:02:51.450> pack<00:02:51.829> I've<00:02:52.829> got<00:02:53.159> close<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.579> my

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
for my battery pack I've got close to my

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.280 
for my battery pack I've got close to my
sensors<00:02:54.269> here<00:02:54.840> my<00:02:55.590> IR<00:02:56.189> sensors<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.109> would<00:02:58.109> have

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
sensors here my IR sensors I would have

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.289 
sensors here my IR sensors I would have
placed<00:02:58.590> for<00:02:58.889> the<00:02:59.510> for<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.540> NXT<00:03:01.939> but<00:03:02.939> I<00:03:02.969> have<00:03:03.209> to

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
placed for the for the NXT but I have to

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.849 
placed for the for the NXT but I have to
remove<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.569> battery<00:03:03.930> pack<00:03:04.019> because<00:03:04.439> it

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
remove the battery pack because it

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.619 
remove the battery pack because it
doesn't<00:03:05.250> fit<00:03:05.310> but<00:03:05.760> I'll<00:03:06.030> redesign<00:03:06.480> everything

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
doesn't fit but I'll redesign everything

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.550 
doesn't fit but I'll redesign everything
so<00:03:07.109> that<00:03:07.139> it<00:03:07.409> does<00:03:07.829> fit<00:03:08.159> and<00:03:09.079> I<00:03:10.079> got<00:03:10.230> my<00:03:10.349> cute

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
so that it does fit and I got my cute

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.649 
so that it does fit and I got my cute
ones<00:03:10.799> well<00:03:11.280> here's<00:03:11.909> the<00:03:11.969> arm<00:03:12.150> design<00:03:12.480> actually

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
ones well here's the arm design actually

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.599 
ones well here's the arm design actually
pretty<00:03:13.230> interesting<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.120> got<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.540> joints

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
pretty interesting so you got the joints

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.379 
pretty interesting so you got the joints
and<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.840> claw<00:03:19.109> opens<00:03:19.560> up<00:03:19.709> like<00:03:19.859> this<00:03:20.099> and<00:03:20.389> then

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
and the claw opens up like this and then

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.330 
and the claw opens up like this and then
the<00:03:21.510> whole<00:03:21.689> thing<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.169> turn<00:03:22.469> like<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.709> now

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
the whole thing can turn like that now

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.000 
the whole thing can turn like that now
kind<00:03:23.639> of<00:03:23.699> cheated<00:03:24.109> this<00:03:25.109> is<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.319> piece<00:03:25.859> I've

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
kind of cheated this is a piece I've

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.399 
kind of cheated this is a piece I've
made<00:03:26.189> for<00:03:26.400> another<00:03:26.609> design<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.299> got<00:03:28.139> a<00:03:28.169> few<00:03:28.319> of

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
made for another design I got a few of

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.330 
made for another design I got a few of
these<00:03:28.530> big<00:03:28.739> wheels<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.129> see<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.340> drilled<00:03:29.909> I

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
these big wheels you see I drilled I

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.960 
these big wheels you see I drilled I
drilled<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:33.829> the<00:03:34.829> X<00:03:35.159> here<00:03:35.430> in<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.579> middle<00:03:35.729> you

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
drilled the the X here in the middle you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.050 
drilled the the X here in the middle you
see<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.359> X<00:03:36.540> here<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.840> drilled<00:03:37.259> it<00:03:37.729> this<00:03:38.729> allows

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
see the X here I drilled it this allows

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.729 
see the X here I drilled it this allows
for<00:03:39.449> the<00:03:39.689> shaft<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:41.370> free<00:03:41.729> role<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.359> and

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
for the shaft to free role in it and

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.240 
for the shaft to free role in it and
then<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:44.009> can<00:03:44.370> have

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.890 

you<00:03:48.940> see<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.600> parts<00:03:50.110> napping<00:03:50.710> here<00:03:51.900> thus

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
you see the parts napping here thus

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.410 
you see the parts napping here thus
making<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:54.480> allowed<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.720> turn<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.530> middle<00:03:56.800> and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
making it allowed to turn the middle and

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.120 
making it allowed to turn the middle and
then<00:03:58.420> rotate<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.260> whole<00:03:59.410> thing<00:03:59.650> for<00:03:59.860> the<00:03:59.950> arm

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
then rotate the whole thing for the arm

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.730 
then rotate the whole thing for the arm
anyway<00:04:01.000> it's<00:04:01.270> kind<00:04:01.480> of<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.660> cool<00:04:02.110> it<00:04:02.260> Lego

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
anyway it's kind of a cool it Lego

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.870 
anyway it's kind of a cool it Lego
should<00:04:02.980> actually<00:04:03.100> make<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.430> piece<00:04:03.700> like<00:04:03.730> that

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
should actually make a piece like that

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.170 
should actually make a piece like that
it<00:04:04.210> would<00:04:04.300> be<00:04:04.450> useful<00:04:05.400> okay<00:04:06.400> so<00:04:06.760> that's<00:04:06.940> my

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
it would be useful okay so that's my

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.630 
it would be useful okay so that's my
Wally<00:04:07.480> for<00:04:07.720> now<00:04:07.840> oh<00:04:08.110> wait<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.070> didn't<00:04:09.280> even<00:04:09.459> show
