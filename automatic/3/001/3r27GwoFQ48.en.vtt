00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
under US nds Council Famicom games were

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.390 
under US nds Council Famicom games were
designed<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.330> top-loading<00:00:24.810> unit<00:00:25.230> now<00:00:26.099> some

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
designed for a top-loading unit now some

designed for a top-loading unit now some
of<00:00:26.520> you<00:00:26.580> might<00:00:26.700> be<00:00:26.849> saying<00:00:27.000> well<00:00:27.180> why<00:00:27.720> can't

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
of you might be saying well why can't

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.859 
of you might be saying well why can't
you<00:00:28.020> just<00:00:28.170> use<00:00:28.320> your<00:00:28.349> nes<00:00:28.770> too<00:00:28.980> well<00:00:29.940> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
you just use your nes too well the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.570 
you just use your nes too well the
reason<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.590> because<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.980> Famicom

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
reason for that is because the Famicom

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.220 
reason for that is because the Famicom
games<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:32.940> actually<00:00:33.239> smaller<00:00:33.600> than<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:33.960> u.s.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
games are actually smaller than the u.s.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.090 
games are actually smaller than the u.s.
NES<00:00:34.590> games<00:00:34.860> as<00:00:35.420> you<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.510> see<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> PCB<00:00:37.350> itself

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
NES games as you can see the PCB itself

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.939 
NES games as you can see the PCB itself
is<00:00:38.340> smaller<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:40.050> fix<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.769> need<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
is smaller so to fix this you need a

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.160 
is smaller so to fix this you need a
converter<00:00:41.420> now<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> most<00:00:42.930> famous
