00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.050
 and good to be management methods because 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.450
 we are in a non-premium server called 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.079
 or not and pp that I already did a review of 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.790
 this server and nothing because this is where 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.750
 I usually play one against one to see 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.689
 Well, if you want to take a few games 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.970
 with me here I will be in one 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.430
 against one and I also want to tell you that 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.980
 the day of yes tomorrow in the 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.350
 canal denver will be uploaded the second 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.820
 episode of the series that we have and good 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.690
 Well let's see what we are in the 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.089
 games to pasta torras and one we are in 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.789
 the first game on this map is 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.649
 and much much much not against 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.650
 sir against this gentleman I do not know how 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.660
 it's called xerez if you want 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.400
 and it was fine all the arrows of 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.750
 we remove an absorbing heart if not 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.690
 I'm wrong is that we go the arrow 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.860
 the critics' particles come out 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.620
 and her 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.380
 Now let's see if we have outstanding 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.750
 and now we are going as we go without cuts to 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.880
 my grandchildren the technical areas the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.880
 cuts but let's go 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.560
 to kill the 18 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.610
 strong and in the air to my grandson 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.010
 one 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.950
 to see which region 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.820
 let's see if we're not going against it but 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.409
 well let's go let's go where are we going 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.409
 ok the same here 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.950
 what is against us 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.950
 in mouth 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.780
 if you remove two hearts apparently 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.130
 wow 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.130

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.260
 and there we are going to put a rating 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.850
 as we see who is it 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.170
 I think I'm number 7 here, all 17 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.120
 effectively already see let's give it a 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.420

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.430
 to see see see see 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.700

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.780

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.450
 bush for 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.010
 Well now I think we'll 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.740
 make a small transition so we 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.740
 we see so far to see see 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.750
 of a goal from webÃ³ 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.739

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.959
 few people because I'm recording it from 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.750

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.740

 let's see we're going against the cricket again the 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.930
 cricket is the protagonist of the old 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.010
 the typical spammer 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:39.100
 the job is to traffic and she 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:43.620
