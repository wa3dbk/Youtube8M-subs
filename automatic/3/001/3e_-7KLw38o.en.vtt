00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:05.180
 among the serious problems due to the issue of sanitation 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.929
 one of the most important is the overflow of the shield 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.929
 and the consequent contamination occurs with the rolled wires 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:17.320
 one of 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.109
 the reasons 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.199
 which causes the network to overflow I know that the pepper 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.249
 due to the release of inadequate waste in the sewage network 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.899
 especially fats 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.480
 then every property should 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.520
 to properly fulfill the body of work and good constructive practice 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.430
 has a device 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.990
 which can be made of masonry 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.819
 or even buyer 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.989
 ready now there is this device interest a device 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.480
 relatively inexpensive 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.280
 called fat box 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.090
 this box of fat 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.020
 works with the fact that fat is lighter than water 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.589
 So 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.570
 she is on the sink 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.500
 and during money laundering 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.790
 in materials when our neighboring pans throw waste from 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.520
 oil 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.440
 messi 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.780
 The launch is made by a tube 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.759
 that stay 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.789
 above 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.680
 of water level 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.130
 and then a second turn that lies inside the water 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.759
 as 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.870
 this fat floats 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.660
 it is then retained in that device the fat box 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.630
 this device is cleaned periodically 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.410
 and then avoid that this fat she goes 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.530
 the system 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.520
 of sewage 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.960
 to go to the sewage network to order the house problems as already quoted one of the 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.259
 more serious is exactly the overflow of the network clogging 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.780
 because fat works as an agronomist binder 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.230
 by pini editor 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.490
 uses 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.189
 for this population along with certain other seed residues 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.030
 it's up to us to have civilians 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.549
 and if it's a house 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.019
 buchecha faces 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.149
 paulo doors for the exercises 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:17.549
 waste that ends up clogging the sewage network that causes the overflow 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.699
 and pollutes the rivers 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:24.640
 in the treatment plant the fat on nothing is born also hinders 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.069
 the sewage treatment process 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.989
 therefore a good practice 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.259
 recommended practice to your mother-in-law 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:35.459
 because also 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.899
 in life it may be well 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:41.879
 case of fat the clogging of the rule itself did within the 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:42.749
 goal 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:47.289
 is that for category installation because it can be built in 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.190
 would be the same 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.369
 installed in stone and 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:57.709
 practice building your fat box is important to help you preserve your 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.470
 nature 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.570
 and avoiding contamination and overflowing is that the 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.140
 Sewer
