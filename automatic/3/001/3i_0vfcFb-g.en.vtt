00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.970 

this<00:00:23.800> is<00:00:24.009> the<00:00:24.220> first<00:00:24.490> step<00:00:25.060> in<00:00:25.329> the<00:00:25.750> pie<00:00:26.259> making

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
this is the first step in the pie making

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.890 
this is the first step in the pie making
process<00:00:27.489> I'm<00:00:27.699> going<00:00:27.939> to<00:00:28.000> be<00:00:28.119> making<00:00:28.449> the<00:00:28.599> crust

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
process I'm going to be making the crust

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.109 
process I'm going to be making the crust
I<00:00:29.109> have<00:00:29.289> my<00:00:29.470> pan<00:00:29.739> prepared<00:00:30.279> with<00:00:30.519> some<00:00:30.699> special

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
I have my pan prepared with some special

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.680 
I have my pan prepared with some special
spices<00:00:31.480> that<00:00:31.899> we<00:00:32.079> use<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:32.680> our<00:00:33.460> wax<00:00:33.910> formula

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
spices that we use and our wax formula

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.140 
spices that we use and our wax formula
and<00:00:34.960> I<00:00:35.920> just<00:00:36.190> pour<00:00:36.610> it<00:00:36.790> on<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.719> pan<00:00:37.989> and<00:00:39.150> try

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
and I just pour it on the pan and try

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.780 
and I just pour it on the pan and try
not<00:00:40.300> to<00:00:40.449> get<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.690> spices<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.589> Brown<00:00:42.220> too<00:00:42.579> much

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
not to get the spices to Brown too much

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.630 
not to get the spices to Brown too much
so<00:00:43.269> I'm<00:00:43.899> going<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.140> go<00:00:44.230> as<00:00:44.379> slowly<00:00:44.769> and<00:00:45.070> as<00:00:45.489> I

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
so I'm going to go as slowly and as I

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.030 
so I'm going to go as slowly and as I
possibly<00:00:46.180> can<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.559> that<00:00:47.860> each<00:00:48.839> crust<00:00:49.839> has<00:00:50.559> the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
possibly can so that each crust has the

00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:28.069 
possibly can so that each crust has the
right<00:00:51.250> amount<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:52.379> spices<00:00:53.379> and<00:00:53.949> color<00:00:54.190> in<00:00:54.489> them

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.380 

crust<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> little<00:01:29.159> crooked<00:01:29.520> today<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.060> I'm

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
crust is a little crooked today so I'm

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:43.690 
crust is a little crooked today so I'm
adjusting<00:01:30.810> my<00:01:31.079> pan

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.550 

and<00:01:44.119> I'm<00:01:44.330> going<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.509> let<00:01:44.689> this<00:01:44.869> sit<00:01:45.140> for<00:01:45.170> about

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
and I'm going to let this sit for about

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.219 
and I'm going to let this sit for about
a<00:01:45.590> half<00:01:45.860> an<00:01:45.979> hour<00:01:46.130> before<00:01:46.400> I<00:01:46.670> can<00:01:47.390> cut<00:01:47.689> out<00:01:47.900> my

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
a half an hour before I can cut out my

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.149 
a half an hour before I can cut out my
wax<00:01:48.770> dough<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:49.610> make<00:01:50.090> my<00:01:50.270> crust

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.740 

after<00:01:56.060> my<00:01:56.350> crust<00:01:57.350> is<00:01:57.619> set<00:01:57.860> up<00:01:58.039> I<00:01:58.310> now<00:01:59.149> cut<00:01:59.719> out

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
after my crust is set up I now cut out

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:08.370 
after my crust is set up I now cut out
my<00:02:00.610> pieces<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:02.240> make<00:02:02.420> my<00:02:02.689> crust<00:02:03.049> on<00:02:03.409> my<00:02:04.450> pans

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.710 

so<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:08.920> gently<00:02:09.870> lift<00:02:10.870> up<00:02:11.170> my<00:02:11.860> crust<00:02:12.490> piece<00:02:14.220> and

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
so I gently lift up my crust piece and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.020 
so I gently lift up my crust piece and
then<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:17.050> like<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.500> real<00:02:17.740> pie<00:02:18.010> I'm<00:02:18.460> going<00:02:18.850> to

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
then just like a real pie I'm going to

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:39.110 
then just like a real pie I'm going to
wrap<00:02:19.570> my<00:02:19.990> wax<00:02:20.290> crust<00:02:20.980> around<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:22.120> tin

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.670 

and<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.780> looks<00:02:40.019> just<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.830> real<00:02:41.040> pie<00:02:41.250> crust

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.620 

now<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.920> our<00:02:47.950> crusts<00:02:48.580> have<00:02:48.730> set<00:02:49.000> up<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.450> next

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
now that our crusts have set up the next

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.410 
now that our crusts have set up the next
step<00:02:49.990> is<00:02:50.230> putting<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.680> wicks<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:51.220> our<00:02:51.460> pies<00:02:51.730> we

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
step is putting the wicks in our pies we

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.140 
step is putting the wicks in our pies we
use<00:02:52.600> two<00:02:52.960> wicks<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.710> we<00:02:54.310> just<00:02:54.580> use<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> simple

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150
