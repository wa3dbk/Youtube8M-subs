00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.590
 being the island and playing the next series against nac was very much your home 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.179
 in three stages 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.420
 is playing the team 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.930
 the snow from the fog also be some times you think 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.410
 but yes I think so because the weather is nice for today and the 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.140
 next morning 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.220
 danger it seemed like a good feeling 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.930
 which is completely ready for let me hear you with a little hoarse but is it going to be one 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.069
 pose a problem for tomorrow's parry 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.339
 Austria is at a standstill is one that caused an interrogation 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.579
 that is in itself the same song for you every week now you just have to go there yourself 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.840
 to win and hope that vitesse points will be missed 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.820
 how do you view the evasion of the after-competition 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.010
 round I think I beh 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.600
 have the effect it is still possible then we go ahead anyway and I think so too 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.340
 that it is just possible 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.530
 and a good plan this morning just for profit and 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.889
 then maybe the pressure came up 

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:54.570
 vitesse and the county 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.150
 well if this season back through a according to ronny rasta suddenly in the 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.089
 Premier League that way against Ajax 4 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.100
 how do you view this development yourself 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 yes that did not go so well avoid 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.570
 the hague perhaps more than i expected the goal was one 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.170
 basic place and that succeeded 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.920
 and the boy has therefore come to and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.750
 yes that is only positive so i am 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.870
 fairly satisfied with my season 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.170
 after shell development did not go unnoticed because this week came the message 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.360
 outward that nrc would be interested in yours services what do you know 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.970
 thereof 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.310
 well i did indeed read it on the internet 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.330
 but 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.970
 yes that is not reported to me on such a 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.870
 I don't know anything about that myself 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.350
 yes i can tell you that it is a nice club 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.979
 that is not the case that your contract expires 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.590
 take him an overdose anyway 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.000
 for example, an option paid a wage with the kurt of a feyenoord fan the third time 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.360
 when you return there 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.720
 the year that possibility has been there for weeks 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.340
 and that soon I was my father a speaker just to evolve so and me 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.650
 do not know the results 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.610
 and if they do and do 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.610
 the only thing that I sometimes also use for such footballs and 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.980
 water is that 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.620
 preferably had it with soccer 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.239
 you can talk in five 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.109
 the calculators of 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.110
 the work is work 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.909
 together with alex pastor the collaboration is appreciated 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.609
 it falls just fine 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.259
 belong to that 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:23.099
 it is also poor the dinkel when playing and underestimated from the relegation candidate 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.879
 that we 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.909
 anyway valve not always try to play good football and one off then it became 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.139
 also so 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.669
 then a passenger car on the fall of good 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.789
 If you and possibly according to them there is a thought that you will still be there 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:35.149
 can learn over it 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:39.329
 the year that is a good sign because that is not yet to be 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.679
 or so 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.509
 So Jan also walk ahead if you do it a bit 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:44.819
 kind of exaggerated 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.010
 make nac breda first 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.340
 Yes, exactly
