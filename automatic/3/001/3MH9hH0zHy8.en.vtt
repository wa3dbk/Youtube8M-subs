00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.410
 work under maximum load and that 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.720
 in all areas 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.650
 It's the beginning of vacation in Hesse, Rhineland 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.720
 Palatinate and Saarland 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.550
 the airport has become an absolute 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.800
 Passenger record set 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.680
 whether this record actually cracked 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.740

 Here will be 220 thousand passengers today 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.850
 expected and that's pretty nice 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.350
 the a320 of air berlin with destination palma 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.539
 de mallorca rolls over quickly 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.980
 then the customer is on the way 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:59.050
 shortly thereafter, both machines are 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.800
 Air take off and land in the course 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.510
 At the same time there are already quite a few 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.089
 passengers in the terminals on the way 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.990
 because the vacation plane states mostly on 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.540
 early morning 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.490
 so that everything runs smoothly here 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.320
 the terminals control the whole day 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.320
 about a detailed look at the processes 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.990
 in the relevant areas of patrick those 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.610
 we got passenger ratings 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.050
 coordinating as a mission leader for the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.550
 passengers control the passenger flows 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.070
 at frankfurt airport 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.740
 that is to say we already set ourselves 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.390
 We are in charge of disturbances in operation 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.250
 then we have countermeasures 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.869
 staff on-site the around this 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.490
 initiate control measures for us 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.050
 or even technology on site 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.300
 Signs are dynamic 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.410
 let switch 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.600
 but at the latest at the passport control 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.000
 then you experience longer according to experience 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.770
 or, of course, the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.910
 Federal Police for weeks on the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.410
 beginning of the holidays prepares the whole 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.899
 staff used that to us 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.429
 available 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:00.349
 The Federal Police Directorate has one 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:03.950
 strength of 2400 employees of it about 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:05.630
 2,000 officials and for the for the 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.080
 Everything was used throughout the day 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.910
 brought what we can muster back 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.880
 on the apron we take a look 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.349
 Everything seems to be in the baggage handling sector 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.360
 to run smoothly 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.230
 what could be the worst case 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.030
 we happen anyway 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.040
 It can happen that the devices 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.250
 that could be a turn on for us 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.610
 a little too much but if all 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.690
 then created again 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.209
 then let's have a look like that 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.370
 loading directly on the plane but runs 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.080
 what is that a smoking wheel and 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.879
 biting stink welcomes us 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.580
 positions a 26 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.110
 the waiter's car has a breakdown 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.620
 but nobody seems to be here 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.290
 to disturb 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.840
 the pallet truck for almost loaded 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:59.890
 Loosely there like so call of must here 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:02.230
 but somebody get nervous every year 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.140
 vacation starts then of course we have 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.450
 to do a lot but we are 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.400
 used 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.260
 back in terminal 1 it is time one 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.799
 first balance sheet of today 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.140
 pull 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.450
 Although the halls are constantly filled the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.160
 you see around here and we 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.230
 have continuous good operation 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.950
 but he runs very smoothly for us 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.019
 and the preparations have been so far 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.450
 the team works well 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.819
 and the guests are so far 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.099
 mostly very early come that 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.630

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.130
 to distribute the guests well in good time 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.410
 You can relax by the protest 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.329
 can run and relax completely 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.760
 come to your plane and also 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.260
 Relaxed on vacation 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.239
 the punctuality of today 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.980
 days can be seen and who 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.840
 even too extreme in the evening 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.019
 pleasing statements by some airlines 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.239
 Lunchtime flights are already far 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.459
 over 80 thousand passengers on the way 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.680
 on vacation or already arrived 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.120
 at noon 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.750
 how does it actually look in the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.489
 Restaurants from we were right 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.140

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.420
 classic with currently twelve-thirty 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.280
 what am I doing the good but the format 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.989
 The business was not like us 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.340
 already last distinctive now actually 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.310
 also expected for this year 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.289
 but let's see if it happens 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.810
 something else in the evening 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.610
 cleaning service gcs you get up 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.860
 set the beginning of the holidays and nine 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.840
 additional cleaning forces ordered 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.759
 have on the apron 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.530
 meanwhile follow me drivers one 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.080
 safe look over the whole happen 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.500
 on the grounds of park positions as well 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.789
 runway today most passengers 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.210
 On the way we have to start your vacation 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.710
 hesse and of course a big one 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.500
 challenge at frankfurter 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.320
 Airport shows me like every day 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.080
 even if a plane more come that 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.090
 I do not want to know coordinated 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.789
 the apron supervision together with that of 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.740
 nomis from the apron grief as soon as one 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:04.280
 plane is touching the ground 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.840
 A secure view of the staff there 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.340
 Of course, more happiness move several 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.680
 movements of exemption from the 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.729
 and the yard and through the yard 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.949
 of course more to do more 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.479
 It's more stressful to coordinate it 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.190
 course, the colleagues try fast 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.820
 replace 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.889
 so that you can recover 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.770
 in between and no one else 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.330
 stop as usual in the early evening 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.789
 Let us know how many passengers 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.110
 because now at the airport railway are the 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.900
 Forecasts arrived 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.479
 We are waiting 213,000 passengers to the 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.889
 time is 70 percent already in the 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.180
 air and I think that too 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.229
 are satisfied because everything is smooth 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.880
 has gone 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.500
 All process partners are doing very well 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.400

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.860

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.330
 we have this morning and each before the 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.310
 single pieks with the process partner 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.240
 together every single peak 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.680

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.449

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.940
 airport was prepared for this day 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.830
 also the airlines have because then everyone 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.940

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.940
 Feedback given 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.919
 no airman was late it is time 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:14.900
 ask the passengers how it is 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.650
 For them today , it is very good 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.690

 Of course I like the organization 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.240
 It is a big airport therefore must 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:43.150

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:46.010
