00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
everyone gets one I see when there was a

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.360 
everyone gets one I see when there was a
home<00:00:43.719> any<00:00:43.870> frying<00:00:44.260> pans<00:00:44.440> today

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
home any frying pans today

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.369 
home any frying pans today
well<00:00:45.910> that<00:00:46.059> was<00:00:46.210> he<00:00:46.360> did<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.629> side<00:00:46.930> hit<00:00:47.110> of<00:00:47.230> the

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
well that was he did the side hit of the

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.990 
well that was he did the side hit of the
up<00:00:47.500> air<00:00:47.710> again<00:00:47.980> that's<00:00:48.129> an<00:00:48.190> armada<00:00:48.489> innovation
