00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.580
 the time has come to finish the story 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.680
 of final fantasy 13 and never better said 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.660
 because this time we're going to go literally 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.520
 against the square clock and mix us 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.220
 presents the third installment of the series 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.169
 one that arrives to tie ropes try to 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.199
 please the fans and step 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.800
 reinvent the original formula - 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.800
 hallways 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.289
 + west 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.460
 and a reformed battle system 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.430
 they are presented as line in weapons 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.800
 which are on to close a trilogy 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.110
 that has generated little controversy during 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.570
 the past five years as they have treated 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.050
 the Japanese to their last creature what 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.050
 we discovered 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.420
 History is fundamental in any 

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:10.670
 final fantasy and here we do not find 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.859
 exception may this time of 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.450
 too many things for known and that your 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:17.090
 interest decays with respect to past 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.459
 deliveries but for the fans it supposes a 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.740
 good source of answers all in the 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:23.719
 lightning paper pushed to save a 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.149
 world that only has a few days left 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.149
 life the return of old characters 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.440
 and of the epic situations 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.249
 are part of a plot where our 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.859
 protagonist will remain the core 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:41.539
 central sent nothing more and nothing less 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.350
 that for god to fulfill an important 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.350
 mission 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.310
 probably the most relevant novelty 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.560
 by lightning williams we find it in 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.540
 the time a watch with my present we 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.820
 remember continuously that every action 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.160
 mind that we should take advantage of our 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.870
 Battling hours will not take time away from 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.870
 lest we lose our lives 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.959
 complete quest could help us win 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.959
 someday even though it is not insured 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.760
 certain actions require being in 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.010
 the right point to the exact time 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.880
 and every day requires us to return 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.160
 at six o'clock home 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.870
 maybe too many obligations for a 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.550
 overwhelming system without providing a 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.550
 feeling of enjoyment in return 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.510
 the passage of time stands as the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.700
 true limit to our experience 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.040
 of play if we lose our lives we are 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.959
 snatches an hour but if we complete 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.150
 missions we may prolong our 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.459
 stay in the world the decisions 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.590
 matter they guide our progress with a 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.170
 night day cycle that illustrates the passage of 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.000
 the days the rhythm of the game is debatable 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.400
 since which are not the most 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.319
 interesting and also the structure of 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.269
 game is confusing but at least 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.590
 lightning cheering can not be denied the 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.840
 have tried 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.819
 After all, we are facing a 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.819
 work very different from the previous 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.070
 one of the biggest problems of the game 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.280
 is overwhelming with tutorials almost 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.440
 eternal 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.750
 with a slow pace of play and little 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.520
 defined the battle system by 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.140
 misfortune fails to maintain the 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.750
 balance demonstrated in the most recent 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.150
 past the fighting they make use of a 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.490
 Novel scheme now more dynamic 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.490
 attack by holding down a button 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.490
 and defend ourselves by pressing another in the 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.580
 opportune moment 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.320
 are the main keys that and go 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.320
 alternating between the different profiles 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.560
 represented by the suits of 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.900
 lightning 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.939
 manage the attack rods 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.730
 and find the weak points of the 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.730
 rivals suppose fundamental elements 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.330
 where is the problem in that again 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.550
 the user is suffocated with too many 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.010
 factors to take into account the difficulty 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.200
 although it has two variants plus one 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.269
 unlockable does not help balance the 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.579
 gaming experience and as for the 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.889
 feeling of progression is confusing 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.900
 the less the elimination of points of 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.270
 experience is appreciated that the 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.740
 Japanese try to experiment but not 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.560
 that decisions have become 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.050
 in frustration facing the player that yes 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.450
 not everything is negative the personalization 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.450
 It is powerful with a number of weapons 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.720
 and accessories 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.240
 and costumes for line 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.050
 the final fantasy series 13 has shown 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.180
 a unique artistic section and very 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.979
 careful from the first delivery the 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.470
 work carried out was ginormous 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.080
 but it has gone less with each video game 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.300
 line in beyond is the most important point 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.400
 under the saga with some graphics that do not 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.599
 they take advantage of xbox 360 and 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.520
 Playstation 3 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.520
 Uninspired modeling 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:15.959
 low definition textures 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.990
 and framerate falls 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.880
 are the tonic of a game in which 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.100
 what stands out most is the music with a 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.680
 Careful combination of old and new 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.870
 melodies is a shame because graphically 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.870
 the title could have given a lot of itself 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.420
 this is the farewell of lightning or 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.070
 less than final fantasy 13 we would have 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.260
 I liked having seen the trilogy in 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.210
 crescendo can not be said however 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.010
 what line in which jones is a 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.230
 video game inadvisable for your 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.030
 unconditional faithful those who are 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.340
 eager to know what you 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.680
 happens to the already endearing protagonist 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.780
 this particular countdown will give them 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.520
 answers with an important touch of 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.770
 innovation although not lacking in 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.140
 ups and downs nobody said to save the world 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.870
 It was going to be easy but the Japanese 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.760
 square enix still have a long time not 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.780
 as lightning to work in the 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.139
 we will wait for franchise 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.139
 no no
