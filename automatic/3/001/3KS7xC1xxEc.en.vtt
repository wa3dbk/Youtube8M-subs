00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.620
 I'm shooting a documentary I want that 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:12.049
 you had cameras yes we filmed 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.889
 I was going to refuel absolutely 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.859
 I was going to put gas in my 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.740
 car because you're doing that would tell you to 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.610
 make a bet wahba ones r the winner gets 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.610
 have your tank full of gas 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:32.099
 it's the loser who pays well yes 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.750
 the challenge is that it's fair and 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.699
 once it's me who loses I give you 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.370
 twice the price of your plate 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.329
 it would be cool I think I found 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.159
 taker 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.630
 but to make a good bet I need 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:47.910
 a totally improbable proposition 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.340
 shot and I bet that without looking at the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.730
 cane pump I can stop on the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.110
 precise amount that you give me everything 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.340
 what I ask you that exceeds our 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.340
 high schools a walk of one or sendai 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.470

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.270
 good luck in the ex it seems so much 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.970
 impossible and one would have to be crazy for 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.070

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.670

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.390
 number 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.680

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:44.140
 35,18 35 dollars he then unlocked my 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.000
 pump for this precise amount can 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.600
 plus a few cents for me to exceed 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.440

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.810
