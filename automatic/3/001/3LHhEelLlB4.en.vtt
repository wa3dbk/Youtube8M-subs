there<00:00:22.230> we've<00:00:23.189> got<00:00:23.220> their<00:00:23.519> V<00:00:23.670> rocker<00:00:23.939> which

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
there we've got their V rocker which

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.779 
there we've got their V rocker which
will<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.289> some<00:00:25.980> rocker<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.400> between<00:00:26.670> the

will have some rocker in between the
bindings<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.630> gives<00:00:27.869> goes<00:00:28.140> right<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.349> the

bindings it gives goes right to the
pressure<00:00:28.800> distribution<00:00:29.070> edge<00:00:29.580> which<00:00:29.730> there's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
pressure distribution edge which there's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.400 
pressure distribution edge which there's
a<00:00:29.910> little<00:00:30.119> bump<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> edge<00:00:31.109> really

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
a little bump out in the edge really

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.250 
a little bump out in the edge really
hard<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> see<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.669> naked<00:00:32.880> eye<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.809> this

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
hard to see with the naked eye but this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
hard to see with the naked eye but this
gives<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.590> extra<00:00:34.950> grip

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
gives you extra grip

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.250 
gives you extra grip
besides<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.030> contact<00:00:36.510> at<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> nose<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:36.989> the

besides the contact at the nose and the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080 
besides the contact at the nose and the
tail<00:00:37.500> we've<00:00:38.010> got<00:00:38.219> ones<00:00:38.489> right<00:00:38.730> underneath<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
tail we've got ones right underneath the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060 
tail we've got ones right underneath the
bindings<00:00:39.510> where<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> pressure<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
bindings where all the pressure is and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.000 
bindings where all the pressure is and
it<00:00:41.399> goes<00:00:41.430> into<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.879> little<00:00:42.180> bit<00:00:42.270> more<00:00:42.300> rocker

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
it goes into a little bit more rocker

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.760 
it goes into a little bit more rocker
after<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.789> binding<00:00:45.450> position<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.590> one's

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
after the binding position this one's

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130 
after the binding position this one's
got<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.250> channel<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.750> probably<00:00:48.960> heard<00:00:49.050> about

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
got the channel you probably heard about

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.840 
got the channel you probably heard about
that<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.860> you're<00:00:50.039> rocking<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.370> board<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.730> got

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that if you're rocking the board you got

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.549 
that if you're rocking the board you got
to<00:00:51.059> do<00:00:51.120> an<00:00:51.239> est<00:00:51.539> binding<00:00:51.899> otherwise<00:00:52.379> you're

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
to do an est binding otherwise you're

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.200 
to do an est binding otherwise you're
only<00:00:52.710> unlocking<00:00:53.219> half<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> performance<00:00:54.090> of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you got the pro tip construction it's

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.569 
you got the pro tip construction it's
really<00:01:01.320> meaty<00:01:01.559> through<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> center<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> the

up a little bit quicker than most other
boards<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.500> got<00:01:13.979> me<00:01:14.130> power<00:01:14.340> through<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
boards just got me power through the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.780 
boards just got me power through the
crud<00:01:15.380> allows<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.619> get<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.280> float<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.520> on

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
crud allows it to get it and float up on

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.999 
crud allows it to get it and float up on
top<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.119> powder<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.720> bit<00:01:18.810> quicker<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
top of powder a little bit quicker and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:20.990 
top of powder a little bit quicker and
gives<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:20.460> bit<00:01:20.610> longer

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
gives it a little bit longer

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.210 
gives it a little bit longer
you<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.810> effective<00:01:22.229> edged<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.770> typically

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
you know effective edged and typically

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.310 
you know effective edged and typically
you'd<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.700> boards<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.210> length<00:01:24.479> so

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
you'd see in boards of this length so

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.719 
you'd see in boards of this length so
now--so<00:01:25.500> has<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> scoop<00:01:26.070> nose<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.549> tail
