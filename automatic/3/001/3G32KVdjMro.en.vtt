00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.200
 what's up stable as you see new video 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.030
 and well I will bring as you see how 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.029
 build the four buttons of the new 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.110
 zombie map of shore is the inah 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.820
 the red the 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.410
 yellow and blue and good kids 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.480
 this is the first one in lilac 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.700
 so I'm going to start first of all 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.260
 you will have to take the white disk and the 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.720
 gramophone the white disk as you see 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.420
 can be down there behind the raccoon 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.790
 or next to the paca mans as you can see there 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.320
 wheelbarrow is with element 115 or 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.390
 Meteorites is where you pointed 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.000
 good the second 8 hours that you have 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.129
 that take that link the woman who is in 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.190
 a single location 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.160
 is at the bottom and has no loss 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.620
 next to the table lying good for 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.800
 this cane and as for us 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.910
 you need a three piece disc and the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.180
 tip and the disc the location of the 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.250
 bÃ¡rtoli disk as you can see 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.990
 or there is in the ground tunnel 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.790
 that is the earth tunnel that is at 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.640
 side of titan for those who do not know 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.710
 but good now as now I'll get out of 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.619
 the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.640
 ay of the tunnel and you will see how it can also 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:29.860
 be here next to the tirant on the table 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.860
 and you have to bring several discs 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.020
 pieces at a time and there is no need for 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.530
 comrades the second you will have to 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.040
 Activate 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.930
 the tank that you will know where is the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.450
 church and well this is a trick that I 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.490
 I have as you see, the zombie will come 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.020
 you and as you can not be giving 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.299
 back and then you will have to jump to 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.280
 I do not fall, what I do is fall with the 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.509
 zombie and then as I go faster than 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.100
 the zombie then I go and jump into the tank 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:04.340
 is this I am going to put it as how is it going 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.310
 the tank is to say in order by order 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.890
 of coming out and first of all 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.380
 is on the right side you will have to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.430
 jump down at the corner of the 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.410
 tank that there is not like a fence of that 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.300
 that could be right because if you do not 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.450
 you will be uprooted and you will not be able to pick up 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.700
 the 1st and see how the zombie call us diaz and 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.600
 how do you see there is a common open bridge 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.760
 this other bridge passes and there will be the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.640
 the piece does not have inverted the second 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.250
 we go down and take the tank again 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.300
 second piece as you see now is in the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.310
 left side would be left once it's 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.680
 on the left side and as you see good 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.790
 that I will explain it is to get the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.470
 cane the red cane and on the side 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.270
 left when you see a wood and 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.190
 open you can catch the other piece 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.180
 does not change the location of the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.120
 pieces I think they do not change the 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.000
 location none and we go down where 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.560
 we have come and as you can see there you have a 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.170
 bit of haste can choose the tank 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.700
 for the third piece there that in 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.040
 I did not really want to jump, I do not know how 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.980
 has not released very fellow that was 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.720
 playing him with me and when you see how 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.820
 a dirt road so you can 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.380
 jump and it 's the easiest of all not 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.230
 you will have to 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.490
 you do not have to jump they do not do any 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.530
 rare jump they have not lost there are 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.540
 are the three pieces now what 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.030
 we have to do is like opening the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.300
 portal to catch the tip and the portal 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.790
 it's nothing else was next to this 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.400
 generator that is just down lower 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.410
 the payment consists of the haiti we lower the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.270
 ground tunnel and very important to carry 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.210
 the gramophone because I the first time 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.830
 I forgot and well you have to place the 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.740
 we create one on the table on the left and 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.350
 will begin to always give to armada 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.610
 as one as a stone that will make a 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:06.740
 portal now you will see it look at this I do not know 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.270
 If I change the order I do not know but I do not know 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.210
 if they change the order the portals I think 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.660
 that in those eggs only the 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.900
 tunnel and the and in the others as you see there 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.389
 1 of each color we take the color d 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.100
 of lira that we have all the pieces 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.100
 and we are going to give it to the 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.710
 teleportation good as I said 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.960
 be careful because they can leave are 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.850
 temporary that there is at this time to read 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.100
 they are my templars of those who do not know 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.600
 how can we continue that they can not kill him if 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.790
 they can kill him but soon more 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.560
 color comes out harder out there 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.320
 You see how I am an asshole and I turn to 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.750
 put in 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.520
 to the portal and good when you leave 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.500
 you take the very important gramophone 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.180
 because grams there is not only one and I just 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.180
 a player can take it and you put it 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.150
 there on the table below where there is next 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.690
 from where we have taken it we put it there 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:04.420
 and as you can see, it will start to sound like 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.020
 a music or will say that liberal blanket of 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.840
 I do not know what you're doing and I'm releasing you there 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.240
 see how they are going down a ladder 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.760
 there with him we can jump in contrast 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.060
 a little low on the first the first 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.090
 ladder that we caught and when 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:26.050
 let's have the tip that will be next 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.180
 of the white disk and the gramophone 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.710
 we go to color and we start 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.820
 create it 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.990
 here I have picked up the red cane because 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.120
 because for you to see that you can 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.690
 change and then you can leave and go back 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.690
 A) Yes 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:46.800
 I'm going to upload all the buttons to it 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:52.370
 so I hope you like this one 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.370
 video and us and nothing else we see
