00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.869 

so<00:03:30.290> where<00:03:30.439> do<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.530> think<00:03:30.620> like<00:03:31.099> going<00:03:31.400> forward

doubles<00:03:33.799> or<00:03:34.040> more<00:03:34.700> stuff<00:03:35.000> like<00:03:35.180> Charles's<00:03:35.659> it

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
doubles or more stuff like Charles's it

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.170 
doubles or more stuff like Charles's it
I<00:03:36.319> think<00:03:36.859> that's<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.579> know<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.819> best<00:03:37.969> thing

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.490 
I think that's you know the best thing
about<00:03:38.239> our<00:03:38.420> sport<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:39.049> you<00:03:39.109> can<00:03:39.230> do<00:03:39.319> whatever

you<00:03:39.739> want<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.159> I<00:03:40.579> think<00:03:40.670> it's<00:03:41.030> always<00:03:41.180> going

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
you want and I think it's always going

you want and I think it's always going
to<00:03:41.450> be<00:03:41.510> from<00:03:42.079> calm<00:03:42.439> to<00:03:42.469> comfort<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.099> going<00:03:43.219> to
