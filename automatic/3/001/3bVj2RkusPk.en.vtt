00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.450
 to make this cake we need to 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.430
 slices of sponge cake from a ganache 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.050
 no problem and we also need to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.050
 mnm 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.489
 it's the threat languages are organized 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.170
 for people who are allergic to 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.640
 gluten 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.710
 I personally called the service 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.890
 consumers have concerned that this is 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.620
 love the spruce mills at the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.809
 collection and the chocolate one I have not 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.510
 the package and those who have the package 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.720
 brown and allow themselves also we made 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.399
 good news to realize the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.159
 ganache i need the same amount 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.960
 of chocolate and fresh cream I do 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.519
 boil the cream and I put it 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.560
 on the piece of chocolate and I leave 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.560
 ask a few minutes 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.960
 here I took 200 g of chocolate and wine 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.939
 smell of fresh cream 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.479
 we mix well our cream with 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.880
 chocolate and let say in a 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.650
 corner in the kitchen because it takes 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.390
 not that the ganache is too cold for 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.540
 can stick the finger around 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.540
 cake 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.200
 mallet of a chai ready i will start 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.130
 mounting my cake on a sheet 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.900
 of baking paper 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.490
 I put my first slice of the genoa 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.490
 plant on a layer of ganache 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.190
 I put a second layer of sponge cake 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.970
 I press lightly and I spread on a 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.970
 little ganache 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.940
 I continue like this until all finish 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.920
 metoise of sponge cake I put it 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.220

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.220
 want 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.380
 no 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.409
 we are trying to arrange the top and the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.280
 sides of our cake and if I have to 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.280
 add some chocolate 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
 at 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.610
 I thought but finger all around 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.400
 my cake 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.470
 I try to form a beautiful circle if 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.380
 I do not come to school and I put a little 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.930
 of ganache on the dies and 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.199
 frozen in glue on the cake this chain 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.199
 feel better 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.150
 so now the magic moment 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:18.150
 now if we can maintain the 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.479
 cake with a ribbon and let it 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.849
 cool well before serving 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.650

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:29.610
