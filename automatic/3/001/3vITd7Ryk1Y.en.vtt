the extra moolah

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.619 
the extra moolah
so<00:06:04.220> our<00:06:04.370> guess<00:06:04.580> is<00:06:04.789> that<00:06:04.940> while<00:06:05.150> other<00:06:05.360> bike

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:05.629 
so our guess is that while other bike

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.749 
so our guess is that while other bike
makers<00:06:06.050> may<00:06:06.169> be<00:06:06.229> going<00:06:06.470> green<00:06:06.830> Honda<00:06:07.340> may<00:06:07.610> have

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
makers may be going green Honda may have

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.260 
makers may be going green Honda may have
just<00:06:08.000> found<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:08.330> formula<00:06:08.599> to<00:06:09.080> beat<00:06:09.289> the<00:06:09.500> heat
