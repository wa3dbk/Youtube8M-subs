00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:13.089
 the current world immersed in competitiveness has undergone a change 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.800
 accelerated in the different productive activities of the human being 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.740
 and the meat sector 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.740
 is no exception 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:29.919
 and the Mexican pig farmers through technified production systems 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.200
 last generation genetics 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.819
 as well as the continuous improvement of health and hygiene conditions 

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:39.029
 have managed to produce healthy pigs and therefore 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.650
 lean meat before harmless high quality 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.170
 that is not only consumed in mexico if what is exported now countries like 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.170
 united states japan and south korea 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.370
 today lean meat to be docontime barely 14% home 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.520
 interspersed in the muscle in a group of selected cuts its luchita to 3% 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.880
 In addition to providing a significant amount of protein vitamins 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.430
 and other essential nutrients 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.740
 all this has 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.300
 next to pork 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.300
 the most consumed plan in the world 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.770
 According to FAO, the production and consumption of pork have had a 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.120
 increase of 300 27% in the last 40 years 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.980
 the consumption of pork 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.780
 is concentrated in developed countries reporting more than 40 kilograms per 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.110
 person per year 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.750
 it's your sun 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.230
 austria spain denmark germany holland and poland among other countries 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.130
 European 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.429
 Besides China Japan United States and Canada 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.159
 occupying Mexico the 17th place worldwide 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.820
 It should be noted that in Mexico there are technified production systems 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.930
 comparable to those of the European economic community and those of states 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.640
 united america 3 a taste 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.390
 know that one because the pork that is produced in mexico 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.679
 It is being exported to countries with high percent levels 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:16.660
 of demand regarding the importation of meat as is the case 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.589
 from Japan and the United States 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.669
 It's really great to see the technical effort and that's why 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.219
 We are at the level of the best with export to Japan United States to 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.879
 Canada with a lot of demand for quality 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.759
 all that is the effort of having 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:30.949
 It's production 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.189
 special vegas 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.529
 aesthetically very well selected 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:36.730
 everything is the process 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.699
 to get your final consumption 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:43.559
 in pig farming, food is the future, it matters the most 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.809
 modern kitchen nutrition 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:50.259
 is focused on producing caritas pork 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.019
 and then to fatten pigs 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:59.769
 from the economic point of view it is much more expensive to produce a kilogram 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.179
 of fat in the fence that a kilogram of meat 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:05.560
 a difference in energy demand 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.599
 involved in the synthesis of both tissues in the animal's organism 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.729
 There are also food plants where the 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.419
 inputs according to each of the productive stages of the sector 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.889
 supervised by doctors industry placed certificates 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:29.239
 and swine exits is considered an indispensable practice 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.430
 for prevention control 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.320
 and eradication of the main diseases that affect pigs 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:39.489
 another characteristic that distinguishes the health of the pork industry 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.779
 mexican 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:44.209
 is that prohibited hormones are not used as promoters of the 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.209
 growth to produce lean meat 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.519
 the process 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.650
 These models are highly painted and fixed 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.389
 and I say good characteristics of one hundred percent 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.349
 and health in general 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.049
 extraordinary 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.949
 within the management of plants 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.409
 one of the most relevant aspects 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.779
 is biosecurity 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.299
 that this set of measures aimed at preventing the entry of agents 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.409
 infectious on the court 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.379
 that can endanger the health of animals and therefore 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.379
 the economic productivity of the median 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.860
 it is the case perimeter fences that isolate the production unit 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.830
 Restricted and controlled access to avoid possible contamination 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.770
 sanitary arch for disinfection of vehicles 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.990

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.660
 sanitary napkin on entry to livestock housing areas 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.580

 health services and training programs in a personal cinema 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.070
 allows to maintain high levels of infestation is for olympic awards 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.830
 fundamental action against consular assistance 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.580
 the impact of the quality of the meat 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.969
 the results 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.199
 and a good animal production system 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.279
 has a good management of it 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.860
 in the conditions of hygiene and health 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.460
 that we could observe 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.550
 both results in a good product can not be another of 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.569
 another way 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.029
 mexico the entire marketing channels 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.950

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.979
 is cataloged as technified isern and technified 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.319
 including obtaining international recognition of health measures 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.469
 and security 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.080
 that are carried out in our country 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.669

 federal inspection type establishments i 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:49.839
 once again 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:54.719
 Biosecurity is of paramount importance in slaughter facilities 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.639
 court and then ethics 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.490
 tif certification 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.610
 is granted by the sagarpa 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.819
 only to establishments that meet strict health and safety requirements 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:05.699
 hygiene 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:10.080
 guaranteeing the safety of meat and meat products that prevents their 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.999
 bankruptcy 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:15.119
 they are monitored permanently by official veterinarians 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.189
 not approved by the parties 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.189
 the required standards although the highest level 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:26.259
 and what has led to the recognition of the track system at an international level 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.620
 through mutual recognition agreements 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.440
 the process rooms are destined solely and exclusively to carry out the 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.870
 sports activity after yes and partly to the high vacuum 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.819
 Hindu are used for no other purpose since this could 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.819
 represent a risk to the health of the product 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.669
 I visited a pig farm there is a trail 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.909
 no doubt the processes are improved have refined and that allows us to have a 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:57.789
 more product 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:02.240
 more reliable in terms of hygiene and nutritional quality, the visit of the 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.969
 today gives us the confidence we can have good products made in 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:11.489
 mexico of the best quality and it is not necessary to be importing 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.919
 these same products from other countries of which we have no knowledge 

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:22.849
 in December 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:26.089
 and the processes of production of Mexican pork 

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:30.369
 they are governed by the strictest international quality standards 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.770
 generates substantial benefits in the product 

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:38.719
 Mexican pork ti 

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:43.399
 a potential that we should appreciate as an important element in the healthy diet 

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:45.759
 from all of us 

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:46.809
 It is therefore 

00:07:46.809 --> 00:07:48.889
 that today we say color 

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:51.039
 that the Mexican pork ti 

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:52.229
 it is by far 

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:54.360
 the tastiest protein
