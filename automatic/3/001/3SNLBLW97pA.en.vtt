go up now this is actually really really

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.970 
go up now this is actually really really
simple<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.820> do<00:00:12.059> honestly<00:00:13.019> I'm<00:00:13.590> going<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.799> kind

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
simple to do honestly I'm going to kind

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.220 
simple to do honestly I'm going to kind
of<00:00:14.070> little<00:00:14.340> bit<00:00:14.370> over<00:00:14.790> complicated<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:15.780> what

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
of little bit over complicated but what

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.380 
of little bit over complicated but what
this<00:00:16.350> really<00:00:16.410> comes<00:00:16.949> down<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.300> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
this really comes down to is that you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.359 
this really comes down to is that you
have<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.720> run<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.439> cannot<00:00:19.770> get<00:00:19.980> hit<00:00:20.189> by

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
have to run and you cannot get hit by

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.800 
have to run and you cannot get hit by
whenever<00:00:20.670> he<00:00:20.789> does<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.090> cannon<00:00:21.300> barrage<00:00:21.539> you

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
whenever he does the cannon barrage you

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.810 
whenever he does the cannon barrage you
can't<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.230> hit<00:00:22.380> by<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.310> also<00:00:23.460> can't

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
can't be hit by that and you also can't

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.060 
can't be hit by that and you also can't
be<00:00:23.939> hit<00:00:24.090> by<00:00:24.210> backdraft<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.769> very

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
be hit by backdraft and so it's very

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.820 
be hit by backdraft and so it's very
simple<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.580> easy<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.000> avoid<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.830> honestly

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
simple and easy to avoid and honestly

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.679 
simple and easy to avoid and honestly
this<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.760> an<00:00:29.910> achievement<00:00:30.000> you'll<00:00:30.480> probably

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
this is an achievement you'll probably

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.020 
this is an achievement you'll probably
get<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.560> good<00:00:31.740> pug<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:32.820> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
get with just a good pug but if you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.060 
get with just a good pug but if you
don't<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:33.930> how<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.230> get<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> normal

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
don't this is how to get as a normal

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.100 
don't this is how to get as a normal
group<00:00:35.280> basically<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.750> want<00:00:37.020> to

have happen is you want to make sure

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.799 
have happen is you want to make sure
that<00:00:38.370> everybody<00:00:38.700> kind<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.969> has<00:00:39.149> timed<00:00:39.540> out

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
that everybody kind of has timed out

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.660 
that everybody kind of has timed out
like<00:00:40.410> who<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.739> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.980> go<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.370> interrupt

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
like who is going to go and interrupt

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.340 
like who is going to go and interrupt
the<00:00:41.760> cannon<00:00:42.059> brushes<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.690> make<00:00:43.079> sure<00:00:43.230> that

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the cannon brushes and make sure that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
the cannon brushes and make sure that
you<00:00:43.469> don't<00:00:43.590> take<00:00:44.190> any<00:00:44.219> chances<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:45.059> terms<00:00:45.270> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
you don't take any chances in terms of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.690 
you don't take any chances in terms of
getting<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.960> getting<00:00:46.770> hit<00:00:47.010> by<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> can

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
getting the getting hit by it as you can

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.209 
getting the getting hit by it as you can
see<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.329> go<00:00:48.450> right<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> boxes<00:00:49.980> here

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
see we go right to the to the boxes here

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.250 
see we go right to the to the boxes here
and<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.850> wait<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> cast<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.989> then<00:00:52.140> I'm

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and we wait for it cast and then I'm

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.660 
and we wait for it cast and then I'm
going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> take<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> Gateway<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.250> I'm<00:00:53.430> pretty

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
going to take the Gateway up I'm pretty

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.979 
going to take the Gateway up I'm pretty
sure<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.940> don't<00:00:54.210> quite<00:00:54.420> remember<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> do

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
sure I don't quite remember what I do

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
sure I don't quite remember what I do
here<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.530> video<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.430> either<00:00:56.760> way<00:00:56.940> I'm

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
here in this video but either way I'm

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.340 
here in this video but either way I'm
probably<00:00:57.239> gonna<00:00:57.420> take<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> Gateway<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.140> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
probably gonna take the Gateway up and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.439 
probably gonna take the Gateway up and
then<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.859> go<00:00:59.010> ahead<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.280> tag<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> boss<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
then I go ahead and tag the boss and it

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.360 
then I go ahead and tag the boss and it
interrupts<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.930> counter<00:01:01.170> Braj<00:01:01.379> nobody<00:01:02.190> got

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
interrupts this counter Braj nobody got

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.779 
interrupts this counter Braj nobody got
hit

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
hit

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
hit
it's<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.329> rinse<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.660> repeat<00:01:04.019> now<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:04.650> are

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
it's just rinse and repeat now there are

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.140 
it's just rinse and repeat now there are
a<00:01:04.739> couple<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:05.070> things<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.280> kind<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:05.880> wrong

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
a couple of things that kind of go wrong

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.910 
a couple of things that kind of go wrong
here<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.020> sometimes<00:01:07.380> people<00:01:07.650> won't<00:01:07.740> be

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
here is that sometimes people won't be

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.280 
here is that sometimes people won't be
fast<00:01:08.130> enough<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> boxes<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> if

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
fast enough to get to the boxes and if

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440 
fast enough to get to the boxes and if
you<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.979> hit<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.400> reset<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> instance

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
you get hit you just reset the instance

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.000 
you get hit you just reset the instance
and<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> big<00:01:13.290> deal

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and it's not really a big deal

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.950 
and it's not really a big deal
backdraft<00:01:14.700> becomes<00:01:15.119> more<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.450> an<00:01:15.540> issue<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
backdraft becomes more of an issue the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.260 
backdraft becomes more of an issue the
more<00:01:16.140> times<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.560> he<00:01:16.680> does<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.189> brush<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.850> so

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
more times that he does can brush and so

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.640 
more times that he does can brush and so
the<00:01:18.390> best<00:01:18.540> way<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.720> handling<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the best way of handling that is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.969 
the best way of handling that is
obviously<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.330> somebody<00:01:21.540> either

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
obviously you just have somebody either

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.380 
obviously you just have somebody either
deterrence<00:01:22.979> works<00:01:23.280> by<00:01:23.580> running<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.180> I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
deterrence works by running out there I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.460 
deterrence works by running out there I
don't<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:24.990> that'll<00:01:25.140> fill<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
don't know if that'll fill the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.920 
don't know if that'll fill the
achievement<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.460> um<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:27.210> sprint<00:01:27.630> rogue

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
achievement but um like sprint rogue

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.569 
achievement but um like sprint rogue
sprint<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:29.100> pretty<00:01:29.310> quick

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
sprint can get up there pretty quick

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
sprint can get up there pretty quick
there's<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.360> ton<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.600> stuff<00:01:30.900> they<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.829> you

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
there's a ton of stuff they can get you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.319 
there's a ton of stuff they can get you
up<00:01:32.009> there<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:32.430> quickly<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.939> especially

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
up there really quickly and especially

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.120 
up there really quickly and especially
like<00:01:33.479> warlock<00:01:33.869> gateways<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.530> warlocks<00:01:34.950> have

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
like warlock gateways like warlocks have

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.590 
like warlock gateways like warlocks have
a<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.460> good<00:01:35.579> chance<00:01:35.640> at<00:01:36.150> actually

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
a really good chance at actually

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.450 
a really good chance at actually
stopping<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.229> stream<00:01:37.439> happening<00:01:37.890> once<00:01:38.159> like

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
stopping the stream happening once like

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.039 
stopping the stream happening once like
if<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:38.970> got<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.240> under<00:01:39.360> control<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
if you really got it under control and

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.560 
if you really got it under control and
so<00:01:40.650> either<00:01:40.829> way<00:01:41.130> guys<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:42.090> probably

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
so either way guys this is like probably

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.569 
so either way guys this is like probably
one<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> easier<00:01:43.259> ones<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:44.189> thought<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
one of the easier ones we thought that

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.609 
one of the easier ones we thought that
if<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.850> knocked<00:01:45.119> him<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.229> were<00:01:46.320> halfway

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
if we knocked him we if we were halfway

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.800 
if we knocked him we if we were halfway
back<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:47.970> had<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> boss<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.630> halfway

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
back if we had the boss like halfway

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.800 
back if we had the boss like halfway
back<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> ship<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.939> would<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.570> time

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
back to the ship we would have more time

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.469 
back to the ship we would have more time
to<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.009> boxes<00:01:53.520> I'm<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.329> really

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
to get to the the boxes I'm not really

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.389 
to get to the the boxes I'm not really
entirely<00:01:54.899> sure<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.259> that's<00:01:55.470> true<00:01:55.740> or<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:55.920> but

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
entirely sure if that's true or not but

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.490 
entirely sure if that's true or not but
you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.060> kind<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.360> get<00:01:57.570> there<00:01:57.780> anyway<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.140> as

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you can kind of get there anyway and as

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.380 
you can kind of get there anyway and as
you<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.710> see<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.369> did<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.850> didn't<00:02:00.210> have

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
you can see there I did I didn't have

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.429 
you can see there I did I didn't have
the<00:02:00.689> money<00:02:01.500> call<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.750> what<00:02:03.750> was<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:03.990> had<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the money call it what was it I had the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.440 
the money call it what was it I had the
gateway<00:02:04.829> debuff<00:02:05.159> that's<00:02:05.340> right<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.210> had

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
gateway debuff that's right and so I had

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.550 
gateway debuff that's right and so I had
the<00:02:06.570> charge<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:07.049> there<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> actually

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the charge up there and I actually

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
the charge up there and I actually
almost<00:02:08.099> got<00:02:08.280> hit<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.000> was<00:02:09.149> luckily<00:02:09.509> enough

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
almost got hit but I was luckily enough

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.839 
almost got hit but I was luckily enough
I<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.619> right<00:02:10.649> up<00:02:11.009> there<00:02:11.039> next<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.520> him<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.730> so

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
I was right up there next to him and so

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.910 
I was right up there next to him and so
it<00:02:11.940> didn't<00:02:12.209> hit<00:02:12.330> me<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:13.230> was<00:02:13.260> really

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
it didn't hit me but that was really

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.350 
it didn't hit me but that was really
a close<00:02:14.190> call<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:14.760> were<00:02:14.849> about<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.209> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
a close call we were about to have to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.809 
a close call we were about to have to
wipe<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.440> as<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.069> see<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.760> is

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
wipe it but as you can see like this is

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.400 
wipe it but as you can see like this is
this<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.690> achievements<00:02:19.230> it's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
this it's one of the achievements it's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.199 
this it's one of the achievements it's
like<00:02:19.620> as<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:20.400> said<00:02:20.580> before<00:02:20.700> right<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.120> actually

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
like as I said before right we actually

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.699 
like as I said before right we actually
got<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.810> think<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.200> kind<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.470> bugged

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
got this I think it's kind of bugged

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.290 
got this I think it's kind of bugged
because<00:02:23.040> like<00:02:23.370> one<00:02:23.550> time<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:23.849> got<00:02:23.880> this

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
because like one time we got this

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.750 
because like one time we got this
achievement<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:26.010> had<00:02:26.130> somebody<00:02:26.340> died<00:02:26.730> a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
achievement and we had somebody died a

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.610 
achievement and we had somebody died a
cannon<00:02:27.239> barrage<00:02:27.390> like<00:02:27.989> not<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:28.349> get<00:02:28.500> hit

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
cannon barrage like not just get hit

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.530 
cannon barrage like not just get hit
they<00:02:28.770> died<00:02:29.069> two<00:02:29.280> cannon<00:02:29.550> brush<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.239> we<00:02:30.330> still

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
they died two cannon brush and we still

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.809 
they died two cannon brush and we still
got<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.750> achievement<00:02:30.870> fuck<00:02:31.709> right<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.580> so

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
got the achievement fuck right and so

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.370 
got the achievement fuck right and so
I'm<00:02:33.000> not<00:02:33.120> really<00:02:33.270> sure<00:02:33.540> how<00:02:33.690> that's<00:02:33.930> how

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
I'm not really sure how that's how

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.160 
I'm not really sure how that's how
that's<00:02:34.560> working<00:02:34.800> out<00:02:35.069> but<00:02:35.370> either<00:02:36.239> way<00:02:36.569> we

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
that's working out but either way we

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.870 
that's working out but either way we
really<00:02:37.770> want<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.010> take<00:02:38.160> away<00:02:38.280> from<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.670> is

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
really want to take away from this is

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.540 
really want to take away from this is
it's<00:02:39.150> very<00:02:39.209> easy<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.750> do<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.170> pretty<00:02:41.130> much<00:02:41.280> any

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
it's very easy to do and pretty much any

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.150 
it's very easy to do and pretty much any
any<00:02:41.880> group<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.569> morons<00:02:43.319> can<00:02:43.590> do<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.860> as<00:02:44.040> long

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
any group of morons can do this as long

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.250 
any group of morons can do this as long
as<00:02:44.280> they<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.550> even<00:02:45.390> half<00:02:45.599> of<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.840> clue<00:02:46.019> on<00:02:46.230> how

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
as they have even half of a clue on how

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.690 
as they have even half of a clue on how
to<00:02:46.440> play<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.680> game<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.190> what<00:02:47.370> what's

expected with the achievement and this

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.570 
expected with the achievement and this
is<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.760> best<00:02:50.970> box<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.569> go<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:53.100> like

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
any trouble whatsoever but the best way

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.430 
any trouble whatsoever but the best way
to<00:03:06.030> do<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.420> honestly<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.019> like<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.290> just

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
to do is honestly it's like you just

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.960 
to do is honestly it's like you just
burn<00:03:07.650> them<00:03:07.769> down<00:03:07.920> really<00:03:08.190> quickly<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:08.760> we<00:03:08.819> only

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
burn them down really quickly so we only

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.520 
burn them down really quickly so we only
have<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.180> do<00:03:09.299> with<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> couple<00:03:09.690> cannon<00:03:10.080> baragas

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
