00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.370
 Hello and welcome to Mac Magazine Podcast my name is Andreas 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.820
 3 stood 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.790
 this little friend should be here to insert a document 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.129
 the letters of the text and flow 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.929
 so far that does not work the background of the picture is colored and 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.400
 not us, eighth is supposed to be transparent 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.270
 Adobe Photoshop and the cheaper version Pixelmator would be now 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.349
 maybe the programs of choice 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.720
 completely free of charge and just as effective it is with the 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:30.509
 Preview one 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.800
 that finds in your program folder 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.840
 By the way, the free-cutting technique shown here only works 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.220
 with real pictures 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.290
 Developing a pdf file first converts it into an image 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.070
 In this picture, it makes sense that it extracts the color blue 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.770
 with the mouse button pressed, slowly draws an area 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.600
 the red mark will show you the part of the picture that will be removed later 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.700
 shall be 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.140
 while you should pay attention to the image content he did not want to keep red 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.780
 colored 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.600
 Are you satisfied with your choice by pressing enter on your keyboard 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.750
 Of course, cropping a picture line with a shape is also possible 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.920
 At the points around the dashed line you can pull us through 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 to highlight the image content the lira hold word 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.830
 to mark the different shapes you will find in the toolbar 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.650
 Preview window it 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.700
 have you made choices here and there chooses 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.960
 Tools crop command and k 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 the command to log in the selection 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.500
 and so that in the map image content would later be transparent 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.110
 also the right file formats save under dialogue also pay attention 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.600
 the format Brocade Network Graphics PNG is just the thing 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.300
 The catch in the alphabet will be that the deleted image content is in the 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 Programs will not be shown later 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.820
 Now, as in the picture here, a picture of good texts can be flowed
