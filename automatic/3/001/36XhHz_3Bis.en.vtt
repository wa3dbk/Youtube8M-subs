00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
know what I thought of the full size

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.819 
know what I thought of the full size
before<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> smaller<00:00:34.320> version

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
before I get it in the smaller version

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.799 
before I get it in the smaller version
and<00:00:35.550> I'm<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.149> go<00:00:36.270> ahead<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.630> show

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
and I'm just going to go ahead and show

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.200 
and I'm just going to go ahead and show
you<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.110> application<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.890> these<00:00:38.040> two<00:00:38.489> right

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
you the application of these two right

00:00:39.210 --> 00:02:15.800 
you the application of these two right
now

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.650 

so<00:02:16.440> overall<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.220> really<00:02:17.730> honestly<00:02:17.910> don't<00:02:18.209> see<00:02:18.480> a

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
so overall I really honestly don't see a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.990 
so overall I really honestly don't see a
big<00:02:19.020> point<00:02:19.380> in<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.830> subversion<00:02:20.310> primer<00:02:20.819> I

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
big point in the subversion primer I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.360 
big point in the subversion primer I
think<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.290> seemed<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> was<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.160> good

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
think that it seemed like it was a good

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.860 
think that it seemed like it was a good
idea<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.760> seemed<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.360> was<00:02:24.390> gonna<00:02:24.660> do

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
idea it seemed like it was gonna do

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.390 
idea it seemed like it was gonna do
something<00:02:25.200> good<00:02:25.319> but<00:02:25.380> honestly<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:26.220> weighed

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
something good but honestly it weighed

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.430 
something good but honestly it weighed
so<00:02:26.819> heavy<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.209> my<00:02:27.390> lashes<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.080> would

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
so heavy on my lashes that I would

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.500 
so heavy on my lashes that I would
definitely<00:02:28.860> not<00:02:29.010> repurchase<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.150> didn't

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
definitely not repurchase this I didn't

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.370 
definitely not repurchase this I didn't
feel<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.840> made<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.020> big<00:02:31.170> enough

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
feel like it made a big enough

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.540 
feel like it made a big enough
difference<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> volume<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.370> length

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
difference in the volume of the length

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.010 
difference in the volume of the length
of<00:02:32.580> my<00:02:32.730> lashes<00:02:32.970> for<00:02:33.239> me<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.390> repurchase<00:02:33.690> that

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
of my lashes for me to repurchase that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.809 
of my lashes for me to repurchase that
now<00:02:34.380> this<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.069> other<00:02:35.220> hand<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.640> actually

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
now this on the other hand I actually

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.030 
now this on the other hand I actually
really<00:02:36.540> really<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.500> how<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
really really like I like how it

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.460 
really really like I like how it
lengthens<00:02:38.370> my<00:02:38.550> lashes<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.239> do<00:02:39.630> feel<00:02:40.050> like<00:02:40.140> you

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
lengthens my lashes I do feel like you

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.590 
lengthens my lashes I do feel like you
need<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.800> kind<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.400> cut<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.790> off<00:02:41.940> at<00:02:42.150> two<00:02:42.330> coats

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
need to kind of cut it off at two coats

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.180 
need to kind of cut it off at two coats
because<00:02:42.959> once<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.290> get<00:02:43.410> past<00:02:43.620> two<00:02:43.830> coats<00:02:44.069> of

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
because once you get past two coats of

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.070 
because once you get past two coats of
this<00:02:44.280> thing<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:44.910> makes<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> lashes<00:02:45.720> go

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
this thing it just makes the lashes go

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.990 
this thing it just makes the lashes go
just<00:02:46.319> complete<00:02:46.650> spider<00:02:47.010> clump<00:02:47.400> together<00:02:47.580> just
