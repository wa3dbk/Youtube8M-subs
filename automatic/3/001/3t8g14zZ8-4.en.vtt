00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.560
 ah 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.719
 What rock I'm here I babble 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.969
 support I come to talk about that I've been 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.520
 in lamadrid game with so much on saturday 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.700
 as on Sunday you already know that this end 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.860
 a week a video game convention 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.869
 here in the capital and last year not 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.779
 I was able to attend it and I would have liked it 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.090
 and I, this year, did not get rid of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.699
 go there to have a look to see 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.510
 how was everything going and basically 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.180
 I'm here to tell you what I did here 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.059
 a kind of video report 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.940
 photographic there so you can see how 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.699
 was the thing well basically guardian 'and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.710
 What I did was ride a truck together 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.850
 a stand with many computers both 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.460
 to play war of war 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.559
 alward plains like something the fans too 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.040
 they had to try the game on the xbox 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.960
 360 review for xbox 360 out there in 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.430
 means of advancing to be able to prove the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.159
 game 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.920
 mediapro basically what I did was 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.110
 approaching the stand and the idea that 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.470
 I had was not waiting 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.620
 to play and we know that to be able to 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.390
 play games but I could not fall without 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.420
 no kind of problem what yes that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.730
 I was curious to see how I 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.760
 they wrapped the logo of the xbox 360 that 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.570
 I had not tried it that much says there the 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.120
 Weekend 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.860
 opinions about the god the warnings 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.130
 presents the handling of the tanks is 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.840
 much more different is very different from 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.520
 what is I used to in computer 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.770
 although it is true on the subject of 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.260
 artillery for example is much more 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.940
 easy to handle what the tanks are 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.940
 move much more slowly than in the 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.340
 computer with which is rarely the one 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.990
 you are going to miss a shot so that it is 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.430
 stopped besides I already felt ten are very very 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.650
 precise in the xbox game 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.940
 at the moment I like it a lot more in the 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.210
 of the computer with milk that is something to 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.220
 I'm used to have enough 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.200
 similarities with him 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.970
 with the dpc changing things like one of 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.770
 the camera 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.630
 the type of development tree that there is 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.710
 of strangers are also not exactly 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.170
 the same to develop 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.840
 and others but it's a shelf game 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.490
 entertaining if you have the option of 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.440
 try them I recommend it so that 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.540
 you try and what is basically what 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.010
 is the difference with the computer is 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.680
 winch walk that is more than I did not have 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.650
 to see how it was also wrapped 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.910
 with them I made the extreme bird on 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.590
 all the first games that the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.330
 I was testing but especially the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.050
 intention that I had to approach for 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.090
 meet 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.580
 so much of rock is the community manager 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.710
 of the Spanish section of the game as a 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.540
 Mr. Tony who is the coordinator and 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.610
 apart from them is chatting for a while 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.140
 with them they ask things pretty 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.180
 interesting about what I was going to 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.940
 happen that it was not going to happen obviously 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.620
 details that they can not count can not 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.060
 tell what happens I want to know 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.730
 today what will happen to another stand that is 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.620
 such that it is going to happen so that they have 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.140
 commented something like for example 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.180
 that the graphic soap engine is not very 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.730
 away already to be able to prove it is this 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.650
 it is practically here close now 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.930
 and apart from knowing them to be 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.080
 chatting a very nice time the idea 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.970
 also what I had was that enough of 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.650
 you are amps with the 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.680
 raids from both Spain and 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.420
 South America and had the intention of 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.459
 there was one that is approached by itself 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.590
 perhaps to lamadrid game week to take a 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.060
 look at the wargaming booth to see if 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.410
 there was a bit of luck and he got 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.480
 see you some of you are chatting 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.030
 a time with you so you can see that 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.250
 we are all practically the same and 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.319
 to know you since really to me be 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.079
 waiting for example an example of a 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.390
 time a queue to test a simulator 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.099
 of rallies that or then the oculus rif that 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.290
 they also make you pay two euros to 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.879
 can try it extra for a couple of 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.650
 minutes does not catch my attention 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.599
 I only intended to leave 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.060
 there of if they found me some of 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.440
 you know meet you say hello 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.690
 hi how are you chatting for a while 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.510
 comes to see how they had mounted all the 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.790
 warning 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.790
 and it 's just and spent a good time 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.980
 and not so much the issue of waiting with 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.299
 I have already taken a picture with some of them 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.640
 of you and others I said that I was going to 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.550
 upload so here you have the photos here 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.980
 which was 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.210
 what they did to us 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:25.920
 the truck and well apart from all this 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.430
 I've got some little things 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.260
 some little gifts that you'll see 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.270
 to do in addition I will try to make a 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.370
 sort of cast to see how I what 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.040
 managed to distribute some cards with 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.800
 codes that I have and also some other 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.630
 thing that you can not have 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.020
 assisted there obviously not what 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.600
 you could have it since it was distributed by children 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.790
 there and it's the idea that I have 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.640
 basically well then well little else 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.470
 I can tell you already on this subject I have 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.930
 passed very very well the truth the while 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.480
 that I've been there chatting and have a 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.420
 ego people try that too year that 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.070
 come closer as it is slowly going to 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.110
 go increasing the whole issue of the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.370
 presence that they have there and others and I 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.930
 have commented that they would do something a 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.150
 little more spectacular with the following 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.250
 years and so so that's the idea 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.380
 basically that as long as you can 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.090
 make a show here 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.300
 close d 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.120
 my intention is to approach to be able 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.590
 meet people and to be able to be 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.660
 constant a couple of times a while to 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.060
 taste and the truth is that I can not 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.760
 tell you many more simply you already know 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.800
 I say because I always have luck in 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.800
 the battlefield see you later
