00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.890
 fan of pencil precision and 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.960
 paper that I think is also a 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.590
 training for the memory of 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.590

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.740
 it can be any question 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.290
 it's interesting but I would give it a name 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.530
 that has to do with the outbursts with 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.530
 the pyrotechnics 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.180

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.340

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.310

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.530
 my life goes through the night 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.770
 if one day a book is made about my life 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.770
 I believe that my documentary life when 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.940
 how the realization of a book should 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.400
 be linked to 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.300
 to fight in boxing especially the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.730
 struggle that implies the survival of 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.540
