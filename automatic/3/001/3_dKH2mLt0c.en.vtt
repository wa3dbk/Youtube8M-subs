00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
camera so for most Nikon DSLRs that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.490

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.399 
would be 200 iso for most Canon DSLRs
that<00:02:05.040> would<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.310> 100<00:02:06.060> iso<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.049> we'll<00:02:07.200> set<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
that would be 100 iso so we'll set that

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.390

other thing you're going to be open for
minutes<00:02:55.500> at<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.650> time<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.700> what<00:02:56.819> we're<00:02:56.909> going<00:02:57.000> to

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
minutes at a time so what we're going to

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.599 
minutes at a time so what we're going to
need<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.450> do<00:02:57.629> is<00:02:57.959> actually<00:02:58.530> keep<00:02:58.950> any<00:02:59.220> extra

need to do is actually keep any extra
light<00:02:59.819> from<00:03:00.060> coming<00:03:00.389> in<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.629> viewfinder<00:03:00.930> from

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
light from coming in the viewfinder from

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.869 
light from coming in the viewfinder from
coming<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.159> eyepiece<00:03:02.579> from<00:03:02.790> the

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
coming in the eyepiece from the

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.490 
coming in the eyepiece from the
viewfinder<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.420> can<00:03:03.569> pick<00:03:03.840> up<00:03:03.930> some<00:03:04.109> ambient

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
viewfinder you can pick up some ambient

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.410 
viewfinder you can pick up some ambient
light<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.189> if<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.549> have<00:03:05.700> black<00:03:05.879> gaffers<00:03:06.389> tape

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
light so if you have black gaffers tape

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.990 
light so if you have black gaffers tape
put<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.379> over<00:03:07.500> there<00:03:07.709> before<00:03:07.889> you<00:03:08.159> shoot<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.609> my

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
put it over there before you shoot in my

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.339 
put it over there before you shoot in my
case<00:03:09.239> there's<00:03:09.450> actually<00:03:09.689> a<00:03:09.720> little<00:03:09.900> door<00:03:10.139> on

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349
