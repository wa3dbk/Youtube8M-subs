00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.530
 no 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.209
 my role 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.910
 hello to all today we work the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:33.330
 180 a half turn on yourself with a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:36.900
 reception switch 180 turn on 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.570
 So even reception switch I 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.160
 going to break this 180 into three points 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.800
 important 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.900
 the entry in the click and its exit 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.790
 the attitude to adopt once in the air 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.340
 and preparing for the reception and the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.100
 reception is the same for a number 1 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.590
 at the end of the kick at the moment of the extension 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.570
 gently engages the rotation with the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.790
 shoulders and arms by pulling slightly 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.230
 his left arm backwards and in 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.199
 let's move slowly right hand towards 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.330
 forward his gaze has already directed towards the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.860
 reception 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.750
 attention we never engage 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.030
 effectively a rotation trying to 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.850
 turn with the head 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.100
 point number two in the air show the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.560
 knees to you and lower it slightly 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.979
 bus to those you find yourself then 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.740
 in a compact and compact position 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.750
 the particularity of the 180 is that the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.070
 upper body dissociated from the bottom of the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.479
 body 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.820
 the shoulders are therefore engaged in the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.159
 rotation and feet are late on 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.649
 shoulders that's how you go 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.509
 ability to manage rotation and 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.810
 choose when you put the skis 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.340
 in laxe to receive switch 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.470
 your gaze is always directed towards the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 reception and will not move until 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.550
 as you touch the ground 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.860
 point number 3 keeping a landmark 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.780
 visual on the reception from the beginning to the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.220
 end of the jump you put yourself in 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.800
 best arrangements for 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.200
 receive bent perpendicular to the 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.520
 slope and the shifted foot on whose side 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.960
 you look at the important points 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.239
 very light rotation commitments 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.260
 the gaze is already directed towards the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.630
 receiving in a clustered position the top of the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.640
 body is dissociated from the bottom of the feet 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.320
 are late on the shoulders and the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.030
 look is always directed towards the 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.500
 receipt reception clichy switch 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.299
 perpendicular to the slope and feet 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.299
 off the side you're watching 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.690
 now it's up to you to play but 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.360
 do not forget the security wearing the 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.530
 helmet the back protector and a bucket 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.069
 adapted to your level 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.069
 the good thing is
