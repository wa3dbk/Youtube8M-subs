just wanted to look around it myself and

try and get the best shots for you guys
and<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.560> why<00:02:01.710> I've<00:02:01.799> come<00:02:01.920> up<00:02:02.040> with<00:02:02.070> so

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and this is why I've come up with so

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.209 
and this is why I've come up with so
this<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> bottom<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.960> ship<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:05.100> can

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
this is the bottom of this ship you can

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.330 
this is the bottom of this ship you can
see<00:02:06.320> this<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.439> where<00:02:07.560> everything<00:02:08.009> comes<00:02:08.160> out

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
see this is where everything comes out

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.680 
see this is where everything comes out
pretty<00:02:08.459> much<00:02:08.610> level<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.270> you'll<00:02:09.599> have

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
pretty much level I think you'll have

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.420 
pretty much level I think you'll have
your<00:02:10.080> own<00:02:10.259> kind<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.619> hangar

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
your own kind of hangar

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.250 
your own kind of hangar
I<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.879> bit<00:02:12.060> there<00:02:12.659> right<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.049> front<00:02:13.079> of

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
I think this bit there right in front of

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.020 
I think this bit there right in front of
us<00:02:13.349> now<00:02:13.439> is<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.709> hanger<00:02:14.069> but<00:02:14.189> then<00:02:14.340> every<00:02:14.909> other

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
us now is a hanger but then every other

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.819 
us now is a hanger but then every other
part<00:02:15.359> is<00:02:15.599> where<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> gunman<00:02:16.140> comes<00:02:16.379> out<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.709> you

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
part is where a gunman comes out and you

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.199 
part is where a gunman comes out and you
can<00:02:16.859> see<00:02:17.040> left<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.430> right<00:02:17.579> there<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.969> guns

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
can see left and right there the guns

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.030 
can see left and right there the guns
will<00:02:18.480> pop<00:02:18.689> out<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.930> there<00:02:19.019> Taurus<00:02:19.439> I<00:02:19.680> also

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040

back<00:02:38.730> into<00:02:38.909> the<00:02:39.120> game<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.540> see<00:02:39.719> have<00:02:40.049> a<00:02:40.079> shot

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
back into the game and see have a shot

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.720 
back into the game and see have a shot
at<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.620> see<00:02:40.799> what<00:02:40.829> it<00:02:41.040> does<00:02:41.189> if<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.549> still

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
at it see what it does if it's still

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.020 
at it see what it does if it's still
there<00:02:41.969> and<00:02:42.930> see<00:02:43.409> if<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.709> likes<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:44.790> I

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
there and see if it likes that but I

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.909 
there and see if it likes that but I
doubt<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.689> would<00:02:45.780> like<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.379> I'm<00:02:46.500> pretty

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919 
doubt it would like that and I'm pretty

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.250 
doubt it would like that and I'm pretty
sure<00:02:47.099> it<00:02:47.159> would<00:02:47.370> eventually<00:02:47.689> try<00:02:48.689> and<00:02:48.870> kill<00:02:49.049> me

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
sure it would eventually try and kill me

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.659 
sure it would eventually try and kill me
but<00:02:49.379> maybe<00:02:49.590> not<00:02:49.829> I<00:02:49.859> mean<00:02:50.069> this<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.489> just

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
but maybe not I mean this is just

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.429 
but maybe not I mean this is just
