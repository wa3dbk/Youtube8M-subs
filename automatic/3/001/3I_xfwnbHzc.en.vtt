00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.490
 people often think of 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.520
 beer is bad for health 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.160
 and I think that studies show precisely the 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.160
 contrary to some consumption and is beneficial 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:39.230
 The beer she has is a series of 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.800
 right substances and these substances 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.400
 are the phenolic compounds they have 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.860
 anti-inflammatory activity and this 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.309
 with which you have a reduced risk 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.309
 cardiovascular 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.770
 the beer is very rich beyond pole 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.380
 canada very rich in vitamin B 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.010
 be magnesium complex 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:16.020
 these vitamins are essential for the 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.020
 good functioning of our organism 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.020
 the beer also contains some 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.870
 antioxidants and also contains alcohol 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.200
 as a cardioprotective factor they are 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.760
 associated with reduced stress 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.760
 of the organism 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.560
 the beer can be used with great 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.530
 emphasis on muscle recovery from 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.930
 athletes in the post-exercise period since 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.950
 it provides a large amount of 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.010
 carbohydrates 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.830
 remembering that the athletes in the post 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.250
 exercising and exercising the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:02:02.350
 should also be concerned about the 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:04.960
 moisture which is very important 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.920
 moderate consumption of beer he is 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.929
 associated with high cholesterol hdl 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.740
 which is the cholesterol that we call 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.750
 good cholesterol so that regular consumption 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.120
 it is associated with this elevation of 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.580
 good cholesterol and we know that 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.030
 raising good cholesterol reduces risk 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.030
 cardiovascular 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.190
 due to the inherent properties of 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.910
 beer 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.550
 studies and specifically 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.700
 people who have suffered a heart attack 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.820
 acute myocardial infarction and that with 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.370
 beer or a greater benefit 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.370
 a reduction in healing time 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.850
 where it is caloric has a 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.950
 calories lower than for example wine 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.150
 and mostly I come because on the street 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.570
 are comparing here from this side 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.570
 emotional 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.860
 the indy is all we talk about that never 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.190
 little and never mother 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.410
 the excess it does bad but we are 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.190
 Seeing you here to drink a little may 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.190
 do well as well
