00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.569 
there's some sort of secret connection
kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.479> going<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.869> where<00:01:28.310> honestly<00:01:29.310> maybe

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
kind of going on where honestly maybe

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.160 
kind of going on where honestly maybe
there<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> connection<00:01:30.270> between<00:01:30.479> kino<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
there is a connection between kino and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.170 
there is a connection between kino and
the<00:01:31.409> regular<00:01:31.829> storyline<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.880> shadows

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the regular storyline with the shadows

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.090 
the regular storyline with the shadows
of<00:01:33.210> evil<00:01:33.479> one<00:01:33.810> or<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.140> something<00:01:34.350> else<00:01:34.650> or

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
of evil one or if it's something else or

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.590 
of evil one or if it's something else or
maybe<00:01:35.280> they're<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.640> promoting<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.270> game<00:01:36.450> I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
maybe they're just promoting a game I

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.899 
maybe they're just promoting a game I
don't<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.229> but<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:38.189> two<00:01:38.460> maps<00:01:38.700> now

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
don't really know but it's two maps now

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.550 
don't really know but it's two maps now
that<00:01:39.090> they've<00:01:39.210> found<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.659> blood<00:01:39.930> splatter<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that they've found is blood splatter and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.560 
that they've found is blood splatter and
honestly<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.579> think<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.909> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.180> even

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
honestly I think is going to be even

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.600 
honestly I think is going to be even
more<00:01:42.840> being<00:01:43.200> put<00:01:43.530> into<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.979> game<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.460> could

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
more being put into the game so it could

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.580 
more being put into the game so it could
have<00:01:44.640> been<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.600> those<00:01:45.780> soft<00:01:46.140> updates

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
have been like one of those soft updates

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.050 
have been like one of those soft updates
that<00:01:46.740> they<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:46.950> where<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.369> don't<00:01:47.670> even<00:01:47.820> have

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
that they do where you don't even have

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.730 
that they do where you don't even have
to<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.450> an<00:01:48.600> update<00:01:48.960> prompt<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.320> anything<00:01:49.590> it's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
to do an update prompt or anything it's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.380 
to do an update prompt or anything it's
just<00:01:49.799> put<00:01:50.130> into<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.549> game<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.939> we'll

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
just put into the game so we'll
