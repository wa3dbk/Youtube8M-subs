00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
gone and those little seeds are kind of

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.979 
gone and those little seeds are kind of
like<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.290> little<00:03:56.130> pebbles<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.910> they<00:03:57.060> will<00:03:57.269> kind

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
like a little pebbles and they will kind

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.420 
like a little pebbles and they will kind
of<00:03:58.049> open<00:03:58.350> up<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.739> there's<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.950> little<00:03:59.160> tail

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
of open up and there's a little tail

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.910 
of open up and there's a little tail
that<00:03:59.700> kind<00:03:59.940> of<00:03:59.970> unwinds<00:04:00.810> from<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:01.739> you'll

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
that kind of unwinds from it so you'll

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.229 
that kind of unwinds from it so you'll
know<00:04:02.130> when<00:04:02.370> it's<00:04:02.519> done<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:02.700> see<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.030> little

and then just swirl it around and let

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.749 
and then just swirl it around and let
everything<00:04:40.380> kind<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.710> settle<00:04:41.130> and<00:04:41.310> then<00:04:41.520> pour

the<00:04:41.820> water<00:04:42.090> off<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.720> will<00:04:42.960> lose<00:04:43.199> some<00:04:43.650> of

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
the water off and you will lose some of

the water off and you will lose some of
the<00:04:43.860> seeds<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.340> float<00:04:44.669> but<00:04:44.850> that's<00:04:45.030> okay

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
the seeds that float but that's okay

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.420 
the seeds that float but that's okay
probably<00:04:46.080> not<00:04:46.139> want<00:04:46.289> those<00:04:46.410> anyway<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:47.280> could

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
probably not want those anyway it could

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.080 
probably not want those anyway it could
be<00:04:47.580> hollow<00:04:48.270> or<00:04:48.780> just<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:50.370> know<00:04:50.400> whatever<00:04:50.940> they

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
be hollow or just you know whatever they

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.469 
be hollow or just you know whatever they
want<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.330> escape<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.310> let<00:04:53.310> those<00:04:53.430> go<00:04:53.639> rinse<00:04:54.360> it

as soon as I as soon as I finish I let
it<00:06:12.340> cool<00:06:12.520> down<00:06:12.580> just<00:06:12.909> a<00:06:13.000> little<00:06:13.210> bit<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:13.720> then

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
it cool down just a little bit and then

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.260 
it cool down just a little bit and then
put<00:06:14.349> it<00:06:14.470> in<00:06:14.560> there<00:06:14.800> and<00:06:15.120> right<00:06:16.120> to<00:06:16.240> the

put it in there and right to the
refrigerator<00:06:16.569> because<00:06:16.960> the<00:06:17.590> danger<00:06:18.129> zone<00:06:18.159> is

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
refrigerator because the danger zone is

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.379 
refrigerator because the danger zone is
40<00:06:19.870> degrees<00:06:20.169> Fahrenheit<00:06:20.889> to<00:06:21.360> 140<00:06:22.360> degrees

Fahrenheit<00:06:22.659> in<00:06:23.409> that<00:06:24.220> range<00:06:24.720> bacteria<00:06:25.720> will

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
Fahrenheit in that range bacteria will

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.580 
Fahrenheit in that range bacteria will
grow<00:06:26.229> even<00:06:26.919> if<00:06:27.580> you<00:06:27.669> can't<00:06:27.940> see<00:06:28.060> it<00:06:28.300> so<00:06:28.599> there's

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
grow even if you can't see it so there's

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.469 
grow even if you can't see it so there's
always<00:06:29.889> a<00:06:30.009> risk<00:06:30.250> of<00:06:30.430> something<00:06:30.729> happening<00:06:31.090> now

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
always a risk of something happening now

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.240 
always a risk of something happening now
since<00:06:32.020> i<00:06:32.110> don't<00:06:32.289> use<00:06:32.889> meet<00:06:33.690> you<00:06:34.690> know<00:06:34.780> my<00:06:34.900> i

since i don't use meet you know my i
reduce<00:06:36.250> the<00:06:36.520> amount<00:06:36.669> of<00:06:36.849> bacteria<00:06:37.270> in<00:06:37.780> my

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:38.129 
reduce the amount of bacteria in my

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.330 
reduce the amount of bacteria in my
kitchen<00:06:39.129> in<00:06:39.699> my<00:06:40.030> food<00:06:40.330> everything<00:06:40.960> by<00:06:41.169> a

kitchen in my food everything by a
significant<00:06:42.340> amount<00:06:42.520> so<00:06:42.940> i<00:06:43.210> don't<00:06:43.750> worry<00:06:44.229> too

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
significant amount so i don't worry too

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.300 
significant amount so i don't worry too
much<00:06:44.740> about<00:06:45.219> it<00:06:45.610> but<00:06:45.940> you<00:06:46.569> should<00:06:46.840> always<00:06:47.310> be

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
much about it but you should always be

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.850 
much about it but you should always be
cautious<00:06:48.940> and<00:06:49.120> never<00:06:49.690> store<00:06:50.229> food<00:06:50.530> between

cautious and never store food between

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.020 
cautious and never store food between
that<00:06:51.310> range<00:06:53.039> that's<00:06:54.039> basically<00:06:54.370> it<00:06:54.490> if<00:06:54.729> you

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
that range that's basically it if you

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.330 
that range that's basically it if you
you<00:06:55.990> know<00:06:56.020> if<00:06:56.110> it's<00:06:56.289> you<00:06:56.830> just<00:06:56.979> is<00:06:57.159> with

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
you know if it's you just is with

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.909 
you know if it's you just is with
boiling<00:06:57.729> let<00:06:58.569> it<00:06:58.659> cool<00:06:58.900> down<00:06:58.960> before<00:06:59.530> you<00:06:59.740> put

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
boiling let it cool down before you put

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.350 
boiling let it cool down before you put
into<00:07:00.039> a<00:07:00.129> plastic<00:07:00.340> container<00:07:00.639> otherwise<00:07:01.180> it's

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
into a plastic container otherwise it's

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.010 
into a plastic container otherwise it's
going<00:07:01.449> to<00:07:01.569> probably<00:07:01.900> melt<00:07:03.090> so<00:07:04.090> 140<00:07:04.629> degrees

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
going to probably melt so 140 degrees

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.950 
going to probably melt so 140 degrees
you<00:07:05.919> know<00:07:06.039> what<00:07:06.400> it's<00:07:06.520> still<00:07:06.789> just<00:07:07.389> it's<00:07:07.659> very

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
you know what it's still just it's very

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.219 
you know what it's still just it's very
warm<00:07:08.229> but<00:07:08.860> it's<00:07:09.219> not<00:07:09.400> steaming<00:07:10.030> then<00:07:10.930> go<00:07:11.139> ahead
