we go guys so we pretty much got all the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.950 
we go guys so we pretty much got all the
resources<00:01:09.610> right<00:01:09.940> there<00:01:10.150> unfortunately<00:01:10.810> did

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
resources right there unfortunately did

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.630 
resources right there unfortunately did
not<00:01:10.990> get<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.350> gold<00:01:11.530> on<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.740> outside<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:12.130> just

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
not get the gold on the outside I just

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.740 
not get the gold on the outside I just
wanted<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:12.880> make<00:01:12.970> sure<00:01:13.030> we<00:01:13.180> could<00:01:13.420> break<00:01:13.540> into

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
wanted to make sure we could break into

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.260 
wanted to make sure we could break into
the<00:01:13.840> middle<00:01:14.110> so<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.920> very<00:01:15.160> cost<00:01:15.820> effective

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
the middle so a very cost effective

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.940 
the middle so a very cost effective
attack<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:16.840> that<00:01:16.990> puts<00:01:17.200> us<00:01:17.260> up<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.560> like<00:01:17.680> two

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
attack and that puts us up to like two

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.270 
attack and that puts us up to like two
million<00:01:18.160> gold<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:19.020> 2.9<00:01:20.020> million<00:01:20.350> elixir<00:01:20.800> so

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
million gold and 2.9 million elixir so

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.010 
million gold and 2.9 million elixir so
that<00:01:21.880> was<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.090> tack<00:01:22.240> number<00:01:22.479> one<00:01:22.600> guys<00:01:22.780> let's

not really sure like where the games

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.630 
not really sure like where the games
trying<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.870> go<00:03:56.050> like<00:03:56.920> they<00:03:57.160> they<00:03:57.400> haven't

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
trying to go like they they haven't

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.430 
trying to go like they they haven't
released<00:03:57.730> any<00:03:58.060> big<00:03:58.420> updates<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:59.050> have<00:03:59.080> really

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
released any big updates I have really

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.570 
released any big updates I have really
changed<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.800> game<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.010> know<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.280> lot<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.490> people

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
changed a game I know a lot of people

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.160 
changed a game I know a lot of people
have<00:04:00.790> talked<00:04:00.970> about<00:04:01.090> clan<00:04:01.420> wars<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:01.990> stuff

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
have talked about clan wars and stuff

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.720 
have talked about clan wars and stuff
like<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.650> think<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.340> game<00:04:03.490> needs

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
like that I think the game needs

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.950 
like that I think the game needs
something<00:04:04.060> like<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.360> to<00:04:04.510> make<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:04.810> little

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
something like that to make it a little

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.750 
something like that to make it a little
more<00:04:05.080> multi-dimensional<00:04:05.800> instead<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:06.640> the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
more multi-dimensional instead of the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.640 
more multi-dimensional instead of the
one-sided<00:04:07.270> game<00:04:07.300> that<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.660> is<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.990> think<00:04:08.560> it

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
one-sided game that it is I think it

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.630 
one-sided game that it is I think it
needs<00:04:08.800> more<00:04:08.890> um<00:04:09.660> more<00:04:10.660> variety<00:04:11.140> definitely<00:04:11.800> it

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
needs more um more variety definitely it

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.220 
needs more um more variety definitely it
gets<00:04:12.820> boring<00:04:13.000> sometimes<00:04:13.330> doing<00:04:13.660> attacks<00:04:13.990> over

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
gets boring sometimes doing attacks over

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.690 
gets boring sometimes doing attacks over
and<00:04:14.320> over<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:14.590> over<00:04:14.650> again<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.459> think<00:04:15.610> it'd

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
and over and over again so I think it'd

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.520 
and over and over again so I think it'd
be<00:04:15.730> cool<00:04:15.910> if<00:04:15.970> they<00:04:16.209> they<00:04:16.690> could<00:04:16.900> create<00:04:17.140> some

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
be cool if they they could create some

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.199 
be cool if they they could create some
kind<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.799> wait<00:04:17.980> for<00:04:18.670> us<00:04:18.790> to<00:04:18.910> have<00:04:19.030> another

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
kind of wait for us to have another

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.240 
kind of wait for us to have another
outlet<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.900> do<00:04:20.020> some<00:04:20.260> fun<00:04:20.470> like<00:04:21.040> they<00:04:21.160> have

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
outlet to do some fun like they have

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.760 
outlet to do some fun like they have
single<00:04:21.580> player<00:04:21.760> which<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.240> okay<00:04:22.960> and<00:04:23.560> they

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
single player which is okay and they

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.890 
single player which is okay and they

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
unfortunately wasn't however we did get

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.130 
unfortunately wasn't however we did get
the<00:04:40.030> village<00:04:40.300> edit<00:04:40.540> mode<00:04:40.660> which<00:04:40.840> was<00:04:40.990> pretty

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
the village edit mode which was pretty

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.720 
the village edit mode which was pretty
cool<00:04:41.260> but<00:04:41.950> it<00:04:42.070> just<00:04:42.220> seems<00:04:42.400> like<00:04:42.490> they're

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
cool but it just seems like they're

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.010 
cool but it just seems like they're
trying<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:43.030> stick<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.360> what<00:04:43.510> they<00:04:43.540> have<00:04:43.840> and

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
trying to stick to what they have and

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.240 
trying to stick to what they have and
what<00:04:44.080> they<00:04:44.170> know<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:44.410> I<00:04:44.590> guess<00:04:44.740> that's<00:04:44.950> okay

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
what they know and I guess that's okay

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.300 
what they know and I guess that's okay
but<00:04:45.490> I'd<00:04:45.610> rather<00:04:45.760> see<00:04:46.060> a<00:04:46.270> big<00:04:46.960> update<00:04:47.190> but<00:04:48.190> yeah

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
but I'd rather see a big update but yeah

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.740 
but I'd rather see a big update but yeah
we<00:04:48.490> looks<00:04:48.820> like<00:04:48.940> we<00:04:49.030> won<00:04:49.120> that<00:04:49.180> attack<00:04:49.510> guys

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
we looks like we won that attack guys

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.030
