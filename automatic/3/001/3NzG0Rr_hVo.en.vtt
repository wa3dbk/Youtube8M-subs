00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.580 
they probably try to jack up the price
so<00:04:48.260> i'm<00:04:48.500> not<00:04:48.560> sure<00:04:48.800> many<00:04:49.729> ways<00:04:49.940> and<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:51.470> only

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
so i'm not sure many ways and the only

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.620 
so i'm not sure many ways and the only
thing<00:04:51.740> about<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.220> too<00:04:52.400> is<00:04:52.430> I<00:04:52.940> think<00:04:53.060> I<00:04:53.360> don't

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
thing about it too is I think I don't

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.839 
thing about it too is I think I don't
think<00:04:53.870> all<00:04:54.110> walmarts<00:04:54.410> carry<00:04:55.130> hard<00:04:55.460> candy

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
think all walmarts carry hard candy

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.420 
think all walmarts carry hard candy
because<00:04:56.060> I<00:04:56.240> have<00:04:56.599> to<00:04:56.630> buy<00:04:57.110> my<00:04:57.260> house<00:04:57.500> one

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
because I have to buy my house one

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.339 
because I have to buy my house one
doesn't<00:04:59.120> carry<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.389> line<00:04:59.570> and<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.990> other<00:05:00.139> one

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
doesn't carry the line and the other one

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.920 
doesn't carry the line and the other one
cares<00:05:00.620> it's<00:05:00.889> so<00:05:01.280> not<00:05:02.000> sure<00:05:02.270> how<00:05:02.419> that<00:05:02.599> works

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
cares it's so not sure how that works

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.710 
cares it's so not sure how that works
but<00:05:03.199> I<00:05:03.740> think<00:05:04.070> they<00:05:04.220> should<00:05:04.490> both<00:05:04.729> carry<00:05:05.120> the

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
but I think they should both carry the

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.969 
but I think they should both carry the
same<00:05:05.930> bang<00:05:06.680> line<00:05:08.440> so<00:05:09.440> anyways<00:05:10.690> if<00:05:11.690> I<00:05:12.169> miss

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979
