gallon build and it finally showed up

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.430 
gallon build and it finally showed up
this<00:00:45.070> thing<00:00:45.340> is<00:00:45.610> probably<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:46.149> size<00:00:46.330> of<00:00:46.810> a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
this thing is probably the size of a

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.040 
this thing is probably the size of a
softball

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.490 

it<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.590> huge<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:52.180> amount<00:00:52.540> of<00:00:52.690> flow<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:53.470> I

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
it is huge the amount of flow that I

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.790 
it is huge the amount of flow that I
have<00:00:54.120> felt<00:00:55.120> at<00:00:55.330> the<00:00:55.810> other<00:00:55.960> end<00:00:56.230> of<00:00:56.380> the<00:00:56.500> tank

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
have felt at the other end of the tank

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.220 
have felt at the other end of the tank
is<00:00:57.040> probably<00:00:57.400> the<00:00:57.700> size<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.450> medium-sized

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
is probably the size of a medium-sized

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.150 
is probably the size of a medium-sized
bayit<00:00:59.860> basketball<00:01:00.490> and<00:01:01.800> probably<00:01:02.800> the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
bayit basketball and probably the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.189 
bayit basketball and probably the
strongest<00:01:03.790> amount<00:01:04.119> of<00:01:04.210> flow<00:01:04.390> I've<00:01:04.570> ever<00:01:04.809> felt

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
strongest amount of flow I've ever felt

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.429 
strongest amount of flow I've ever felt
out<00:01:05.650> of<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:05.950> powerhead<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.790> I've<00:01:06.909> owned<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
out of a powerhead and I've owned the

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:14.249 
out of a powerhead and I've owned the
ton<00:01:08.650> Z<00:01:09.000> 6100<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.909> know<00:01:13.060> those<00:01:13.720> are<00:01:13.930> you

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
ton Z 6100 and you know those are you

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:15.870 
ton Z 6100 and you know those are you
know<00:01:14.290> supposed<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:14.890> have<00:01:15.009> a<00:01:15.040> lot<00:01:15.280> of<00:01:15.340> flow<00:01:15.640> but

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
know supposed to have a lot of flow but

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.490 
know supposed to have a lot of flow but
this<00:01:16.090> thing<00:01:16.299> just<00:01:16.479> blows<00:01:16.780> that<00:01:17.079> out<00:01:17.290> of<00:01:17.439> the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
this thing just blows that out of the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.100 
this thing just blows that out of the
water<00:01:17.680> especially<00:01:18.009> for<00:01:18.690> $85<00:01:19.690> guys<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:23.080> can

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
water especially for $85 guys as you can

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.510 
water especially for $85 guys as you can
see<00:01:23.320> getting<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.070> lot<00:01:24.280> of<00:01:24.420> wave<00:01:25.420> action<00:01:25.810> here

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.000 

you<00:01:30.520> know<00:01:30.670> after<00:01:31.240> I<00:01:31.270> adjust<00:01:31.870> it<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.440> takes

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
you know after I adjust it it takes

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.750 
you know after I adjust it it takes
about<00:01:33.250> 10<00:01:33.790> minutes<00:01:34.440> or<00:01:35.440> about<00:01:35.620> I<00:01:36.040> don't<00:01:36.520> know<00:01:36.670> a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
about 10 minutes or about I don't know a

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.530 
about 10 minutes or about I don't know a
few<00:01:37.120> minutes<00:01:37.510> for<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:39.150> figure<00:01:40.150> out<00:01:40.330> what

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
few minutes for it to figure out what

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.969 
few minutes for it to figure out what
it's<00:01:40.690> doing<00:01:41.020> again<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.440> know<00:01:41.560> it's

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
it's doing again you know it's

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.190 
it's doing again you know it's
Renaissance<00:01:42.790> frequency<00:01:43.540> is<00:01:43.630> what<00:01:43.810> you'd<00:01:43.960> call

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
Renaissance frequency is what you'd call

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.890 
Renaissance frequency is what you'd call
it<00:01:44.260> but<00:01:45.159> other<00:01:45.250> than<00:01:45.400> that<00:01:45.460> guys<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.690> comes

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
it but other than that guys it comes

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.070 
it but other than that guys it comes
with<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.200> controller<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:49.119> it's<00:01:49.840> pretty

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
with the controller that it's pretty

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.240 
with the controller that it's pretty
simple<00:01:50.590> but<00:01:50.650> it<00:01:51.430> provides<00:01:52.090> basically<00:01:52.869> all<00:01:53.350> of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
simple but it provides basically all of

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.880 
simple but it provides basically all of
the<00:01:54.880> options<00:01:55.060> that<00:01:55.630> some<00:01:55.960> that<00:01:56.470> one<00:01:56.650> would

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
the options that some that one would

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.039 
the options that some that one would
want<00:01:59.670> right<00:02:00.670> now<00:02:00.700> we're<00:02:01.060> in<00:02:01.150> wave<00:02:01.360> mode<00:02:01.689> one

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
want right now we're in wave mode one

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.820 
want right now we're in wave mode one
and<00:02:02.729> my<00:02:03.729> dial<00:02:04.000> isn't<00:02:04.570> turned<00:02:04.840> down<00:02:05.080> the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
and my dial isn't turned down the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.119 
and my dial isn't turned down the
fastest<00:02:06.490> pulse<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:08.019> is<00:02:08.200> fastest<00:02:08.799> pulse

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
fastest pulse so this is fastest pulse

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.259 
fastest pulse so this is fastest pulse
and<00:02:10.080> guys<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.470> probably<00:02:12.250> takes<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.640> few<00:02:12.909> minutes

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
and guys it probably takes a few minutes

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.320 
and guys it probably takes a few minutes
for<00:02:13.599> it<00:02:13.629> to<00:02:13.780> really<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.909> what<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.239> going

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
for it to really get to what it's going

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.630 
for it to really get to what it's going
to<00:02:16.450> be<00:02:16.599> doing<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.260> can<00:02:17.379> see<00:02:17.620> we<00:02:18.610> just

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
to be doing as you can see we just

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.730 
to be doing as you can see we just
adjusted<00:02:19.569> it

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
adjusted it

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.820 
adjusted it
and<00:02:21.740> guys<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:23.000> pump<00:02:23.270> it's<00:02:23.810> whew<00:02:24.380> Trent<00:02:24.680> Lee

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
and guys the pump it's whew Trent Lee

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.360 
and guys the pump it's whew Trent Lee
silent<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:27.230> know<00:02:27.260> that's<00:02:27.560> one<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.099> plus

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
silent you know that's one of the plus

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.300 
silent you know that's one of the plus
things<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.910> they<00:02:29.000> were<00:02:29.060> saying<00:02:29.390> about<00:02:29.540> this

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
things that they were saying about this

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.089 
things that they were saying about this
on<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.520> market<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:32.300> quieter<00:02:32.900> than<00:02:33.890> the

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
on the market it's quieter than the

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.500 
on the market it's quieter than the
Vortech<00:02:34.550> WP<00:02:35.150> or<00:02:35.390> mp40<00:02:36.819> it's<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:37.970> third<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.390> the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
Vortech WP or mp40 it's a third of the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.720 
Vortech WP or mp40 it's a third of the
quarter<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.440> cost<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:42.310> basically<00:02:43.310> its

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
quarter of the cost and basically its

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.640 
quarter of the cost and basically its
power<00:02:44.120> is<00:02:44.480> even<00:02:44.840> more<00:02:45.230> than<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:47.000> w2<00:02:47.600> mp40<00:02:48.500> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
power is even more than the w2 mp40 and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.800 
power is even more than the w2 mp40 and
the<00:02:49.100> other<00:02:49.220> thing<00:02:49.550> that's<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:49.970> plus<00:02:50.269> two<00:02:50.569> guys

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
the other thing that's a plus two guys

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.860 
the other thing that's a plus two guys
is<00:02:51.200> on<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.800> on<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.670> vortex<00:02:52.880> there<00:02:53.630> are<00:02:53.690> no

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
is on the on the vortex there are no

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.930 
is on the on the vortex there are no
motors<00:02:54.200> on<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.470> outside<00:02:54.980> that's<00:02:55.700> probably

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
motors on the outside that's probably

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.720 
motors on the outside that's probably
why<00:02:56.090> it's<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.300> bit<00:02:56.480> louder<00:02:57.100> but<00:02:58.100> if<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.400> goes

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
why it's a bit louder but if that goes

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.789 
why it's a bit louder but if that goes
out<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.420> replacements<00:03:00.170> about<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.410> hundred

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
out that replacements about a hundred

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.830 
out that replacements about a hundred
and<00:03:00.890> twenty<00:03:01.160> dollars<00:03:01.310> so<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:02.510> could<00:03:02.720> have

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
and twenty dollars so you could have

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.930 
and twenty dollars so you could have
bought<00:03:02.989> one<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.290> these<00:03:03.530> for<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:04.549> one<00:03:04.700> hundred

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
bought one of these for that one hundred

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.759 
bought one of these for that one hundred
and<00:03:05.000> twenty<00:03:05.269> dollars<00:03:05.390> or<00:03:05.900> basically

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
and twenty dollars or basically

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.670 
and twenty dollars or basically
eighty-five<00:03:07.340> dollars<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.750> know<00:03:08.780> been

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
eighty-five dollars and you know been

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.009 
eighty-five dollars and you know been
able<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:09.980> buy<00:03:10.190> maybe<00:03:10.640> even<00:03:11.000> six<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.600> these<00:03:11.690> for

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
able to buy maybe even six of these for

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.820 
able to buy maybe even six of these for
the<00:03:12.080> price<00:03:12.110> of<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.530> W<00:03:13.120> mp40<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.540> that's<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.799> I

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
the price of a W mp40 so that's it I

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.330 
the price of a W mp40 so that's it I
think<00:03:16.190> it's<00:03:16.310> totally<00:03:16.549> worth<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.180> price

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
think it's totally worth the price

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.210 
think it's totally worth the price
if<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:19.970> breaks<00:03:20.209> oh<00:03:20.510> well<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.470> vortex<00:03:21.769> are

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
if it breaks oh well the vortex are

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.449 
if it breaks oh well the vortex are
known<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.580> wear<00:03:23.060> out<00:03:23.239> every<00:03:23.690> year<00:03:24.019> or<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:24.500> so

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
known to wear out every year or so so

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.699 
known to wear out every year or so so
you<00:03:26.890> know<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:28.100> gave<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.700> shot<00:03:29.410> I'll<00:03:30.410> go<00:03:30.620> over

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
you know I gave it a shot I'll go over

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.860 
you know I gave it a shot I'll go over
the<00:03:30.980> controls<00:03:31.760> real<00:03:32.060> quick<00:03:34.480> there's<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.720> low

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
the controls real quick there's the low

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.949 
the controls real quick there's the low
setting<00:03:36.410> for<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.739> wave<00:03:37.540> which<00:03:38.540> will<00:03:38.720> probably

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
setting for the wave which will probably

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.729 
setting for the wave which will probably
be<00:03:39.350> a<00:03:39.380> more<00:03:39.680> even<00:03:40.220> way<00:03:40.400> from<00:03:40.910> corner<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.329> corner

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
be a more even way from corner to corner

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.800 
be a more even way from corner to corner
but<00:03:42.739> it'll<00:03:43.459> take<00:03:43.640> a<00:03:43.670> while<00:03:43.850> for<00:03:44.120> that<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.299> that

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
but it'll take a while for that to that

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.940 
but it'll take a while for that to that
to<00:03:45.079> go<00:03:45.290> in<00:03:45.470> that's<00:03:46.010> got<00:03:46.280> wave<00:03:46.640> mode<00:03:46.970> too<00:03:47.269> which

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
to go in that's got wave mode too which

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.449 
to go in that's got wave mode too which
starts<00:03:48.950> out<00:03:49.130> kind<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.180> hard<00:03:51.040> flow<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.340> then

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
starts out kind of hard flow and then

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.789 
starts out kind of hard flow and then
ramps<00:03:53.030> down<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:53.720> then<00:03:53.840> takes<00:03:54.109> a<00:03:54.290> long<00:03:54.500> pause

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
ramps down and then takes a long pause

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.420 
ramps down and then takes a long pause
and<00:03:55.250> then<00:03:56.109> w3<00:03:57.109> is<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.440> opposite<00:03:57.950> would<00:03:58.220> be<00:03:58.280> a

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
and then w3 is the opposite would be a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.870 
and then w3 is the opposite would be a
little<00:03:58.760> bit<00:03:58.850> faster<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.690> then<00:04:00.430> shorter<00:04:01.430> rests

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
little bit faster and then shorter rests

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.330 
little bit faster and then shorter rests
and<00:04:03.130> else<00:04:04.130> is<00:04:04.609> pretty<00:04:04.940> cool<00:04:05.239> it's<00:04:06.190> kind<00:04:07.190> of

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
and else is pretty cool it's kind of

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.210 
and else is pretty cool it's kind of
trying<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:07.970> mimic<00:04:08.180> vortex<00:04:09.079> reef<00:04:09.470> crest<00:04:09.799> mode<00:04:10.190> I

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
trying to mimic vortex reef crest mode I

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.910 
trying to mimic vortex reef crest mode I
believe<00:04:10.760> it's<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.450> kind<00:04:12.019> of<00:04:12.079> goes<00:04:12.290> through<00:04:12.650> all

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
believe it's it kind of goes through all

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.569 
believe it's it kind of goes through all
all<00:04:13.549> the<00:04:14.030> channels<00:04:14.980> basically<00:04:15.980> all<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.340> modes

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
all the channels basically all the modes

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.509 
all the channels basically all the modes
so<00:04:17.539> that's<00:04:18.500> probably<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.889> one<00:04:19.039> that<00:04:19.190> I'll<00:04:19.340> end

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
so that's probably the one that I'll end

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.050 
so that's probably the one that I'll end
up<00:04:19.609> running<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.090> on<00:04:20.859> maybe<00:04:21.859> once<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.340> week<00:04:22.520> I'll

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
up running it on maybe once a week I'll

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.200 
up running it on maybe once a week I'll
throw<00:04:23.510> a<00:04:23.539> storm<00:04:24.080> on

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
throw a storm on

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.059 
throw a storm on
but<00:04:25.990> I'll<00:04:26.110> have<00:04:26.259> to<00:04:26.380> do<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.620> manually

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:27.069 
but I'll have to do that manually

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:32.360 
but I'll have to do that manually
unfortunately<00:04:29.009> you<00:04:30.009> got<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.220> 10-minute<00:04:30.840> hold

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
unfortunately you got a 10-minute hold

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.900 
unfortunately you got a 10-minute hold
for<00:04:33.660> feeding<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:34.960> then<00:04:35.770> I'm<00:04:36.280> not<00:04:36.460> sure

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
for feeding and then I'm not sure

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.670 
for feeding and then I'm not sure
exactly<00:04:37.569> how<00:04:38.080> to<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:39.250> guess<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:40.569> what<00:04:41.229> I<00:04:41.259> can<00:04:41.410> do

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
exactly how to I guess so what I can do

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.170 
exactly how to I guess so what I can do
is<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.889> can<00:04:41.949> hold<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.340> button<00:04:42.460> down<00:04:42.759> and<00:04:42.789> lock

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
is I can hold the button down and lock

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:51.900 
is I can hold the button down and lock
it<00:04:43.509> and<00:04:44.880> well<00:04:45.880> I<00:04:49.740> guess<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:51.009> locked<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:51.580> but<00:04:51.759> it's

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
it and well I guess I locked it but it's

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.170 
it and well I guess I locked it but it's
still<00:04:52.590> are<00:04:53.590> now<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:53.949> locked<00:04:54.430> it's<00:04:54.699> in<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:54.970> same

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
still are now it locked it's in the same

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.969 
still are now it locked it's in the same
mode<00:04:56.370> so<00:04:57.370> you<00:04:58.150> know<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:58.900> really<00:04:59.289> like<00:04:59.470> it<00:04:59.740> I

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
mode so you know I really like it I

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.540 
mode so you know I really like it I
think<00:05:00.789> it's<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.240> great<00:05:01.419> pump<00:05:02.130> people<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.280> lot<00:05:03.460> of

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
think it's a great pump people a lot of

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.490 
think it's a great pump people a lot of
people<00:05:03.759> are<00:05:03.820> complaining<00:05:04.180> about<00:05:04.509> the<00:05:04.960> sensor

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
people are complaining about the sensor

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.450 
people are complaining about the sensor
and<00:05:06.930> basically<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.349> happened<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.250> have<00:05:09.430> a

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
and basically it happened to have a

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.210 
and basically it happened to have a
light<00:05:09.820> on<00:05:10.090> or<00:05:10.539> you<00:05:10.990> know<00:05:11.139> it<00:05:11.349> not<00:05:11.530> shutting<00:05:11.949> off

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
light on or you know it not shutting off

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.790 
light on or you know it not shutting off
like<00:05:12.610> vortex<00:05:13.180> for<00:05:13.389> tech<00:05:13.570> does<00:05:13.750> a<00:05:13.780> 10-hour<00:05:14.259> shut

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
like vortex for tech does a 10-hour shut

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.670 
like vortex for tech does a 10-hour shut
off<00:05:14.979> I<00:05:15.220> believe<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:18.750> this<00:05:19.750> one<00:05:20.080> has<00:05:20.289> a<00:05:20.320> light

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
off I believe and this one has a light

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.309 
off I believe and this one has a light
sensor<00:05:21.159> so<00:05:21.539> it's<00:05:22.539> not<00:05:22.630> that<00:05:22.690> big<00:05:22.990> of<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.169> deal

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
sensor so it's not that big of a deal

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.490 
sensor so it's not that big of a deal
guys<00:05:23.530> because<00:05:24.690> if<00:05:25.690> you<00:05:25.840> do<00:05:25.990> one<00:05:26.169> or<00:05:26.199> two<00:05:26.319> things

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
guys because if you do one or two things

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.520 
guys because if you do one or two things
you<00:05:27.430> can<00:05:27.580> put<00:05:27.699> a<00:05:27.729> lamp<00:05:28.030> inside<00:05:28.330> your<00:05:28.870> sump<00:05:29.199> on<00:05:29.440> a

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
you can put a lamp inside your sump on a

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.430 
you can put a lamp inside your sump on a
timer<00:05:29.919> that<00:05:30.280> comes<00:05:31.240> on<00:05:31.780> which<00:05:32.139> that<00:05:32.349> would

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
timer that comes on which that would

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.189 
timer that comes on which that would
just<00:05:32.650> be<00:05:32.800> retarded<00:05:33.479> the<00:05:34.479> best<00:05:34.690> way<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:34.930> do

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
just be retarded the best way to do

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.800 
just be retarded the best way to do
would<00:05:35.349> just<00:05:35.380> be<00:05:35.650> putting<00:05:35.889> on<00:05:36.039> a<00:05:36.070> timer<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.880> as

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
would just be putting on a timer and as

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.540 
would just be putting on a timer and as
you<00:05:38.020> can<00:05:38.169> see<00:05:38.409> I'll<00:05:38.650> go<00:05:38.860> ahead<00:05:38.949> and<00:05:39.159> kill<00:05:39.370> the

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
you can see I'll go ahead and kill the

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.260 
you can see I'll go ahead and kill the
power<00:05:39.729> to<00:05:39.909> it<00:05:40.560> and<00:05:41.699> then<00:05:42.699> when<00:05:42.820> I<00:05:42.849> turn<00:05:43.120> it<00:05:43.240> back

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
power to it and then when I turn it back

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.260 
power to it and then when I turn it back
on<00:05:43.530> it<00:05:44.530> goes<00:05:44.740> right<00:05:45.009> back<00:05:45.250> to<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.610> same<00:05:45.909> mode

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
on it goes right back to the same mode

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.959 
on it goes right back to the same mode
so<00:05:47.080> that's<00:05:47.770> pretty<00:05:47.979> much<00:05:48.070> what<00:05:48.340> I'll<00:05:48.520> do<00:05:48.759> is

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
so that's pretty much what I'll do is

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:50.879 
so that's pretty much what I'll do is
I'll<00:05:49.120> just<00:05:49.150> that<00:05:49.599> way<00:05:49.719> my<00:05:49.960> corals<00:05:50.349> can<00:05:50.560> sleep

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
I'll just that way my corals can sleep

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:56.790 
I'll just that way my corals can sleep
at<00:05:51.070> night<00:05:51.479> but<00:05:54.210> you<00:05:55.210> know<00:05:55.360> it's<00:05:55.719> it's<00:05:56.650> not<00:05:56.710> that

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
at night but you know it's it's not that

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.649 
at night but you know it's it's not that
big<00:05:57.130> of<00:05:57.219> a<00:05:57.310> deal<00:05:57.460> to<00:05:57.580> me<00:05:57.729> because<00:05:58.180> I<00:05:58.389> want<00:05:58.509> to<00:05:58.570> be

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
big of a deal to me because I want to be

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.770 
big of a deal to me because I want to be
running<00:05:58.840> a<00:05:59.050> reflow<00:05:59.469> hammerhead<00:05:59.949> on<00:06:00.070> there<00:06:00.780> so

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
running a reflow hammerhead on there so

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.279 
running a reflow hammerhead on there so
I<00:06:02.610> really<00:06:03.610> like<00:06:03.789> the<00:06:03.969> pump<00:06:04.240> I<00:06:04.509> did<00:06:04.840> do<00:06:05.020> it<00:06:05.169> on

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
I really like the pump I did do it on

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.100 
I really like the pump I did do it on
the<00:06:05.409> tub<00:06:05.880> which<00:06:06.880> I<00:06:07.030> will<00:06:07.210> show<00:06:07.389> you<00:06:07.449> guys<00:06:07.570> that

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
the tub which I will show you guys that

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.999 
the tub which I will show you guys that
in<00:06:08.409> a<00:06:08.500> few<00:06:08.770> minutes<00:06:09.180> but<00:06:10.500> it<00:06:11.500> was<00:06:11.770> basically

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:12.009 
in a few minutes but it was basically

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.300 
in a few minutes but it was basically
rocking<00:06:12.789> my<00:06:12.940> ASM<00:06:13.750> skimmer<00:06:14.199> around<00:06:14.590> it<00:06:14.889> was

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
rocking my ASM skimmer around it was

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.050 
rocking my ASM skimmer around it was
enough<00:06:15.610> flow<00:06:15.990> to<00:06:17.370> basically<00:06:18.370> meet<00:06:18.639> the<00:06:18.820> needs

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
enough flow to basically meet the needs

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.620 
enough flow to basically meet the needs
of<00:06:19.240> this<00:06:19.449> tub<00:06:19.860> with<00:06:20.860> with<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:21.520> you<00:06:22.479> know
