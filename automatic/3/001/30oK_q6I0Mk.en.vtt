00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
Pro baby this going on and I think it's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.480 
Pro baby this going on and I think it's
the<00:01:09.110> intro<00:01:10.110> movie<00:01:10.260> yeah<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.400> with

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the intro movie yeah I think it's with

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.250 
the intro movie yeah I think it's with
your<00:01:11.640> corner<00:01:11.909> h1<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.049> love<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
your corner h1 and you just love a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.990 
your corner h1 and you just love a
smaller<00:01:13.619> curling<00:01:14.100> iron<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> don't<00:01:14.790> want

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
smaller curling iron and you don't want

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.789 
smaller curling iron and you don't want
to<00:01:15.090> use<00:01:15.299> expect<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.320> leave<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> way

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
to use expect so just leave it the way

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.840 
to use expect so just leave it the way
that<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.220> basically<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.700> need

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
that so basically you just need

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.300 
that so basically you just need
something<00:01:18.090> without<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.990> clip<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.280> I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
guys grab your wand and we're gonna curl

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.400 
guys grab your wand and we're gonna curl
pretty<00:01:50.730> large<00:01:51.150> sections<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.170> want<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
pretty large sections and you want to

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.930 
pretty large sections and you want to
just<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.620> the<00:01:52.740> bottom<00:01:52.920> layers<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.730> I'm<00:01:53.790> going

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
just do the bottom layers so I'm going

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.430 
just do the bottom layers so I'm going
to<00:01:54.000> start<00:01:54.210> looking<00:01:54.300> my<00:01:54.510> back<00:01:54.690> bottom<00:01:55.050> layer<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
to start looking my back bottom layer it

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.560 
to start looking my back bottom layer it
would<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.680> pretty<00:01:55.950> big<00:01:56.220> sections<00:01:56.700> like<00:01:56.820> big

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
would do pretty big sections like big

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.290 
would do pretty big sections like big
chunks<00:01:58.080> like<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.850> gonna<00:01:59.970> grab<00:02:00.150> it

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
chunks like this and just gonna grab it

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.170 
chunks like this and just gonna grab it
randomly<00:02:00.660> like<00:02:00.960> something<00:02:01.830> special<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:03.000> just

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
randomly like something special and just

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.530 
randomly like something special and just
going<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.360> go<00:02:03.420> over<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.900> wand<00:02:04.340> lets<00:02:05.340> me<00:02:05.550> and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
going to go over the wand lets me and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.020 
going to go over the wand lets me and
you<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> hole<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.350> five<00:02:07.680> seconds

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.480 

let<00:02:12.030> go<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.709> doesn't<00:02:13.950> look<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.100> anything

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
let go and it doesn't look like anything

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.920 
let go and it doesn't look like anything
right<00:02:14.580> now<00:02:14.640> but<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.240> will<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> promise

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
right now but it will I promise

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.320 
right now but it will I promise
so<00:02:16.500> another<00:02:17.100> big<00:02:17.220> section<00:02:17.790> really<00:02:18.090> really

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
so another big section really really

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:27.770 
so another big section really really
random<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.970> once<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.270> finish<00:02:27.480> doing<00:02:27.690> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
random so once you finish doing the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.360 
random so once you finish doing the
large<00:02:28.020> sections<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.709> want<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.950> focus<00:02:29.070> on<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
large sections you want to focus on the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.830 
large sections you want to focus on the
smaller<00:02:29.730> sections<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.420> don't<00:02:30.720> look

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
smaller sections that don't look

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.910 
smaller sections that don't look
straight

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.920 

we<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:38.070> do<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> couple<00:02:38.700> sections<00:02:38.970> up<00:02:39.390> here<00:02:39.690> just

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
we can do a couple sections up here just

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.510 
we can do a couple sections up here just
to<00:02:40.020> get<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> little<00:02:40.320> bit<00:02:40.560> more<00:02:40.830> volume<00:02:41.100> but<00:02:41.489> you

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
to get a little bit more volume but you

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.740 
to get a little bit more volume but you
will<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.970> don't<00:02:42.150> want<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.330> do<00:02:42.420> too<00:02:42.540> much<00:02:42.690> good

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
will you don't want to do too much good

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.810 
will you don't want to do too much good
you<00:02:43.739> just<00:02:43.920> want<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.130> keep<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.370> straight<00:02:44.610> at<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
you just want to keep it straight at the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.509 
you just want to keep it straight at the
top<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.209> looks<00:02:45.239> my<00:02:45.540> natural<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.709> now<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:46.860> decide

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
top it looks my natural so now I decide

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.690 
top it looks my natural so now I decide
you<00:02:47.790> want<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.000> curl<00:02:48.330> see<00:02:48.959> your<00:02:49.110> way<00:02:49.290> but

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
you want to curl see your way but

through the trails the swings good so
its<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:52.709> going<00:02:53.070> over<00:02:53.570> curling<00:02:54.570> are<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:55.049> go

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
little something like this I like to add

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.170 
little something like this I like to add
some<00:03:09.840> texture<00:03:10.140> into<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.470> I'm<00:03:10.860> using<00:03:11.550> land<00:03:11.970> by

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
some texture into it I'm using land by

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.870 
some texture into it I'm using land by
chopping<00:03:12.710> their<00:03:13.710> texture<00:03:14.220> bomb<00:03:14.460> it<00:03:14.730> looks

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
chopping their texture bomb it looks

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.160 
chopping their texture bomb it looks
like<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.540> think<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.680> clea<00:03:16.890> bully<00:03:17.250> stick

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170

like this I think the clea bully stick
and<00:03:19.170> just<00:03:19.380> about<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.680> your<00:03:19.950> palm<00:03:22.130> just<00:03:26.180> stick

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
it to my lines as okay so this is the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.380 
it to my lines as okay so this is the
final<00:03:44.430> look<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.760> don't<00:03:44.820> know<00:03:45.000> if<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.150> guys<00:03:45.209> can
