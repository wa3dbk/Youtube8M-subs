hi I'm Jacob with emerald pool supply

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.230 
hi I'm Jacob with emerald pool supply
and<00:00:07.160> today<00:00:07.550> we're<00:00:07.670> going<00:00:07.790> to<00:00:07.849> go<00:00:07.970> over<00:00:08.000> the

and today we're going to go over the

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.330 
and today we're going to go over the
Jandy<00:00:08.720> variable<00:00:09.380> speed<00:00:09.559> pump<00:00:09.830> the<00:00:10.160> one

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
Jandy variable speed pump the one

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.610 
Jandy variable speed pump the one
horsepower<00:00:10.820> version<00:00:11.030> of<00:00:11.300> the<00:00:11.360> blow<00:00:11.510> Pro<00:00:11.750> so

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
horsepower version of the blow Pro so

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.900 
horsepower version of the blow Pro so
pretty<00:00:13.040> much<00:00:13.099> what's<00:00:13.280> going<00:00:13.459> on<00:00:13.580> this<00:00:13.849> thing

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
pretty much what's going on this thing

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.360 
pretty much what's going on this thing
is<00:00:14.360> it<00:00:15.080> looks<00:00:15.259> exactly<00:00:15.410> like<00:00:15.799> the<00:00:16.190> two

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:16.370 
is it looks exactly like the two

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.730 
is it looks exactly like the two
horsepower<00:00:16.700> but<00:00:17.660> they<00:00:17.900> now<00:00:18.200> mount<00:00:18.500> to<00:00:18.650> the

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
horsepower but they now mount to the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.920 
horsepower but they now mount to the
controller<00:00:19.100> on<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:19.310> back<00:00:19.520> of<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:19.730> motor<00:00:19.940> so

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
controller on the back of the motor so

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.050 
controller on the back of the motor so
it<00:00:21.770> makes<00:00:21.950> a<00:00:22.040> little<00:00:22.190> bit<00:00:22.280> more<00:00:22.370> convenience

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
it makes a little bit more convenience

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.760 
it makes a little bit more convenience
for<00:00:23.300> some<00:00:23.510> people<00:00:23.870> or<00:00:24.140> however<00:00:24.320> you<00:00:24.530> want<00:00:24.680> to

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
for some people or however you want to

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.860 
for some people or however you want to
do<00:00:24.920> it<00:00:25.070> but<00:00:25.310> you<00:00:25.910> also<00:00:26.060> have<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:26.450> option<00:00:26.840> to

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:26.870 
do it but you also have the option to

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.360 
do it but you also have the option to
remove<00:00:27.110> the<00:00:27.350> controller<00:00:27.800> mounted<00:00:28.040> in<00:00:28.310> the

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.370 
remove the controller mounted in the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.139 
remove the controller mounted in the
wall<00:00:28.520> like<00:00:28.550> before<00:00:29.090> with<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.390> two<00:00:29.540> horsepower

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:31.149 
wall like before with the two horsepower

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.420 
wall like before with the two horsepower
pretty<00:00:32.149> much<00:00:32.329> everything<00:00:32.870> is<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:33.530> same<00:00:33.559> same

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
pretty much everything is the same same

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.040 
pretty much everything is the same same
baskets<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.239> lids<00:00:36.129> unions<00:00:37.129> same<00:00:37.730> everything

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
baskets and lids unions same everything

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.770 
baskets and lids unions same everything
the<00:00:39.499> basis<00:00:39.980> it<00:00:40.280> comes<00:00:40.460> with<00:00:40.550> bases<00:00:40.999> so<00:00:41.480> you

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
the basis it comes with bases so you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.840 
the basis it comes with bases so you
have<00:00:41.960> say<00:00:42.350> a<00:00:42.379> super<00:00:42.649> to<00:00:42.949> pump<00:00:43.190> right<00:00:43.370> now<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:43.730> I

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
have say a super to pump right now and I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.239 
have say a super to pump right now and I
got<00:00:44.059> hayward<00:00:44.449> super<00:00:44.780> -<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.769> way<00:00:45.890> it<00:00:45.920> is<00:00:46.129> right

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
got hayward super - the way it is right

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:47.439 
got hayward super - the way it is right
now<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.519> it<00:00:46.670> bolts<00:00:46.909> right<00:00:46.969> into<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:47.300> hayward

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
now is it bolts right into a hayward

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.090 
now is it bolts right into a hayward
super<00:00:47.839> -<00:00:47.989> you<00:00:48.260> just<00:00:48.379> cut<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:48.769> kind<00:00:49.039> of

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
super - you just cut it and kind of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.889 
super - you just cut it and kind of
plumbing<00:00:49.429> in<00:00:49.519> its<00:00:49.789> perfect<00:00:50.120> tight<00:00:50.449> weight

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
plumbing in its perfect tight weight

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.899 
plumbing in its perfect tight weight
everything<00:00:51.289> you<00:00:52.010> put<00:00:52.190> this<00:00:52.339> in<00:00:52.609> with<00:00:52.879> a

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
everything you put this in with a

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:54.130 
everything you put this in with a
whisper<00:00:53.600> foam

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
whisper foam

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.739 
whisper foam
it<00:00:54.319> becomes<00:00:54.649> these<00:00:55.390> adaptors<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.420> make<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:56.719> a

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
it becomes these adaptors and make it a

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.569 
it becomes these adaptors and make it a
little<00:00:56.899> bit<00:00:57.140> taller<00:00:57.319> with<00:00:57.530> this<00:00:57.679> base<00:00:57.890> they

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
little bit taller with this base they

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.399 
little bit taller with this base they
come<00:00:58.789> in<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.269> middle<00:00:59.569> so<00:00:59.749> you<00:00:59.809> snap<00:01:00.140> them<00:01:00.260> out

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
come in the middle so you snap them out

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.040 
come in the middle so you snap them out
and<00:01:00.620> then<00:01:00.739> you<00:01:00.829> put<00:01:00.859> them<00:01:01.100> on<00:01:01.659> like<00:01:02.659> that<00:01:02.870> they

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
and then you put them on like that they

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.880 
and then you put them on like that they
stick<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.129> you<00:01:04.220> put<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.460> base<00:01:04.640> down<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:06.530> then

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
stick so you put the base down and then

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.499 
stick so you put the base down and then
it'll<00:01:07.430> sit<00:01:07.640> right<00:01:07.790> on<00:01:07.850> top<00:01:07.969> just<00:01:08.329> like<00:01:08.390> that

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
it'll sit right on top just like that

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.080 
it'll sit right on top just like that
and<00:01:09.200> now<00:01:09.409> it<00:01:09.530> bolts<00:01:09.829> up<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.130> this<00:01:10.219> whisper<00:01:10.909> flow

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
and now it bolts up to this whisper flow

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.240 
and now it bolts up to this whisper flow
you<00:01:11.780> have<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.930> snare<00:01:12.170> right<00:01:12.350> pump<00:01:12.649> it<00:01:12.890> requires

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
you have a snare right pump it requires

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.550 
you have a snare right pump it requires
a<00:01:13.369> third<00:01:13.700> base<00:01:14.030> but<00:01:14.899> if<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.110> have<00:01:15.259> that<00:01:15.439> you

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
a third base but if you have that you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.080 
a third base but if you have that you
need<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.770> call<00:01:15.890> zodiacs<00:01:16.310> export<00:01:16.790> then<00:01:16.969> they'll

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
need to call zodiacs export then they'll

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.630 
need to call zodiacs export then they'll
send<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:17.750> free<00:01:18.409> of<00:01:18.560> charge<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.189> it's

send it to you free of charge so it's

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.779 
send it to you free of charge so it's
kind<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:19.969> cool<00:01:20.119> thing<00:01:20.180> if<00:01:20.479> they<00:01:20.600> do<00:01:21.789> pretty

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
kind of a cool thing if they do pretty

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.310 
kind of a cool thing if they do pretty
much<00:01:22.939> other<00:01:23.210> than<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:23.509> it<00:01:24.020> looks<00:01:24.049> pretty

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
much other than that it looks pretty

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.279 
much other than that it looks pretty
much<00:01:24.789> acts<00:01:25.789> like<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.329> same<00:01:26.539> thing<00:01:26.810> as<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.110> two

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
much acts like the same thing as the two

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.459 
much acts like the same thing as the two
horsepower<00:01:27.590> it's<00:01:28.009> just<00:01:28.189> a<00:01:28.280> little<00:01:28.490> bit<00:01:28.610> less

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
horsepower it's just a little bit less

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.609 
horsepower it's just a little bit less
so<00:01:30.469> let's<00:01:30.920> go<00:01:31.039> the<00:01:31.189> wine<00:01:31.340> guy<00:01:32.259> so<00:01:33.259> here's<00:01:33.439> what

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
so let's go the wine guy so here's what

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.590 
so let's go the wine guy so here's what
the<00:01:33.710> pump<00:01:33.920> looks<00:01:34.130> like<00:01:34.280> up<00:01:34.460> close<00:01:34.490> it<00:01:35.450> comes

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
the pump looks like up close it comes

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.120 
the pump looks like up close it comes

switch<00:01:43.219> the<00:01:43.369> wrong<00:01:43.579> way<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:44.420> could

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
switch the wrong way you could

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.630 
switch the wrong way you could
potentially<00:01:45.140> fry<00:01:45.469> an<00:01:45.649> aqua<00:01:45.920> link<00:01:46.100> board<00:01:46.340> if

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
potentially fry an aqua link board if

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.620 
potentially fry an aqua link board if
you're<00:01:46.820> hooking<00:01:47.060> up<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.479> aqua<00:01:47.929> link<00:01:48.250> rs-485

you're hooking up the aqua link rs-485

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.760 
you're hooking up the aqua link rs-485
take<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.719> little<00:01:50.869> sticker<00:01:51.079> off<00:01:51.289> just<00:01:51.530> keep<00:01:51.679> it

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
take the little sticker off just keep it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.520 
take the little sticker off just keep it
around<00:01:51.859> just<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:52.579> you<00:01:52.670> can<00:01:52.789> refer<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.210> later

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
around just so you can refer to it later

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
of a cool thing to do well let's open up

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.139 
of a cool thing to do well let's open up
the<00:02:03.200> front<00:02:03.350> panel<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.890> take<00:02:04.369> a<00:02:04.429> look<00:02:04.670> at<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:04.969> so

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
the front panel and take a look at it so

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.120 
the front panel and take a look at it so
you<00:02:05.719> got<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:05.899> little<00:02:06.049> QuickStart<00:02:06.740> guide<00:02:06.920> right

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
you got a little QuickStart guide right

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.510 
you got a little QuickStart guide right
here<00:02:07.369> which<00:02:07.969> can<00:02:08.420> be<00:02:08.570> removed<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.190> then<00:02:10.190> this

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
here which can be removed and then this

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.300 
here which can be removed and then this
is<00:02:10.670> your<00:02:10.789> controller<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.890> control<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
is your controller so you control the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.890 
is your controller so you control the
whole<00:02:13.489> pump<00:02:13.909> interface<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.629> whole<00:02:14.750> nine

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
so then when you're installing the motor

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.880 
so then when you're installing the motor
here's<00:02:19.750> everything<00:02:20.049> that<00:02:20.230> you're<00:02:20.739> dealing

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
say you want to hook it up until you

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.809 
say you want to hook it up until you
like<00:02:32.590> an<00:02:32.709> older<00:02:33.010> aqua<00:02:33.370> link<00:02:33.549> that<00:02:33.730> doesn't

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
like an older aqua link that doesn't

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.930 
like an older aqua link that doesn't
support<00:02:34.299> variable<00:02:34.720> speed<00:02:34.870> programming<00:02:35.560> or<00:02:35.940> so

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
support variable speed programming or so

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.759 
support variable speed programming or so
you<00:02:37.000> have<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.209> heater<00:02:38.079> with<00:02:38.290> just<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.500> regular

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
you have a heater with just a regular

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.410 
you have a heater with just a regular
time<00:02:38.980> clock<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.280> can<00:02:39.579> do<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> fireman<00:02:40.209> switch

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
time clock you can do a fireman switch

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.530 
time clock you can do a fireman switch
style<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.959> where<00:02:41.079> when<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.799> heater<00:02:42.010> turns<00:02:42.280> off

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
style to where when the heater turns off

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.059 
style to where when the heater turns off
or<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.750> pump<00:02:43.959> turns<00:02:44.170> off<00:02:44.379> it's<00:02:44.590> got<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.739> twenty

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
or the pump turns off it's got a twenty

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.270 
or the pump turns off it's got a twenty
minute<00:02:45.190> fireman<00:02:45.700> delay<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.349> pump

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
minute fireman delay so that the pump

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.800 
minute fireman delay so that the pump
will<00:02:48.519> not<00:02:48.670> or<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.909> heater<00:02:49.120> will<00:02:49.269> not<00:02:49.390> fry<00:02:49.629> up

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
will not or the heater will not fry up

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.140 
will not or the heater will not fry up
because<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.319> just<00:02:50.379> turns<00:02:51.280> off<00:02:51.459> by<00:02:51.640> itself<00:02:51.909> that

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
because it just turns off by itself that

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.110 
because it just turns off by itself that
cool<00:02:52.390> down<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.680> your<00:02:53.799> 485<00:02:54.310> switch<00:02:54.609> so

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
cool down this is your 485 switch so

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.390 
cool down this is your 485 switch so
pretty<00:02:55.359> much<00:02:55.480> if<00:02:55.629> you<00:02:55.659> want<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.250> hook<00:02:57.250> the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
pretty much if you want to hook the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.589 
pretty much if you want to hook the
controller<00:02:57.730> up<00:02:57.849> somewhere<00:02:58.180> else<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.510> whole

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
controller up somewhere else the whole

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.849 
controller up somewhere else the whole
controller<00:02:58.959> will<00:02:59.109> come<00:02:59.260> off<00:02:59.409> you<00:02:59.560> can<00:02:59.680> close

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
controller will come off you can close

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.789 
controller will come off you can close
this<00:03:00.040> base<00:03:00.220> again<00:03:00.519> but<00:03:01.299> you<00:03:01.690> can<00:03:01.930> run<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
this base again but you can run the

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.550 
this base again but you can run the
wires<00:03:03.010> through<00:03:03.430> here<00:03:03.989> with<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.019> little<00:03:05.230> adapter

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
wires through here with a little adapter

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.899 
wires through here with a little adapter
piece<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.129> they<00:03:06.250> give<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.549> they're<00:03:06.760> going

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
piece that they give you they're going

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.080 
piece that they give you they're going
to<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.359> conduit<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:09.670> can<00:03:09.819> run<00:03:10.000> the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
to the conduit and you can run the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.270 
to the conduit and you can run the
controller<00:03:10.420> wherever<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.810> want<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:12.159> the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
controller wherever you want to so the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.680 
controller wherever you want to so the
dip<00:03:12.400> switches<00:03:12.639> this<00:03:12.849> is<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.090> important<00:03:13.510> part

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
dip switches this is the important part

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.569 
dip switches this is the important part
right<00:03:13.720> here<00:03:14.019> so<00:03:14.889> pretty<00:03:15.129> much<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.400> way<00:03:15.489> the

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
right here so pretty much the way the

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.509 
right here so pretty much the way the
dip<00:03:15.760> switches<00:03:16.000> work<00:03:16.299> is<00:03:17.099> it<00:03:18.099> comes<00:03:18.280> out<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
dip switches work is it comes out of the

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.819 
dip switches work is it comes out of the
factory<00:03:18.849> number<00:03:19.120> one<00:03:19.299> two<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.510> five<00:03:19.780> up<00:03:20.139> that

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
factory number one two and five up that

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:21.990 
factory number one two and five up that
means<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.190> going<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.430> be<00:03:21.489> is<00:03:21.760> you're<00:03:21.940> gonna

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
means it's going to be is you're gonna
