 sir good evening the situation is going 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.670
 temporarily degrade but finally he 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.269
 must be remembered that since one 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.800
 half months 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.690
 we are enjoying a period 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.719
 especially hot and sunny 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.430
 with for example on strasbourg +25 for 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.820
 its sunshine compared to the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.680
 average and + 40% for paris ah here is the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.240
 situation and the satellite animation we 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.189
 have a sky that for the moment is 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.570
 well cleared overall but a 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.519
 depression deepened on the islands 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.050
 british with already a little a little 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.550
 front a first front that is passed on 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.950
 the country we had a little bit too 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.809
 of instability on the Pyrenees and then 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.730
 so this other perturbation that is 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.960
 go straight to Brittany so 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.180
 tomorrow morning we will find a 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.190
 overcast and slightly rainy 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.200
 brittany in the pas de calais with 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.610
 wind at 60 kilometers per hour at the front 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.440
 a sky loaded with locally a few 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.660
 waved then the more we go south 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.949
 then the sun will prevail in the course of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.780
 day the franc progresses but 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.250
 quietly quietly they get 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.210
 walk inland with 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.430
 still light rains 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.379
 a bit of wind at 50 kilometers an hour 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.570
 and then dry and sunny weather in 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.129
 the south of the country so the temperatures 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.750
 tomorrow morning well will vary from 12 to 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.030
 22 degrees it's nice that he will do the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.010
 softer it's like that for a few 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.570
 weeks and then in the afternoon the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.479
 temperatures will be down on the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.350
 north with 21 lille 22 in paris just as 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.820
 in the south it will be hot again with 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.650
 for example a lot of 31 degrees in 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.310
 the Garonne valley or in the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.140
 Rhone Valley 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.630

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 coming week with for monday again 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.079
 a mitigated time the residues of the forehead on 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.329
 the flank is with a thunderclap 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.820
 possible a little instability also 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.560
 on the southwest side between the two a 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.750
 half time fig half grape on the other hand 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.670
 bright spells will already be back 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.200

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.090
 nice high pressure this 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.680
 will succeed in winning with 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.869
 rising temperatures to note however 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.939
 still the possibility of a shower on the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.869

 especially north of the Seine and 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.640
 temperatures that will continue to 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.340
