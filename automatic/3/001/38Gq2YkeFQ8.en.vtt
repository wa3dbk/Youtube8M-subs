exact duplicate of what the wax looks

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.549 
exact duplicate of what the wax looks
like<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.690> very<00:00:48.870> important<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
like so it's very important to have a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.240 
like so it's very important to have a
very<00:00:49.739> clean<00:00:50.039> wax<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.199> very<00:00:52.710> smooth

very clean wax and have it very smooth
in<00:00:53.430> some<00:00:53.640> places<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.570> don't<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.960> to

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
in some places so that you don't have to

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.720 
in some places so that you don't have to
do<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.410> much<00:00:55.590> finishing<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> casting

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
do that much finishing to the casting

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.849 
do that much finishing to the casting
once<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.120> finished<00:00:57.300> now<00:00:57.690> there's<00:00:58.440> two<00:00:58.680> ways

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
once it's finished now there's two ways

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.060 
once it's finished now there's two ways
of<00:00:59.010> making<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.520> wax<00:00:59.760> pattern<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.469> using<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
of making a wax pattern one is using a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.160 
of making a wax pattern one is using a
rubber<00:01:02.309> mold<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.180> great<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.719> production

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
rubber mold this is great for production

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.810 
rubber mold this is great for production
if<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.530> too<00:01:04.650> crude<00:01:04.920> grate<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> bunch<00:01:05.700> of

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
if you have too crude grate a bunch of

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.929 
if you have too crude grate a bunch of
pieces<00:01:06.140> we<00:01:07.140> inject<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> wax<00:01:07.860> using<00:01:08.400> our<00:01:08.700> hot

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
inside the rubber mold and then we just

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.780 
inside the rubber mold and then we just
pop<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.360> open<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.470> voila<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.759> have

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.630 
mold so we use this hot pen
we<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:04.060> melt<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.140> end<00:02:06.040> of<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.340> bottom

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
we just melt it to the end of the bottom

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.360 
we just melt it to the end of the bottom
of<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.850> shank<00:02:07.119> here<00:02:10.770> let<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:11.800> cool<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.190> little

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
of the shank here let it cool a little

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:33.690 
of the shank here let it cool a little
bit<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:32.290> have<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.470> be<00:02:32.620> very<00:02:32.860> careful<00:02:33.459> with<00:02:33.550> the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
bit you have to be very careful with the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.530 
bit you have to be very careful with the
wax<00:02:33.880> patterns<00:02:34.330> they're<00:02:35.290> very<00:02:35.560> fragile<00:02:36.540> it's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
wax patterns they're very fragile it's

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.949 
wax patterns they're very fragile it's
very<00:02:37.720> simple<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.230> break<00:02:38.440> them<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.720> once<00:02:40.870> you

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
very simple to break them so once you

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.440 
very simple to break them so once you
have<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.200> wax<00:02:41.350> pattern<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:45.090> attach<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.300> to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
have the wax pattern you attach it to

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:59.030 
have the wax pattern you attach it to
the<00:02:46.570> little<00:02:46.840> base<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:52.360> this<00:02:56.370> let<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.580> dry

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
the little base like this let that dry

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.270 
the little base like this let that dry
fill<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.190> seam<00:03:00.519> like<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.980> there<00:03:06.160> you

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
fill in the seam like that and there you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.310 
fill in the seam like that and there you
have<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.489> now<00:03:06.910> we're<00:03:07.480> ready<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.750> go<00:03:07.930> into<00:03:08.140> the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
have it now we're ready to go into the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.170 
have it now we're ready to go into the
investing<00:03:08.920> room<00:03:09.150> we'll<00:03:10.150> create<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.630> mold
