 all the shapes that are going to be cut 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.750
 define this form as a vector of 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.210
 cut when assigning the contour code of 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.040

 seconds and then put the image on 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.030

 heat press at 325 degrees fahrenheit 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.659
 closes the press on the garment and 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.659
 press for 15 seconds 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.720
 the heat and the pressure will join 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.000
 permanently the graphic and the garment 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.680
 allow the garment to cool by two

 or three seconds and then remove the
