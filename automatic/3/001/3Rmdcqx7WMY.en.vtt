00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.420
 to 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.790
 hello everybody who never abused 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.910
 power is not even the case. 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:33.510
 so get done, there are still five tips 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:37.770
 to you who never told a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.110
 little bit does not hurt it does not hurt it without 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.090
 see the staff because of loss so in 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.180
 a little bit we come as a medium 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.840
 bond or even a people knowing the whole day 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.789
 nipping can not pinch causes 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.770
 that we lose the notion of quantity 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.180
 and then it consumed many calories then 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.190
 set times for your meals 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.550
 including snacks between meals 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.769
 and with these meals 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:14.100
 Okay, you have total control of your 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:17.040
 Feeding time near food 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.799
 more caloric and less healthy as 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.540
 candy biscuits bullets makes the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.020
 people consume more than we 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.299
 then need to know that if the 6 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 after these foods that he committed 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.930
 still without these foods nearby 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.540
 crazy is that friends of being few friends 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.909
 work so that you do not have to 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.729
 you are exposed to treatment because 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.310
 You'll certainly continue and go. 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.549
 play if you're near what's left 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.549
 Henrique 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.130
 For those who want to lose weight 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.340
 can be a trigger 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.409
 to give up the goal and beyond 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.100
 When we exaggerate people think that 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.140
 nothing works that we can not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.470
 Actually, we can, yes. 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.140
 as planning it even plans to 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.970
 the excess time if you know why 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.180
 example that the weekend has a 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.250
 moment of alert when you go to botafogo 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.220
 go to relatives's house 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.450
 access is planned for those who are not so 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.880
 Big this way and then you have control is 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.430
 of your food and you keep 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.430
 within its objective which is 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.379
 who never thought that too? 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.110
 then exaggeration will do what goes 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.870
 walking in the same light as for the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.040
 exercise increases expenditure 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.290
 energetic but only you all the benefits 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.890
 of physical activity only in moments 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.160
 of exaggeration and knows what the most personal is 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.019
 that people usually value the 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.000
 energy expenditure that we have with 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.450
 physical activity , but then I saw 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.750
 personal physical activity will help goes 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.630
 help but will be even better if the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.090
 people put on this exercise practice 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.190
 of our routine in our daily lives there 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.590
 yes all the benefits that the 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:32.459
 exercises can bring us will 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:36.900
 get the soup diet 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:40.349
 the detox diet for three days 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.780
 This is not the best alternative. 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.720
 if you exaggerated, go back to your routine 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.639
 food so that the restriction beyond 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.880
 What were you already doing? 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.980
 increase your willingness to eat 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.109
 food plus 30 pilots and then if you 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.510
 stay available for these 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.690
 food you will not have control is 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.510
 normal is then a restriction 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.730
 excessively decreases their engagement in 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.700
 Your goal then is not worth it. 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.799
 further restriction and for diets 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.440
 back to your food routine 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.590
 go back to food re-education 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.250
 always have a balanced diet 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.979
 the party is part of the party with lunch 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.380
 friends but for those who want to lose weight 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.639
 having a healthy diet is part of 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.419
 will also resume re-education 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.419
 so ok
