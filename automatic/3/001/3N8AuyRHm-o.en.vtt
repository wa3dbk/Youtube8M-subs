peace<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.290> when<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.710> think<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.310> defensive

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
peace and when you think of a defensive

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.160 
peace and when you think of a defensive

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
a center midfielder you don't

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.750 
a center midfielder you don't
necessarily<00:02:11.910> need<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:13.170> have<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.890> know<00:02:13.920> 85

place<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.630> stupid<00:02:16.170> pace<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.590> those<00:02:16.739> positions

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
place and stupid pace in those positions

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.270 
place and stupid pace in those positions
in<00:02:17.400> my<00:02:17.520> opinion<00:02:17.849> guys<00:02:18.209> 74<00:02:18.989> piece<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.069> a

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
in my opinion guys 74 piece to have in a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.190 
in my opinion guys 74 piece to have in a
defensive<00:02:20.700> midfielder<00:02:20.910> or<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.569> center

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
defensive midfielder or a center

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.410 
defensive midfielder or a center
midfielder<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.860> good<00:02:23.190> do<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.400> know<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.819> so

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
midfielder is good do you know and so

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.880 
midfielder is good do you know and so
that's<00:02:24.630> just<00:02:24.720> my<00:02:24.959> opinion<00:02:24.989> if<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.770> to

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
that's just my opinion if you have to

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.590 
that's just my opinion if you have to
have<00:02:26.010> pace<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.610> position<00:02:26.790> then<00:02:27.180> probably

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
have pace in that position then probably

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.449 
have pace in that position then probably
effenberg<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.380> not<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.770> sort<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.069> player<00:02:29.310> that

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
up the only downside really that I had

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.539

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
him back a little bit so he was out of
