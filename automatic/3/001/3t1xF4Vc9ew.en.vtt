00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
alright so here isn't up to eight on my

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.130 
alright so here isn't up to eight on my
gaming<00:00:04.110> computer<00:00:05.450> how<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.480> set<00:00:06.810> up<00:00:06.899> over<00:00:07.080> there

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
gaming computer how I set up over there

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.110 
gaming computer how I set up over there
were<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.760> computer<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.880> now<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:11.120> didn't

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
were that a computer is now and didn't

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.470 
were that a computer is now and didn't
quite<00:00:12.330> work<00:00:12.599> right<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.590> happened<00:00:13.950> is

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
quite work right what happened is

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.380 
quite work right what happened is
install<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.630> operating<00:00:15.809> system<00:00:16.350> are<00:00:16.500> at<00:00:16.590> once

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
install the operating system are at once

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.929 
install the operating system are at once
didn't<00:00:18.390> really<00:00:19.010> install<00:00:20.010> or<00:00:20.189> boot<00:00:20.400> correctly

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
didn't really install or boot correctly

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.859 
didn't really install or boot correctly
try<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.869> again<00:00:22.580> booted<00:00:23.580> correctly<00:00:24.330> installed

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
try it again booted correctly installed

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.189 
try it again booted correctly installed
booty<00:00:25.230> crackers<00:00:25.500> once<00:00:26.029> they<00:00:27.029> had<00:00:27.210> USB<00:00:27.689> failure

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
booty crackers once they had USB failure

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.790 
booty crackers once they had USB failure
come<00:00:28.619> probably<00:00:29.369> because<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.970> motherboard

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
come probably because of the motherboard

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.760 
come probably because of the motherboard
and<00:00:31.800> then<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.820> wouldn't<00:00:33.600> stop<00:00:33.840> right<00:00:34.170> again<00:00:34.500> so

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and then it wouldn't stop right again so

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.810 
and then it wouldn't stop right again so
i<00:00:34.860> restarted<00:00:35.120> again<00:00:36.290> and<00:00:37.370> try<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.430> selling<00:00:38.730> it

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
i restarted again and try and selling it

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.790 
i restarted again and try and selling it
again<00:00:39.000> but<00:00:39.120> then<00:00:39.300> i<00:00:39.329> wouldn't<00:00:39.559> start<00:00:40.559> up<00:00:40.649> at

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
again but then i wouldn't start up at

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.190 
again but then i wouldn't start up at
all<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.840> let's<00:00:42.840> flash<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.890> i<00:00:45.200> think

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
all just like let's flash so i think

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.310 
all just like let's flash so i think
it's<00:00:46.500> some<00:00:46.710> other<00:00:46.800> board<00:00:47.129> i<00:00:47.219> got<00:00:47.430> i<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
it's some other board i got i have a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.799 
it's some other board i got i have a
crappy<00:00:50.100> motherboard<00:00:50.760> well<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.510> thing<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
crappy motherboard well one thing that

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.639 
crappy motherboard well one thing that
could<00:00:52.050> cause<00:00:52.350> although<00:00:52.680> restarting<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:55.489> that

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
could cause although restarting is that

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.599 
could cause although restarting is that
this<00:00:58.649> computer<00:00:59.280> comes<00:00:59.670> with<00:01:00.000> these

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
this computer comes with these

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.380 
this computer comes with these
temperature<00:01:02.609> readers<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:05.270> originally<00:01:06.270> put

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
temperature readers and originally put

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.109 
temperature readers and originally put
the<00:01:06.510> heat<00:01:06.689> sink<00:01:06.869> down<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> processor<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.250> I

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the heat sink down the processor and I

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.240 
the heat sink down the processor and I
took<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.479> off<00:01:09.659> couple<00:01:10.229> hours<00:01:10.650> later<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.130> put

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
took it off couple hours later and put

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.780 
took it off couple hours later and put
these<00:01:11.490> little<00:01:11.820> heat<00:01:12.180> sink<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:13.200> these<00:01:13.380> um<00:01:13.790> heat

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
these little heat sink in these um heat

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.410 
these little heat sink in these um heat
measure<00:01:15.150> things<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.180> probably

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
measure things in and that probably

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.410 
measure things in and that probably
messed<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> thermal<00:01:19.350> grease<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.420> so

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
messed up the thermal grease in there so

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.510 
messed up the thermal grease in there so
that's<00:01:21.570> probably<00:01:22.200> why<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:22.979> shutting<00:01:23.280> down

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that's probably why it's shutting down

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.330 
that's probably why it's shutting down
with<00:01:23.700> someone<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.150> i<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.570> do<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.220> going<00:01:26.220> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
with someone so i have to do is going to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.890 
with someone so i have to do is going to
have<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> thermal<00:01:27.330> grease<00:01:27.540> over

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
have to get the thermal grease over

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.730 
have to get the thermal grease over
there<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:29.490> after<00:01:29.850> they<00:01:30.000> are<00:01:30.380> find<00:01:31.380> some<00:01:31.560> new

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
there and after they are find some new

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.710 
there and after they are find some new
stuff<00:01:32.549> put<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.450> there<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.490> we<00:01:35.509> will<00:01:36.509> solve

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
stuff put it in there and we will solve

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.810 
stuff put it in there and we will solve
my<00:01:36.869> problems<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.530> doesn't<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.220> i'm<00:01:38.670> gonna

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
my problems it doesn't then i'm gonna

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.920 
my problems it doesn't then i'm gonna
have<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> new<00:01:39.299> motherboard<00:01:39.630> or

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
have to get a new motherboard or

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.710 
have to get a new motherboard or
something<00:01:40.490> take<00:01:41.490> forever<00:01:43.310> but<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.820> pretty

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
something take forever but that's pretty

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.630 
something take forever but that's pretty
much<00:01:45.869> what's<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.860> I'll<00:01:47.250> tell<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> what
