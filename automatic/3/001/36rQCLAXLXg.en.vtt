00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
thing however it is also very easy to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.370 
thing however it is also very easy to
take<00:02:23.580> because<00:02:24.150> they<00:02:24.540> don't<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:24.990> have

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
take because they don't like have

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.930 
take because they don't like have
anything<00:02:25.710> that<00:02:25.980> would<00:02:26.070> set<00:02:26.220> off<00:02:26.250> an<00:02:26.460> alarm<00:02:26.550> if

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
anything that would set off an alarm if

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.310 
anything that would set off an alarm if
you<00:02:27.030> just<00:02:27.210> walk<00:02:27.390> out<00:02:27.570> with<00:02:27.720> it's<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.110> bag

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
you just walk out with it's it's a bag

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.900 
you just walk out with it's it's a bag
it's<00:02:28.530> not<00:02:28.620> like<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.740> wrapped<00:02:29.040> product<00:02:29.520> or<00:02:29.670> like

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
it's not like a wrapped product or like

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.280 
it's not like a wrapped product or like
with<00:02:30.150> an<00:02:30.270> alarm<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.810> or<00:02:30.990> anything<00:02:31.020> like

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
with an alarm on it or anything like

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.070 
with an alarm on it or anything like
that<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.070> it's<00:02:32.880> very<00:02:33.150> easy<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.570> take<00:02:33.870> however

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
that so it's very easy to take however

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.420 
that so it's very easy to take however
that's<00:02:34.320> not<00:02:34.380> what<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:34.710> went<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:34.950> there<00:02:35.100> with

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
that's not what we went in there with

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.610 
that's not what we went in there with
the<00:02:35.610> intent<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.090> do<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:36.870> apparently<00:02:37.500> my

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
the intent to do but apparently my

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.580 
the intent to do but apparently my
friends<00:02:37.950> had<00:02:38.100> different<00:02:38.700> ideas<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.440> what<00:02:40.440> they

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
friends had different ideas so what they

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.340 
friends had different ideas so what they
did<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.790> were<00:02:41.910> like<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.720> packing<00:02:43.140> up<00:02:43.230> the

like whispering to each other and they

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.010 
like whispering to each other and they
