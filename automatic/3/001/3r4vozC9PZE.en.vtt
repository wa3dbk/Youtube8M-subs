00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
so apparently this map is really strange

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.339 
so apparently this map is really strange
open<00:00:22.099> spawn<00:00:22.490> you<00:00:23.179> literally<00:00:23.509> spawn<00:00:23.929> in<00:00:24.140> this

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
open spawn you literally spawn in this

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.120 
open spawn you literally spawn in this
rack

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
rack

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.059 
rack

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:28.069 
it looks like the jungle temple blocks

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.489 
it looks like the jungle temple blocks
have<00:00:28.669> glitched<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:29.539> it<00:00:29.900> looks<00:00:30.050> really<00:00:30.470> really

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:30.499 
have glitched and it looks really really

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.820 
have glitched and it looks really really
really<00:00:30.769> really<00:00:31.460> strange<00:00:31.849> so<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.560> blocks

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
really really strange so the the blocks

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.170 
really really strange so the the blocks
just<00:00:34.070> feel<00:00:34.160> really<00:00:34.340> strange<00:00:34.730> how<00:00:34.910> this<00:00:35.090> is

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
just feel really strange how this is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.650 
just feel really strange how this is
happened

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
happened

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.090 
happened
obviously<00:00:36.200> you<00:00:36.260> can't<00:00:36.500> blow<00:00:36.650> them<00:00:36.800> up<00:00:36.860> with<00:00:37.010> a

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
obviously you can't blow them up with a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.010 
obviously you can't blow them up with a
rocky<00:00:37.310> lawn<00:00:37.550> just<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:37.970> that<00:00:38.300> was<00:00:38.450> weird

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
rocky lawn just so that was weird

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.570 
rocky lawn just so that was weird
see<00:00:39.320> if<00:00:39.410> I<00:00:39.470> try<00:00:39.680> blowing<00:00:39.890> up<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.310> rocket

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
see if I try blowing up the rocket

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.820 
see if I try blowing up the rocket
launcher<00:00:40.850> now<00:00:41.090> we'll<00:00:41.570> try<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:41.870> do<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.080> we're

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
launcher now we'll try and do it we're

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.100 
launcher now we'll try and do it we're
trying<00:00:42.950> to<00:00:43.130> it<00:00:43.250> nope<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:44.240> just<00:00:44.480> does<00:00:44.690> not<00:00:44.720> work

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
trying to it nope it just does not work

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.990 
trying to it nope it just does not work
so<00:00:45.860> you<00:00:45.920> can't<00:00:46.220> blow<00:00:46.370> over<00:00:46.580> the<00:00:46.670> rocket

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
so you can't blow over the rocket

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.700 
so you can't blow over the rocket
launcher<00:00:47.300> everything<00:00:48.020> around<00:00:48.260> it<00:00:48.470> will<00:00:48.590> blow

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
launcher everything around it will blow

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.010 
launcher everything around it will blow
over<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:48.980> rock<00:00:49.130> culture<00:00:49.310> but<00:00:50.060> not<00:00:50.300> that<00:00:50.630> but

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
over the rock culture but not that but

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.630 
over the rock culture but not that but
anyway<00:00:51.230> let's<00:00:51.410> go<00:00:51.560> to<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.770> road<00:00:51.950> map<00:00:52.280> where

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
anyway let's go to the road map where

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.640 
anyway let's go to the road map where
there<00:00:52.820> is<00:00:52.940> even<00:00:53.360> more<00:00:53.390> strange<00:00:53.930> occurrences

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
there is even more strange occurrences

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.160 
there is even more strange occurrences
there<00:00:55.160> are<00:00:55.310> pathways<00:00:55.490> this<00:00:56.030> there's<00:00:56.870> just

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
there are pathways this there's just

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.920 
there are pathways this there's just
randomly<00:00:57.770> like<00:00:57.980> glitch<00:00:58.280> there<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:59.000> upon

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
randomly like glitch there and upon

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.750 
randomly like glitch there and upon
loading<00:01:00.200> this<00:01:00.470> world<00:01:00.770> it<00:01:01.130> just<00:01:01.430> looks<00:01:01.640> like

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
loading this world it just looks like

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.359 
loading this world it just looks like
this<00:01:02.150> look<00:01:02.900> at<00:01:03.050> this<00:01:03.200> it<00:01:03.860> looks<00:01:03.980> really

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
this look at this it looks really

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.840 
this look at this it looks really
strange

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
strange

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.060 
strange
so<00:01:05.180> don't<00:01:05.420> know<00:01:05.510> oh<00:01:05.720> I'm<00:01:06.140> pretty<00:01:06.440> sure<00:01:06.650> this<00:01:07.010> is

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
so don't know oh I'm pretty sure this is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.000 
so don't know oh I'm pretty sure this is
glitched<00:01:07.460> I'm<00:01:07.730> I'm<00:01:08.180> not<00:01:08.450> definitely<00:01:09.230> sure<00:01:09.530> but

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
glitched I'm I'm not definitely sure but

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.220 
glitched I'm I'm not definitely sure but
it's<00:01:10.159> just<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:10.370> massive<00:01:10.610> hole<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:11.810> does<00:01:12.080> need

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
it's just this massive hole it does need

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.080 
it's just this massive hole it does need
to<00:01:12.380> say<00:01:12.560> looks<00:01:12.800> a<00:01:12.890> bit<00:01:12.920> really<00:01:13.220> really<00:01:13.610> strange

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
to say looks a bit really really strange

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.870 
to say looks a bit really really strange
like<00:01:14.480> I<00:01:15.080> don't<00:01:15.230> think<00:01:15.710> this<00:01:16.070> probably<00:01:16.640> would

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
like I don't think this probably would

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.280 
like I don't think this probably would
have<00:01:16.940> been<00:01:17.060> made<00:01:17.390> I<00:01:17.420> think<00:01:17.720> it<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.229> an

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
have been made I think it this is an

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.180 
have been made I think it this is an
actual<00:01:18.650> glitch

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
actual glitch

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.480 
actual glitch
apparently<00:01:19.880> upon<00:01:20.270> spawning<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.620> jungle

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
apparently upon spawning the jungle

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.480 
apparently upon spawning the jungle
biome<00:01:23.030> has<00:01:23.479> been<00:01:24.080> took<00:01:24.260> over<00:01:24.530> with<00:01:24.890> crimson

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
biome has been took over with crimson

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.940 
biome has been took over with crimson
and<00:01:25.729> mushroom<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:27.170> that's<00:01:27.350> just<00:01:27.590> really

the different things you can get if we
go<00:01:43.280> down<00:01:43.490> let's<00:01:43.940> go<00:01:44.030> down<00:01:44.119> from<00:01:44.390> here<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:45.200> this

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
go down let's go down from here so this

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.490 
go down let's go down from here so this
is<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.740> parent<00:01:46.010> even<00:01:46.100> taken<00:01:46.640> over<00:01:47.090> or<00:01:47.600> by<00:01:47.960> eg

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
is the parent even taken over or by eg

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.120 
is the parent even taken over or by eg
all<00:01:48.799> mushroom<00:01:49.310> okay<00:01:50.530> but<00:01:51.530> history<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:51.950> the

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
all mushroom okay but history is the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.780 
all mushroom okay but history is the
jungle<00:01:52.520> biome

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
jungle biome

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.320 
jungle biome
itself<00:01:53.740> at<00:01:54.740> HS<00:01:55.190> this<00:01:55.369> is<00:01:55.490> really<00:01:55.820> strange<00:01:56.060> how

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
itself at HS this is really strange how

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.870 
itself at HS this is really strange how
it's<00:01:56.450> been<00:01:56.570> taken<00:01:57.020> over<00:01:57.260> by<00:01:57.619> mushroom<00:01:58.310> but<00:01:58.580> the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
it's been taken over by mushroom but the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.280 
it's been taken over by mushroom but the
Clement<00:01:59.240> say<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.479> could<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.659> been<00:01:59.869> used<00:02:00.110> for

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
Clement say it could have been used for

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.690 
Clement say it could have been used for
that<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:00.530> I'm<00:02:00.619> not<00:02:00.650> sure<00:02:00.799> if<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.130> has<00:02:01.159> his

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
that so I'm not sure if it has his

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.039 
that so I'm not sure if it has his
friend<00:02:02.000> could<00:02:02.150> have<00:02:02.270> joined<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:02.900> could

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
friend could have joined and it could

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.500 
friend could have joined and it could
have<00:02:03.140> happened<00:02:03.470> but<00:02:03.650> it's<00:02:04.189> really<00:02:04.490> weird<00:02:04.760> like

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
have happened but it's really weird like

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.120 
have happened but it's really weird like
if<00:02:05.659> there's<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.110> little<00:02:06.500> bit<00:02:06.619> of<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.799> jungle

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
if there's a little bit of the jungle

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.330 
if there's a little bit of the jungle
but<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.430> busted<00:02:07.880> tree<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.420> most<00:02:09.019> of<00:02:09.200> the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
but that busted tree it most of the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.589 
but that busted tree it most of the
biome<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.490> just<00:02:10.640> missed<00:02:10.910> there<00:02:11.120> mushroom

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
biome is just missed there mushroom

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.900 
biome is just missed there mushroom
biome<00:02:12.170> which<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.800> why<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.040> believe

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
biome which is why I believe

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.150 
biome which is why I believe
this<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.180> actually<00:02:14.660> glitched<00:02:15.260> like<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:16.010> what

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
this is actually glitched like of what

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.280 
this is actually glitched like of what
enter<00:02:16.580> in<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.820> if<00:02:17.270> we<00:02:17.360> just<00:02:17.600> go<00:02:17.690> down<00:02:17.840> here<00:02:17.900> take

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
enter in it if we just go down here take

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.510 
enter in it if we just go down here take
a<00:02:18.320> quick<00:02:18.560> look<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:19.250> looks<00:02:19.430> really

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
a quick look it just looks really

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.600 
a quick look it just looks really
strange<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.560> they<00:02:21.740> dead<00:02:22.040> there's<00:02:22.220> no<00:02:22.370> no<00:02:22.490> it

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
strange and they dead there's no no it

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.150 
strange and they dead there's no no it
paths<00:02:22.880> or<00:02:23.180> anything<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.680> leads<00:02:24.980> me<00:02:25.070> to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
paths or anything so this leads me to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.150 
paths or anything so this leads me to
believe<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.850> actually<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.590> like<00:02:27.590> blitz

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
believe that it actually is like blitz

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.580 
believe that it actually is like blitz
from<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.580> star<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.880> map<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:29.540> if<00:02:29.600> any<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.470> these

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
from the star the map so if any of these

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.590 
from the star the map so if any of these
currents<00:02:31.070> has<00:02:31.160> happened<00:02:31.550> just<00:02:31.850> kind<00:02:32.150> below<00:02:32.420> if

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
currents has happened just kind below if

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600 
currents has happened just kind below if
you've<00:02:32.750> had<00:02:32.900> anything<00:02:33.170> like<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.530> happen<00:02:33.770> to

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
you've had anything like this happen to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.030 
you've had anything like this happen to
your<00:02:34.760> jungle<00:02:35.120> biome<00:02:35.360> or<00:02:35.660> anything<00:02:36.500> like<00:02:36.770> that

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
your jungle biome or anything like that

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.490 
your jungle biome or anything like that
Bessy<00:02:37.670> split<00:02:38.060> me<00:02:38.240> below<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.960> also<00:02:39.170> if<00:02:39.440> you

the minute but this loads of all killing

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.520 
the minute but this loads of all killing
more<00:03:19.070> here<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.370> really<00:03:19.670> cool<00:03:20.290> it's<00:03:21.290> not<00:03:21.470> cool

more here it really cool it's not cool

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.199 
more here it really cool it's not cool
obviously<00:03:22.130> because<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.370> maps<00:03:22.580> destroyed<00:03:22.970> but

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
obviously because the maps destroyed but

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.510 
obviously because the maps destroyed but

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
below I can record your maps but try to

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.690 
below I can record your maps but try to
do<00:03:30.320> something<00:03:30.650> different<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.160> if<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:31.580> is
