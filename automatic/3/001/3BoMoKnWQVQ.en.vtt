sequence extremely hard opening but at

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
sequence extremely hard opening but at
least<00:00:08.590> it's<00:00:08.860> in<00:00:09.040> the<00:00:09.160> right<00:00:09.309> order<00:00:09.730> but<00:00:11.250> if<00:00:12.250> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
goes ending on time you practice lever

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.859 
goes ending on time you practice lever
you<00:00:20.289> might<00:00:20.529> live<00:00:20.769> or<00:00:21.130> you<00:00:21.159> might<00:00:21.669> get<00:00:22.329> to<00:00:22.599> look

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
you might live or you might get to look

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.720 
you might live or you might get to look
down<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.199> long<00:00:23.619> tunnel<00:00:23.919> with<00:00:24.249> the<00:00:24.339> white<00:00:24.519> legs

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
down the long tunnel with the white legs

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:32.150 
down the long tunnel with the white legs
and<00:00:25.179> all<00:00:25.480> that<00:00:26.249> so<00:00:27.249> if<00:00:27.849> if<00:00:28.359> I<00:00:28.599> was<00:00:28.779> to<00:00:28.929> just<00:00:29.169> say

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.670 

fairly<00:00:33.160> common<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.840> then<00:00:37.960> I've<00:00:38.050> got<00:00:38.200> to<00:00:38.320> deal

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
fairly common and then I've got to deal

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.670 
fairly common and then I've got to deal
with<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:38.920> bridle<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:41.200> know<00:00:41.290> the<00:00:41.410> first

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
with the bridle you know the first

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.670 
with the bridle you know the first
mistake<00:00:42.190> that<00:00:42.220> I<00:00:42.370> see<00:00:42.460> a<00:00:42.640> lot<00:00:42.880> of<00:00:42.910> is<00:00:43.470> this<00:00:44.470> one

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
mistake that I see a lot of is this one

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.450 
mistake that I see a lot of is this one
right<00:00:44.830> here<00:00:45.690> what's<00:00:46.690> wrong<00:00:46.870> with<00:00:47.020> that<00:00:49.320> guy

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
right here what's wrong with that guy

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.400 
right here what's wrong with that guy
bottom<00:00:51.460> right<00:00:51.610> so<00:00:52.150> if<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.390> bridle<00:00:52.810> tries<00:00:53.260> to

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
bottom right so if the bridle tries to

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.870 
bottom right so if the bridle tries to
pull<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.650> pilot<00:00:54.040> chute<00:00:54.190> out<00:00:54.310> a<00:00:54.370> treat<00:00:54.730> you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
pull the pilot chute out a treat you

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.540 
pull the pilot chute out a treat you
hoping<00:00:55.180> sideways<00:00:55.720> thing<00:00:56.500> in<00:00:56.590> fat<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.430> now

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
hoping sideways thing in fat and now

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.069 
hoping sideways thing in fat and now
it's<00:00:57.730> very<00:00:57.940> hard<00:00:57.970> to<00:00:58.300> get<00:00:58.390> out<00:00:58.540> so<00:00:58.780> that<00:00:58.900> does

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
it's very hard to get out so that does

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.960 
it's very hard to get out so that does
the<00:00:59.320> first<00:00:59.710> escape<00:00:59.890> well<00:01:00.520> we<00:01:00.640> can<00:01:00.790> certainly

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
the first escape well we can certainly

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.540 
the first escape well we can certainly
fix<00:01:01.329> that<00:01:01.570> by<00:01:02.170> having<00:01:02.470> subrata<00:01:03.100> legs<00:01:03.340> at<00:01:03.489> the

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
fix that by having subrata legs at the

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.980 
fix that by having subrata legs at the
top<00:01:06.090> however<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:08.590> I<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:10.299> it<00:01:10.450> like<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:10.659> this

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
top however if I do it like that this

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.660 
top however if I do it like that this
pulls<00:01:11.319> up<00:01:11.439> pretty<00:01:11.679> nice<00:01:11.890> but<00:01:12.130> then<00:01:12.280> I<00:01:12.399> get<00:01:12.549> to

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
pulls up pretty nice but then I get to

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.550 
pulls up pretty nice but then I get to
the<00:01:12.789> end<00:01:12.969> and<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:17.200> is<00:01:17.350> balls-up<00:01:19.200> berries<00:01:20.200> the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
the end and this is balls-up berries the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.850 
the end and this is balls-up berries the
full<00:01:20.859> solution

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.590 

here<00:01:27.210> left<00:01:28.500> bring<00:01:29.500> this<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:29.979> edge<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:31.390> your

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
here left bring this to the edge in your

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.740 
here left bring this to the edge in your
new<00:01:31.720> clothes<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.940> everything<00:01:34.180> else<00:01:34.540> will<00:01:34.720> be

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
new clothes and everything else will be

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.260 
new clothes and everything else will be
exactly<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.440> same<00:01:35.470> now

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:50.520 

and<00:01:41.780> then<00:01:41.990> we<00:01:42.520> Bridal<00:01:43.520> fools<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.740> difference
