00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.230
 is here in the with more than 50 animals 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.480
 is one of the main problems of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.339
 thousands a locality of the department of 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.250
 cannelloni where they live a little more than two 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:43.079
 a thousand people and then we can 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.360
 write but this is the sound that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.920
 they have to receive every day the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.659
 citizens of thousands and the neighbors of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.870
 this search that has more than 100 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.870
 dogs 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.160
 what is the situation how do they live day to 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.160
 day with these horrible because always 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.570
 you can not have an open window 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.120
 because not only because of the smell but because 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.010
 it just fills up without cat bars 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.730
 this sound that we hear now is 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.730
 permanent 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:23.710
 they all take out the stuff 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.710
 in bags there 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.850
 besides the bad smell generated by the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.250
 urine and fecal matter there are animals in 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.380
 hands the abandoned farm became 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.000
 in a focus of serious health hazard 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.220
 for the neighbors apart we are 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.320
 willing to an academy any there 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.090
 animals that my hair is left with 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.590
 weapons that you have what it is that 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.450
 they ask what they want because this 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.979
 it's a big problem for the city has 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.119
 come the moment that there is that there is a 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.140
 limit must be put 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.020
 underlined was looking for the owner of the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.759
 house is a judicial employee because we went 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.009
 until the court of mercy good me 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.799
 I imagine you know because we came clear 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.280
 and for the animals it is considered that 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.500
 neighbors deserve to have all this sound 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.690
 all day and this smell because it's from 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:18.250
 joke 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:21.220
 and recognizes that there is harmful 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.450
 for the neighbors of the ball or not the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.280
 denunciation of evaded several of the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.620
 questions although from outside open door 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.310
 to a possible solution although this 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.310
 institution 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.590
 now I promise 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.420
 we were in thousands with the neighbors and with 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.129
 the owner of the place now we 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.450
 we came to cannelloni to talk to 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.250
 the authorities of the intendency and 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.579
 ask them what can be done about 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.579
 to this case 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.400
 it's part of the responsibility to take care 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.440
 that public health ministry has also 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.170
 had a performance on this issue is 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.300
 evaluating or has done and act 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.520
 judicially against this person in 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.860
 this sense she said that if she 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.300
 approach animals and place maybe could 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.860
 do to them for you if they have any 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.790
 type of date we talk to you with several 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.580
 especially private institutions that 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.290
 move in the cannelloni department 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.180
 we raised this situation they did not have 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.980
 ability to absorb that amount 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.269
 the reality of animals is the reality 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.310
 you are willing to make a 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.010
 judicial complaint in this case in the 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.370
 moment that we coincide with the mystery 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:37.060
 it is published that it is a health risk 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.560
 which I think it can be 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.190
 to support what is the ministry 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.660
 obviously after seven years of 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.700
 complaint is the subject still remains without 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.739
 solution to repeated reports 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.090
 negative now the ministry of health 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.250
 public made the complaint before the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.960
 justice the question is what is going to 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.400
 do with animals 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.290
 We came to seek the claim of the 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.510
 neighbors we also went in search of the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.670
 owner of this place also we 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.390
 authorities contacted us 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.390
 let's talk
