00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.349
 hello friends, I'm mario arias, your 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.510
 photographic sensor in photography before 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.359
 Today I'm going to present you with a new objective 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.180
 of the brand so rom is 150 to 600 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:20.359
 millimeters an optics that comes to 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.189
 replace the already veteran 200 500 of the 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.320
 same brand and good totally 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.210
 redesigned and I think all lovers 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.279
 of photographers who love 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.180
 photography of nature or of 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.310
 birds or of 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.410
 photographers who like photography 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.060
 sports I think all of them and I 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.750
 included we are in luck because 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.340
 we are facing a goal that 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.370
 obviously there is a lot of demand from 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.790
 then the first unit has just arrived 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.379
 we just opened it from the packaging and the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.550
 First impression is that it is a goal 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.250
 what is it that impresses your appearance 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.559
 still having a define that is a super 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.379
 four-magnification telephoto lens without 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.570
 have an extremely powerful tan is a 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.100
 relatively light objective 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.600
 to say is an objective that falls from the two 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.110
 kilos 1950 grams 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.939
 it has a very good touch 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.890
 materials are strong 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.560
 sounds and the truth that I think the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.500
 Japanese manufacturer, I think it has 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.020
 returned to make a great effort as 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.330
 it's been we're not seeing the 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.539
 recent times already with the 24 70 that has 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.610
 been 28 that has been quite a product 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.049
 reference and with such good quality with 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.020
 so good judgment and with such good 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.240
 critical as 90 bank even 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.860
 70 200 28 how good all these have been 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.659
 of recent times the news and 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.539
 the incorporations that the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:48.110
 This manufacturer comes to be within 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.240
 this range of optics esp a range of one 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.190
 superior quality in terms of glass in 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.539
 about the conventional range and I think 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.610
 Well, they have returned to the 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.460
 nail in terms of making a goal in 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.580
 which there is demand that so far only 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.590
 we had a possibility to buy in the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.240
 immediate competition of how so rom 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.060
 is the sigma brand and well, I think 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.410
 that unlike this one because we're 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.660
 speaking an optics that arrives I insist to 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.400
 600 millimeters must be taken into account 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.960
 Besides, it's an optic that's going to be 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.840
 compatible with so many sensors 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.380
 sc as full frame and all this in one 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.920
 psc makes it round the 230 nine hundred and 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.420
 peak millimeters to 950 this makes 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.200
 really, well, let's have a thousand 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.710
 millimeters at a price that's good then no 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.420
 will happen to be in two thousand 69 thousand 99 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.070
 we are talking a very contained price 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.010
 for a t the goal that good that 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.990
 can have a lot of let's say rennet between 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.700
 all photographers especially at level 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.980
 amateur I would say that they want to have a 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.750
 super tele without having a let's say a 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.180
 high price than what usually 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.230
 they happen to us with the original optics 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.909
 of nikon and canon 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.800
 the frames in which they are going to 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.560
 make will be what I told you 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.660
 with canon also mount sony alpha 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.130
 then, well, those who are 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.200
 users of this type of machines 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.420
 will have that possibility first 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.489
 good impressions when we have removed the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.319
 top we see an imposing diameter of 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.849
 25 mm filter that the truth 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.750
 that the pint that has crystal is 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.160
 extraordinary focus speed 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.260
 so let's leave doubts now I invite 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.720
 As you can see it is thanks to the USB 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.170
 which is how the ultra manufacturer calls the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.530
 ultrasonic treatment alain drive it is 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.840
 practically inaudible the speed in 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.910
 as to the sound it exerts when 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.560
 we exercise the camera autofocus not 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.180
 we are going to listen to it and then at the same time 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.130
 that I observe that the speed of focus and 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.709
 the way the lens has recovered 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.690
 it is impressive to say it is very fast 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.819
 to be moving an optical block 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.860
 I insist of enough is enough 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.470
 lenses that good because I think it is 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.599
 quite a success having incorporated 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.310
 this technology that so developed 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.300
 and such good results is giving notes 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.970
 Optics of such brand 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.580
 is an element that is composed of 20 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.560
 20 elements what are the floors 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.510
 divided into 13 groups what is the 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.390
 construction of the objective itself and the 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.140
 it's really good that he wears a diaphragm 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.760
 of 9 shovels and the truth that I insist the 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.459
 pint is of an objective but totally 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.500
 and at a price I insist that it would be in the 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:26.720
 more than reasonable sale 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.800
 the aspect in what is the grip of the 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.690
 own goal I think it's 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.950
 impressive obviously as 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.270
 it can be another way 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.540
 to move the center of gravity 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.150
 it comes with the title with the typical 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.070
 handle to be able to put a monkey foot in a 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
 tripod and also for even for 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.890
 hold it like I'm doing it 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.870
 now I pulse so I can do 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.460
 photographs with him incorporated as not 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.400
 It could also be otherwise 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.770
 the vc system in order to have a 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.480
 built-in optical stabilizer and good 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.000
 all he will allow is to photograph 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.090
 even freehand with a 600 millimeter to 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.090
 reasonably slow speeds and that 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.550
 do not have the feeling of moving photo is 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.530
 Another advantage I see you 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.720
 also incorporates a parasol that 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.240
 It is also imposing a bit to the 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.650
 size of what is the lens here what 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.630
 you have mounted and the truth is that with 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.190
 this aspect already then aspect of 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.710
 paparazzi we can get to have all 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.660
 but good I insist features 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.270
 fundamentals very fast approach 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.920
 a price more than content and memory 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.590
 one thousand 99 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.560
 euros 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.750
 with 600 mm the diaphragm with the 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.180
 who works can not all have a 5 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.400
 with 6 with 3 the diaphragm that we had already 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.500
 in other brands and it's a diaphragm that 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.630
 taking into account the latitude with the 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.520
 that the machines of today work 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.170
 I think it's not going to be an impediment to 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.230
 that we can photograph with him under 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.120
 any circumstance if to those those 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.340
 high that we can work the 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.080
 machines we add the stabilizer 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.990
 image, I think that even for 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.520
 photograph with him without any kind of 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.290
 external help can not be a tripod a 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.990
 monkey foot then we can have that 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.960
 possibility as it is also being 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.640
 usual in the brand the goal always 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.170
 that is an official import will have 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.720
 five-year warranty once the 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.640
 register on the page of so rom with 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.980
 which is another spur to say 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.420
 give us a peace of mind regarding the 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.490
 security that manufacturers have 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.410
 last times to get then 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.330
 let's say a good glasses with a 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.560
 extraordinary optical performance and 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.930
 over with the tranquility of a 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.320
 so extremely high guarantee of these 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.660
 five years have just come already in fact 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.330
 we have more demand than possibility of 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.370
 try to retain some unit 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.259
 of those that we already have sold so that 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.060
 if you want of course to come and try it 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.340
 with your cameras are happy to 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.810
 to be able to serve you here in person and good 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.000
 You already know that our online store 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.770
 you can make any kind of purchase 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.439
 consult that you need I am your 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.909
 disposition and nothing we will see in the 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:54.169
 next video I hope you liked it 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:54.169
 until next time
