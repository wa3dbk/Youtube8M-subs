00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello everyone today got me that 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.840
 the little thing is called white computer 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.509
 Well, how would the on-board computer call 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.660
 for some reason its cycle computer is so 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.660
 simple 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:33.800
 it is considered an onboard computer 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:38.030
 let's see what's inside the sachets 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:44.910
 why not happen to them 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:47.420
 sides respectively onboard 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.420
 computer 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.050
 so here we look here already rampage on 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.409
 he looks like two to me 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.409
 buttons 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.670
 Well, almost the model by the way forgot to say 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:18.820
 called both for that is like 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:21.329
 sorry my english axis will show how 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:27.460
 here the model is not written 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:33.100
 called strongly and s820 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:38.709
 i.e. the most advanced model i.e. 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:44.610
 if that's a look at the side wall of the 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:49.119
 there is now it turns out the teams have 820 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.479
 It turns out 2 left column dots 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:56.079
 there are dots everywhere there that is if on 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.659
 there are no other models of action movies 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:03.280
 here completely 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:07.560
 what possible functions would there be 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.210
 the most functional model 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.790
 here buttons respectively resad set 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.410
 combined with the calculation button can you 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.790
 all if there we need time 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:28.510
 set click on the set set 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:34.060
 what time do we need to rearrange again 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:42.370
 same fashion hours and minutes put up 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:44.760
 after 56 seconds when you put gets up 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.350
 to your place. 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:53.310
 it turns out nothing needs to be pressed there 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:56.860
 the time is remembered automatically 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.130
 so a brief overview can tell who 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.780
 interesting full review write 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:09.430
 I will definitely do it like this 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:15.360
 here is the mount with extension here as i 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.500
 I understand it is worth a bright in this world of physics 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:25.570
 i.e. mount 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:29.250
 when the onboard computer is dressed like this 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.610
 here it snaps into place 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.610
 contacts close 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:46.440
 This part is displayed on the plug with the sensor 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:53.310
 here here the mount here turns out 2 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:04:02.010
 screed 3 through 7 3 screed this subfolder 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:05.240
 rubber itself is such a usual one . 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:11.600
 beautifully annexed hard to see 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:15.720
 my camera is not so little 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.480
 meanwhile more or less understood in general 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.080
 polar is put on the needle and in at 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.080
 each pass 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:30.930
 hacks 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:36.750
 Carry speed shown kilometer 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.860
 what speed you drive that is very 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.340
 many features i still 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.270
 Now we will buy more in all really not 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.160
 figured out for him 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:51.660
 Anyone interested I will write if you write 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:55.820
 it will be interesting to someone to find out more 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.250
 be sure to take a detailed review and 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.440
 tell show stand 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:05.480
 bye everyone bye 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:09.590
 the channel will be much more interesting 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.590
 see you soon
