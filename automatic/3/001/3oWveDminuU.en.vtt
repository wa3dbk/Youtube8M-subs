00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.950
 for SUVs I have long been special 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.719
 feeling like these cars like 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.730
 can not be better suited for movement 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.769
 in our country and how to sleep us 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.839
 routes and directions which 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.029
 the roads can not be called myself for five years 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.800
 I own an SUV and change 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.330
 I do not want it therefore do not make a review 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.699
 updated on uaz patriot 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.680
 we just couldn't but check it out 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.750
 in various road modes as well 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.060
 combine business with pleasure we will go 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.369
 on patriot for apples of course in 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.930
 Lebedyansky district where you can still go 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.930
 Lipetsk region for apples 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.980
 UAZ car legendary it happened that 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.110
 from the very beginning of the brand 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.060
 cars did not make for a simple life 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.460
 all modifications were intended for 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.470
 feats warrior rescue overcome 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.650
 road laying and the harvest battle 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.960
 it was always like this but the situation has changed 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.659
 UAZ patriot especially updated him 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.670
 version is no longer a tank and no trench on wheels 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.770
 now it's really a car for 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.450
 life while the designers were able to 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.450
 keep the best of the Soviet 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.880
 jeep passability and indestructibility vas 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.280
 patriot first off the line in 2005 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.240
 year it was a fundamentally new model 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.970
 modern comfortable 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.860
 SUV over the past eight years 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.899
 the car was constantly upgraded but 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.060
 dramatic changes only occurred 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.130
 now in order external changes 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.050
 parking sensors are almost invisible 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.420
 LED cilia headlights 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.580
 but inside the first thing that throws in 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.590
 eyes updated torpedo panel 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.000
 looks nicer former foundation softer 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.920
 coating with a nice texture 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.229
 the quality of the mating parts is much 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.640
 better trauma increased sake 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.579
 this had to remove the rail from 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.560
 passenger side 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.329
 the role has also changed is missing only 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.459
 airbag however designer 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.019
 promises that they will soon appear along with 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.610
 steering wheel covers replaced 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.470
 switches control module 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.780
 lighting and lining racks 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.280
 the windshield is completely different and 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.590
 air conditioning control panel 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.480
 automatically acts faster softer yes 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.459
 and the climate system itself is different 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.680
 standard equipment patriot 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.430
 now 2din new radio cassette ural both on 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.230

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.150
 by phone glove box connector under 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.760
 yusb completely replaced door trim 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.530
 They are softer, more elegant and lighter than the previous ones. 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.780
 armrest passenger drivers 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.310
 power window buttons in 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.040
 searching for apples we came to the village 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.380
 the troek farm of 15 years of October and 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.450
 immediately headed to the intense gardens and 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.060
 the trees here are low in height 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.200
 but our disappointment gave the apples removed 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.489
 a month ago 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.680
 and check off-road performance 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.540
 patriot also did not work gardens 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.400
 asphalted driveways in search 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.890
 off-road and apples go gardens 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.349
 there is no old planting of apples either 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.400
 removed for the fact that she is off-road 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.760
 connect the front axle 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.760
 forward 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.379
 updated uaz patriot saved 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.150
 loyalty to the old school 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.040
 front axle still connects 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.540
 rigidly driving off-road 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.730
 potential assigned to large 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.109

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.390
 gear lever 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.189
 the emergence of such krutilki became possible 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.450
 thanks to the new import handout 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.239
 production korea 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.989
 levers lost and traction characteristics 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.359
 improved gear ratio 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.950
 downshift now is 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.810
 2.56 instead of the previous 1.94 connection 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.629
 front axle possible at speeds up to 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.670
 60 kilometers per hour but to turn on 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.859
 downshift need to stop 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.230
 translate lever spinning transmits 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:56.169
 neutral position turn the puck on 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.819
 4l survive clutch still wait three 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:01.030
 four seconds and only after that 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.220
 the low creep of the UAZ turns on 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.260
 improved dramatically on steep slopes 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.359
 UAZ patriot scrambles not easy 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.310
 sure you can not touch the pedal 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.139
 accelerator SUV will continue 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.909
 crawl to the top of the lift at idle 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.430
 it is better to gasp regularly 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.109
 so that the engine does not stall otherwise otherwise 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.510
 start the car down again 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.459
 transfer is disabled peculiar protection 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.409
 fool with the new Korean razdatkoy 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.100
 patriot got another unprecedented 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:28.950
 hitherto option silence in the cabin 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.780
 forget about cleaning the rumble vibration 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.430
 In general, all that has long been considered 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.230
 integral attribute of the product 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.490
 Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant, especially 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.190
 change busy switching 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.440
 downshifts and now mode 40 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.190
 can only be identified by indication on 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.040
 instrument panels 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.440
 patriot 2014 model year 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.450
 cross-frame other configuration 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.220
 rear cardan lost intermediate 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.050
 supports and differs in length from its 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.240
 predecessor therefore put 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.550
 razdatku old-style new car 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.440
 not possible due to the emergence of a new 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.030
 razdatke changed the parking brake design 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.980
 before patriot equipped 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.990
 transmission hand brake that is 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.860
 separate drum lock interlocks 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.690
 driveshaft 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.670
 however, the subscriber slowed down 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.930
 only one wheel which was better 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.150
 associated with dear reason for that 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.250
 differential now ropes affect 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.300
 directly to brake drums 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.700
 rear wheels 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.190
 and marketers put together a sensible 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.590
 winter package for 9 13 thousand rubles 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.180
 depending on the chosen configuration 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.470
 the owner of the Ulyanovsk flagship will receive 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.930
 heated front seats 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.270
 high- capacity battery heating 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.440
 windshield and separate stove 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.690
 for rear passengers 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.310
 if it were a smartphone one could 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.650
 say that the patriot has become much 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.600
 friendlier to the user it certainly is not 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.550
 crossover handling native car 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.620
 far from the crazy fellow but no longer 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.700
 kondovy SUV for hunting enthusiasts 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.980
 and fishing 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.320
 apples we eventually found in stock 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.280
 farms in 15 years of October and here we 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.140
 very useful 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.140
 Patriot's spacious trunk 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.800
 the trunk of a patriot they just 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.000
 roomy it is so huge apples 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.000
 can lead a lot 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.260
 of course we drove on a patriot at all 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.870
 but even a little 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.630
 this run was enough for us to understand 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.790
 that the new version of the all-terrain vehicle is better and 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.770
 safer previous and if you consider the price 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.840
 agree that a large frame 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.970
 SUV sure to have bumps 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.980
 any caliber for half a million rubles this 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.660
 very interesting offer at 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.220
 least for those who are often enough 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.680
 have to drive on rough roads 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.580
 Russian hinterland, and once in a while but 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.580
 go off-road
