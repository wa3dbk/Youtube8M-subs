whether it is offensive or defensive
what<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.620> also<00:02:45.890> recommend<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.820> use

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
what I also recommend is to use

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.880 
what I also recommend is to use

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
different routes than others it's

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.100

following you this is a really big
advantage<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.430> know<00:03:52.610> what<00:03:53.120> can<00:03:53.299> be<00:03:53.480> very

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
advantage to know what can be very

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.780 
advantage to know what can be very
useful<00:03:53.870> as<00:03:54.440> well<00:03:54.650> as<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.040> kneel<00:03:55.220> down<00:03:55.489> while

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
useful as well as the kneel down while

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.850 
useful as well as the kneel down while
shooting<00:03:56.120> because<00:03:56.690> Danny<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.470> weapons

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
shooting because Danny the weapons

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.190 
shooting because Danny the weapons
deviation<00:03:58.400> will<00:03:58.610> decrease<00:03:59.120> slightly<00:03:59.299> and<00:03:59.840> it

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
deviation will decrease slightly and it

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.350 
deviation will decrease slightly and it
can<00:04:00.410> be<00:04:00.440> confusing<00:04:00.860> for<00:04:01.340> other<00:04:01.700> players<00:04:02.090> who

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
can be confusing for other players who

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.410 
can be confusing for other players who
aim<00:04:02.570> on<00:04:02.840> your<00:04:02.870> head<00:04:03.790> ok<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:04.820> think<00:04:05.030> that's

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
aim on your head ok I think that's

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.210 
aim on your head ok I think that's
enough<00:04:05.600> otherwise<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.680> can<00:04:06.920> start

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
enough otherwise that I can start

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.070 
enough otherwise that I can start
talking<00:04:07.489> about<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.209> weapons<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:08.720> equipment
