bubbles on top I've actually found that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.090 
bubbles on top I've actually found that
doing<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.200> way<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.590> better<00:00:43.739> than<00:00:43.980> doing

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
doing it this way is better than doing

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.580 
doing it this way is better than doing
it<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.460> oven<00:00:44.789> now<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:46.200> obviously

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it in the oven now I do it's obviously

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.510 
it in the oven now I do it's obviously
better<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> tandoor<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:48.410> if<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:50.309> don't

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
better in a tandoor but if you don't

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.700 
better in a tandoor but if you don't
have<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.719> wanted<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> try<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
have one then wanted to try it on the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.350 
have one then wanted to try it on the
pan<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> does<00:00:53.430> work<00:00:53.579> very<00:00:53.789> well<00:00:53.850> let's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
pan because it does work very well let's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.389 
pan because it does work very well let's
see<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.020> closer<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.559> there<00:00:55.710> now<00:00:55.829> see
