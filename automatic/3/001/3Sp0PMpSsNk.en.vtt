and they're so easy to use they're quick

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.240 
and they're so easy to use they're quick
and<00:00:40.890> convenient<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.850> not<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.570> all<00:00:42.750> messy<00:00:43.250> this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and convenient and not at all messy this

and convenient and not at all messy this
film<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.820> about<00:00:44.970> machine<00:00:45.629> use<00:00:45.960> dyes<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.890> just

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
film is about machine use dyes you just

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.860 
film is about machine use dyes you just
pop<00:00:47.400> them<00:00:47.580> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.790> machine<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.330> they<00:00:48.809> do

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
pop them in the machine and they do

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.500 
pop them in the machine and they do
their<00:00:49.199> work<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:50.190> you'll<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:51.330> don't

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
their work and as you'll see they don't

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.200 
their work and as you'll see they don't
harm<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> machine<00:00:52.350> or<00:00:52.680> any<00:00:53.309> fabrics<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.120> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
harm the machine or any fabrics that you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.930 
harm the machine or any fabrics that you
wash<00:00:54.420> afterwards<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:56.100> results<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.820> depend

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
wash afterwards the results will depend

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.400 
wash afterwards the results will depend
on<00:00:57.239> three<00:00:57.540> things

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
on three things

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.189 
on three things
the<00:00:58.739> type<00:00:59.040> of<00:00:59.070> fabric<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.150> weight<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.720> fabric

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the type of fabric the weight of fabric

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.560 
the type of fabric the weight of fabric
and<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.710> color<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.489> fabric<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.299> use

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and the color of the fabric that you use

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.050 
and the color of the fabric that you use
so<00:01:04.229> let's<00:01:04.409> begin<00:01:04.589> by<00:01:04.830> considering<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.700> type

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
so let's begin by considering the type

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.410 
so let's begin by considering the type
of<00:01:06.090> fabric<00:01:07.070> cotton<00:01:08.070> linen<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.460> viscose<00:01:08.970> will

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.359 
of fabric cotton linen and viscose will
all<00:01:09.630> work<00:01:09.900> exceptionally<00:01:10.500> well<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.220> give

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
all work exceptionally well and give

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.340 
all work exceptionally well and give
absolutely<00:01:11.970> great<00:01:12.390> results<00:01:12.930> or<00:01:13.049> something

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
absolutely great results or something

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.289 
absolutely great results or something
like<00:01:13.440> this<00:01:13.799> which<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.670> hundred<00:01:15.030> percent

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
like this which is a hundred percent

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.539 
like this which is a hundred percent
pure<00:01:15.630> cotton<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:16.650> give<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> perfect<00:01:17.400> result

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
pure cotton will give a perfect result

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.090 
pure cotton will give a perfect result
mixes<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.479> these<00:01:18.659> fabrics<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.320> synthetics

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
mixes of these fabrics with synthetics

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.820

such<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.460> polyester<00:01:21.210> or<00:01:21.330> acrylic<00:01:22.229> will<00:01:22.710> give

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
such as polyester or acrylic will give

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
such as polyester or acrylic will give
much<00:01:23.040> lighter<00:01:23.490> results<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.720> synthetics

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
much lighter results as the synthetics

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.740 
much lighter results as the synthetics

the weight each pack of machined I will
dye<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.689> 600<00:01:43.619> grams<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.219> fabric<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.909> the

or<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.549> couple<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.299> shirts<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:52.140> dye<00:01:52.320> larger

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
or a couple of shirts to dye larger

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.069 
or a couple of shirts to dye larger
amounts<00:01:53.249> of<00:01:53.340> fabrics<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:53.999> use<00:01:54.479> multiple

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
amounts of fabrics just use multiple

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.230 
amounts of fabrics just use multiple
packs<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.770> remember<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.850> leave<00:01:56.969> enough<00:01:57.210> room

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
packs just remember to leave enough room

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
packs just remember to leave enough room
in<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.749> machine<00:01:58.109> to<00:01:58.350> let<00:01:58.499> the<00:01:58.649> fabric<00:01:58.859> move

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
in the machine to let the fabric move

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.880 
in the machine to let the fabric move
around<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.259> finally<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.469> need<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> think

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
around and finally you need to think

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.559 
around and finally you need to think
about<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> color<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.759> your<00:02:02.999> fabric<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
about the color of your fabric and

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.499 
about the color of your fabric and
remember<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.439> color<00:02:04.890> mixing<00:02:05.429> rules<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
remember the color mixing rules if you

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.900 
remember the color mixing rules if you
want<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.810> dye<00:02:06.929> something<00:02:07.380> red<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> blue

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
want to dye something red with a blue

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.630 
want to dye something red with a blue
dye<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.630> will<00:02:10.080> give<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> purple<00:02:10.979> result<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
dye it will give a purple result and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.940 
dye it will give a purple result and
remember<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.660> dye<00:02:12.840> won't<00:02:13.140> always<00:02:13.350> cover<00:02:13.770> up

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
remember the dye won't always cover up

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.330 
remember the dye won't always cover up
patterns<00:02:14.520> they<00:02:15.150> may<00:02:15.420> still<00:02:15.720> show<00:02:15.750> through

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
patterns they may still show through

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.309 
patterns they may still show through
also<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.180> want<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.480> dye<00:02:18.780> something<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.290> a

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
also if you want to dye something to a

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.710 
also if you want to dye something to a
lighter<00:02:19.710> shade<00:02:19.920> or<00:02:20.340> another<00:02:20.910> strong<00:02:21.330> color

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
lighter shade or another strong color

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.920 
lighter shade or another strong color
you<00:02:22.350> can<00:02:22.530> always<00:02:22.710> use<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.310> dial<00:02:23.730> on<00:02:23.910> pre<00:02:24.300> dye<00:02:24.569> and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
you can always use a dial on pre dye and
