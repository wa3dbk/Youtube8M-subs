different parts of your robot what does
what<00:00:50.809> well<00:00:51.739> this<00:00:52.100> is<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.520> main<00:00:52.790> brain

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
what well this is the main brain

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.369 
what well this is the main brain
basically<00:00:54.290> this<00:00:54.739> tells<00:00:55.720> what<00:00:56.720> all<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.230> other

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
so I'll show you all this from the start

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.719 
so I'll show you all this from the start
to<00:01:05.690> beginning<00:01:06.050> all<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.440> parts<00:01:06.800> here's<00:01:07.550> the

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
to beginning all the parts here's the

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.180 
to beginning all the parts here's the
touch<00:01:07.940> sensor<00:01:08.479> when<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.869> touch<00:01:09.110> it<00:01:09.190> it

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
touch sensor when you touch it it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:29.980 
touch sensor when you touch it it
obviously<00:01:10.640> reacts<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.300> air<00:01:29.450> will<00:01:29.660> break

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
obviously reacts and the air will break

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.540 
obviously reacts and the air will break
in<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.679> top<00:01:30.920> spins

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
in the top spins

I like that blade boys then you have a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.550 
I like that blade boys then you have a
light<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:36.710> there<00:01:36.860> too<00:01:37.039> what<00:01:37.250> does<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.399> do

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
light in there too what does that do

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.150 
light in there too what does that do
that<00:01:39.560> kind<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:39.979> tells<00:01:40.220> people<00:01:40.880> uh<00:01:41.740> what<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.950> do

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
that kind of tells people uh what to do

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.040
