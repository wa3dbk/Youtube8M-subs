00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 ah 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.650
 hello everyone I bring you another one of the myths 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.720
 blank are the zombies on the map of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.010
 trÃ nsit and good in this game was 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.660
 with porsche as you are seeing we are 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.660
 in the village area what would be the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.810
 Village map is worth and good enough 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.550
 time that people commented was said 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.040
 that this door could be opened 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.500
 that door that is there just gives 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.449
 what is the inside of the bowling la 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.710
 bowling is here is worth it in 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.660
 theory is one of the answers the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.260
 zombies out there the zombies enter the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.330
 map is worth it so the normal thing is that there 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.540
 we can not be there can not be there 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.570
 so in theory there is no 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.920
 way to get in there just with a hack 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.750
 like the one we have, it's worth 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.120
 we can not have good mother for not 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.589
 die and we also have the notary 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.449
 so that the barrier of death does not 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.979
 kill now you are going to see what then 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.650
 teleports me in voucher we are 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.270
 in here and apparently it seems that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.600
 if you can be here but not really 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.400
 actually here if we enter without 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.500
 use the boot mode and the notary 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.780
 that could kill us we would be 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.070
 dead in here, okay, I do not know why 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.750
 people insist on saying that they 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.820
 can enter sites as is 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.250
 knowing that he is a responds the zombies and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.200
 never in life in any of the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.570
 call of duty games are those of the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.640
 zombies you could get into none 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.560
 of the respondents in a responds 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.270
 you die if you did a normal trick and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.340
 current in the game you do a trick and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.380
 there you get in here in some of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.200
 the ways you would die is worth it because it is 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.910
 I answered the replies moore is good 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.380
 say that what we are with the with 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.330
 we bother with him not target so he does not 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.619
 they kill us and you are seeing good that we 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.300
 we give here a round but not 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.030
 there is nothing there 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.310
 the most obvious thing to know apart from that 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.080
 they kill us as you are seeing we can 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.620
 go through what are the heaps these 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.410
 of moon that there is no debris here 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.030
 We can go through these debris and 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.260
 Well that already indicates that here is 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.900
 impossible to enter not 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.180
 already first they kill us, it's worth to enter 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.040
 but if there was some way to 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.420
 deactivate that they will kill us or 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.220
 doing some mystery or anything 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.660
 neither could do because as 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.950
 you are seeing as we go through things 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.020
 and when we go through things, it's 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.090
 here you can not be worth it so neither 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.500
 my cousin or my friend or nobody has entered 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.300
 in the bowling alley because you can not enter 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.190
 you can only enter with a hack like the 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.710
 that we have a ps3 worth 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.300
 text and with the teleport and the good mode and 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.520
 the noticing that it must be the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.230
 three things, otherwise, it's not worth it, so 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.820
 nothing is simply this was so that 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.100
 you see a little bit what is the bowling 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.890
 inside that there is a piece and I know 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.800
 said it was a meteorite I said that 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.480
 not that it was a piece of rocket know 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.670
 we do not know what it is really gives me 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.200
 maybe that's not the case, it's not for 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.720
 you see a little how is this inside 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.550
 and little else no more history is worth it 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.070
 that nothing for people who say that about 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.870
 that here you can enter yes and that 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.550
 here inside there is me that I know the story 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.080
 that are invented here you can not enter 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.370
 so nothing is simply this I hope 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.709
 that you liked those two if you have 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.240
 liked boots I like and favorites and we 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.510
 we see in the next video greetings to 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.510
 everyone 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.459
 I 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.930
 yes 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.790
 yes
