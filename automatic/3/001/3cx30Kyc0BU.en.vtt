the other side I try to get that pin in

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.040 
the other side I try to get that pin in
the<00:02:33.670> bottom<00:02:34.000> half<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.510> circle<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:35.020> the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
the bottom half of the circle in the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:49.830 
the bottom half of the circle in the
mechanism<00:02:35.620> first<00:02:47.670> alright<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:48.910> once<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.330> pins

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
mechanism first alright so once the pins

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.360 
mechanism first alright so once the pins
are<00:02:50.020> locked<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.380> both<00:02:50.530> sides<00:02:50.770> make<00:02:51.070> sure<00:02:51.100> that

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
are locked on both sides make sure that

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.640 
are locked on both sides make sure that
this<00:02:51.580> opens<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.690> closes<00:02:52.930> easily<00:02:55.170> ok<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.230> right

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
this opens and closes easily ok so right

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.610 
this opens and closes easily ok so right
now<00:02:56.800> we<00:02:56.860> have<00:02:56.980> one<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.720> one<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.990> tear

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
now we have one of the one of the tear

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.620 
now we have one of the one of the tear
off<00:02:59.770> strips<00:03:00.070> in<00:03:00.280> place<00:03:00.610> right<00:03:00.910> now<00:03:01.150> okay<00:03:01.570> so

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
off strips in place right now okay so

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.020 
off strips in place right now okay so
the<00:03:02.620> only<00:03:02.650> thing<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.100> haven't<00:03:03.340> done<00:03:03.610> is

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
the only thing that I haven't done is

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.949 
the only thing that I haven't done is
tape<00:03:04.810> put<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.620> little<00:03:05.830> bit<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:06.100> clear<00:03:06.400> tape

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
tape put a little bit of clear tape

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.650 
tape put a little bit of clear tape
under<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.380> corners<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:09.910> all<00:03:10.180> four<00:03:10.450> corners

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
under the corners on all four corners

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.880 
under the corners on all four corners
kind<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.140> where<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.380> swamp

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
kind of where the swamp

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.040 
kind of where the swamp
Swami<00:03:12.280> logo<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.150> then<00:03:13.240> directly<00:03:13.630> below<00:03:13.870> it

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
Swami logo is and then directly below it

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.380 
Swami logo is and then directly below it
and<00:03:14.350> then<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.760> end

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
and then the end

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.390 
and then the end
I'm<00:03:17.230> sure<00:03:17.410> if<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.530> can<00:03:17.709> see<00:03:17.860> this<00:03:17.920> really<00:03:18.190> well

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
I'm sure if you can see this really well

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.810 
I'm sure if you can see this really well
but<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:19.300> tear-offs<00:03:19.690> turf<00:03:19.900> has<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.170> little

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
but the tear-offs turf has a little

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.940 
but the tear-offs turf has a little
slack<00:03:21.820> on<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.390> right<00:03:22.780> side<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:23.590> what<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:23.830> can

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
slack on the right side and what you can

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.160 
slack on the right side and what you can
do<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.160> fold<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.580> over<00:03:24.640> just<00:03:25.390> behind<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.870> pin

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
do is fold that over just behind the pin

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.150 
do is fold that over just behind the pin
and<00:03:27.300> tape<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.900> this<00:03:29.200> will<00:03:29.410> kind<00:03:29.590> of<00:03:29.709> act<00:03:29.890> as

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
and tape it and this will kind of act as

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.720 
and tape it and this will kind of act as
like<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.840> thick<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:32.050> thicker<00:03:32.470> portion<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:33.430> grab

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
like a thick a thicker portion to grab

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.430 
like a thick a thicker portion to grab
it'll<00:03:34.090> stick<00:03:34.330> out<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.540> little<00:03:34.630> bit<00:03:34.959> so<00:03:35.200> when<00:03:35.350> you

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
it'll stick out a little bit so when you

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.650 
it'll stick out a little bit so when you
need<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.680> pull<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:35.980> off<00:03:36.130> during<00:03:36.510> while<00:03:37.510> you're

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
need to pull it off during while you're

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.500 
need to pull it off during while you're
writing<00:03:37.870> it'll<00:03:38.290> be<00:03:38.380> easy<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.680> find<00:03:39.300> so<00:03:40.300> the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
writing it'll be easy to find so the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.850 
writing it'll be easy to find so the
second<00:03:40.900> one<00:03:40.959> that<00:03:41.140> we're<00:03:41.380> gonna<00:03:41.470> put<00:03:41.739> on

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
second one that we're gonna put on

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.130 
second one that we're gonna put on
obviously<00:03:42.760> this<00:03:42.970> one<00:03:43.150> there's<00:03:43.420> two<00:03:43.660> sides<00:03:43.930> of

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
obviously this one there's two sides of

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.330 
obviously this one there's two sides of
protective<00:03:44.820> coating<00:03:45.820> inside<00:03:46.500> packaging<00:03:47.500> ones

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
protective coating inside packaging ones

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.789 
protective coating inside packaging ones
one<00:03:48.820> side<00:03:49.060> is<00:03:49.180> green<00:03:49.390> and<00:03:49.690> one<00:03:49.840> side<00:03:50.080> is<00:03:50.200> clear

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
one side is green and one side is clear

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.850 
one side is green and one side is clear
okay<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:52.200> here's<00:03:53.200> what<00:03:53.440> they<00:03:53.590> look<00:03:53.799> like<00:03:55.860> like

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
okay and here's what they look like like

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.039 
okay and here's what they look like like
I<00:03:56.980> said<00:03:57.250> one<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.700> green<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.269> one<00:03:58.420> is<00:03:58.570> clear

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
I said one is green and one is clear

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.780 
I said one is green and one is clear
okay<00:03:59.470> so<00:03:59.530> make<00:03:59.860> sure<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.130> get<00:04:00.250> both<00:04:00.489> of<00:04:00.519> those

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
okay so make sure you get both of those

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.449 
okay so make sure you get both of those
off<00:04:01.350> it'll<00:04:02.350> be<00:04:02.410> pretty<00:04:02.590> obvious<00:04:03.040> when<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.280> put

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
off it'll be pretty obvious when you put

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.000 
off it'll be pretty obvious when you put
it<00:04:03.580> on<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.450> it's<00:04:04.900> really<00:04:05.260> foggy<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.890> you

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
it on it and it's really foggy that you

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.560 
it on it and it's really foggy that you
didn't<00:04:06.310> get<00:04:06.400> both<00:04:06.580> of<00:04:06.610> them<00:04:06.910> off<00:04:07.060> but<00:04:07.330> they're

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
didn't get both of them off but they're

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.009 
didn't get both of them off but they're
both<00:04:07.810> extremely<00:04:08.140> thin<00:04:08.680> layers<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.540> hard<00:04:10.540> and

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
both extremely thin layers and hard and

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.630 
both extremely thin layers and hard and
hard<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.940> see<00:04:12.940> okay<00:04:13.660> so<00:04:14.410> this<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.310> tear<00:04:15.519> off

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
hard to see okay so this the tear off

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.630 
hard to see okay so this the tear off
strip<00:04:15.850> itself<00:04:16.180> has<00:04:16.510> one<00:04:16.900> side<00:04:17.109> is<00:04:17.459> curved<00:04:18.459> a

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
strip itself has one side is curved a

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.009 
strip itself has one side is curved a
little<00:04:18.880> bit<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.180> other<00:04:19.359> side<00:04:19.600> is<00:04:19.750> flat

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
little bit and the other side is flat

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.380 
little bit and the other side is flat
but<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.010> flat<00:04:21.250> side<00:04:21.519> is<00:04:21.669> gonna<00:04:21.820> go<00:04:22.000> on<00:04:22.030> top

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
but the flat side is gonna go on top

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.360 
but the flat side is gonna go on top
okay<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.110> you'll<00:04:23.440> want<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.680> pull<00:04:23.950> off<00:04:24.100> the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
okay so you'll want to pull off the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.270 
okay so you'll want to pull off the
bottom<00:04:24.729> layer<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.210> on<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.289> second<00:04:26.770> on<00:04:26.979> the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
bottom layer and on the second on the

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.240 
bottom layer and on the second on the
second

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
second

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.370 
second
and<00:04:28.340> or<00:04:28.730> third<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.360> final<00:04:29.810> however<00:04:30.050> many

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
and or third and final however many

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.140 
and or third and final however many
layers<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.860> put<00:04:31.070> on<00:04:31.480> I'll<00:04:32.950> leave<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.280> top<00:04:34.550> one

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
layers you put on I'll leave the top one

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.530 
layers you put on I'll leave the top one
on<00:04:35.480> until<00:04:36.170> I<00:04:36.200> go<00:04:36.500> out<00:04:36.710> so<00:04:37.010> kind<00:04:37.430> of<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.700> it

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
on until I go out so kind of the it

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.000 
on until I go out so kind of the it
doesn't<00:04:38.900> get<00:04:39.020> contaminated<00:04:39.230> with

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
doesn't get contaminated with

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.110 
doesn't get contaminated with
fingerprints<00:04:40.910> or<00:04:42.220> or<00:04:43.220> dirt<00:04:43.550> or<00:04:43.670> anything<00:04:43.910> like

fingerprints or or dirt or anything like
that<00:04:44.180> okay<00:04:44.660> so<00:04:45.140> you'll<00:04:45.590> separate<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.190> just

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
that okay so you'll separate it just

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.440 
that okay so you'll separate it just
like<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.580> sticker<00:04:47.200> peel<00:04:48.200> off<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.680> bottom<00:04:51.310> okay

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
like a sticker peel off the bottom okay

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.120 
like a sticker peel off the bottom okay
this<00:04:53.450> is<00:04:53.600> very<00:04:53.630> kind<00:04:54.140> I<00:04:54.170> want<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.530> be<00:04:54.740> careful

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
this is very kind I want to be careful

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.260 
this is very kind I want to be careful
with<00:04:55.250> your<00:04:55.340> fingers<00:04:55.730> make<00:04:55.940> sure<00:04:56.090> that

okay blue yellow just access the pin

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:08.890 
okay blue yellow just access the pin
area<00:05:02.780> it'll<00:05:03.020> just<00:05:03.200> kind<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:03.680> push<00:05:04.100> on<00:05:06.580> a<00:05:07.900> finger

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
area it'll just kind of push on a finger

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.500 
area it'll just kind of push on a finger
around<00:05:08.990> it<00:05:09.290> okay<00:05:09.880> and<00:05:10.880> you'll<00:05:11.090> run<00:05:11.300> this

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
around it okay and you'll run this

around it okay and you'll run this
around<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.419> other<00:05:14.510> side<00:05:15.669> you<00:05:16.669> have<00:05:16.700> to

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
around to the other side you have to

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.900 
around to the other side you have to
pull<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.240> little<00:05:17.450> bit<00:05:17.570> of<00:05:17.720> tension<00:05:18.610> and<00:05:19.610> play

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
pull a little bit of tension and play

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.600 
pull a little bit of tension and play
with<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.240> lineup<00:05:20.770> so<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:21.980> it<00:05:22.100> kind<00:05:22.310> of<00:05:22.370> hits

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
with the lineup so that it kind of hits

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.100 
with the lineup so that it kind of hits
in<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:22.880> right<00:05:23.060> spot<00:05:23.360> I<00:05:23.390> already<00:05:23.690> have<00:05:23.840> one

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
in the right spot I already have one

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.640 
in the right spot I already have one
down<00:05:24.500> so<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:25.010> guess<00:05:25.190> works<00:05:25.460> kind<00:05:25.760> of<00:05:25.820> out

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
down so the guess works kind of out

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.120 
down so the guess works kind of out
there<00:05:27.650> we<00:05:27.740> go

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.400 

perfect<00:05:34.220> so<00:05:35.030> both<00:05:35.270> of<00:05:35.300> these<00:05:35.570> will<00:05:35.780> be<00:05:35.810> folded

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
perfect so both of these will be folded

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.159 
perfect so both of these will be folded
and<00:05:36.590> taped<00:05:36.650> down<00:05:37.400> at<00:05:37.729> the<00:05:37.880> end<00:05:38.060> both<00:05:38.810> of<00:05:39.050> them

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
and taped down at the end both of them

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.920 
and taped down at the end both of them
will<00:05:39.320> be<00:05:39.350> folded<00:05:39.919> and<00:05:40.400> page<00:05:41.030> so<00:05:41.390> be<00:05:41.660> pretty

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
will be folded and page so be pretty

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.920 
will be folded and page so be pretty
it'll<00:05:42.830> be<00:05:42.919> a<00:05:43.190> little<00:05:43.970> bit<00:05:44.210> of<00:05:44.360> space<00:05:44.900> between

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
it'll be a little bit of space between

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.070 
it'll be a little bit of space between
them<00:05:47.080> you<00:05:48.080> can<00:05:48.110> see<00:05:48.500> right<00:05:48.710> here<00:05:49.750> both<00:05:50.750> of<00:05:50.780> them

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
them you can see right here both of them

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.880 
them you can see right here both of them
okay<00:05:51.229> one<00:05:51.800> two<00:05:52.990> all<00:05:53.990> right<00:05:54.169> so<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.500> top<00:05:54.710> one

bubbles that you see or air space here

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.490 
bubbles that you see or air space here

anything that holds it down just a the
tension<00:06:12.080> from<00:06:12.440> from<00:06:12.950> pin<00:06:13.190> to<00:06:13.310> pin<00:06:13.520> or<00:06:14.419> and<00:06:14.810> then

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
tension from from pin to pin or and then

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.100 
tension from from pin to pin or and then
kind<00:06:15.470> of<00:06:15.530> it<00:06:15.710> forms<00:06:16.520> like<00:06:16.580> a<00:06:16.700> little<00:06:17.110> vacuum

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
much like a little vacuum there so

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.110 
much like a little vacuum there so
that'll<00:06:23.780> stay<00:06:24.050> on<00:06:24.460> and<00:06:25.460> then<00:06:25.610> peel<00:06:25.820> the<00:06:25.880> last

that'll stay on and then peel the last
went<00:06:26.330> off<00:06:26.830> and<00:06:27.830> then<00:06:28.370> the<00:06:28.580> four-corners<00:06:29.030> a

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
went off and then the four-corners a

went off and then the four-corners a
tape<00:06:29.570> and<00:06:29.900> then<00:06:30.200> you're<00:06:30.380> good<00:06:30.560> to<00:06:30.590> go<00:06:30.790> the<00:06:31.790> the

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
only thing that I can say is make sure

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.490 
only thing that I can say is make sure
that<00:06:34.220> your<00:06:34.540> shield<00:06:35.540> is<00:06:35.720> clean<00:06:36.140> underneath

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
that your shield is clean underneath

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.890 
that your shield is clean underneath
before<00:06:36.860> you<00:06:37.099> put<00:06:37.430> all<00:06:37.520> this<00:06:37.669> on<00:06:37.900> otherwise

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
before you put all this on otherwise

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.279 
before you put all this on otherwise
it's<00:06:39.200> kind<00:06:39.410> of<00:06:39.560> you<00:06:40.490> kind<00:06:40.669> of

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
it's kind of you kind of

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.920 
it's kind of you kind of
grind<00:06:41.499> these<00:06:41.759> with<00:06:42.759> the<00:06:42.939> pins<00:06:43.509> are<00:06:43.719> a<00:06:43.749> little

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
grind these with the pins are a little

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.609 
grind these with the pins are a little
abrasive<00:06:44.819> so<00:06:45.819> you<00:06:46.270> kind<00:06:46.539> of<00:06:46.599> ruin<00:06:47.439> them<00:06:47.589> a

00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:47.619 
abrasive so you kind of ruin them a

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:49.230 
abrasive so you kind of ruin them a
little<00:06:47.889> bit<00:06:48.099> if<00:06:48.279> you<00:06:48.339> take<00:06:48.639> them<00:06:48.789> on<00:06:48.909> and<00:06:49.180> off

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
little bit if you take them on and off

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.320 
little bit if you take them on and off
and<00:06:49.300> they<00:06:49.599> might<00:06:49.629> keep<00:06:50.589> a<00:06:50.860> really<00:06:51.330> really

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
and they might keep a really really

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.350 
and they might keep a really really
tight<00:06:52.569> tension<00:06:53.020> across<00:06:53.259> the<00:06:53.529> shield<00:06:54.119> so<00:06:55.119> after

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
tight tension across the shield so after

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.879 
tight tension across the shield so after
you<00:06:55.449> have<00:06:55.479> those<00:06:55.749> on<00:06:55.960> you<00:06:56.289> can<00:06:56.409> put<00:06:56.589> your<00:06:56.710> end

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:56.889 
you have those on you can put your end

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:02.730 
you have those on you can put your end
caps<00:06:57.129> back<00:06:57.460> on<00:07:00.779> these<00:07:01.779> are<00:07:02.050> you<00:07:02.229> might<00:07:02.529> have<00:07:02.619> to

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
caps back on these are you might have to

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.230 
caps back on these are you might have to
wrestle<00:07:02.979> with<00:07:03.219> these<00:07:03.369> a<00:07:03.430> little<00:07:03.699> bit<00:07:06.240> there

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
wrestle with these a little bit there

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:25.409 
wrestle with these a little bit there
you<00:07:07.270> go<00:07:18.839> second<00:07:19.839> lock<00:07:20.050> -<00:07:22.680> there<00:07:23.680> it<00:07:23.800> is<00:07:24.419> alright

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:25.419 
you go second lock - there it is alright

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:26.519 
you go second lock - there it is alright
so<00:07:25.719> there<00:07:25.959> it<00:07:26.080> is

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:26.529 
so there it is

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:33.179 
there's your explana accel shield change
and<00:07:30.159> tear<00:07:30.849> off<00:07:30.969> application<00:07:31.779> I<00:07:32.099> thought<00:07:33.099> it

00:07:33.179 --> 00:07:33.189 
and tear off application I thought it

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:36.119 
and tear off application I thought it
might<00:07:33.309> be<00:07:33.430> beneficial<00:07:33.610> just<00:07:34.270> to<00:07:34.389> show<00:07:35.099> some<00:07:36.099> of

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:36.129 
might be beneficial just to show some of

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:38.489 
might be beneficial just to show some of
the<00:07:36.279> bubbles<00:07:36.610> and<00:07:36.729> stuff<00:07:36.939> on<00:07:37.089> the<00:07:37.240> screen<00:07:37.629> you

00:07:38.489 --> 00:07:38.499 
the bubbles and stuff on the screen you

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:40.829 
the bubbles and stuff on the screen you
can't<00:07:38.740> see<00:07:39.009> them<00:07:39.219> on<00:07:39.309> them<00:07:39.459> from<00:07:40.240> the<00:07:40.330> inside

00:07:40.829 --> 00:07:40.839 
can't see them on them from the inside

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:44.040 
can't see them on them from the inside
of<00:07:40.869> the<00:07:41.169> shield<00:07:41.649> so<00:07:42.149> just<00:07:43.149> as<00:07:43.300> a<00:07:43.330> look<00:07:43.659> from<00:07:43.899> the

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.050 
of the shield so just as a look from the

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.939 
of the shield so just as a look from the
inside<00:07:45.870> actually<00:07:46.870> it<00:07:46.959> still<00:07:47.139> has<00:07:47.349> the<00:07:47.529> film<00:07:47.769> on

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:47.949 
inside actually it still has the film on

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:49.920 
inside actually it still has the film on
but<00:07:48.279> the<00:07:48.399> other<00:07:48.550> half<00:07:48.789> doesn't<00:07:49.029> so<00:07:49.629> you<00:07:49.719> can

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:49.930 
but the other half doesn't so you can

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.100 
but the other half doesn't so you can
definitely<00:07:50.289> see

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.110 

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:58.090 

that<00:07:54.110> there's<00:07:54.350> no<00:07:55.450> there's<00:07:56.450> no<00:07:56.540> real<00:07:57.100> trouble

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:58.100 
that there's no there's no real trouble

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:06.640 
that there's no there's no real trouble
with<00:07:58.250> the<00:07:58.370> bubble

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:06.650 

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.710
