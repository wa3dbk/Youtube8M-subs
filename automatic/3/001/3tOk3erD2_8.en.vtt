 but veteran in the mass' is no longer the only option 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.120
 transfer was the visa problem, it is a new program that facilitates 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.270
 too much copy of all settings matters 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.939
 it can be used to copy files from an old computer and put them in 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.150
 your new machine with windows vista 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.259
 many ways 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.259
 connecting with easy cable transfer by usb 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.210
 connecting the two machines to an ethernet network 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.810
 or backing up the psd before installing windows vista doctor 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.020
 using easy transfer 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.220
 you will still need to install your programs 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.300
 but that 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.440
 is much easier than trying to remember all your passwords and 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.170
 settings 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.230
 2 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 art 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.090

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.520
 before blow grille of preference 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.180
 in contrast the support / p neither by this and double click in means to this 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.310
 point this fire 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.110

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.780
 click me close close all to close all programs that are 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.320
 round 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.630
 then choose the method of data transfer 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.030
 the best is the traffic broth 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.230
 but it is difficult to find in Brazil 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.680
 the simplest solution is to accuse the cds 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 dvd other removable media 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.080
 case 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.620
 the transfer was 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.350
 You can use usb flash drives or a network hd to make overhead more 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.280
 you do not have any of them click cd 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.179
 it can be either the flavor 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.010
 or dvd 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.220
 I chose a dvd burner dvd from the list 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.179
 if you want to protect your files from the curious 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.159
 choose an access password 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.220
 not 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.219
 the promotion information that the transfer is will ask 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.570
 It's what you want to move. 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.220
 you can click on all user accounts files and settings 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.019
 to transfer everything 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.230
 but this can be many dvds to do more 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:22.299
 so click on advanced options to be a bit more selective 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:28.279
 you will see a list of all the groups of files and settings that 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.559
 the transference can hear 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.220
 the total size 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.950
 button is in the lower right corner of the screen, I have cleared the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.359
 items that are not really needed 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.909
 until they know that they have a reasonable number of david r 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:49.759
 you can add the pasture files to important vespers 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.659
 for not knowing with the virgin dvd in the drive 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.599
 click next 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.099
 with easy transfer 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.209
 copy the files and set up actions for the disk 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.299
 and will prompt you for a new disc if necessary 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.229
 not 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:07.319
 to participate 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.109
 So

 of users of the old system 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.249
 For example you were marta fisherman before 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.360
 but only put marten clovis 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.219
 so he'll ask which accounts 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:49.109

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.739
 click transfer 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.680
 and let the program do its work by swapping the disks 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.069
 when necessary 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.309
 I will 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:06.229
