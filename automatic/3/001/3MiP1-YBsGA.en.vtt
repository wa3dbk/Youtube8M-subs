00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.750
 this video that part of opinions 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.490
 and that the willingness to discuss 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.490
 below the comment have a good video 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.369
 Have you ever stopped to think about what your 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.119
 way to play Sunday fledes amends 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.789
 gameplay 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.099
 but after all what changes your mindset a 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.019
 game the most visible change would be the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.000
 role he plays in the game he does not 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.790
 we had more defensive players like 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.160
 a support for the most secondary gameplay 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.559
 already the aggressive players we see in 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.690
 of slots like tops breaking 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.910
 positions that always gain affection for the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.190
 High damage and number of fatalities 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.739
 players from gender roles and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.719
 says he can help other laws and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.170
 able to maintain greater control over 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.770
 Now let's look at each one more 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.000
 close 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.640
 starting with aggressive players 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 first these players have the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.020
 known problems within the goal 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.090
 fred are extremely offensive 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.280
 showing in their laws that normally 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.110
 are drawn to their enemy and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 rarely saved by eliminating any 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.610
 escape from January foe every mistake 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.920
 of his team is highlighted by the same with 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.020
 name - calling and rarely discouragement 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.299
 It's your fault and you're trying to do it. 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 aggressive and dangerous moves many 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.770
 times alone resulting in his death 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.439
 a good example of this is a game that 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.140
 I had not a long time in this match 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.860
 I used to be a platinum team and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 gold 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.299
 the player decided to drive on the top to 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.040
 do not cause a fight on the chip select sires 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.780
 leave it and try to arrive with a 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.759
 two hectare strategy 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.829
 I was in love a dialogue and confesses 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.780
 to be with some difficulty in me 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.820
 with this strategy because of the fact that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.310
 be a single tank of my team and I ended up 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.189
 Wronging several times to me bandage and drive 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.420
 keep saying gg de hangu does not 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.880
 it helped in nothing 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.820
 defensive agents tend to form only 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.189
 Lenny and usually walk a lot and end up 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.560
 going bad in the game this player will talk 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.930
 very little or nothing and they tend to be afraid 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.000
 from entering any confrontational players 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.619
 defensive tendency to join the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.989
 time and followed them avoiding any 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.060
 personal play as spirit bush by 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.770
 last we have players that all 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.390
 we would like to be and have a 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.430
 our team the neutral players 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.320
 usually look for your 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.050
 time and look at the goal in place of 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.300
 mistakes and player rarely blames anyone and 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.520
 tries to take advantage of the enemy's mistakes 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.590
 your favor as a baron one how much 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.450
 another team is coming back to base 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.000
 it also seeks to pass as many 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.830
 information as possible via chat and pins 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.620
 and you have to be friendly to 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.600
 others more at ease 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.980
 unfortunately none of us is just a 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.780
 type of player 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.700
 we all have aggressive aspects 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.310
 defensive and neutral we should seek 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.040
 be the best possible in each game or 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.930
 less inside the game and here who 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.310
 will you listen to the curses are your parents? 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.830
 children and neighbors 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.300
 let's practice now from the point of view 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.680
 from the enemy to the birth rate can be 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.840
 positive or negative 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.580
 think that you are in the game and start 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.770
 see that the team is fighting 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.130
 at this time you can encourage this 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.560
 discussion and have an easier game being 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.810
 this the positive side or you may be 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.230
 losing and another team is mocking of 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.430
 you 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.440
 At this time be careful not to let 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.360
 arriving in your mind ignores the team 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.400
 enemy and focus on your game 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.200
 the clever fighter imposes his will 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.750
 is an enemy and will not allow 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.030
 the other's will and is imposed by 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.380
 now for the point of view of his team 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.930
 let's say you're an aggressive player 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.000
 you're cursing your team 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.370
 along with you there are three 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.620
 defensive players in one won 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.020
 these defensive players will end 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.120
 speaking little play less because they are 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.790
 under pressure and feel guilty 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.370
 really their aggressive play will 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.440
 start fighting with you after all for him 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.240
 it's your fault and not his 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.980
 in the end this team to end up being 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.660
 inferior than the opponent even the 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.740
 most skilled players 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.690
 I feel inside the scene. 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.340
 also professional training for those who 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.230
 closely follow the pros 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.080
 we have a great example of the penha game 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.240
 the drastic changes come from 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.190
 lower level as the 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.680
 mentality of the team is below 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.720
 need not reinforce that this tip is 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.390
 extremely important and I 've been robbed 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.430
 numerous times by the ILO itself connects 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.709
 flash is a team game and so is 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.229
 many other collective sports do not 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.000
 can be decided by only one champion 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.590
 for those with a mentality 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.420
 aggressive and offensive 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.120
 I suggest training and leave 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.550
 rafael out of the game afinal league of 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.290
 Legends came to have us both entertained 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.480
 to work then the next time 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.940
 Do you want to win in a league? 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.940
 remember teamwork is op
