 public money to rescue the bank 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.140
 about seven billion euros that is 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.420
 pretty much the same thing that goes to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.060
 cut back on education and health 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.830

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.949
 of euros but how many cutlery are going to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.980

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.550
 would inject public money now if 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.570
 that was necessary to get the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.210
 credit to save the system 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.100

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.870
