and<00:04:29.850> all<00:04:30.000> I'm<00:04:30.210> doing<00:04:30.570> is<00:04:31.669> twisting<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:32.760> around

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
and all I'm doing is twisting it around

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.400 
and all I'm doing is twisting it around
my<00:04:33.270> finger<00:04:33.720> like<00:04:33.960> this<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:35.150> then<00:04:36.150> pulling<00:04:37.139> it
