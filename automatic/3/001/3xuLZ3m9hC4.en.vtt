a little further on in the video first I
wanted<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.310> kind<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.610> quickly<00:01:21.030> go<00:01:21.299> over

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330

is<00:01:46.439> threaded<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.880> will<00:01:48.119> go<00:01:48.270> into<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:49.140> hole

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
is threaded and that will go into a hole

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
is threaded and that will go into a hole
that<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.640> will<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:51.030> drilling<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.780> tapping

bottle stopper so when you're turning
you<00:02:31.530> know<00:02:31.740> how<00:02:32.010> far<00:02:32.340> down<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.120> turn

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
you know how far down you have to turn

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.080 
you know how far down you have to turn
that<00:02:33.600> end<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.800> bottle<00:02:35.100> stopper<00:02:35.340> the
