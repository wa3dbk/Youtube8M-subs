I'm a little complex but let me tell you
in<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:06.840> simple<00:01:07.560> way<00:01:07.640> my<00:01:08.640> outer<00:01:08.909> shell<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
in a very simple way my outer shell is

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.810 
in a very simple way my outer shell is
called<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.990> capsid<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> protective

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
called a capsid it is a protective

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.570 
called a capsid it is a protective
protein<00:01:12.330> coat<00:01:12.619> inside<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.130> nucleic

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
protein coat inside there is nucleic

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.130 
protein coat inside there is nucleic
acid<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.960> RNA<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:16.740> DNA<00:01:17.450> confused<00:01:18.450> okay

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
acid it can be RNA or DNA confused okay

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.320 
acid it can be RNA or DNA confused okay
let<00:01:19.619> me<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.860> more<00:01:20.040> simple<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.820> an<00:01:21.150> outer

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
let me be more simple I have an outer

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.480 
let me be more simple I have an outer
coat<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.900> some<00:01:22.140> material<00:01:22.710> inside<00:01:23.070> called

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
coat and some material inside called

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.480 
coat and some material inside called
nucleic<00:01:23.909> acid<00:01:24.600> how<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.530> make<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> person<00:01:26.250> sick

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
nucleic acid how do I make a person sick

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.719 
nucleic acid how do I make a person sick
ah<00:01:27.200> let<00:01:28.200> me<00:01:28.320> tell<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> secret<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.610> we

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
ah let me tell you a secret when we

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.300 
ah let me tell you a secret when we
enter<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> human<00:01:30.659> or<00:01:30.810> animal<00:01:31.170> bodies<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.950> make

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
enter the human or animal bodies I make

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.060 
enter the human or animal bodies I make
copies<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> myself<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.869> means<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.380> multiply

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
copies of myself that means I multiply

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.550 
copies of myself that means I multiply
myself<00:01:35.579> let<00:01:36.210> me<00:01:36.329> show<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.600> how<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
myself let me show you how I do it a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.010 
myself let me show you how I do it a
virus<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.729> me<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.329> enter<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:39.840> body

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
virus like me can enter your body

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.560 
virus like me can enter your body
through<00:01:40.409> your<00:01:40.560> nose<00:01:40.799> mouth<00:01:41.460> or<00:01:41.729> from<00:01:41.820> broken

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
through your nose mouth or from broken

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.620 
through your nose mouth or from broken
skin<00:01:42.979> after<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.579> enter<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:45.000> body<00:01:45.149> cells

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
skin after that we enter your body cells

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.679 
skin after that we enter your body cells
we<00:01:46.020> remove<00:01:46.409> our<00:01:46.680> coat<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.460> our<00:01:47.670> nucleic<00:01:48.090> acid

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
we remove our coat then our nucleic acid

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.010 
we remove our coat then our nucleic acid
gets<00:01:48.869> mixed<00:01:49.200> up<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:49.649> human<00:01:49.979> body<00:01:50.399> cell

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
gets mixed up with human body cell

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.190 
gets mixed up with human body cell
manufacturing<00:01:52.020> factories<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.270> then<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.869> do

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
manufacturing factories and then we do

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.550 
manufacturing factories and then we do
our<00:01:55.409> dirty<00:01:55.920> magic<00:01:56.729> your<00:01:57.479> body<00:01:57.780> cell<00:01:58.200> then

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
our dirty magic your body cell then

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.789 
our dirty magic your body cell then
starts<00:01:58.979> making<00:01:59.219> copies<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.939> us<00:02:00.270> yes<00:02:01.049> human

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
starts making copies of us yes human

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.969 
starts making copies of us yes human
body<00:02:02.040> cells<00:02:02.430> stop<00:02:02.850> producing<00:02:03.570> viruses<00:02:04.290> these

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
body cells stop producing viruses these

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.580 
body cells stop producing viruses these
viruses<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:05.909> start<00:02:06.270> attacking<00:02:06.659> other<00:02:07.110> human

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
viruses then start attacking other human

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.969 
viruses then start attacking other human
body<00:02:07.799> cells<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.390> how<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> virus<00:02:10.349> makes

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
body cells and that is how a virus makes

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.440 
body cells and that is how a virus makes
you<00:02:11.310> sick

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
you sick

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.650 
you sick
haha<00:02:12.870> scared<00:02:13.620> again<00:02:13.739> don't<00:02:14.670> worry<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:15.360> can't

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
haha scared again don't worry we can't
