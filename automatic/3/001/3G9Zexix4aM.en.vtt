00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
nowhere I had to put the tiniest extra

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.770 
nowhere I had to put the tiniest extra
dosh<00:03:30.650> onto<00:03:31.219> my<00:03:31.310> hand<00:03:31.519> from<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.879> bottle<00:03:32.209> but<00:03:32.659> if

dosh onto my hand from the bottle but if

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.959 
dosh onto my hand from the bottle but if
I'd<00:03:32.930> worked<00:03:33.170> quickly<00:03:33.500> err<00:03:33.709> quickly<00:03:34.670> more

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:34.969 
I'd worked quickly err quickly more

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:36.819 
I'd worked quickly err quickly more
quickly<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.510> would<00:03:36.049> have<00:03:36.139> been<00:03:36.230> able<00:03:36.439> to<00:03:36.560> use

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
quickly I would have been able to use

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.619 
quickly I would have been able to use
just<00:03:37.159> that<00:03:37.400> amount<00:03:37.730> for<00:03:37.879> my<00:03:37.970> whole<00:03:38.150> face<00:03:38.389> I

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
just that amount for my whole face I

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.210 
just that amount for my whole face I
know<00:03:38.689> it<00:03:39.109> was<00:03:39.260> way<00:03:39.500> too<00:03:39.560> much<00:03:40.959> but<00:03:42.069> this<00:03:43.069> is

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
know it was way too much but this is

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.159 
know it was way too much but this is
actually<00:03:43.549> really<00:03:44.329> hard<00:03:44.569> to<00:03:44.750> get<00:03:44.870> off<00:03:44.989> with<00:03:45.109> a

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
actually really hard to get off with a

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.250 
actually really hard to get off with a
baby<00:03:45.349> wipe<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:46.189> I<00:03:46.760> believe<00:03:47.239> this<00:03:47.540> claims<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.169> be

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
baby wipe so I believe this claims to be

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.670 
baby wipe so I believe this claims to be
like<00:03:49.030> fairly<00:03:50.030> bulletproof<00:03:50.540> foundations<00:03:51.349> so

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
like fairly bulletproof foundations so

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.059 
like fairly bulletproof foundations so
I'm<00:03:51.950> going<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.310> just<00:03:52.609> apply<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:54.650> rest<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:54.980> my

yet and my chin is not oily however
coverage<00:05:02.410> has<00:05:02.820> diminished<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:04.030> little<00:05:04.389> kind<00:05:05.110> of

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
coverage has diminished a little kind of

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.219 
coverage has diminished a little kind of
all<00:05:05.380> around<00:05:05.680> my<00:05:05.770> chin<00:05:06.010> area<00:05:06.190> now<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:07.229> wasn't

massive<00:05:11.200> thick<00:05:11.440> chunky<00:05:11.919> scarf<00:05:11.979> which<00:05:12.520> may

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
massive thick chunky scarf which may

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.850 
massive thick chunky scarf which may
have<00:05:12.790> rubbed<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.090> off<00:05:13.440> that<00:05:14.440> would<00:05:14.590> explain

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
have rubbed it off that would explain

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.800 
have rubbed it off that would explain
that<00:05:14.940> coverage<00:05:15.940> elsewhere<00:05:16.360> has<00:05:16.510> remained

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
was really no need for a mirror I could

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
was really no need for a mirror I could
contact<00:05:59.590> outer<00:05:59.979> space<00:06:00.310> with<00:06:00.520> that<00:06:00.639> forehead

contact outer space with that forehead

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.390

so<00:06:03.400> okay<00:06:03.960> my<00:06:04.960> forehead<00:06:05.410> is<00:06:05.560> still<00:06:05.860> very<00:06:06.039> shiny

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:17.250 

and<00:06:10.800> I'm<00:06:11.800> getting<00:06:12.220> shiny<00:06:12.520> around<00:06:13.060> here<00:06:16.260> but

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
and I'm getting shiny around here but

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.470 
and I'm getting shiny around here but
all<00:06:18.190> in<00:06:18.460> all<00:06:18.520> I<00:06:18.580> think<00:06:18.700> it<00:06:18.910> looks<00:06:19.030> okay<00:06:19.150> I

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
all in all I think it looks okay I

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.560 
all in all I think it looks okay I
reckon<00:06:19.990> if<00:06:20.080> I'd<00:06:20.230> used<00:06:20.640> maybe<00:06:21.640> a<00:06:21.760> setting<00:06:22.240> spray

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
reckon if I'd used maybe a setting spray

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.990 
reckon if I'd used maybe a setting spray
and<00:06:22.780> or<00:06:23.320> powder<00:06:23.770> it<00:06:24.430> might<00:06:24.700> have<00:06:24.850> made<00:06:24.940> a

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
and or powder it might have made a

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.250 
and or powder it might have made a
difference<00:06:25.090> I'm<00:06:25.480> gonna<00:06:25.630> zoom<00:06:25.720> you<00:06:25.870> in<00:06:25.900> just<00:06:26.170> so

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.580 
you can see blush is still there so
that's<00:06:33.100> pretty<00:06:33.400> bad<00:06:36.780> as<00:06:37.780> you<00:06:37.930> can<00:06:38.080> see<00:06:38.200> my<00:06:38.350> chin

that's pretty bad as you can see my chin
is<00:06:38.710> really<00:06:38.980> cracked<00:06:39.310> looking<00:06:40.410> so<00:06:41.410> in<00:06:41.710> essence

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190

this<00:06:42.610> foundation<00:06:43.240> I<00:06:43.330> will<00:06:43.570> continue<00:06:43.840> to<00:06:43.990> use

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
this foundation I will continue to use

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.810 
this foundation I will continue to use
it<00:06:44.410> but<00:06:44.680> I'm<00:06:44.830> going<00:06:45.100> to<00:06:45.220> use<00:06:45.280> it<00:06:45.490> with<00:06:45.550> powder

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
it but I'm going to use it with powder

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.320 
it but I'm going to use it with powder
next<00:06:46.060> time<00:06:46.300> and<00:06:46.480> see<00:06:46.630> how<00:06:46.780> that<00:06:47.050> goes<00:06:48.030> my<00:06:49.030> tips

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
next time and see how that goes my tips

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.270 
next time and see how that goes my tips
would<00:06:49.600> be<00:06:49.660> to<00:06:50.230> powder<00:06:50.530> it<00:06:50.710> if<00:06:50.830> you<00:06:50.920> have<00:06:51.010> oily

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
would be to powder it if you have oily

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.190 
would be to powder it if you have oily
skin<00:06:51.340> I<00:06:51.850> reckon<00:06:52.180> it<00:06:52.270> could<00:06:52.420> be<00:06:52.510> okay<00:06:52.780> for<00:06:52.840> dry

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
skin I reckon it could be okay for dry

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.430 
skin I reckon it could be okay for dry
skin<00:06:53.620> I<00:06:53.830> would<00:06:54.250> also<00:06:54.460> use<00:06:55.000> a<00:06:55.240> palette<00:06:55.960> to<00:06:56.170> apply

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
skin I would also use a palette to apply

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.930 
skin I would also use a palette to apply
it<00:06:56.500> on<00:06:56.710> because<00:06:56.980> applying<00:06:57.400> it<00:06:57.520> in<00:06:57.580> the<00:06:57.640> back<00:06:57.790> of

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
it on because applying it in the back of

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.700 
it on because applying it in the back of
my<00:06:58.030> hand<00:06:58.210> meant<00:06:58.510> I<00:06:58.690> wasted<00:06:59.080> a<00:06:59.110> lot<00:06:59.170> of<00:06:59.230> product

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
my hand meant I wasted a lot of product

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.140 
my hand meant I wasted a lot of product
because<00:07:00.010> my<00:07:00.130> hands<00:07:00.400> soaked<00:07:00.580> up<00:07:00.730> quite<00:07:00.940> a<00:07:00.970> bit

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150
