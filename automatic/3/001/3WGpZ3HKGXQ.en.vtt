00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.099
 it seems that ten years ago 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:11.259
 this 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.719
 well first it was an argument to write 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.609
 After going out 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.179
 turn it into 3 million 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.099
 the people becomes the trilogy of the air and took yool first york is the 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.859
 singing can be said that neither distinctive 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.060
 p caught my attention 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.810
 Of course, I have always liked things, I know we detect mystic and esoteric 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.060
 i ibiza today to make history 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.760
 b left me very good impression 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.730
 and I thought it was a challenge 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.730
 when apple brings crazy 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.510
 in which we had a direct approach with arturo lucentum bridge 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.450
 what you can 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.630
 the project and we were pretty interested from that moment 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.750
 we had a pawn 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.890
 the project 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.770
 visionary aloft sm 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.070
 the state government of aguascalientes and support this project 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.190
 It is definitely a project that special conditions and with project 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.580
 and there are 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.340
 and I started to see the structure I had created 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.910
 all the work they had done computing 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.550
 the dl the costume design work 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.410
 percent and the creations of those in the scenarios 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.000
 I feel my and sensitized a lot 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.310
 ii what all the capacity 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.960
 creative there 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.789
 in that state of aguascalientes he did not face viera 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:36.890
 imagined 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.910
 financial fallen angel 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.340
 it's a movie this 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.710
 different 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.830
 what has been done in Mexico 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.190
 percent 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.340
 it's a movie before 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.390
 the issues are no longer treated 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.320
 Nationals are not treated issues 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.120
 that worlds that do not exist are not real 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.560
 characters 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.240
 this fantasy something 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.420
 in concrete the event is the cairo 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.450
 I do not think so 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.580
 cam for people 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.180
 percent 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.580
 I dont know 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.839
 a magic that I have not seen the screen 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.359
 national since I think that from the beginning when mostoleño checks the 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.479
 first time all the treatments 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.939
 it was something that we liked a lot 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.279
 the relationship 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.319
 either by means of what was the 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.569
 hb processes composite color correction 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.009
 the animation that is another important part 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.479
 that makes up this new movie that I think is a 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.669
 a success 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.249
 within what is another genre on stage 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:40.049
 after he encouraged me to make this movie is that in Mexico they are not made 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.599
 this type of change 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.680
 And if any have been done around here, even unveiled 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:51.489
 I thought it was a very big challenge to return 10 I should say with 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.919
 all honesty for the debt crisis 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.809
 as it does little good because it's really about the month of 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:59.619
 july a style book 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:02.839
 from cc it seemed to be dead 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:08.029
 percent smoking special effects and all that because of the 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:10.069
 complexity of the project 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.449
 recreate this in this new one that is not in mexico 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.209
 arráez age change of the special effects that is a very good point 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.489
 after what has happened for miles, I do not think so in the 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.489
 rest of doing something new 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.159
 although also sirte 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.599
 at the forefront of many of the American films and that 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.389
 We can really do it in Mexico 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.449
 I love music 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.869
 the music leave me pressed the photograph 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:37.979
 passions 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:42.719
 the imagination for each of the cells characters the special dates 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.339
 the red to the fragile 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.559
 per cent what is the makeup really me that is causing good 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.869
 impression because of the causes and a lot of people that had that we had had 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:53.189
 the fortune of seeing 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.209
 the advancements of his movie was very difficult 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.289
 get the money because people did not believe 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.289
 ap ac 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:05.289
 a few years ago I did not believe that this kind of 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.480
 the cinema did not believe that in Mexico it can be sealed that these 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.569
 cook have that art that have the movies of January the fantastic 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.589
 p then the first the first visits I had with my company its 

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.430
 investors and taught them to it 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.979
 drawings and sketches crossing the river and all the trade because it is not a consequence 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.729
 from mexico expo 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.430
 this can not be lowered anymore 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.419
 practically impossible but 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.659
 but what 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.659
 if there are possibilities to do it because there is talent 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:42.389
 i this great effort all your creative and dirty throughout the whole team 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.809
 something positive has to happen 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.919
 managers and that will reach people in some way 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.430
 to the truth 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.770
 states that this way 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.680
 txiki that is not supported emery comes the level that has the money 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.810
 but that is supported by creativity 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.800
 to the maximum 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.999
 this is a good thing 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.999
 I would invite companies 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:11.699
 kensuke ana 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.770
 support Mexican cinema support this project 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.889
 because definitely this new stream 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.819
 it benefits us all 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:25.009
 to all the people is that they exported a different a different concept of what 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:26.219
 What is Mexico? 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.619
 in the country there are infrastructures that there were not ten years ago was 

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:32.990
 currently to her thousands of rooms in him 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.729
 the distribution is massive before alliances and in 20 copies at most five 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.509
 people 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.370
 this fallen angel let's get us out at least we're fighting 

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:44.919
 350 copies 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.589
 that Americans have already approached the movies 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:51.240
 refers that it's pretty good 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.309
 in fact 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:55.869
 junior is supported commented on his type of new Mexican cinema 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:59.689
 in which is dabbling in new techniques new technologies 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.399
 I really look for excellence with commented with the quality that in the 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:05.199
 draft 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.039
 why 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.239
 it was when nothing else new york a lot of people have to get on the boat 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.490
 he did see that supporting this is going to promote a lot of what movie work is 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.129
 in mexico ii guido 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.419
 we need the conspiracy of all of you 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.419
 I hope that it is to your liking it is also a movie 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.180
 yes it is for all public 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.240
 equal children 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.520
 teenagers and adults 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.069
 for the entire family 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:36.400
 there are many young filmmakers like you who are starting 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.990
 and who I think is the favorable point against you so that 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.270
 continue to be you so that we all win wins Mexico wins the industry 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.020
 illana the image that you have now for what is the Mexican cinema the only thing is 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.770
 that like no bars but there are other companies that join this 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.569
 effort 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.599
 and that we can really land it and make it 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.339
 a good result of all this 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:04.800
 percent to the pity all businessmen call them to support 

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:08.469
 Mexican talent and talent in which the talent drain does not continue to be given 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:09.309
 palms 

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:12.219
 it's time to put each one of us a year of sand 

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:15.110
 why Mexican cinema 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.770
 he has been seen as an ape
