my<00:00:44.280> trial<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.760> error<00:00:45.000> little<00:00:45.570> things<00:00:46.110> that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
my trial and error little things that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.890 
my trial and error little things that
I've<00:00:46.410> learned<00:00:46.650> is<00:00:46.949> I<00:00:47.220> just<00:00:47.760> turn<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.690> break

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
I've learned is I just turn the break

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.160 
I've learned is I just turn the break
all<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.559> way<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.820> stop<00:00:51.180> its<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.600> slows<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
all the way up it stop its it slows the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.130 
all the way up it stop its it slows the
spool<00:00:52.470> down<00:00:52.650> throughout<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> whole<00:00:53.220> cast<00:00:54.140> so

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
spool down throughout the whole cast so

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.049 
spool down throughout the whole cast so
what<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.290> also<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.769> when<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.400> disengage<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
what I also do is when I disengage the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.619 
what I also do is when I disengage the
gear<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.480> keep<00:00:57.780> an<00:00:57.930> eye<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.170> how<00:00:58.350> fast<00:00:59.390> the<00:01:00.390> bait

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
gear I keep an eye on how fast the bait

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
gear I keep an eye on how fast the bait
drops<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> disengagement<00:01:02.879> let<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.329> drop

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
drops in the disengagement let it drop

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.960 
drops in the disengagement let it drop
that's<00:01:04.649> a<00:01:04.739> good<00:01:04.890> speed<00:01:05.129> people<00:01:05.700> would<00:01:05.850> say

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
that's a good speed people would say

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.029 
that's a good speed people would say
that's<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.330> bit<00:01:06.479> too<00:01:06.630> fast<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.110> I'm<00:01:07.710> doing<00:01:07.979> this

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
that's a bit too fast but I'm doing this

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.249
