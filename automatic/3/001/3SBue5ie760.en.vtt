to<00:00:28.080> get<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.320> 97<00:00:28.859> i<00:00:28.920> think<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.340> driving<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
to get to a 97 i think is in driving a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.609 
to get to a 97 i think is in driving a
layup<00:00:29.970> went<00:00:30.269> up<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.599> driving<00:00:30.840> dunk<00:00:31.199> went<00:00:31.439> up

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
layup went up and driving dunk went up

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.979 
layup went up and driving dunk went up
because<00:00:32.550> they<00:00:32.790> weren't<00:00:33.000> 99<00:00:33.540> yet<00:00:33.750> when<00:00:33.870> they

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
because they weren't 99 yet when they

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.840 
because they weren't 99 yet when they
should<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.170> been<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:35.130> these<00:00:35.280> defensive

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
should have been but these defensive

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.580 
should have been but these defensive
stats<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.210> him<00:00:36.360> still<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.690> don't<00:00:36.899> think<00:00:37.110> aren't

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
stats on him still I don't think aren't

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.100 
stats on him still I don't think aren't
as<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.920> mean<00:00:38.610> they<00:00:38.969> went<00:00:39.390> up<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:39.719> well<00:00:39.899> there

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
as I mean they went up as well there

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.080 
as I mean they went up as well there
abouts<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.440> an<00:00:40.559> Isis<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.129> they<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:41.579> should<00:00:42.059> be

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
abouts in an Isis but they all should be

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.350 
abouts in an Isis but they all should be
a<00:00:42.239> near<00:00:42.540> 99<00:00:43.110> ah<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.370> other<00:00:44.579> than<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.329> think

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
a near 99 ah but other than that I think

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.010 
a near 99 ah but other than that I think
in<00:00:45.660> quickness<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:47.450> speed<00:00:48.450> what<00:00:48.899> I'm

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
in quickness on and speed what I'm

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
in quickness on and speed what I'm
thinking<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.530> what<00:00:49.950> went<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.399> well<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.730> a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
thinking of is what went up as well to a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.139 
thinking of is what went up as well to a
bow<00:00:50.910> tie<00:00:50.940> easy<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.680> 97<00:00:53.309> upgrade<00:00:53.610> card<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
bow tie easy so the 97 upgrade card is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.450 
bow tie easy so the 97 upgrade card is
is<00:00:54.390> pretty<00:00:54.750> good<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.289> would<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.160> don't<00:00:56.309> know<00:00:56.370> if

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
is pretty good I would I don't know if

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.700 
is pretty good I would I don't know if
I'd<00:00:56.579> want<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.910> pay<00:00:57.030> 500,000<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.530> is

basketball last video I talked about the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.789 
basketball last video I talked about the
trade<00:01:50.880> deadline<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.840> time<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.110> ever<00:01:52.409> had

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
trade deadline but this time I ever had

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.319 
trade deadline but this time I ever had
cuz<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.250> don't<00:01:53.310> pack<00:01:53.640> openings<00:01:54.000> much<00:01:54.119> anymore

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329

cuz I don't pack openings much anymore
haven't<00:01:54.630> had<00:01:54.720> time<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.170> sit<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.560> top

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
haven't had time to just sit on top

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.469 
haven't had time to just sit on top
about<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> league<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.820> was<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.060> think<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
about the league and was I think of it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.719 
about the league and was I think of it
because<00:01:57.659> i<00:01:57.840> watch<00:01:58.649> basketball<00:01:58.890> religiously

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
because i watch basketball religiously

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.670 
because i watch basketball religiously
pretty<00:02:00.000> religiously<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:00.780> much<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.229> did

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
pretty religiously not as much as I did

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.160 
pretty religiously not as much as I did
before<00:02:01.799> because<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.280> don't<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:02.640> much

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
before because I just don't have as much

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.580 
before because I just don't have as much
more<00:02:03.409> but<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:04.310> do<00:02:04.369> keep<00:02:04.700> up<00:02:04.880> when<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.150> can<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.689> I

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
more but I do keep up when I can and I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.949 
more but I do keep up when I can and I
think<00:02:07.100> all<00:02:08.090> right<00:02:08.239> basically<00:02:08.479> every

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
think all right basically every

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.540 
think all right basically every
prediction<00:02:09.200> I've<00:02:09.470> made<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:09.920> far<00:02:10.130> in<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.340> year

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
prediction I've made so far in the year

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.910 
prediction I've made so far in the year
has<00:02:10.759> come<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.150> fruition<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:12.230> Bulls<00:02:12.470> even<00:02:12.830> when

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
has come to fruition the Bulls even when

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.410 
has come to fruition the Bulls even when
Tim<00:02:13.040> was<00:02:13.069> playing<00:02:13.430> well<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.640> predict<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.120> much

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
Tim was playing well I predict that much

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.120 
Tim was playing well I predict that much
may<00:02:14.540> slow<00:02:14.870> down<00:02:14.900> because<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.410> saw<00:02:15.620> how<00:02:15.650> they<00:02:15.950> are

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
may slow down because I saw how they are

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.010 
may slow down because I saw how they are
playing<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.700> they<00:02:17.060> were<00:02:17.120> playing<00:02:17.420> Paul<00:02:17.720> way

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
playing and they were playing Paul way

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.479 
playing and they were playing Paul way
too<00:02:18.080> much<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.590> think<00:02:18.620> pose<00:02:18.980> way<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.220> slow<00:02:19.459> down

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
too much I think pose way to slow down

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.309 
too much I think pose way to slow down
by<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.819> playoffs<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.569> they're<00:02:20.810> losing<00:02:21.020> to

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
by the playoffs and they're losing to

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.840 
by the playoffs and they're losing to
unnecessary<00:02:21.950> teams<00:02:22.250> they<00:02:22.459> lost<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.819> the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
unnecessary teams they lost to the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.790 
unnecessary teams they lost to the
Celtics<00:02:23.450> they've<00:02:23.630> lost<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:24.230> couple<00:02:24.440> of<00:02:24.620> teams

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
Celtics they've lost a couple of teams

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.770 
Celtics they've lost a couple of teams
on<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.069> 500<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.790> they're<00:02:26.300> just<00:02:26.450> not<00:02:26.630> as

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
on the 500 and they're just not as

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.330 
on the 500 and they're just not as
consistent<00:02:27.350> as<00:02:27.470> them<00:02:27.680> should<00:02:27.890> be<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.130> don't

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
consistent as them should be and I don't

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.190 
consistent as them should be and I don't
think<00:02:28.489> they're<00:02:28.610> championship<00:02:29.180> ready<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.660> do

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
think they're championship ready I do

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.330 
think they're championship ready I do
see<00:02:30.470> them<00:02:30.590> going<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.890> eastern<00:02:31.160> conference

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
see them going to the eastern conference

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.430 
see them going to the eastern conference
finals<00:02:31.640> at<00:02:32.000> least<00:02:32.209> I<00:02:32.450> predicted<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.230> when

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
finals at least I predicted that when

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.559 
finals at least I predicted that when
the<00:02:33.530> Cavs<00:02:33.769> run<00:02:34.010> them<00:02:34.190> terrible<00:02:34.910> losing<00:02:35.300> street

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
the Cavs run them terrible losing street

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.550 
the Cavs run them terrible losing street
that<00:02:35.720> they<00:02:35.840> were<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.140> gets<00:02:36.380> together

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
that they were going to gets together

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.290 
that they were going to gets together
and<00:02:36.860> it's<00:02:37.100> just<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.370> matter<00:02:37.519> of<00:02:37.700> chemistry

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
and it's just a matter of chemistry

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.680 
and it's just a matter of chemistry
which<00:02:38.720> does<00:02:39.050> not<00:02:39.230> hit<00:02:39.530> la<00:02:39.709> tête<00:02:40.190> heck<00:02:41.060> long<00:02:41.390> and

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
which does not hit la tête heck long and

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.660 
which does not hit la tête heck long and
then<00:02:41.870> look<00:02:42.049> at<00:02:42.110> where<00:02:42.319> they<00:02:42.410> are<00:02:42.530> no<00:02:42.769> and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
then look at where they are no and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.539 
then look at where they are no and
there's<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.060> first<00:02:44.209> onyx<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.980> just<00:02:45.980> lead<00:02:46.370> up<00:02:46.519> to

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
sound word but do you think is the

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.750 
sound word but do you think is the
Grizzlies<00:05:27.680> that<00:05:27.710> will<00:05:28.040> come<00:05:28.190> all<00:05:28.310> to<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:28.460> west

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
Grizzlies that will come all to the west

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.820 
Grizzlies that will come all to the west
I<00:05:29.030> think<00:05:29.630> it's<00:05:29.750> about<00:05:29.930> time<00:05:30.200> then<00:05:30.530> stop

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
I think it's about time then stop

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.230 
I think it's about time then stop
getting<00:05:31.160> cuts<00:05:31.370> off<00:05:31.520> at<00:05:31.730> the<00:05:31.880> western

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
getting cuts off at the western

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.659 
getting cuts off at the western
conference<00:05:32.390> finals<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:33.290> semi<00:05:33.500> finals<00:05:33.950> and<00:05:34.100> go

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
conference finals and semi finals and go

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.040 
conference finals and semi finals and go
all<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:34.940> way<00:05:34.970> I<00:05:35.090> think<00:05:35.419> that<00:05:35.570> all<00:05:35.690> time<00:05:35.870> that

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
all the way I think that all time that

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.990 
all the way I think that all time that
is<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:36.260> Grizzlies<00:05:36.590> go<00:05:36.770> to<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.460> finals<00:05:37.850> and

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
is the Grizzlies go to the finals and

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.700 
is the Grizzlies go to the finals and
also<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.419> East<00:05:38.570> I<00:05:38.690> still<00:05:38.900> say<00:05:39.140> is<00:05:39.320> the<00:05:39.500> Cavs

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
also the East I still say is the Cavs

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.750 
also the East I still say is the Cavs
that<00:05:39.919> can<00:05:40.100> do<00:05:40.250> it<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:42.250> just<00:05:43.250> personally<00:05:43.580> in<00:05:43.700> the

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
that can do it I just personally in the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.700 
that can do it I just personally in the
East<00:05:43.970> is<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:44.300> toss-up<00:05:44.720> really<00:05:45.140> if<00:05:45.350> the<00:05:45.500> Cavs

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
East is a toss-up really if the Cavs

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.440 
East is a toss-up really if the Cavs
can't<00:05:45.980> keep<00:05:46.160> them<00:05:46.310> chemistry<00:05:46.700> going<00:05:46.880> but<00:05:47.120> if

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
can't keep them chemistry going but if

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.300 
can't keep them chemistry going but if
they<00:05:47.750> can<00:05:47.990> there<00:05:48.290> is<00:05:48.410> no<00:05:48.650> reason<00:05:48.860> to<00:05:49.040> cavs

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
they can there is no reason to cavs

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.190 
they can there is no reason to cavs
can't<00:05:49.550> come<00:05:49.700> up<00:05:49.790> to<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:49.970> east<00:05:50.150> in<00:05:50.540> the<00:05:50.780> West<00:05:51.080> I

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
can't come up to the east in the West I

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.260 
can't come up to the east in the West I
really<00:05:51.650> do<00:05:51.770> think<00:05:52.010> is<00:05:52.220> the<00:05:52.430> Grizzlies<00:05:52.820> but<00:05:53.060> Tom

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.570 
really do think is the Grizzlies but Tom

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
Allen toys are great I think I you'd be

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.180 
Allen toys are great I think I you'd be
a<00:05:55.610> great<00:05:55.910> all<00:05:56.240> forward<00:05:56.870> he<00:05:57.440> is<00:05:57.500> Bill<00:05:57.890> Russell

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
a great all forward he is Bill Russell

reminiscence<00:05:59.060> for<00:05:59.570> me<00:05:59.660> um<00:05:59.900> I<00:06:00.530> step<00:06:01.100> up<00:06:01.490> with

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
reminiscence for me um I step up with

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.170 
reminiscence for me um I step up with
better<00:06:01.910> offensive<00:06:02.300> stats<00:06:02.660> I<00:06:03.669> think<00:06:04.669> it<00:06:04.970> is

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
better offensive stats I think it is

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.090 
better offensive stats I think it is
just<00:06:05.360> as<00:06:05.600> I<00:06:05.690> really<00:06:05.930> had<00:06:06.080> closed<00:06:06.470> pending<00:06:06.830> way
