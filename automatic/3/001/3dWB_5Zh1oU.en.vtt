but<00:00:53.550> overall<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.180> found<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.680> browsing

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
but overall I found that the browsing

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.689 
but overall I found that the browsing
experience<00:00:56.239> was<00:00:57.239> much<00:00:57.570> faster<00:00:58.020> I'm<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:59.430> sure

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
experience was much faster I'm not sure

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.900 
experience was much faster I'm not sure
that<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.440> because<00:01:01.440> before<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.039> was<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.309> well

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
that was because before it was all well

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.260 
that was because before it was all well
yeah<00:01:03.739> before<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.830> was<00:01:04.890> all<00:01:05.129> rendering<00:01:05.880> kind<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
yeah before it was all rendering kind of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.750 
yeah before it was all rendering kind of
a<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.290> bit<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.159> little<00:01:08.189> bit<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
a little bit just a little bit that you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.370 
a little bit just a little bit that you
can<00:01:09.000> notice<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.780> one's<00:01:09.990> really
