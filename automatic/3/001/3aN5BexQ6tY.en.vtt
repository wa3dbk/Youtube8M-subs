00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello there are lists 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.450
 in today's tutorial I'm going to reveal 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.220
 all my tricks to make a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.050
 marbling to the water without staining or anything and 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.030
 saving the maximum possible enamel 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.250
 I will teach you to draw a flower 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.080
 enamel like this that you see here 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.330
 you have them in the box of 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.520
 video information where it shows show 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.250
 plus 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.780
 to start we will need a glass or 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.660
 glass container with water 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.250
 neither cold nor hot time choose the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.800
 glazes is very important so that you 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.650
 get the picture right in the water not all 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.940
 the enamels are for him marbled 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.380
 they have to be covered and not be 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.330
 express 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.930
 try until you find the enamels 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.930
 suitable 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.829
 I am using two network colors 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.839
 knights and another one of lola makeup 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.969
 I recommend you try first in the glass 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.980
 and see what colors you have chosen 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.079
 they expand well 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.900
 At the drop the glaze has to go 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.180
 towards the edges of the cup if it does not work 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.650
 let dry a little and remove the enamel 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.980
 of water with a toothpick or a piece of 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.750
 paperboard 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.940
 it is very important that you let it 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.200
 expand the color but do not miss 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.930
 too much time to put the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:20.780
 following 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:23.650
 [Music] 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.650
 Y 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.500
 do not throw the glaze drop from very 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.430
 up close enough but without 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.430
 get to touch the water 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.299
 [Music] 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.229
 [Music] 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.600
 once the circles are drawn with a 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.810
 stick or a pin we draw the lines 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.390
 towards the center until you draw the flower 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.979
 a trick at the end is to put the toothpick 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.060
 in the center and press a little towards 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.740
 down 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.740
 this is the most beautiful picture 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.090
 we let it dry at least one hour 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.709
 you can make several drawings and have them 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.709
 stored between the pages of a notebook 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.190
 You see it looks like a round sticker 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.260
 I reinforced the drawing in five parts to 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.260
 minus one for each finger 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.570
 [Music] 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.400
 painted the base with one of the colors that 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.799
 I had already used in the marbling 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.159
 I let it dry for a minute and pressed very 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.740
 well with the trimmed piece then you 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.380
 I put the top coat on top 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.750
 and the edges are going to separate already 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.510
 them alone with the help of a stick 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.330
 something we remove it from around and if 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.850
 You want a swab ears 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.890
 dipped nail polish removers or a brush 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.810
 mojadito in nail polish remover you can 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.190
 fix by around 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.620
 [Music] 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.190
 let's repeat this process with the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.190
 other nails 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.810
 it is very important that you press very well 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.810
 the piece of marbling 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.920
 we painted the base 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.920
 and let dry a little 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.190
 minutes or so and we take the piece 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.319
 trimmed and we press very very well 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.810
 [Music] 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.260
 then over the top coat and we see 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.999
 how is the detachment of the solo with 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.159
 let's throw a little bit we are going to be able to 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:57.269
 remove it later with the brush if 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.269
 we want we can go retouching 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.970
 and so with the next fingers I've 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.280
 also realized that some top 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.610
 coat are better than others for this 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.140
 case has to be a fluid top coat 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.350
 but do not take the drawing by 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.490
 in front sometimes some top coat corroen 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.490
 as if we said the drawing 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.549
 I'm using the golden quick drive 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.129
 rose that seems perfect 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.780
 He has also given an extra layer to the 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:27.110
 finish the marbling to fix it 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.110
 best 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.230
 as you see if you follow all the steps of 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.090
 this way of doing more molding is 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.090
 much cleaner than the other 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.660
 I hope you found this video 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.160
