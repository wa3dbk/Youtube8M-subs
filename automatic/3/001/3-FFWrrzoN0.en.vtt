years I know the carburetor is not
riding<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.250> because<00:02:24.400> we<00:02:24.549> we<00:02:24.880> didn't<00:02:25.090> fiddle

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
riding on it because we we didn't fiddle

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.849 
riding on it because we we didn't fiddle
with<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.690> while<00:02:25.840> get<00:02:26.079> it<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.290> start<00:02:26.769> and

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
with it for a while get it to start and

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.349 
with it for a while get it to start and
run<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:27.250> doesn't<00:02:27.579> work<00:02:27.730> out<00:02:27.910> very<00:02:28.090> well

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359
