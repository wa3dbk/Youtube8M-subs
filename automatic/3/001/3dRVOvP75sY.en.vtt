00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.470
 they should have the tomatoes and that's why 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.280
 Today there is a delicious fresh 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.949
 tomato soup with meatballs the 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.100
 spices herbs and we start 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:40.760
 the onions and garlic to pay for that 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:44.560

00:00:40.760 --> 00:01:00.460

00:00:44.560 --> 00:01:05.640
 the whole thing is traces on 1 in front 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:10.330
 the ready to connect it to the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:19.899
 tomato and basil defend 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:21.970
 Half a chemistry to the whole 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.430
 important is the stream from the tomatoes too 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.430
 remove are not really healthy 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.979
 all the time like now or now 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.979

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:47.299
 good that the little one now has about one 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.520

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.259
 Herbs in addition to Italian herbs 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:02:03.170

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:21.620

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:25.590
 200 milliliters of water about 15 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.900
 minutes to 100 degrees call 2 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.790
 15 minutes have been completely sufficient 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.890
 soup is've finished in the meantime 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.930
 I made the meatballs the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.340
 could tower in the steam 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.540
 unfortunately my boys do not like it that way 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.319
 like this year two the two ports 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.580
 two liters of super are from the ingredients 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.830

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:03.090
 I finished you a plate 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:04.349
 already put to the side should be so synonymous 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.680
 look nice 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.680
 the eye eats with hat for girls 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:19.549

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:25.879
