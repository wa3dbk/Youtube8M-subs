00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.269
 and not all stalls are ready for this fair yet 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.160
 Carpets misplaced stalls rearranged plastic cleared away and there is so 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.689

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.519

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.850
 and then they shine in the spotlight of the new Audi a4 Avant 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.600
 and the VW Scirocco and the many spam-mails he will be the Mercedes at this time 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.380
 and you might get into a better conversation here than in the huge one 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.380

 only at the Linz stand does the world seem to be in perfect order 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.379
 Wettenberg does not expect anything from this damper car salon 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.030
 Often they know on the inlet side clouded outer disk after we have 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.119

 Problem children work too 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.219

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.879

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.589
 Area where we operate 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:07.159
 it's always fun when it's hard to get started in post office 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.599
 somewhere for us, Mr. platform for the new concept has been loud 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.599

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:26.969
 listen here 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.749
 4 different reasons one is that we speak neutral territory ours 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:34.159
 Courts from both games become French Americans of German 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:35.829
 Brunsbüttel 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.209
 but here comes everyone and shows 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.589
 Alberto Quality wants to compare us 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:43.199
 the other is also in the craft industry points 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.559
 Director himself curious what our competition has to show and ours 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.559
 Listener too excited «What will show 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:04.649
 What you see here at the Geneva Motor Show is then on the construction day 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:08.969
 the actually gasoline savings concepts are in the foreground on their advisor 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:09.859
 was standing 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.069
 but the SLR has come to the fore 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.659
 even with him still only the big one 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.559
 super fast dream car 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:19.979
 Of course not exclusively we have 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.759
 we live in a world where, of course, fascination is still what it all 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.569
 Wish what many are thrilled but there are matching to this super car 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.840
 Basis of the Mercedes Benz SL r 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.690
 The one here in a special livery is from a front dreamlike 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.909
 domestic equipments 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.219
 leather issued with a floor 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.999
 there is an idea with us what is called to have what the yacht building 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.979
 escape 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.990
 they can get a smart fit for this car namely a Brabus old one 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.120
 Biedermann too 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.440
 exactly the same color exactly the same teacher in the same 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.440
 Equipment the car is behind us 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:12.759
 Doris on high heels and judging dresses are still on the main nude portal 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:13.660
 out of place 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.720
 Today beats year Schlabberlook and is danced barefoot while she is on 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.680
 the Renault was much more important what is under the cover that hides cars that 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.919
 stands behind me 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.360
 There the new one is really hot with a concert Crocodile Dundee 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.670
 cut problem 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.340
 very flat with a sensational franc a really interesting one 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.460
 rear end 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.980
 he will be an important competitor for the new VW Scirocco at the end of this year 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.729
 he should celebrate the next year 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.039
 It is one of the smallest cars you can find at the Geneva Motor Show 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.659
 and generates the greatest tension 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:15.199
 The Taser Nano is a four door native from India and is celebrating it in Europe 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.770
 first time its premiere 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.080
 After all, this is supposed to be watched suspiciously by the competition 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.129
 Small model for just home are offered 700 euros in Asia and that 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:30.460
 although great supplier technology from German supplier Bosch is in it 

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:31.110
 plugged 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.439
 how the car arrives 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:36.399
 whether the audience likes it &amp; the competition really scares her 

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:39.839
 That's what they're taught tomorrow on Auto Motor and Sport TV
