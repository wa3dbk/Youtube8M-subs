00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.259
 a live event from mick studios new york 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.359
 ace to the present on new spider and 7 a 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.009
 15 6 inch notebook out of the 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.230
 common because it has a particular 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.239
 tilting mechanism of the screen 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.550
 which allows you to position the display 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.500
 in four different modes between the 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.330
 which figure also a pad mode like 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.519
 you can see or tablet if you prefer 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.350
 something that reminds us a lot of the ball 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.420
 top the ultra-compact oils of 1 year 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.829
 latest generation of maxi tablets that 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.390
 can be moved easily 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.110
 inside the various rooms of the house 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.030
 or office 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.369
 in this mode the spider and 7 ass 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.869
 an inclination of about 4 degrees that 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:57.280
 allows an ergonomic use yes 

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:00.070
 placing it on the table it has 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.839
 these transformations are embraced 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.330
 possible thanks to a new hinge 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.640
 patented called hazell that actually 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.590
 consists of two hinges one for each 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.540
 screen and the other for the connected base 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.970
 at the ends of a sturdy support in 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.590
 tempered aluminum is possible as well 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.180
 rotate all the way backwards 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.220
 panel in a mode that comes 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.110
 call display but unlike 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.580
 other tipping systems allows 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.740
 to continue to use the ataxia of the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.150
 touchpad and therefore is perfect to do 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.740
 a presentation to a prospective 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.929
 interlocutor or to watch a film 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.579
 and we can also use modalities 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.920
 notebook as a common computer 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.450
 15 inch laptop with a footprint 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.189
 in line with that of other products 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.890
 in the same category with a thickness 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.319
 between 2 cm 2 cm 8 e 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.869
 a weight of 2.8 kg which also includes 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.640
 an accredited 4-cell battery of a 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.079
 autonomy up to four and a half hours 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.210
 I open it because I want to show you the 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.270
 base for racing de standby 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.109
 thanks to windows and it's very fast 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.359
 we can immediately resume 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.799
 use our aspire r7 from the point 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.420
 Exactly where we were interrupted 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.520
 maybe continuing to write an email 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.990
 thanks to the large island keyboard has 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.549
 standard size keys 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.380
 particularly large also as far as 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.789
 regards the enter key the shift the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.890
 space bar and is equipped with 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.899
 backlight while the touchpad 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.970
 instead it occupies the upper part of the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.320
 therefore there is a reversal in the base 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.420
 common position and touch keyboards 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.220
 compared to traditional notebooks e 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.960
 this to allow us to tilt in 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.360
 forward the screen using one of the 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.310
 so many virtues of the hazell hinge for 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.990
 approach it and then be able to use the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.550
 touch screen a little more comfortable 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.870
 without having to give up the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.070
 possibility to use the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.720
 keyboard 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.300
 let's quickly summarize the interfaces 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.340
 positioned on the various sides on the side 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.800
 back there is nothing except the two 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.120
 grids for the cooling system 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.490
 while the right side is a little more 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.780
 crowded starting from the bottom we see the 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.070
 hook hole for padlock 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.010
 safety power connector 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.170
 the rocker power button 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.200
 for volume adjustment a door 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.180
 usb 2.0 a slot for the reader of 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.270
 sd memory cards occupied by a play 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.430
 solder and to finish the first hole 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.170
 speaker side also 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.760
 front completely free made 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.190
 except for the double microphone for the 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.260
 noise cancellation while on the side 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.900
 left on an acer convertible door 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.180
 vga alan via adapter one output 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.240
 digital video cd and never two usb ports 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.630
 3.0 and an audio combo jack for headphones and 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.489
 microphone and then to the seven spere a 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.630
 innovative concept but acer has 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.519
 made with a very large one 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.320
 attention to details like ad 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.239
 example the speaker system well 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.190
 four of which only two are 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.959
 positioned anteriorly and two others 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.880
 instead they are positioned towards the back 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.519
 to allow you to have an audio always 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.530
 impeccable even display mode is 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.450
 in fact turning the handset on the bottom 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.360
 we can see the four grids of the 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.100
 2 watt speakers each this 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.049
 side also has a soft finish 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.120
 touch that improves grip and grip 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.709
 also hides the fingerprints 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.320
 while instead originating on others 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.900
 we convert it back into mode 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.880
 notebook to close it let's see 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.760
 that instead the cover is made in one 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.769
 the combination of magnesium and aluminum 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.260
 zipper we have already said and in sturdy 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.360
 brushed aluminum and also inside 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.000
 we find the same magnesium alloy 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.650
 aluminum 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.330
 who has the advantage of reducing weight 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.640
 without compromising the qualities of 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.770
 Impact resistance ACER does not have 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.540
 not even referring to software 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.030
 three fingers on the screen we can activate 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.980
 impact the acer screen grasp pool that 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.230
 allows you to select a portion of the 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.150
 desktop also from the start screen and from 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.380
 take a screenshot which you can then 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.850
 be immediately edited 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.680
 adding notes by hand or 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.320
 drawing directly using it 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.930
 like big beppe lending on 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.900
 Full HD resolution screen of 1920 x 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.300
 1080 pixels and ips type with angles of 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.790
 178 degree vision that will allow 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.860
 sharing between multiple users and from one 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.340
 brilliance of 300 superior candles 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.740
 to the average 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.230
 the technical equipment includes windows 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.090
 eight in the 64-bit version e 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.490
 intel core processors to files is needed 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.290
 seven of the low voltage type therefore themselves 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.690
 processors normally used on 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.570
 ultrabook combined with a ram up to 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.340
 12gb therefore a fairly fast system 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.470
 as the windows index also detects 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.570
 with scores that are around seven 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.340
 points between in 3d graphics even if vi 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.110
 I remember that in Europe there will also be 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.810
 configurations with powerful tabs 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.180
 nvidia graphics 750 m 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.040
 acer aspire r7 arrives from June to 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.040
 base price of 999 euros
