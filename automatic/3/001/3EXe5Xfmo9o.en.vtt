00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.760 
horizons in terms of Ivy League athletes
I<00:04:37.160> think<00:04:37.820> that<00:04:37.970> there's<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.450> lot<00:04:39.200> of<00:04:39.230> very<00:04:39.680> good

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
I think that there's a lot of very good

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.700 
I think that there's a lot of very good
student<00:04:40.250> athletes<00:04:40.820> that<00:04:41.060> would<00:04:42.050> love<00:04:42.350> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
student athletes that would love the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.980 
student athletes that would love the
opportunity<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:43.610> compete<00:04:44.210> at<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.570> place<00:04:44.870> like

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
opportunity to compete at a place like

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.690 
opportunity to compete at a place like
Yale<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.590> I<00:04:45.740> think<00:04:45.980> that<00:04:46.130> we've<00:04:46.250> got<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.580> do<00:04:46.670> a

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
Yale and I think that we've got to do a

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.760 
Yale and I think that we've got to do a
great<00:04:46.940> job<00:04:46.970> of<00:04:47.240> making<00:04:47.570> sure<00:04:47.720> we<00:04:48.350> turn<00:04:48.560> over
