 lost treasure of the land of wanted 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.900
 so precious that men sand the sand 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.080
 would dye to get them 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.570
 brave and a pirate queen 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.619
 dangerous that does not shrink from anything 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.220
 to find him 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:37.330
 from a bonnstraße line of the 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.750
 Kammerjäger a city where there is nothing 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.750
 suspect 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.830
 Do you have the treasure of the sand ? 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.240
 Are you right with me but I'm in 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.900
 I have not yet 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.900
 I am often sorry for being introduced 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.900
 would have 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.310
 very pleased 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.170
 the top of the rock nose in the future 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.090
 Exactly on the lighthouse and use 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.410
 then the compass when you're up then 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.540
 we'll probably hear the treasure buried 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.680
 is and probably tries on everyone 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.970
 first to be there 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.970
 that will be a lot of fun 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.140
 I'll do it just like your skills 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.140
 me 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.950
 I want the treasure of the country with her 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.450
 offer together and become completely honest 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.369
 Of course, sometime in the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.049
 fall back but for now we have 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.049
 better chances when we get together
