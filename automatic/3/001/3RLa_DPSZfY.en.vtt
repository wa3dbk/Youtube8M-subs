00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
me the best way to reuse it okay just

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.259 
me the best way to reuse it okay just
took<00:00:27.750> three<00:00:27.960> batteries<00:00:28.380> from<00:00:28.560> there<00:00:29.269> let's

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
took three batteries from there let's

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.900 
took three batteries from there let's
see<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.869> I'm<00:00:31.650> using<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.130> ball<00:00:32.309> tester<00:00:32.730> here

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
see this I'm using a ball tester here

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.030 
see this I'm using a ball tester here
but<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.930> not<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.350> best<00:00:34.469> way<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.710> test

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
but it's not really the best way to test

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.400 
but it's not really the best way to test
a<00:00:35.160> battery<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.700> well<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> all<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.260> I

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
a battery but well this is all like I

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.110 
a battery but well this is all like I
don't<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> battery<00:00:37.980> tester<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.969> want

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
don't have a battery tester I just want

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.780 
don't have a battery tester I just want
to<00:00:39.210> show<00:00:39.500> how<00:00:40.500> many<00:00:40.559> voltage<00:00:41.100> how<00:00:41.399> much<00:00:41.550> boost

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
to show how many voltage how much boost

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.819 
to show how many voltage how much boost
it's<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.360> has<00:00:42.510> left<00:00:42.860> this<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.100> has<00:00:45.829> 494

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it's just one has left this one has 494

00:00:46.829 --> 00:01:02.410 
it's just one has left this one has 494
left<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:53.870> 1.81<00:00:54.870> left<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:58.410> word<00:00:58.710> has

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.050 

point<00:01:03.420> 1<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.170> 1<00:01:04.470> volt<00:01:04.769> point<00:01:05.220> my<00:01:06.030> 3<00:01:06.299> left<00:01:06.510> okay

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
point 1 in 1 volt point my 3 left okay

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.109 
point 1 in 1 volt point my 3 left okay
normally<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.299> 1.6<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.010> still<00:01:11.490> has<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
normally it's like 1.6 if it still has a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.160 
normally it's like 1.6 if it still has a
lot<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.510> juice<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:14.299> what<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.360> use<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.930> to

lot of juice on it so what I use is to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.740 
lot of juice on it so what I use is to
reuse<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.310> use<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.890> lamp<00:01:20.119> yes<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.570> one

this back this left last month we had a

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.490 
this back this left last month we had a
major<00:02:32.010> boost<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.190> fire<00:02:33.430> down<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.910> like<00:02:34.570> to

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
major boost of fire down this like to

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.430 
major boost of fire down this like to
block<00:02:36.160> away<00:02:36.370> from<00:02:36.670> my<00:02:36.790> house<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:38.260> lock

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440
