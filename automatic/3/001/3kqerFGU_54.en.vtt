what the trick is is that I'll have
these<00:00:40.000> surrounding<00:00:40.780> stickers<00:00:41.230> be<00:00:41.620> different

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
these surrounding stickers be different

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.820 
these surrounding stickers be different
from<00:00:42.220> the<00:00:42.550> inside<00:00:42.790> stickers<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:43.750> all<00:00:44.260> happen

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
from the inside stickers and all happen

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.549 
from the inside stickers and all happen
on<00:00:44.920> all<00:00:45.129> these<00:00:45.430> faces<00:00:46.000> okay<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:47.170> start<00:00:47.379> you

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
on all these faces okay to start you

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.290 
on all these faces okay to start you
pick<00:00:47.800> any<00:00:48.040> color<00:00:48.670> you<00:00:48.910> want

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
pick any color you want

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.100 
pick any color you want
I'll<00:00:49.930> choose<00:00:50.590> grains<00:00:50.860> okay<00:00:51.730> so<00:00:52.510> you<00:00:52.570> move<00:00:52.930> your

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
I'll choose grains okay so you move your

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.910 
I'll choose grains okay so you move your
left<00:00:53.230> side<00:00:53.559> down<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:55.600> right<00:00:56.110> side<00:00:56.350> down<00:00:56.590> the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
left side down your right side down the

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.550 
left side down your right side down the
top<00:00:57.489> layer<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.690> left<00:00:58.720> and<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.290> bottom

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
top layer to the left and the bottom

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.520 
top layer to the left and the bottom
layer<00:00:59.710> to<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:00.280> left<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.840> move<00:01:01.989> your<00:01:02.079> cube<00:01:02.380> to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
layer to the left and move your cube to

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.510 
layer to the left and move your cube to
the<00:01:02.560> right<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.149> move<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:04.509> left<00:01:04.720> layer<00:01:05.190> up<00:01:06.190> and

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
the right and move the left layer up and

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.770 
the right and move the left layer up and
the<00:01:07.270> right<00:01:07.420> layer<00:01:07.600> up<00:01:08.940> that's<00:01:09.940> all<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.540> mean

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
the right layer up that's all I mean

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.200 
the right layer up that's all I mean
that'll<00:01:11.590> make<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:12.009> pattern<00:01:12.369> on<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.670> side<00:01:12.880> but

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
that'll make the pattern on the side but

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.469 
that'll make the pattern on the side but
you<00:01:13.420> need<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.690> move<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.990> cube<00:01:14.229> down<00:01:14.440> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you need to move the cube down and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.480 
you need to move the cube down and
simply<00:01:16.479> move<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.869> middle<00:01:17.050> layers<00:01:17.530> here<00:01:18.190> left

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
simply move the middle layers here left

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.240 
simply move the middle layers here left
and<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.840> will<00:01:20.020> happen<00:01:20.200> on<00:01:20.500> all<00:01:20.740> these<00:01:20.979> sides

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
and it will happen on all these sides

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.249 
and it will happen on all these sides
nope<00:01:25.410> now<00:01:26.410> to<00:01:26.470> solve<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:27.100> yet<00:01:27.610> I'll<00:01:27.880> find<00:01:28.750> the

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
nope now to solve it yet I'll find the

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.830 
nope now to solve it yet I'll find the
three<00:01:29.590> sides<00:01:30.550> that<00:01:30.940> have<00:01:31.740> matching<00:01:32.740> cubes<00:01:33.340> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
three sides that have matching cubes and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.930 
three sides that have matching cubes and
this<00:01:34.840> kind<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.229> hadn't<00:01:35.560> work<00:01:35.770> this<00:01:36.190> metal<00:01:36.670> cube

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
this kind of hadn't work this metal cube

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.730 
this kind of hadn't work this metal cube
matches<00:01:37.539> with<00:01:37.720> this<00:01:38.020> outer<00:01:38.369> side<00:01:39.369> up<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:40.740> this

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
matches with this outer side up and this

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.040 
matches with this outer side up and this
in<00:01:41.950> turn<00:01:41.979> cube<00:01:42.369> matches<00:01:43.060> up<00:01:43.209> with<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:43.780> outer

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
in turn cube matches up with this outer

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.029 
in turn cube matches up with this outer
side<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.800> same<00:01:45.009> thing<00:01:45.190> with<00:01:45.340> this<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.970> oh

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
side and the same thing with this and oh

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.309 
side and the same thing with this and oh
okay<00:01:48.039> so<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.300> side<00:01:49.509> we'll<00:01:49.660> be<00:01:49.810> working<00:01:50.289> with

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
okay so the side we'll be working with

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.410 
okay so the side we'll be working with
is<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.800> bottom<00:01:51.160> one

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
is the bottom one

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.570 
is the bottom one
we'll<00:01:52.420> make<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.440> like<00:01:53.679> that<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.429> the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
we'll make it like that so that the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.820 
we'll make it like that so that the
other<00:01:54.610> sides<00:01:55.090> on<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.509> top<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.679> right

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
other sides on the top and the right

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.020 
other sides on the top and the right
okay<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:58.060> move<00:01:58.270> your<00:01:58.869> left<00:01:59.050> layer<00:01:59.349> down<00:02:00.130> you

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
okay you move your left layer down you

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.029 
okay you move your left layer down you
right<00:02:01.209> layer<00:02:01.420> down<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.830> move<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.160> middle<00:02:03.840> go

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
right layer down and move the middle go

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.040 
right layer down and move the middle go
now<00:02:06.039> you<00:02:06.099> move<00:02:06.459> your<00:02:06.670> left<00:02:06.789> side<00:02:07.119> up<00:02:07.330> your

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
now you move your left side up your

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.520 
now you move your left side up your
right<00:02:08.170> side<00:02:08.410> up<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.830> then<00:02:09.610> this<00:02:09.759> side<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.030> soft

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
right side up and then this side is soft

right side up and then this side is soft
now<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.590> move<00:02:11.950> your<00:02:12.099> cube<00:02:12.370> down<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.590> one<00:02:14.590> more

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
now you move your cube down and one more

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.460 
now you move your cube down and one more
time<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:16.750> soft

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470
