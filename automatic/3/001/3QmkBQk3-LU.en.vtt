00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.149 
tango a piece of paper you came back for
your<00:01:56.850> fast<00:01:57.119> password<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.110> usually<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:58.920> was

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
your fast password and usually that was

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219 
your fast password and usually that was
the<00:01:59.250> case<00:01:59.399> with<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.909> more<00:02:00.270> popular<00:02:00.659> rides<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the case with the more popular rides and

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.980 
the case with the more popular rides and
I<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.890> every<00:02:02.100> riot<00:02:02.340> has<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:02.759> except<00:02:03.630> little

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
I think every riot has one except little

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.289 
I think every riot has one except little
kid<00:02:04.170> rides<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.649> stuff<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.299> yeah

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
kid rides and stuff like that but yeah

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.749

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
pretty much every ride has one of them

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.090 
pretty much every ride has one of them
but<00:02:08.759> now<00:02:09.000> what<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:09.629> do<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.970> they

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
can't get in here down here and all that

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.320 
can't get in here down here and all that
but<00:03:04.660> but<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.380> will<00:03:06.070> probably<00:03:06.550> notify<00:03:07.000> them<00:03:07.180> if

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
but but it will probably notify them if

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.380 
but but it will probably notify them if
you<00:03:07.450> don't<00:03:07.950> if<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.010> don't<00:03:09.160> use<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.430> correctly

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
you don't if you don't use it correctly

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.710 
you don't if you don't use it correctly
so<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:12.100> yeah<00:03:12.220> what<00:03:12.850> do<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.000> think<00:03:13.030> of<00:03:13.330> this<00:03:13.480> I

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
so so yeah what do I think of this I

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.840 
so so yeah what do I think of this I
think<00:03:14.590> it's<00:03:14.740> a<00:03:14.890> lot<00:03:15.070> more<00:03:15.100> efficient<00:03:15.730> because

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
think it's a lot more efficient because

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.130 
think it's a lot more efficient because
now<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.210> don't<00:03:16.570> have<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:17.580> like<00:03:18.580> go<00:03:19.450> over<00:03:19.870> and

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
now you don't have to like go over and

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.720 
now you don't have to like go over and
get<00:03:20.230> in<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.380> big<00:03:20.560> line<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:20.860> way<00:03:21.190> for<00:03:21.400> people<00:03:21.430> to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
get in a big line a way for people to

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.340 
get in a big line a way for people to
get<00:03:21.940> these<00:03:22.090> tickets<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.720> your<00:03:22.810> card<00:03:23.050> won't

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
get these tickets and your card won't

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.800 
get these tickets and your card won't
get<00:03:23.530> jammed<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:25.150> know<00:03:25.240> anyone<00:03:25.540> have<00:03:25.690> that

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
get jammed and you know anyone have that

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.000 
get jammed and you know anyone have that
problem<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:27.160> don't<00:03:27.700> know<00:03:27.790> if<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.920> feel<00:03:29.920> like
