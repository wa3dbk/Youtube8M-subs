I know that's what I love about being a
herpetologist<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:34.579> around<00:00:35.579> every<00:00:35.940> corner

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
herpetologist that around every corner

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.560 
herpetologist that around every corner
there's<00:00:36.300> always<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> new<00:00:37.129> surprise<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.760> this

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
there's always a new surprise and this

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.020 
there's always a new surprise and this
is<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.960> them<00:00:40.190> to<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.370> gorgeous<00:00:41.670> little

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
is one of them to that gorgeous little

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.100 
is one of them to that gorgeous little
face<00:00:42.920> absolutely<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.670> take<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> look<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:45.989> his

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
face absolutely and take a look at his

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.520 
face absolutely and take a look at his
body<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:47.160> ventral<00:00:47.579> scales<00:00:47.910> are<00:00:48.870> squirt<00:00:49.320> off

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
body the ventral scales are squirt off

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.889 
body the ventral scales are squirt off
almost<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.760> gives<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.510> great

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
almost like this and that gives it great

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.170 
almost like this and that gives it great
traction<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.620> climbing<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.039> tree<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:54.059> I'm

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
traction it's climbing up a tree and I'm

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.540 
traction it's climbing up a tree and I'm
guessing<00:00:54.480> by<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.660> width<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> tail<00:00:56.129> basis

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
guessing by the width of the tail basis

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.049 
guessing by the width of the tail basis
of<00:00:56.670> mail<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.710> probably<00:00:59.190> trying<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.579> at

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
of mail so it's probably trying to at

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.250 
of mail so it's probably trying to at
this<00:01:00.210> time<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.449> year<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.750> probably<00:01:01.020> trying<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
this time of year is probably trying to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.690 
this time of year is probably trying to
find<00:01:01.500> some<00:01:01.710> hibernation<00:01:02.399> spots<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:05.309> don't

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
