but I think this is the the easiest

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.150 
but I think this is the the easiest
solution<00:00:39.379> to<00:00:40.379> make<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.649> look<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.890> it's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
have a hot pink I think those very easy

have a hot pink I think those very easy
to<00:02:13.230> install<00:02:13.580> basically<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.670> three<00:02:14.790> dots

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
to install basically have three dots

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.240 
to install basically have three dots
indicating<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.750> steps<00:02:16.050> first<00:02:16.590> step<00:02:16.860> second

indicating the steps first step second

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.160 
indicating the steps first step second
step<00:02:17.280> third<00:02:17.490> step<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:18.180> doesn't<00:02:18.420> matter

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
step third step it doesn't matter

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.570 
step third step it doesn't matter

decide to put your one on there um I did
not<00:02:23.430> pulling<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.760> there<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.230> personally<00:02:25.230> like

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
not pulling on there I personally like

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.190 
not pulling on there I personally like
it<00:02:25.760> just<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.850> be<00:02:26.910> all<00:02:27.030> black<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.080> have

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
all the silver really easy to install

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.930 
all the silver really easy to install
now<00:02:33.569> when<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.840> comes<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.200> removing<00:02:34.940> the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
now when it comes to removing the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.000 
now when it comes to removing the
spectra<00:02:36.360> wrap<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:37.230> does<00:02:37.590> leave<00:02:37.890> residue<00:02:40.010> says

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
spectra wrap it does leave residue says

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.070 
spectra wrap it does leave residue says
it<00:02:41.160> doesn't<00:02:41.459> leave<00:02:41.580> any<00:02:41.700> residue<00:02:41.880> but<00:02:42.300> um<00:02:42.480> let

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
it doesn't leave any residue but um let

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.310 
it doesn't leave any residue but um let
me<00:02:43.110> try<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.320> had<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.650> on<00:02:43.800> for<00:02:43.980> about<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.489> day<00:02:45.320> but

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
me try I had this on for about a day but

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.460 
me try I had this on for about a day but
from<00:02:46.470> previous<00:02:46.890> experiences<00:02:48.080> I've<00:02:49.080> noticed

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
from previous experiences I've noticed

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.870 
from previous experiences I've noticed
where<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.830> has<00:02:50.010> left<00:02:50.250> residue<00:02:50.790> behind<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.850> I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
where that has left residue behind so I

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.259 
where that has left residue behind so I
think<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.600> think<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:55.019> how<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.200> peel<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:56.269> of

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
think it's I think is how you peel it of

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.729 
think it's I think is how you peel it of
course<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.660> peel<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.810> fast<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:01.470> know<00:03:01.560> for

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
course you can peel it fast you know for

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.110 
course you can peel it fast you know for
some<00:03:01.860> reason<00:03:02.160> I'm<00:03:02.280> not<00:03:02.430> getting<00:03:02.730> any<00:03:02.819> residue

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
some reason I'm not getting any residue

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.910 
some reason I'm not getting any residue
but<00:03:03.269> um<00:03:03.450> I'll<00:03:03.989> Noah<00:03:04.140> beside<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.530> says<00:03:04.709> it's

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
but um I'll Noah beside it says it's

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.539 
but um I'll Noah beside it says it's
designed<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.340> leave<00:03:05.489> no<00:03:05.610> residue<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:08.310> far<00:03:08.459> it

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
designed to leave no residue so far it

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.789 
designed to leave no residue so far it
looks<00:03:08.579> pretty<00:03:08.910> good<00:03:09.060> but<00:03:09.690> this<00:03:09.780> is<00:03:09.840> notices

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
looks pretty good but this is notices

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.900 
looks pretty good but this is notices
have<00:03:10.920> been<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.190> for<00:03:11.400> only<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.940> day<00:03:13.579> now<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.640> card

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
have been on for only a day now the card

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.130 
have been on for only a day now the card
about<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> spectra<00:03:15.480> wrap<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.810> not<00:03:15.959> going<00:03:16.079> to

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
about the spectra wrap is not going to

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.819 
about the spectra wrap is not going to
work<00:03:16.200> into<00:03:16.470> any<00:03:16.709> tight<00:03:17.640> cases<00:03:18.260> such<00:03:19.260> as<00:03:19.290> in

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
work into any tight cases such as in

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.750 
work into any tight cases such as in
case<00:03:20.130> sliders<00:03:20.640> hard<00:03:21.450> cases<00:03:21.989> on<00:03:22.400> some<00:03:23.400> cases

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
case sliders hard cases on some cases

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.970 
case sliders hard cases on some cases
will<00:03:23.910> work<00:03:24.060> like<00:03:24.209> snap-on<00:03:24.570> cases<00:03:25.019> or<00:03:25.709> leather

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
will work like snap-on cases or leather

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.750 
will work like snap-on cases or leather
cases<00:03:26.400> but<00:03:26.579> not<00:03:26.640> like<00:03:27.420> slider<00:03:27.720> cases<00:03:28.170> where

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
cases but not like slider cases where

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.520 
cases but not like slider cases where
where<00:03:29.760> they're<00:03:29.910> precise<00:03:31.549> cut<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.850> everything
