able to support them or something to
happen<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.180> computer<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.690> be<00:02:11.780> able<00:02:11.810> to

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
happen to the computer to be able to

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.449 
happen to the computer to be able to
deploy<00:02:12.260> something<00:02:12.620> right<00:02:12.739> away<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:13.310> them

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
deploy something right away to them

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.699 
deploy something right away to them
without<00:02:13.690> basically<00:02:14.690> interfere<00:02:15.500> with<00:02:15.620> their

the<00:03:58.799> littlest<00:03:59.160> thing<00:03:59.340> mattered<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.760> me

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
the littlest thing mattered to me

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.690 
the littlest thing mattered to me
actually<00:04:00.150> being<00:04:00.959> able<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.260> drill<00:04:01.560> down<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:02.250> see

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
actually being able to drill down to see

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.940 
actually being able to drill down to see
how<00:04:02.820> much<00:04:02.970> memory<00:04:03.209> was<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.720> computer<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.320> to

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
how much memory was in a computer and to

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.349 
how much memory was in a computer and to
actually<00:04:05.130> know<00:04:05.370> how<00:04:05.489> many<00:04:05.670> memories<00:04:06.030> in<00:04:06.120> each

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
actually know how many memories in each

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.569 
actually know how many memories in each
slots<00:04:06.780> really<00:04:07.440> helpful<00:04:07.799> for<00:04:07.829> me<00:04:07.950> because<00:04:08.310> I

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
at a desktop management solution what

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.400 
at a desktop management solution what
would<00:04:45.970> you<00:04:46.090> ask<00:04:46.180> them<00:04:46.390> to<00:04:46.480> look<00:04:46.630> for<00:04:46.900> um<00:04:49.410> what

easy<00:05:12.880> to<00:05:12.970> install<00:05:13.210> um<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.140> don't<00:05:14.800> all<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.100> other

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
easy to install um I don't all the other

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.700 
easy to install um I don't all the other
products<00:05:15.520> I've<00:05:15.610> tried<00:05:15.940> this<00:05:16.630> was<00:05:16.870> easiest<00:05:17.500> so

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
products I've tried this was easiest so

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.090 
products I've tried this was easiest so
I<00:05:17.770> was<00:05:17.950> kind<00:05:18.100> of<00:05:18.190> slow<00:05:18.370> down<00:05:18.400> that<00:05:18.790> only<00:05:19.030> and<00:05:20.100> to

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
I was kind of slow down that only and to

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.720 
I was kind of slow down that only and to
make<00:05:21.280> email<00:05:21.700> ads<00:05:21.850> IT<00:05:22.240> staff<00:05:22.780> life<00:05:23.730> basically
