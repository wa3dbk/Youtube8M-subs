00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
just ended up shooting it just to make

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.729 
just ended up shooting it just to make
sure<00:00:57.090> there<00:00:57.420> wasn't<00:00:57.570> anything<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> when<00:00:58.710> I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
sure there wasn't anything in it when I

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.830 
sure there wasn't anything in it when I
shot<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.280> some<00:00:59.460> sort<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.730> golden<00:01:00.239> piece<00:01:00.570> fell

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
shot it some sort of golden piece fell

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.420 
shot it some sort of golden piece fell
out<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.500> tried<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> pick<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
out of it and I tried to pick it up and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.250 
out of it and I tried to pick it up and
wouldn't<00:01:02.910> let<00:01:03.180> me<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:03.719> some<00:01:03.899> reason<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
wouldn't let me and for some reason it

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.810 
wouldn't let me and for some reason it
just<00:01:04.320> disappeared<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.220> happened<00:01:05.610> twice

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
just disappeared and it's happened twice

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.580 
just disappeared and it's happened twice
already<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.900> don't<00:01:07.170> know<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
already so I don't know if this is the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.050 
already so I don't know if this is the
part<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> easter<00:01:08.220> egg<00:01:08.340> I'm<00:01:08.490> assuming<00:01:08.939> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
part of the easter egg I'm assuming it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060 
part of the easter egg I'm assuming it
is<00:01:09.270> maybe<00:01:09.659> I'm<00:01:09.930> missing<00:01:10.409> something<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
is maybe I'm missing something that I

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.859 
is maybe I'm missing something that I
was<00:01:11.189> supposed<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.820> since<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.450> wasn't<00:01:12.750> able
