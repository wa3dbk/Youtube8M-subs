00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:07.190 
with safety in mind caterpillar is given

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.129 
with safety in mind caterpillar is given
the<00:00:07.310> operator<00:00:07.640> two<00:00:08.210> ways<00:00:08.390> to<00:00:08.660> get<00:00:08.809> out<00:00:08.930> of<00:00:09.050> it

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
the operator two ways to get out of it

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.420 
the operator two ways to get out of it
to<00:00:09.260> lower<00:00:09.380> the<00:00:09.559> boom<00:00:09.680> and<00:00:09.920> get<00:00:10.010> out<00:00:10.070> of<00:00:10.160> the<00:00:10.220> cab

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.430 
to lower the boom and get out of the cab

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.030 
to lower the boom and get out of the cab
in<00:00:10.910> case<00:00:11.270> of<00:00:11.480> emergency<00:00:11.930> running<00:00:12.650> out<00:00:12.740> of<00:00:12.830> fuel

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
in case of emergency running out of fuel

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.310 
in case of emergency running out of fuel
or<00:00:13.700> a<00:00:14.120> mechanical<00:00:14.750> failure

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
or a mechanical failure

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.780 
or a mechanical failure
the<00:00:15.650> first<00:00:15.860> way<00:00:16.010> that<00:00:16.040> Jeff's<00:00:16.580> going<00:00:16.700> to

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
the first way that Jeff's going to

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.080 
the first way that Jeff's going to
demonstrate<00:00:16.970> is<00:00:17.540> our<00:00:18.279> use<00:00:19.279> of<00:00:19.310> an<00:00:19.550> accumulator

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
demonstrate is our use of an accumulator

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.140 
demonstrate is our use of an accumulator
to<00:00:20.150> lower<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.660> boom<00:00:20.779> and<00:00:21.079> level<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.560> bucket

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
to lower the boom and level the bucket

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.290 
to lower the boom and level the bucket
and<00:00:23.150> get<00:00:23.360> the<00:00:23.509> boom<00:00:23.930> down<00:00:27.759> Jeff<00:00:28.759> turn<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.119> key

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
and get the boom down Jeff turn the key

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.540 
and get the boom down Jeff turn the key
switch<00:00:29.450> on<00:00:29.810> hit<00:00:30.290> the<00:00:30.410> parking<00:00:30.770> brake<00:00:30.919> once<00:00:31.189> and

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
switch on hit the parking brake once and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.940 
switch on hit the parking brake once and
uses<00:00:32.210> his<00:00:32.360> implement<00:00:32.899> control<00:00:33.260> to<00:00:33.590> lower<00:00:33.739> the

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
uses his implement control to lower the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.240 
uses his implement control to lower the
boom<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.250> ground<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:34.910> level<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.270> bucket

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
boom to the ground and level the bucket

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.990 
boom to the ground and level the bucket
so<00:00:37.250> he'll<00:00:37.370> be<00:00:37.519> able<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:37.670> go<00:00:37.760> out<00:00:37.850> of<00:00:37.940> that

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
so he'll be able to go out of that

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.729 
so he'll be able to go out of that
machine<00:00:38.210> in<00:00:38.870> an<00:00:39.050> emergency<00:00:47.050> now<00:00:48.050> Jeff's<00:00:48.559> gonna

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739

boom all the way up to the top and
demonstrate<00:00:52.910> how<00:00:52.940> we<00:00:53.120> also<00:00:53.390> use<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.690> manual

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
demonstrate how we also use a manual
