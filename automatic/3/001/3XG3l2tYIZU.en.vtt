00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.230
 about traditional physical activities 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.020
 which are practiced in academies and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.300
 parks throughout Brazil and around the world. 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.870
 especially popular and for 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.950
 many in pt on a loop 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.059
 questions I get many will be 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.840
 than bodybuilding in a daycare center. 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.399
 truth

 do these exercises to lose 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.940
 belly that we both see on the internet 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.070
 magazines really work 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.480
 the former understands that bodybuilding is 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.949
 in what I call activities 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.829
 traditional physical 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.030
 most of them just for you 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.210
 to confuse over our chat 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.290
 97% of the exercises to lose weight I speak 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.049
 understand that what is wrong is not a 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.670
 exercise to lose weight but the way 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.680
 do this exercise 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.070
 these exercises that you do in 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.320
 gym in the park be on the street 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.409
 treadmill is pedaling a bicycle in the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.240
 street or exercise machine is pulling weight or 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.409
 even swimming physical activity 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.659
 has the following 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.790
 characteristics first it usually 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.130
 is done at a constant pace 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.990
 that is, there is no variation in the rhythm 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.630
 according to what is done during an interval 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.960
 of relatively long time varying in 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.189
 average of 30 to 60 minutes for 30 socks 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.140
 hour one hour 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.720
 third is done with the frequency of 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.759
 three to five times a week on average 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.590
 then if the traditional exercises are 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.049
 basically aerobic because they 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.509
 they consume a lot of oxygen and 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.350
 they strengthen heart lungs vessels 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.520
 blood 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.930
 but does this exercise of the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.060
 traditional emagrecentro really 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.280
 play the role in weight loss 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.990
 is that good science says about it the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.340
 good science, or studies of 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.520
 high level of scientific evidence 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.819
 of the world's largest universities in 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.110
 show that traditional exercises 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.660
 traditional bodybuilding is also here 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.280
 remember as they are they will burn fat 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.780
 but they will also burn muscles or 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.940
 either you will lose a little weight 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.610
 initially but with the loss of 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.380
 lean muscle mass in the medium term 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.840
 you will suffer from a serious problem that 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.870
 it's the accordion effect where you win everything 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.720
 the weight lost and further damaging 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.850
 your metabolism is morally sad 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.790
 story is that this ends up causing 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.959
 frustration and discouragement in practice 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.030
 activities 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.370
 the burning of lean mass generates what I 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.480
 I call it damaging metabolism 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.890
 basal 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.450
 I always like to remember that the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.430
 Your body's metabolism is like 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.590
 the fire that must be burning in 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.770
 full steam for you to lose weight with 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.640
 health and time ie burn fat 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.300
 corporal 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.880
 some time ago I made a videocast and the 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.860
 subject was going without food and thin and 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.170
 I explained how your metabolism reacts 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.660
 the accordion effect and these fad diets 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.120
 and miraculous exercises 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.040
 so I will not stick to the details 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.900
 of metabolism I want to focus only on 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.660

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.900

 in addition to bringing great results by 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.770

 after staying for another 3 minutes 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.370
 again at a moderate speed and 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.990
