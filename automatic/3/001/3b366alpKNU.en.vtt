this tutorial is on how to make fabric
coasters<00:00:03.030> I'm<00:00:03.330> gonna<00:00:03.629> be<00:00:03.750> using<00:00:03.870> two

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
coasters I'm gonna be using two

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.900 
coasters I'm gonna be using two
different<00:00:04.230> colors<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.799> fabric<00:00:04.950> they're<00:00:05.759> both

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
different colors of fabric they're both

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.009 
different colors of fabric they're both

100% cotton home deco fabric first of
all<00:00:10.110> we're<00:00:10.260> gonna<00:00:10.380> cut<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.490> side<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.940> one<00:00:12.090> of

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
all we're gonna cut the side of one of

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.020 
all we're gonna cut the side of one of
them<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.480> make<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.870> straight<00:00:13.320> side<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.099> I'm

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
them to make it a straight side and I'm

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.279 
them to make it a straight side and I'm
gonna<00:00:15.120> use<00:00:15.269> heavy-duty<00:00:15.690> because<00:00:16.020> I'm<00:00:16.109> going

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
gonna use heavy-duty because I'm going

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.189 
gonna use heavy-duty because I'm going
to<00:00:16.379> two<00:00:16.560> layers<00:00:17.390> slide<00:00:18.390> right<00:00:18.630> along<00:00:18.869> there

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
to two layers slide right along there

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.210 
to two layers slide right along there
and<00:00:19.500> cut<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.160> off<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.930> then<00:00:21.930> next<00:00:22.320> we're

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
and cut that off and then next we're

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.679 
and cut that off and then next we're
going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.430> work<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.029> other<00:00:24.180> side<00:00:24.449> and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
going to work on the other side and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.089 
going to work on the other side and
we're<00:00:24.869> going<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> cut<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> straight<00:00:25.619> line<00:00:25.859> on

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
we're going to cut a straight line on

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.310 
we're going to cut a straight line on
that<00:00:26.390> this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.599> where<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.810> decide<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> width

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
that this is where you decide the width

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.650 
that this is where you decide the width
of<00:00:28.500> your<00:00:28.590> coasters<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.640> cut<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.000> whatever<00:00:30.420> we

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
of your coasters so cut out whatever we

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.560 
of your coasters so cut out whatever we
do<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.730> usually<00:00:32.730> stick<00:00:32.910> around<00:00:33.059> 4

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
do you like I usually stick around 4

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.020 
do you like I usually stick around 4
inches<00:00:34.260> won't<00:00:35.190> you're<00:00:35.340> done<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.610> that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
inches won't you're done with that

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.369 
inches won't you're done with that
it's<00:00:36.840> time<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.230> go<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> other<00:00:37.620> color<00:00:38.040> now

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
it's time to go to the other color now

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.740 
it's time to go to the other color now
now<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.440> need<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:41.059> cut<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.300> side<00:00:42.570> straight

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
now you need to cut one side straight

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.430 
now you need to cut one side straight
like<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.230> did<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> other<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:45.260> I'm<00:00:46.260> going

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
like we did on the other one I'm going

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.630 
like we did on the other one I'm going
to<00:00:46.500> line<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:46.920> into<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> corner<00:00:49.640> that's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
to line that up into the corner that's

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.840 
to line that up into the corner that's
where<00:00:50.850> these<00:00:50.940> rulers<00:00:51.390> come<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.899> very<00:00:52.260> handy

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
where these rulers come in very handy

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.700 
where these rulers come in very handy
now<00:00:53.870> after<00:00:54.870> we're<00:00:54.960> done<00:00:55.050> cutting<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.469> one

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
now after we're done cutting that one

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
now after we're done cutting that one
side<00:00:55.980> straight<00:00:56.100> we're<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.760> cut<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
side straight we're going to cut the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.630 
side straight we're going to cut the
other<00:00:57.420> side<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.320> same<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:59.160> make<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> same

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
other side the same to make it the same

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.740 
other side the same to make it the same
width<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.570> other<00:01:00.750> color<00:01:02.420> this<00:01:03.420> doesn't

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
width as the other color this doesn't

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.700 
width as the other color this doesn't
take<00:01:03.899> too<00:01:04.049> much<00:01:04.080> math<00:01:09.170> just<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.290> simple<00:01:10.590> way<00:01:10.680> of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
take too much math just a simple way of

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.840 
take too much math just a simple way of
double-checking<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.340> they're<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> same

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
double-checking that they're the same

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.250 
double-checking that they're the same
width<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.420> lay<00:01:12.540> them<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.810> top<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.140> each

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
width is to lay them on top of each

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.740 
width is to lay them on top of each
other<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.790> look<00:01:14.880> about<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> same

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
other you have to look about the same

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.560 
other you have to look about the same
so<00:01:16.140> now<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.740> need<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> cut<00:01:17.549> them<00:01:18.060> into<00:01:18.180> squares

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
so now we need to cut them into squares

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.590 
so now we need to cut them into squares
lined<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.680> nice<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:19.890> straight<00:01:20.420> I'm<00:01:21.420> gonna

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
lined up nice and straight I'm gonna

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.719 
lined up nice and straight I'm gonna
trim<00:01:21.960> off<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.470> end<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.340> won't<00:01:23.490> use

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
trim off the end because we won't use

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.940 
trim off the end because we won't use
that<00:01:25.549> lined<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.869> then<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.470> cut<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.780> so

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
that lined it up and then you cut it so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.200 
that lined it up and then you cut it so
this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.009> where<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.400> handy<00:01:32.790> little<00:01:32.820> thing

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
this is where this handy little thing

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.359 
this is where this handy little thing
comes<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.720> has<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.560> diagonal<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.159> there

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
comes in has a little diagonal on there

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.859 
comes in has a little diagonal on there
and<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.030> slide<00:01:36.150> right<00:01:36.479> down<00:01:36.600> there

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and you can just slide right down there

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.140 
and you can just slide right down there
making<00:01:37.530> sure<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> top<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.729> diagonal

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
making sure that the top of the diagonal

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.210 
making sure that the top of the diagonal
is<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> corner<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.560> bottom<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.009> on

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
is up in the corner and the bottom is on

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.719 
is up in the corner and the bottom is on
the<00:01:41.250> edge<00:01:42.530> now<00:01:43.530> very<00:01:43.770> unscientific<00:01:44.220> way<00:01:44.670> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the edge now very unscientific way to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.810 
the edge now very unscientific way to
cut<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> next<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.380> lay<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.670> you

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
cut the next one is to lay the one you

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.910 
cut the next one is to lay the one you
just<00:01:47.970> cut<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.360> top<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.439> lay<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> ruler

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
just cut on top and then lay the ruler

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.219 
just cut on top and then lay the ruler
on<00:01:50.070> top<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> exact<00:01:52.200> same

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
on top of that to get the exact same

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.850 
on top of that to get the exact same
size<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.180> just<00:01:54.180> keep<00:01:54.450> cutting<00:01:54.899> until<00:01:55.110> you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
size and just keep cutting until you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.300 
size and just keep cutting until you
have<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.399> many<00:01:57.140> sides<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.469> need<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.009> since

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
