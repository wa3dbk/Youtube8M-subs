00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.110
 he refutes that desirable football also play and turn it into a factory 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.559
 And in that sense that in that direction Ukraine players developed so was one 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.289
 spectacular in particular the final phase ff 2 2 of mvv can be fired or 3 2 of 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.289
 vvv all results possible 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.900
 yes that's right back home short term back in vvv european banks 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.470
 play 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.800
 and then it all created a lot of space for us 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.570
 but with our fast players, yes, they are therefore full of danger 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:31.710
 taken care of 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.710
 but they also got the chance when we had more 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.590
 opportunistic game so to speak 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.110
 the number of opportunities created so could go in all directions yes that is only 10 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.130
 those people stopped against the team 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.840
 which is now in the second season if we do not hit it again and one 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 team that actually has yes promotion aspirations naturally turn that 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.040
 sense the current and we can we can hopefully imagine that you are there 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.040
 a bit pissed off street in that sense of the Jack Tuyp could have won 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.559
 it is the one stands for 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.710
 the three minutes before time yes then of course it is also a bit of course 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.610
 We were not disappointed 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.850
 have drawn the name across the line 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.570
 and that has been successful so far every time in competition 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.619
 stopped against a ssl his red carpet and yes and tonight from now it is 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.580
 failed and maybe it has to do with the jaap is busy 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.150
 program we had and 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.640
 we also went to england last week for the impression premier league 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.100
 an international cape 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.189
 so matches stack of nice clean up jade that is nice but yes the will 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.820
 also show that with certain on the fatigue that I have 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.610
 often trainers in front of the camera that if you do the current job but terpstra it 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.040
 most important is that we have grabbed a point or three points 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.280
 I have to tell you that you are just a little bit different 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.020
 no but it is known for you to learn for you and for everyone 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.020
 what matters is participating once 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.820
 as a coach, I think that I was the first to make it, yes, it is clear that 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.499
 the 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.869
 in the first place, developments of this player are central and 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.279
 and then I first look at first of course I am a winner as a coach 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.049
 and willeke also win I also definitely read to win too 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.719
 if you sit when you've seen them in the dressing room after the game 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.489
 yes then they were just very disappointed that they just didn't have it 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.259
 won 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.729
 it has been a no party to the rest after the game I can do that 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.589
 say delicious 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:37.700
 it is already the seventh place that actually goes two things 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.859
 but yes in our view 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.919
 being real in us is of course very important 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.400
 that players say develop the way we want it
