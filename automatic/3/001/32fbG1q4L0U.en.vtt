 let's learn with your comments 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.040
 Febrile convulsions

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.360
 abrupt 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.160
 per cent that can be donostia type mantegna 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.100
 or with displacement 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.180
 that can be produced for one hundred percent by one hundred epochal of one of my body 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.440
 or it can be generalized 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.070
 in the context of a December thermal boost 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.620
 always by the way and dorrego was above 38 degrees Celsius 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.050
 somehow 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.770
 yes they activate in June you have an atheistic predisposition network compulsions 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.770
 hackers develop this episode 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.040
 Febrile seizures by definition percent 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.590
 it is established that they appear from 6 months of age until about five 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.650
 years 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.130
 having although in the period of one to three years you will see a recurrence 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.820
 oo a tendency to present a higher number of convulsive febrile events 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.940
 percent this within these entities 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.490
 in such a way that in this period of one to three years that is 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.880
 is where parents should in some way be connected to how 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.550
 handle febrile seizures the approach you can rule out because if 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.320
 It is a simple febrile seizure 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.420
 in which per hundred and there is no compromise of the central nervous system 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.759
 inter recurrence actors that this patient could have 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.070
 you should also look for the parents of the driving 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.789
 one of the therapeutic alternatives that are used soon the 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.729
 called intermittent tito treatment 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:25.699
 or permanent type intermittent type with those used in 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.699
 simple febrile convulsions like her on the fifa day 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.930
 the day that padilla used so that somehow within the first 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.869
 24 48 pure fiction 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:40.209
 today that has had as excellent tell him that he has factors the recurrence of 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.640
 to have a new one with a lot that April 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.480
 Without minimizing the risk, you still have to resort to the episode again 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.559
 together with the measures that we said earlier as well that the 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:55.739
 fidelity chemotherapy is faithful and the local technician did not feel ventilated 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.699
 santi villa ethical and jointly the day know when the start the 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.689
 temperature above 38 degrees 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.980
 the other type of treatment that the john specialist has already established 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.189
 European that through these complex febrile convulsions 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.369
 would be permanent treatment that is used with anti-percent drugs and 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.169
 convulsing remains identical 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.549
 like phenobarbital and like hegel valproic acid 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.619
 that can be done and has been established by the specialist 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:28.689
 where there is some way put c patient will be under control p percent d 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.399
 specialist because in some easy way and the treatment 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.239
 anticonvulsants 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.819
 so we can minimize the risk because that patient deteriorates in the fmi 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.730
 most of the parents really this one after a first 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.859
 experience and then beaver you have to explain in a way quite by 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.999
 educational cent leader and who trust in confidence regarding the event if 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:57.480
 handle satisfactorily let's say in the presentation of the crisis with 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.800
 music
