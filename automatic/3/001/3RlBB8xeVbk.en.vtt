00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
nice but to be to be found when I stick

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.590 
nice but to be to be found when I stick
with<00:01:21.570> long<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:22.350> small<00:01:23.299> headband<00:01:24.299> similar

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
with long with small headband similar

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300 
with long with small headband similar
because<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.900> also<00:01:25.170> makes<00:01:25.590> his<00:01:25.740> forehead<00:01:26.070> look

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
because it also makes his forehead look

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.850 
because it also makes his forehead look
big<00:01:27.180> which<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.689> exactly<00:01:28.200> how<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.439> want<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
big which is exactly how I want it to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.670 
big which is exactly how I want it to
look<00:01:29.009> hair<00:01:29.729> color<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.270> brown

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
look hair color is going to be brown

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
look hair color is going to be brown
because<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.040> his<00:01:32.130> color<00:01:32.400> Black's

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
because that is his color Black's

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.910 
because that is his color Black's
obviously<00:01:33.090> too<00:01:33.360> dark<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.750> Brown<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> decent

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
obviously too dark so Brown is a decent

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.840 
obviously too dark so Brown is a decent
color<00:01:35.130> their<00:01:36.409> facial<00:01:37.409> hair<00:01:37.619> style<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.670> mean

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
color their facial hair style I mean

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
color their facial hair style I mean
again<00:01:39.450> there's<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.740> one

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
again there's not really the right one

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.520 
again there's not really the right one
for<00:01:41.100> him<00:01:41.310> he<00:01:41.790> does<00:01:41.970> sometimes<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.200> chin

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
for him he does sometimes have this chin

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.620 
for him he does sometimes have this chin
stubble<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:44.939> think<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.149> looks<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
stubble but I don't think it looks that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.149 
stubble but I don't think it looks that
great<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.290> honest<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> way<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.950> Feith

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
great to be honest the way that Feith

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.230 
great to be honest the way that Feith
FIFA<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.700> done<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:49.850> mean<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.030> doesn't

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
FIFA have done it I mean that doesn't

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.120 
FIFA have done it I mean that doesn't

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
look like him that doesn't like him that

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it's kind of okay but it looks a little

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.740 
it's kind of okay but it looks a little
bit<00:01:56.189> too<00:01:56.399> thick<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.880> bit<00:01:57.060> too<00:01:57.210> intense<00:01:57.540> but

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
bit too thick and a bit too intense but

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.450 
bit too thick and a bit too intense but
hey<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.409> could<00:01:58.710> use<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.340> be

do<00:03:48.840> something<00:03:49.080> like<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:49.740> you<00:03:50.190> know<00:03:50.220> I

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
do something like that but you know I

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.160 
do something like that but you know I
think<00:03:50.460> a<00:03:50.730> natural<00:03:50.970> kind<00:03:51.330> of<00:03:51.480> look<00:03:51.720> looks

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
think a natural kind of look looks

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.630 
think a natural kind of look looks
fairly<00:03:52.440> decent<00:03:52.530> because<00:03:53.040> when<00:03:53.520> you're

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
fairly decent because when you're

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.850 
fairly decent because when you're
playing<00:03:53.850> this<00:03:54.180> game<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:55.260> animations<00:03:55.740> will

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
playing this game the animations will

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.960 
playing this game the animations will
kick<00:03:56.100> in<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.490> will<00:03:56.580> make<00:03:56.760> him<00:03:56.880> look

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
kick in and it will make him look

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.780 
kick in and it will make him look
angrier<00:03:57.510> or<00:03:57.780> whatever<00:03:58.440> or<00:03:58.680> sets<00:03:59.550> if<00:03:59.700> he's

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
angrier or whatever or sets if he's

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.540 
angrier or whatever or sets if he's
missed<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.120> chance<00:04:00.330> so<00:04:00.990> I'll<00:04:01.290> just<00:04:01.410> use<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.800> keep

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
missed a chance so I'll just use it keep

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.450 
missed a chance so I'll just use it keep
it<00:04:02.700> very<00:04:02.910> neutral<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.830> eyebrows<00:04:05.160> are<00:04:05.370> of
