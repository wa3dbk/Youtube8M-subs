video basically a little update on my

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.960 
video basically a little update on my
water<00:00:06.450> dragons<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.080> their<00:00:07.200> habitat<00:00:07.649> so<00:00:08.610> used

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
water dragons and their habitat so used

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.570 
water dragons and their habitat so used
to<00:00:09.000> have<00:00:09.150> two<00:00:09.360> cages<00:00:09.599> that<00:00:10.139> were<00:00:10.230> basically

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
to have two cages that were basically

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.039 
to have two cages that were basically
four<00:00:11.580> feet<00:00:11.759> tall<00:00:11.969> two<00:00:12.269> feet<00:00:12.480> wide<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.900> two

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
four feet tall two feet wide and two

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.029 
four feet tall two feet wide and two
feet<00:00:13.259> in<00:00:14.190> depth<00:00:14.809> and<00:00:15.809> what<00:00:16.320> I've<00:00:16.440> done<00:00:16.590> now<00:00:16.650> is

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
feet in depth and what I've done now is

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.400 
feet in depth and what I've done now is
I<00:00:17.160> could<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.400> combined<00:00:17.820> them<00:00:18.140> as<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.260> can

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
I could have combined them as you can

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.380 
I could have combined them as you can
see<00:00:19.500> here<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.680> get<00:00:20.010> my<00:00:20.160> really<00:00:20.550> pretty<00:00:21.150> much<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
see here I get my really pretty much the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.599 
see here I get my really pretty much the
biggest<00:00:21.600> dish<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.590> biggest<00:00:22.859> container<00:00:23.160> water

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
biggest dish the biggest container water

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.730 
biggest dish the biggest container water
I<00:00:23.760> could<00:00:23.939> find<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.869> would<00:00:25.080> fit<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.529> between

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
I could find like would fit in between

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.310 
I could find like would fit in between
those<00:00:26.189> two<00:00:26.400> logs<00:00:26.689> and<00:00:27.689> wouldn't<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.140> enough

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
those two logs and wouldn't be enough

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.510 
those two logs and wouldn't be enough
space<00:00:28.970> and<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.900> put<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> filter<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.830> power<00:00:32.130> filter

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
space and I put a filter a power filter

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.170 
space and I put a filter a power filter
in<00:00:32.640> right<00:00:32.790> there

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
in right there

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.479 
in right there
it's<00:00:33.540> an<00:00:33.630> AK<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.050> are<00:00:34.200> not<00:00:34.469> think<00:00:34.620> forty<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
it's an AK we are not think forty to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.500 
it's an AK we are not think forty to
fifty-five<00:00:36.180> gallon<00:00:37.700> all<00:00:38.700> right<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.030> said<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
fifty-five gallon all right I said that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.250 
fifty-five gallon all right I said that
should<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.809> some<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.200> good<00:00:40.379> filtration

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
should have some really good filtration

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.200 
should have some really good filtration
and<00:00:43.340> basically<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.579> kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> left

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and basically just kind of left

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.850 
and basically just kind of left
everything<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> same<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> power

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
everything the same have a power

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.229 
everything the same have a power
something<00:00:47.219> which<00:00:47.309> kind<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.820> difficult

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
something which kind of be difficult

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.029 
something which kind of be difficult
power<00:00:48.780> something<00:00:49.110> along<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> top<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.980> know

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
power something along the top I know

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.310 
power something along the top I know
kind<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.370> keep<00:00:50.670> looking<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:52.140> been

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
kind of keep looking but it's been

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.040 
kind of keep looking but it's been
working<00:00:52.500> really<00:00:52.739> really<00:00:52.829> well

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
working really really well

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.340 
working really really well
UV<00:00:55.050> light<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.500> side<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:58.140> heat

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
UV light on this side and the heat

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.290 
UV light on this side and the heat
emitter<00:00:58.590> 260<00:00:59.520> watt<00:00:59.640> heater<00:00:59.850> heat<00:01:00.059> emitter

emitter 260 watt heater heat emitter
another<00:01:01.079> good<00:01:01.289> thing<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.879> that<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.239> I

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
another good thing is that now that I

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.020 
another good thing is that now that I
basically<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.080> cage<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:05.250> less<00:01:05.700> light

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
basically have one cage it's less light

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.109 
basically have one cage it's less light
less<00:01:06.890> for<00:01:07.890> me<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.070> pay<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.310> far<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.700> light<00:01:08.909> bill

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
less for me to pay as far as light bill

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.210 
less for me to pay as far as light bill
you<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.900> some<00:01:10.650> people<00:01:10.740> don't<00:01:10.920> worry<00:01:11.130> about

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you know some people don't worry about

lot of reptile snake stuff like that but

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.149 
lot of reptile snake stuff like that but
kind<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> bad<00:01:35.759> example<00:01:35.909> since<00:01:36.570> they<00:01:36.780> don't

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
kind of a bad example since they don't

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.670 
kind of a bad example since they don't
in<00:01:38.159> reality<00:01:38.700> once<00:01:39.020> you<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.170> older<00:01:40.500> you're

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
in reality once you get older you're

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.899 
in reality once you get older you're
easily<00:01:40.920> happy<00:01:41.220> we're<00:01:41.369> having<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> worry<00:01:41.820> about

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
easily happy we're having to worry about

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.710 
easily happy we're having to worry about
everything<00:01:42.570> light<00:01:43.040> maintenance<00:01:44.040> feeding<00:01:44.970> how

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
everything light maintenance feeding how

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.280 
everything light maintenance feeding how
much<00:01:45.899> cost<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.710> pretty<00:01:47.250> much<00:01:47.369> keep<00:01:47.579> them

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
much cost to just pretty much keep them

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.569 
much cost to just pretty much keep them
so<00:01:49.290> there's<00:01:49.530> another<00:01:49.710> thing<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
so there's another thing you have to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.069 
so there's another thing you have to
take<00:01:50.729> into<00:01:50.850> account<00:01:50.970> basically<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> light

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
