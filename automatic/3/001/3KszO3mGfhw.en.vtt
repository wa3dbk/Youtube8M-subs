the idea of simple kites we made a

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.350 
the idea of simple kites we made a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
on kites trapped in a shell so it's

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.910 
on kites trapped in a shell so it's
almost<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.780> Kai<00:00:48.960> tales<00:00:49.260> getting<00:00:49.500> trapped<00:00:49.710> in

what he does absolutely of course I know
the<00:01:33.580> inspiration<00:01:34.330> but<00:01:34.930> I<00:01:35.290> think<00:01:35.470> if<00:01:35.710> they

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
the inspiration but I think if they

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.440 
the inspiration but I think if they
wouldn't<00:01:36.310> have<00:01:36.400> told<00:01:36.580> me<00:01:36.730> it<00:01:36.790> was<00:01:36.910> about<00:01:37.030> kites

and the wind and the air and everything

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.820 
and the wind and the air and everything
I<00:01:40.540> would<00:01:40.900> have<00:01:41.020> found<00:01:41.170> it<00:01:41.410> because<00:01:41.680> it's

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
I would have found it because it's

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.620 
I would have found it because it's
really<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.460> feel<00:01:42.730> it<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.180> for
