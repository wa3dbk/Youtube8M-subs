do it with with the heavy duty because
this<00:02:42.379> is<00:02:42.560> an<00:02:42.980> inexpensive<00:02:44.470> fast<00:02:45.470> option<00:02:46.129> to

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
this is an inexpensive fast option to

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.959 
this is an inexpensive fast option to
creating<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.120> bike<00:02:47.569> fleet
