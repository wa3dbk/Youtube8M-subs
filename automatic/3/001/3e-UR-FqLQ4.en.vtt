 advantage that's why you are exactly like that 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.680
 this vertical is even more comfortable to watch 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:26.990

 so let's say here is the organization of gear too 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.090
 depends and the way it is loaded 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.240
 the feeder here in this case it helps 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.979
 you years it turns out that already cut 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:25.179
 do you need to start playing 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.159
 tip we crouched them something after all this is not 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.690
 very convenient to carp so there

 I use no such only they 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.220
 really out he swallowed everything 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:22.990
 completely hook the city ​​hit him in 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:22.990
 on average it's okay to take such good 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.980
 Excellent tackle back view but I 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.640
