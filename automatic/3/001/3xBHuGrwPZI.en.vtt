00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 Marl 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.710
 that is diverse 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.409
 a judge in Washington again how to best 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.210
 for the older ones 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.330
 instead of "freezing" 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
 not too often to downsize 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.830
 I thought I could not get out of it as music 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.170
 if you then perhaps come to my biggest protests Staatskapelle 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.900
 Dresden Christophe Le Manie 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.900
 you can stop now 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.920
 then there is more to travel 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.120
 I've been to a relatively small orchestra 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.410
 No to put 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.950
 Want to keep customers 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.470
 and then with 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.750
 the first was not like that 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.990
 within reach as my girlfriends could study 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.450
 not only made the decision of this 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.600
 to be from there 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.540
 the worst were 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.689
 has too 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.470
 the farewell of my mother and brother 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.470
 we were ourselves 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.290
 we can go to school now 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.520
 since the school's gone Laden's Robinho's more skillful 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.890
 and ready and ready 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.890
 at the moment where you did not know when you will see each other again 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 How will we be off tomorrow? 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.400
 swimming across the river 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.549
 always the same chances to Bernd Hoffmann or try the message 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.539
 this driveway shot to 2 2 surpasses questions 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.320
 between the military and then really becomes my husband 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.920
 with grant 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.360
 and then they did not get any intense investigation it was that way 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.560
 we have more and more people behind us 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.140
 At some point a father and his family left the children at hand 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.819
 went to the 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.819
 and around here everyone met after the other 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.939
 then they went 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.939
 Soldiers on the serve that just as long 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.649
 Then the family through 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:30.629
 and all hands and will be so short by and third field 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.799
 Oppenheim a month out 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.309
 the Embassy in Prague refugees 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:39.419
 as ideal 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:40.739
 can still today 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.049
 to travel to the Federal Republic of Germany 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.870
 you can do that so that is afterword 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.489
 in the weather report 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.309
 Deutschlandfunk and Gretel Witch Hunters 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:53.389
 while setting loads 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.509
 so very briefly and then 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.069
 Roth, that's why 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.809
 Uwe Alzen 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.179
 and there are in such a column 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:06.399
 we are looking much bigger 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:09.399
 to a remote farm in Prague 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.069
 Deuce 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.069
 very quickly in the bag 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:18.769
 exactly to this I now sit exactly in this place 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:19.879
 then has too 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.319
 at regular intervals concrete walls 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.549
 I saw policemen with dogs and over the border over the 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:30.979
 was appreciated in the month of June as it expects the release of 4 90 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:31.469
 Euro 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:33.969
 you have seen these values 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.529
 by Nkunda Semperoper and finally 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:38.700
 January into the sparkling wine 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.700
 it was nice before had heavy 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.379
 It was a bit exciting that now it's the send right thing 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.579
 not maybe 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.509
 who else intercepted 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:57.749
 It sure was not going to happen but I thought what was wrong 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:01.279
 a matter of time until one of the military's myths intervene 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:04.429
 the Russians is then no more 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:06.989
 tolerate 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.379
 but that's the way it is 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.389
 non-violent that is 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.389
 it surprised me 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.620
