 Age approval is not yet 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.920

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.280

 story of a wicked witch named 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.830
 they actually remember one 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.780
 so-called haunted one is indeed a very 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.520
 special provisions have witches 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.620
 and monsters and evil to hunt one 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.569
 actual color world the reality 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.220
 is is locked up at some point create 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.840
 yourself out of this prison also 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.640
 to come and so it is the old one 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.470
 defiant this book called gregory 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.060
 played by jeff bridges of the try 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.680
 this witch must be queen 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.510
 to face the problem is the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.100
 belly he had a handcuff of it 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.989
 some but now must be a very short one 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.760
 time a new gentleman named tom ford 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.830
 in the role and play relationship or 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.170
 must be the seventh son of a seventh son 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.700
 is one of the titles of sevens and all 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.320
 quickly this old bite becomes 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.330
 man and his apprentice a duo that 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.239
 trying to face the evil that 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.530
 whole packed together with mythical creatures 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.700
 kingdom clinging fashion 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.040
 bit on mister of the rings look 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.709
 made so that 3d inflated that 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.760
 fantasy adventure spectacle in which must 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.019
 I honestly say that actually 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.160
 should come out of the pasture 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.900
 and also a trailer for over one 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.130
 year the whole thing exists through the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.049
 Distributors change a bit 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.610
 now attracted the beginning march starts 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.049
 But you feel the traders are 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.519
 very cool and interesting because that too 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.950
 visually make some of the film 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.019
 itself has unfortunately become pretty bad 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.670
 the problem is your fans of this film 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.170
 is unbelievably predictable the effects 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.910
 are not really terrific many 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.320
 Monsters doubles up and, above all, at 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.120
 this predictability, he is right 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.890
 boring the dialogues are in many 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.239
 moments quite banal and you ask yourself 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.980
 unfortunately again and again what have jeff 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.780
 bridges and julien mo lost in it 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.130
 Oscar winner and Oscar nominated 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.660
 you try such a film 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.370
 of course the audience in the cinemas too 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.049
 lure but stevens has then unfortunately 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.130
 honestly not much to offer you 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.900
 even course on discs on 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.100
 looks and who says okay I want 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.570
 with the should look at the 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.340
 of course, in the cinema as well 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.810
 because these effects look like this 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.310
 fantasy worlds always in case of big ones 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.750
 canvas really unfolds 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.459
 but should not expect 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.690
 that was a really good move around 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.850
 The corner comes I was then very much 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.890
 had disappointed so reasonably 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.359
 adjusted expectations but the goods 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.910
 Really under it and the 102 minutes 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.799
 looks very very tough and that should 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.510
 mean that even he has a bigger one 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.459
 disappointment is about me as a fantasy 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.220
 adventure four out of ten possible 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.780
 get points 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.220
 Total only three out of ten possible 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.750
 score a pity shame 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.640
 I have no fun as I said 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.620
 It's a bad thing to talk about but that 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.180
 that corresponds more to the reality and there 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.850
 i have through my review the sevens 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.860
 on from the fifth year 2015 in the cinemas 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.750
 liked to read a thumb there if it liked 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.920
 if not otherwise know that 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.570
 There are still a few left and me 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.730
 around and tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.470
 at the latest a new video and until then 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.540
 I hope for weeks again with it 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.540
 of course at 3
