00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.710 
on the guy you know I know for a fact
I'm<00:03:56.930> aiming<00:03:57.230> on<00:03:57.320> them<00:03:57.500> perfectly<00:03:57.920> but<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:59.150> it

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
I'm aiming on them perfectly but so it

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.440 
I'm aiming on them perfectly but so it
depends<00:04:00.200> it<00:04:00.530> really<00:04:00.680> depends<00:04:01.070> as<00:04:01.340> right<00:04:02.270> here

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
depends it really depends as right here

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.979 
depends it really depends as right here
I<00:04:02.480> pick<00:04:02.690> up<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.870> target<00:04:03.200> finder<00:04:03.760> FAL<00:04:04.989> fully

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
I pick up a target finder FAL fully

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.870 
I pick up a target finder FAL fully
automatic<00:04:06.650> oh<00:04:06.880> I<00:04:07.880> do<00:04:08.600> not<00:04:08.989> not<00:04:09.680> a<00:04:09.709> fan<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.250> tying

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
automatic oh I do not not a fan of tying

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.479 
automatic oh I do not not a fan of tying
from<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.360> set<00:04:11.630> up<00:04:11.780> me<00:04:12.709> personally<00:04:13.280> I<00:04:13.310> think

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
from that set up me personally I think

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.640 
from that set up me personally I think
they<00:04:13.730> should<00:04:13.910> nerf<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.270> target<00:04:14.570> finder<00:04:14.810> maybe

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
they should nerf the target finder maybe

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.370 
they should nerf the target finder maybe
they<00:04:15.950> could<00:04:16.160> decrease<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.910> range<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.510> you

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
they could decrease the range of you

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.500 
they could decrease the range of you
know<00:04:18.500> where<00:04:19.100> they<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.549> know<00:04:19.580> show<00:04:20.150> up<00:04:20.299> as<00:04:20.480> a

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
know where they you know show up as a

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.750 
know where they you know show up as a
big<00:04:20.780> red<00:04:21.020> diamond<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.680> maybe<00:04:22.430> they<00:04:22.610> could

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
big red diamond and maybe they could

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.090 
big red diamond and maybe they could
even<00:04:22.880> maybe<00:04:23.570> give<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.990> gun<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.470> bit<00:04:24.500> more<00:04:24.860> kick

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
even maybe give the gun a bit more kick

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.710 
even maybe give the gun a bit more kick
because<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.550> picked<00:04:25.970> up<00:04:26.090> you<00:04:26.240> know<00:04:26.330> target

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
because I picked up you know target

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.170 
because I picked up you know target
finder<00:04:26.930> like<00:04:27.740> machine<00:04:28.100> guns<00:04:28.130> assault<00:04:28.730> rifles

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
finder like machine guns assault rifles

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.560 
finder like machine guns assault rifles
and<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:29.870> can<00:04:30.020> just<00:04:30.169> spray<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:31.210> for<00:04:32.210> like<00:04:32.360> me

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
and you can just spray and for like me

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.470 
and you can just spray and for like me
it<00:04:32.840> just<00:04:32.870> barely<00:04:33.470> any<00:04:33.740> recoil<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:34.610> maybe<00:04:35.330> they

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
it just barely any recoil so maybe they

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.140 
it just barely any recoil so maybe they
could<00:04:35.630> do<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:35.870> but<00:04:36.260> will<00:04:36.980> they<00:04:37.220> probably<00:04:37.730> not

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
could do that but will they probably not

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.480 
could do that but will they probably not
but<00:04:38.840> it<00:04:39.290> would<00:04:39.500> be<00:04:39.530> nice<00:04:39.800> for<00:04:39.860> them<00:04:40.220> you<00:04:40.400> know

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
but it would be nice for them you know

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.250 
but it would be nice for them you know
to<00:04:40.669> think<00:04:41.060> of<00:04:41.180> me<00:04:41.300> like<00:04:41.330> a<00:04:41.570> nerf<00:04:41.810> for<00:04:42.140> it

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
to think of me like a nerf for it

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.200 
to think of me like a nerf for it
because<00:04:42.620> they<00:04:42.830> didn't<00:04:43.130> you<00:04:43.220> know<00:04:43.340> nerf<00:04:44.030> the

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
because they didn't you know nerf the

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.510 
because they didn't you know nerf the
submachine<00:04:44.570> guns<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.470> r870

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
submachine guns and the r870

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.430 
submachine guns and the r870
and<00:04:46.610> they<00:04:47.000> like<00:04:47.210> buff<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.690> assault<00:04:48.110> rifles

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
and they like buff the assault rifles

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.680 
and they like buff the assault rifles
and<00:04:48.860> I<00:04:49.099> didn't<00:04:49.819> really<00:04:49.910> notice<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.539> know<00:04:50.629> too

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
and I didn't really notice you know too

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.719 
and I didn't really notice you know too
much<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.169> a<00:04:51.259> big<00:04:51.590> difference<00:04:52.039> but<00:04:52.370> that's<00:04:52.610> just

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
much of a big difference but that's just

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.749 
much of a big difference but that's just
