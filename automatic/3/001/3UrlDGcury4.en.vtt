00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.370
 Asa today is Uesugi new work this time 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.660
 Look at how to checkmate your opponent's King with your King and Queen 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.690
 I want to go there 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:20.020
 When I do this I use three steps and the first stop is this 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:25.510
 It is a shame of the King edition this Midoriï½° etc. -8 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.990
 Relegating the mass who are shown in the mark thing that confined there 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:33.239
 In or Let's do actually 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.110
 If you open this one more people at the end of the plate, this is the technique you use to drive to death 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.200
 The queen 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.980
 Thing that we have to do not with the de check can position 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.720
 For example, in this position, the prescribed one is Queen and then 5 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.540
 It will go can check this not equal in 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:54.200
 If this positional relationship is used, it will be closed by this and the three- step name will be covered and three 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:57.290
 So does the King of the vault approach the eighth step? 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.570
 Well do you get closer to the h file 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:06.060
 For example, the hull is two centers 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.730
 Making the positional relationship between this well or not be here as a way closer to the 1 file 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.180
 Again here 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:18.750
 Close to the eighth row or close to the h file 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:22.000
 The positional relationship between the went into the United States if it Dema 7 approaching the eighth stage bee is also not here 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.510
 Made in Well 1 file daily routine 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.130
 Go to the eighth step 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:32.820
 Once you get into the eighth row, you'll be trapped there so let's stick a little 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:36.320
 Create a positional relationship between the Kinpira Mr. 7 not sown Again 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.700
 Another h file or eighth row of this 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:45.299
 Say again and run away 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:51.550
 Where do King go to 9 eight-stage with the other hatch make the positional relationship between this or in no 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:54.290
 Now you can that is placed at the end of the edition I h file Martinique mother 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.420
 Once in, for example, put on the eighth stage 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.890
 Block the seventh step completely here 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.500
 Safe King can not get out of the eighth row 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.170
 I want one be careful in the positional relationship between the not is this computing 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:15.020
 The end of the plate 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.560
 Oh It's cans or barracuda when you do this here can not use the positional relationship between the no 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.370
 Hmm 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:27.040
 The reason is that King is making a positional relationship towards when it was put into taste and this is King 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:32.349
 Because there is no place to go, it will be a stalemate draw 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:38.140
 So as long as the opponent's Ting enters the end of the plate 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.859
 By blocking the seventh step and g file far from King 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.409
 There 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.409
 For example, here the seventh step grass 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.150
 Again 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:55.390
 This will close the g file 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:03:00.460
 Step 1 is complete because King is now locked at the end of the plate 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.900
 Next step is step 2 step 2 is to open my king 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.560
 To move closer 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.830
 let's do it 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.830
 Chan 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.030
 Here 's the point to get close one minute later 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.210
 Don't disturb this queen's crisis, for example 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.870
 King If you wait too long to prevent this crisis entered here 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:32.910
 Your opponent's King can escape from this h file 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.910
 So it raised to also close so as not to interfere with the crisis of the Queen 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:41.620
 At this point, if you get close enough, step 3 will use your king and queen to your opponent's 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.590
 Checkmate Ting 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.560
 If it is this position, for example, the 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.890
 I hit a queen and got dressed 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.890
 here 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.610
 Because there is no place for King to escape 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.610
 Become a checkmate 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:08.590
 That's it from yourself for a King and Queen of checkmate 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.590
 That is Thank me look
