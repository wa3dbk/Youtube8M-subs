 one microsoft wants to stop all 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.099

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.859
 many players when playing mode al 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.900
 online mode of the console that is not another 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.750
 to meet the players 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.060
 they look for polemics that insult they are 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.740
 all the time insulting and they get to 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.360
 overwhelm though you can easily erase 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.040
 but you always find someone in 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.900
 some game that touches you 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.630
 no balls and for it microsoft 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.970
 will finance a reputation system for 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.830
 xbox one that will basically reward or 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.140
 punish players based on 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.850
 his way of behaving I'm going to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.830
 explain it for example those 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.660
 players that make use of xbox live 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.270
 rewards will get a rating 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.220
 elevated in its reputation while 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.990
 those with a bad reputation are 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.090
 You will see from the obligation to play with 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.909
 other players of similar reputation or 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.659
 be that those who are always insulting 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.090
 will play with people 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.789
 that insults or trans is saved with 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.350
 the trolls and the haters with the haters or 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.630
 whatever you want to call it, they will all be 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.610

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.799
 among them to say it in some way 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.869
 and people who behave well will play with 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.899
 people who behave well is a system 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.060
 that a priori the truth is that it has 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.159
 good intentions but you may have 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.149
 can have its risks when it comes to being 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.819
 effective either as it grants that 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.000
 qualification without being rigged or without 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.979

 to get an idea of ​​how this 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.030
 could be implemented but 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.039
 it really is an idea that has very 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.799
