 it's at the very bottom of the English countryside in board sheds are a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.689
 small airfield that hides the collection of nick the essonne 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.149

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:20.439
 adequacy thanks to the help of his home mechanics after twenty years and 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.439
 a workshop that will be treated number of garage

 to go out and start this amazing makarainen f1 gtr the short version of 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.190
 one of the weakest supercars in history 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.240
 registered 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.180
 nick drove of course as well as on the road 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.540
 she reflects her passion 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.350
 for cars 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.350
 from the oldest to the most recent 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.760
 the old cars will probably be driving job 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.100
 because they appear more voluntary 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.980
 it must also be mentioned that their limits 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.850
 this car or with the ferrari enzo that are newer 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.130
 we can not look for limits on the road when it loses 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.680
 adhesion to mans towards instant control 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
 four years after having passed 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.840
 so his collection 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.840
 the unavoidable 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 parties like this ferrari the messages are read 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.800
 259 kilometers traveled 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.920
 the deputy christian paul his two ears of 24 hours 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.040
 the porsche 962 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.020
 and the ferrari 512s make choices some enlightened hobbyists but who 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.760
 seems not to respond to any particular logic if it is his own 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.159
 scene 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.240
 on May 5th a dangerous class picked running cars and 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.149
 often for a specific reason for you especially because it was 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.130
 at the forefront of their category 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.700
 a whole class actually I choose the cars according to the championships 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.450
 which fascinates me this is the case for example I wanted the cars 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.550
 could in size category 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.040
 the tickets which was the best choice to illustrate me src 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.110
 otherwise I also choose cars that symbolize stocks especially 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.760
 it is a chance 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.760
 which is a shame 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.229
 an example of how 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:12.579
 who chooses his cars 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.979
 this amazing maceiras quoted 61 afraid that she manages 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:19.249
 for which he catches pussies memories of stirling moss pictures at 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:19.970
 his steering wheel 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.149
 he had scored during his childhood 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:24.049
 a childhood that he spent 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:24.959
 the epidemic 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.229
 on the seats of the plane 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.149
 his father's bentley 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:29.019
 yet this is 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.019
 in the first piece of his collection 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.079
 no it was not my first car 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.349
 because my father did not want to give it to me right away director of 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.359
 recover much later as he mixes continue to drive for 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.779
 for a long time the first car was the destiny these young people a very 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.919
 little english car 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.440
 but to understand the value and importance of his collection 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.190
 know that all participants will be a part of these cars is at 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.070
 preceded him by 12 seconds on the duet place 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.670
 but with so many masterpieces in his possession what is his favorite 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:08.269
 the site reselling all my cars and watching movies that would be 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.119
 certainly the gto that I will keep writing 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.829
 because we can do so many different things with her with a bag 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.209
 american chips m it's a plastic racing car 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.879
 but it's also a sensational car to make rallies 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.329
 automobiles but you can even use daily if needed 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.780
 we agree with you his ferrari 250 gto 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.839
 and the one that made us the most crack of his collection 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:38.499
 built in 1962 this is one of the 39 it exists in the world is also of the 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.549
 third most-rated car behind the royal bugatti and the 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.259
 ferrari strait 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:46.829
 a higher suite I am currently trading between 13 8 and 12 million 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.019
 beautiful euros I had suffered that's all 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.239
 capable race leader with his movie 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.049
 300 horsepower 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.379
 300 kilometers an hour for the time 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.059
 then have the energy and the means that nenni but on the collectionnite all 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:02.039
 these cars 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.419
 one wonders what is his true passion driving cars 

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:08.739
 we played music 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.649
 finally I mean that playing music probably what gives me the 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:13.850
 more chills concert 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.850
 but for driving at mans it gets close to it a lot 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.150
 in any case be it behind a battery or behind a steering wheel of this 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
 house always gives us so much emotion 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.939
 this week 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.939
 I think we are out of gas the afp 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.110
 it's chaos to a cell phone
