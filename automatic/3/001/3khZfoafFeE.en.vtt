00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.190
 that this is the second part as we see 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.330
 and as we said a while ago 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.460
 is that line apparently 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.290
 allegedly ash 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.990
 but the funny thing is that this chain of 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:21.190
 clouds that we see to the left 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.570
 is crossing that line 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.570
 logic tells us 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.169
 what I should be seeing is seeing some 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.690
 difference if there are two air currents 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.670
 that are there at this point 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.360
 they are meeting however you can not see 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.360
 no difference 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.100
 whether the air stream of the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.520
 ash was stronger should it be 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.350
 should be affected and none of the 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.960
 two currents of one affected and that of 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.850
 the science that goes above are for 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.480
 all and the north 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.480
 like that 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.490
 nor that of the cloud chain that is 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.190
 crossing 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.720
 no way 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.270
 practically towards the destination 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.840
 curious as part of the volcano 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.820
 popocatÃ©petl 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.149
 and it is here at the bottom can not be seen by 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.149
 clouds 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.880
 that we would see these things 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.740
 and what we do with can 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.080
 knows 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.840
 while everyone is 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.090
 but the dancing microphone 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.219
 we repeat then what we do with 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.780
 which in these cases is very simple 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.119
 while everyone else is in their 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.859
 offices like morons joining hands 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.859
 and fingers and singing 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.509
 gat 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.039
 as they said while all 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.810
 office workers and university students are in 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.580
 their classrooms a lot knowing that 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.690
 they use our hands as authentic 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.690
 products and bringing things 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.099
 We left running away terrified 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.440
 here and we wait for the end of the world 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.010
 finish while everyone does try 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.010
 attitude 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.110
 good 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.350
 the other is to make onions and slowly 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.300
 of their life 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.250
 accept Jesus Christ as the authentic 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.700
 creator of the world 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.700
 He says 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.880
 and good after this little 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.880
 cultural breviary with banking 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.010
 we will keep watching to see what else 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.120
 happens 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.120
 now they are the 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.780
 440 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.780
 look at the 340 3 40 in the afternoon 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.270
 Monday January 7 has just passed kings 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.670
 From the year 2013 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.319
 I do not know who will see this in posterity 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.159
 but if you are seeing me 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.159
 we are having fun 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.520
 if it cleans 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.870
 but the left side
