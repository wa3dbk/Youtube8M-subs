00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.320
 and apart I never went on the court 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.210
 knowing that it was going to be a goal I would 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.490
 I wanted to do but there are the defenders 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.059
 also imagine that but for you are 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.209
 goal scorer 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.070
 I am a scorer and I do everything since 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.810
 half on Monday morning until 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.300
 on Sunday to make goals in what I 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.250
 I did everything I did was to do 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.470
 goals and every training I did in 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.610
 my life was for even when I did not 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.020
 he worked with balls that were going 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.250
 doing weights 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.250
 look to jump higher 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.150
 all focused make goals 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.290
 but no no no 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.080
 I thought I was coming in. I never thought that 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.850
 I went to the court and he never said that 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.400
 all that 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.620
 it occurred to me but I did not take it for 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.510
 let's say there is a law defenders of 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.050
 another side that they want to charge you 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.560
 kicks 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.390
 in those moments 94-98 you said 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.640
 Internally no no I will not be 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.059
 World Cup scorer or it never happened to you 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.520
 it's not a dream you saw anything if it's 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.860
 something that you believe but when you are there not 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.070
 Become aware that you are more than not 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.280
 more than dale dale that you did not always see 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.400
 it was like that laughs more now it is that never 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.950
 I enjoyed nothing I entered a field 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.860
 the only thing that felt the respect of the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.090
 people that was a thing that I loved 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.909
 because I passed on things to him 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.439
 or you go down the street say to the attic that 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.340
 It's like you fall down, I liked that 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.990
 after inside the court never 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.060
 enjoyment 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.340
 apart from the 90 minutes after 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.770
 to have scored three goals today I got the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.020
 things but neither that nor initially 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.920
 you said gross or that I am not ever 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.740
 but as you wish it was so stupid of 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.570
 some way 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.049
 so I bring him today on Sunday that 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.180
 come have seven goals and now I will 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.299
 fix self-imposed too during 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.530
 the repetition and yes a little it would have 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.049
 have enjoyed a little more but 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.060
 out there if he enjoyed and had not done 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.709
 what it says but as it was always 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.870
 excuse to improve for example that is 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.239
 they make three goals 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.450
 to boot life well for the table 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.400
 of scorers that excuse was to try 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.840
 to make more goals to try to make 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.970
 more goals than to continue training and 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.129
 keep you announced this level if not 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.390
 he made the goals if the whore who gave birth to him 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.010
 Be left behind in births and thus always 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.930
 I think that is one of the virtues 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.700
 that have those that reach up and 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.500
 they keep looking for the excuse 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.480
 to say it's not all right how you think 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.950
 what does make me happy out there 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.950
 listen to young players 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.460
 I had to me as a benchmark that 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.070
 it's good that 's what's left and not yet 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.310
 I knew no technician that tastes 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.560
 for the players I beat the 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.050
 desire to win exactly because 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.800
 end of the game football 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.170
 a team sport wins the roster 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.150
 until the match ended after 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.970
 we are alone and in the selection 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.890
 more after I do not go to my house 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.090
 Batistuta will recapture the candle 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.040
 goes the silver then that is after it says 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.220
 I will put nothing I feel that people 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.190
 does not understand does not realize that a 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.230
 world cup or a cup america did not win it 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.930
 players if they do not achieve a roster they do not 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.930
 he wins but a championship also 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.660
 a championship also mine no no no no 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.830
 there is a player 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.130
 You can not have a month maradona but 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.190
 One month you can only win a match 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.120
 after winning a championship to win 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.670
 a match because they have a rebound and a 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.420
 rebound to maradona and today with 60 years of 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.520
 vaccine 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.130
 but that's not a bounce it's not going to fall 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.080
 40 parties a year I do not know how good you can 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.160
 win a championship depending on a 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.880
 game has to be team 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.940
 we need a team you need a group 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.220
 that's why I am also half is a 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.870
 little our Argentine culture in the 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.540
 clubs I see that many players exceed 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.900
 they exceed the role of the player my idea of 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.610
 soccer is a group with responsibilities 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.990
 each one their responsibility each of 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.150
 that his team is the home team 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.760
 That 's why that 10 is 5 each 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.220
 he does his thing I know he can not stop 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.830
 a criminal who has his role each one has 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.479
 his role of some star some spain 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.500
 before some just that of the 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:50.410
 agonist is a team but I without them 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.380
 without a super archer I can not go to 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.729
 no side and the archer without a 9 that the 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.889
 goal can not go anywhere but 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.740
 Boston then outside the court that 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.090
 I took more photo to 9 but also in the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.669
 humility of the rest say that the 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.979
 selection needs humility is 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.600
 the intelligence more than the good 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.490
 if it's smart if an intelligent one is 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.810
 humble if not 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.800
 one that is not humble is not 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.229
 smart 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.889
 and good but that's the job of 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.990
 technical that is the work of players 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.360
 but I'm not going to kick a penalty if I do 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.360
 I am Jesus Christ the heavens I am the culprit 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.250
 of the good defeat the archer of that 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.879
 responsibility does not take the 2 between 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.900
 on 4 the 5 let's say there are 10 types in the 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:35.720
 team that do not take that 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.129
 responsibility carries a deaf and if 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.259
 you have to say it's a 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.180
 definition by penalties in a world cup that 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.360
 it leaves you out or that gives you life that is 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.060
 let's say that one of the moments that 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:52.020
 and feel the weight of the country when you're 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:56.910
 singing the anthem this makes you vibrate 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.920
 go to kick a penalty in that instance 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.990
 because when the game starts you 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.100
 you know they're all behind you 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.969
 and the thoughts are positive 90 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.960
 minutes ahead there is 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:13.960
 it's a second black white 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.250
 that is, there are no chances 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:21.100
 it's not easy and in fact many players 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.130
 they refuse to breeder that refuses to 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.650
 has a criminal and in many cases and in 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:29.830
 many cases with players who have not 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.660
 kicked usually I do not have it the 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.250
 head and I have it because apart 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.250
 I think I'm going to give it to the bow
