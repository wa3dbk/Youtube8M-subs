00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.740 

so<00:00:10.620> here<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.800> have<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.130> 105<00:00:11.639> Q<00:00:11.940> crybaby<00:00:12.480> bass

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
so here I have the 105 Q crybaby bass

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.829 
so here I have the 105 Q crybaby bass
walk<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:14.309> inspiration<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.570> law

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
walk and the inspiration of this law

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.320 
walk and the inspiration of this law
essentially<00:00:16.710> was<00:00:16.949> something<00:00:17.850> completely

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
essentially was something completely

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.269 
essentially was something completely
different<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.960> was<00:00:19.170> listening<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.770> artists

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
different it was listening to artists

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.939 
different it was listening to artists
that<00:00:20.460> actually<00:00:21.090> used<00:00:21.359> our<00:00:21.510> old<00:00:21.750> design<00:00:22.380> which

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
that actually used our old design which

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.550 
that actually used our old design which
was<00:00:23.189> essentially<00:00:24.060> kind<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.449> reavoice<00:00:24.869> vocal

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
was essentially kind of a reavoice vocal

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.450 
was essentially kind of a reavoice vocal
and<00:00:25.740> tonal<00:00:26.039> wise

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and tonal wise

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.960 
and tonal wise
GCB<00:00:26.939> 95<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:28.650> problem<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.910> just

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
GCB 95 the problem is that just it just

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.110 
GCB 95 the problem is that just it just
didn't<00:00:30.630> meet<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.320> bass<00:00:31.590> players<00:00:31.920> needs<00:00:32.279> one

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
didn't meet the bass players needs one

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.940 
didn't meet the bass players needs one
being<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.079> bottom<00:00:34.469> man<00:00:34.649> wasn't

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
being is that the bottom man wasn't

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.130 
being is that the bottom man wasn't
robust<00:00:35.550> enough<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> wasn't<00:00:36.360> me<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.660> wasn't

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
robust enough it wasn't me it wasn't

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.650 
robust enough it wasn't me it wasn't
really<00:00:37.500> retained<00:00:37.950> when<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.700> turn<00:00:39.149> turned<00:00:39.480> on

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
really retained when you turn turned on

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.330 
really retained when you turn turned on
the<00:00:39.809> effect<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> kind<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.620> bass<00:00:40.829> kind<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.190> went

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the effect the kind of bass kind of went

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.000 
the effect the kind of bass kind of went
away<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> lot<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.360> bass<00:00:42.600> players<00:00:42.629> said<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
away so a lot of bass players said the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.299 
away so a lot of bass players said the
most<00:00:44.309> popular<00:00:44.850> version<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:46.020> filter<00:00:46.590> effect

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
most popular version of a filter effect

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.910 
most popular version of a filter effect
for<00:00:47.520> bass<00:00:47.670> was<00:00:48.390> actually<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> old

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
for bass was actually that the old

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.790 
for bass was actually that the old
envelope<00:00:50.850> filters<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> early<00:00:51.930> 70s<00:00:52.500> mid

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
envelope filters of the early 70s mid

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.360 
envelope filters of the early 70s mid
70s<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.879> within<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:55.129> feedback

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
70s so within that feedback

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.220 
70s so within that feedback
I<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:57.030> basically<00:00:57.239> started<00:00:57.870> off<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
I just basically started off with a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.319 
I just basically started off with a
blank<00:00:58.469> piece<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> paper<00:00:58.920> nothing<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.149> with

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
blank piece of paper nothing to do with

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.279 
blank piece of paper nothing to do with
the<00:01:00.510> crybaby

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the crybaby

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.910 
the crybaby
GCB<00:01:01.949> 95<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.350> sort<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.470> looked<00:01:04.680> at<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
GCB 95 and sort of looked at the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.789 
GCB 95 and sort of looked at the
envelope<00:01:05.070> filter<00:01:05.549> topologies<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.650> I've

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
envelope filter topologies so what I've

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.250 
envelope filter topologies so what I've
done<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.220> put<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.640> circuitry<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.140> can

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
done is put in circuitry that you can

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.649 
done is put in circuitry that you can
actually<00:01:10.500> move<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.369> down<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.270> filter

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
actually move up and down the filter

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.890 
actually move up and down the filter
with<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.200> foot<00:01:14.010> which<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.549> essentially<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
with your foot which is essentially you

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.679 
with your foot which is essentially you
drive<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.500> pedal<00:01:16.860> unlike<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.689> envelope

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
drive the pedal unlike the envelope

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.270 
drive the pedal unlike the envelope
filter<00:01:19.080> where<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.350> kind<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.560> takes<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> life

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
filter where it kind of takes on a life

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.090 
filter where it kind of takes on a life
of<00:01:20.460> its<00:01:20.580> own<00:01:20.790> depending<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.390> your<00:01:21.540> plane<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
of its own depending on your plane and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
of its own depending on your plane and
also<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.880> did<00:01:24.270> was<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> heel<00:01:25.200> position

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
also what I did was in the heel position

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.700 
also what I did was in the heel position
of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> wah<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.790> mix<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.420> some<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.110> dry<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
of the wah I mix in some of the dry and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
of the wah I mix in some of the dry and
as<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.340> get<00:01:29.520> further<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.970> further<00:01:30.030> toe<00:01:30.540> down

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
as you get further and further toe down

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.990 
as you get further and further toe down
I<00:01:31.020> take<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.439> little<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.979> mix<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> lot<00:01:32.970> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
I take a little of that mix or a lot of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.640 
I take a little of that mix or a lot of
some<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.420> mix<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.350> have

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
some of that mix out so now you have

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.830 
some of that mix out so now you have
more<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.189> filter<00:01:35.520> peaky<00:01:35.909> response<00:01:36.360> so

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
more of the filter peaky response so

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.840 
more of the filter peaky response so
this<00:01:36.990> has<00:01:37.170> all<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.409> qualities<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
this has all the qualities of the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.069 
this has all the qualities of the
sought-after

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
sought-after

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.620 
sought-after
envelope<00:01:40.799> filter<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.060> new<00:01:42.119> twist

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
envelope filter but with that new twist

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.499 
envelope filter but with that new twist
where<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> mix<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.560> some<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> dry<00:01:44.490> signal<00:01:45.180> in

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
where I mix in some of the dry signal in

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.780 
where I mix in some of the dry signal in
with<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.140> well<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:47.070> give<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
with it as well just to give it that and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.690 
with it as well just to give it that and
retain<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:49.079> bass<00:01:49.409> response<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.369> bass

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
retain that bass response in that bass

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.870 
retain that bass response in that bass
tone<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.630> remains<00:01:52.320> thick<00:01:52.770> throughout<00:01:53.640> its

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
tone so it remains thick throughout its

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:14.150 
tone so it remains thick throughout its
whole<00:01:54.030> suite

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.830 

okay<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.430> controls<00:02:15.850> on<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.180> side<00:02:16.420> are

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
okay so the controls on the side are

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.559 
okay so the controls on the side are
very<00:02:17.410> useful<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.069> very<00:02:18.280> simplistic<00:02:18.940> one<00:02:19.239> is

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
very useful but very simplistic one is

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.890 
very useful but very simplistic one is
the<00:02:19.810> Q<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:21.130> what<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.550> does<00:02:21.819> is<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.180> takes

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
the Q and what that does is that takes

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.100 
the Q and what that does is that takes
the<00:02:23.200> filter<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.220> actually<00:02:24.940> makes<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.600> peaky

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
the filter and actually makes it peaky

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.979 
the filter and actually makes it peaky
and<00:02:26.319> very<00:02:26.650> sharp<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.280> vocal<00:02:27.670> or<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.660> can<00:02:28.810> back

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
and very sharp and vocal or you can back

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.500 
and very sharp and vocal or you can back
down<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.410> Q<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.400> make<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.760> more<00:02:30.940> subtle<00:02:31.209> and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
down the Q and make it more subtle and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.780 
down the Q and make it more subtle and
flattened<00:02:32.110> response<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:32.980> what<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.250> does<00:02:33.519> is

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
flattened response and what that does is

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.449 
flattened response and what that does is
it<00:02:33.940> goes<00:02:34.090> from<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.360> very<00:02:34.600> vocal<00:02:35.040> bubbly<00:02:36.040> sort<00:02:36.310> of

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
it goes from a very vocal bubbly sort of

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.490 
it goes from a very vocal bubbly sort of
sound<00:02:36.700> -<00:02:37.150> very<00:02:37.360> subtle<00:02:37.630> almost<00:02:38.080> like<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.230> tone

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
sound - very subtle almost like a tone

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:47.730 
sound - very subtle almost like a tone
control<00:02:38.980> sound

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.920 

you

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:09.240 

Oh

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.550 

also<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.520> has<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.700> volume<00:03:11.210> so<00:03:12.110> let's<00:03:12.260> say<00:03:12.380> if<00:03:12.470> you

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
also it has a volume so let's say if you

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.040 
also it has a volume so let's say if you
want<00:03:12.770> to<00:03:12.890> put<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.760> wah-wah<00:03:14.240> on<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.780> bounce

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
want to put the wah-wah on and bounce

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.730 
want to put the wah-wah on and bounce
over<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.860> mix<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.850> can<00:03:17.090> boost<00:03:17.960> the<00:03:18.200> volume<00:03:18.350> up

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
over the mix you can boost the volume up

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.220 
over the mix you can boost the volume up
or<00:03:19.010> let's<00:03:19.460> say<00:03:19.610> you<00:03:19.670> want<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.940> more<00:03:20.120> even<00:03:20.570> you

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.900 
or let's say you want a more even you
can<00:03:21.410> set<00:03:21.710> it<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:21.920> brought<00:03:22.130> in<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.310> middle<00:03:22.640> or

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
can set it and brought in the middle or

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.630 
can set it and brought in the middle or
if<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.630> want<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:24.020> even<00:03:24.080> a<00:03:24.260> little<00:03:24.560> lower<00:03:24.740> the

if you want it even a little lower the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.250 
if you want it even a little lower the
other<00:03:25.760> cool<00:03:26.060> thing<00:03:26.330> about<00:03:26.360> this<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.110> auto

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
other cool thing about this is the auto

so<00:03:28.310> when<00:03:28.490> bass<00:03:28.670> players<00:03:29.000> are<00:03:29.210> playing<00:03:29.360> usually

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
so when bass players are playing usually

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.320 
so when bass players are playing usually
want<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.140> get<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.590> out<00:03:30.680> so<00:03:31.340> we<00:03:31.700> did<00:03:32.000> away

want to get in and out so we did away

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.720 
want to get in and out so we did away
with<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.780> toe<00:03:32.990> switch<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:33.710> we<00:03:34.460> have<00:03:34.610> an

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
with the toe switch and we have an

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.400 
with the toe switch and we have an
automatic<00:03:35.120> heel<00:03:35.510> switch<00:03:35.780> so<00:03:35.960> whether<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.260> let

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
automatic heel switch so whether you let

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.100 
automatic heel switch so whether you let
go<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.860> foot<00:03:37.240> the<00:03:38.240> pedal<00:03:38.570> automatically

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
go of the foot the pedal automatically

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.850 
go of the foot the pedal automatically
turns<00:03:39.350> off<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:39.940> time<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.180> turns<00:03:41.360> off<00:03:41.860> you

turns off and the time it turns off you

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.560 
turns off and the time it turns off you
can<00:03:43.100> actually<00:03:43.250> adjust<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.940> timing<00:03:44.360> with<00:03:44.540> a

can actually adjust the timing with a

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.830 
can actually adjust the timing with a
little<00:03:45.020> adjustment<00:03:45.440> screw<00:03:45.860> driver<00:03:46.100> inside<00:03:46.840> so

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
little adjustment screw driver inside so

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.150 
little adjustment screw driver inside so
here<00:03:48.020> it<00:03:48.110> is<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.650> 105<00:03:49.130> Q<00:03:49.490> crybaby
