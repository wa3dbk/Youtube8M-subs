00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 let's go around the world 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.529
 Around the world on moto2 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.630
 miquel wild will search all over the 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.920
 planet the trail of the explorers 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.920
 less known 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.960
 and difficulties 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.949
 adventure 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.949
 and beauty flight 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.170
 we go about 150 kilometers from vancouver 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.750
 and finally I left the city and here 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.930
 stuck in this wild nature 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.650
 the real journey to the ask begins 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.650
 to my destination 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.769
 the trip to the last border is a 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.050
 great adventure of natural beauty 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.350
 camping lack of fuel and climate 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350
 unpredictable 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.520
 3 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.040
 but not only humans can cause 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.890
 problems this is the way I 've 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.289
 chosen from here they call it roads 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.000
 wild if I do not put out there that's going to be 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.310
 an experience with what to have in 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.770
 account is that there is very little traffic and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.530
 here are bears every time I stop to do 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.500
 a photo to film I make sure not to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.570
 be in the company of grizzlies that do not 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.340
 they are no joke 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.009
 the most dangerous animals of the great 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.920
 north are the mosquitoes a new 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.959
 setback that has triggered me the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.940
 witness the pressure of the rear tire 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.200
 I think I punctured the milk 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.440
 fucking mosquito chopping on my wheel 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.940
 there dale dale dale knows if you get something 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.520
 before alaska is a territory 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.979
 mythical the yukon let's follow the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.590
 traces of the gold rush in the century 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.480
 19 gold was discovered in the territories 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.790
 from the north it was unleashed what we 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.010
 we know as the gold rush they 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.630
 actually they called it shopping the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.680
 rush of gold because it was like a 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.109
 stampede this 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.019
 He said that from Switzerland and we are in 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:27.329
 dawson city 27 and is the city founded in 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.519
 the gold rush and he is a seeker of 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.519
 gold that has already been found 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.280
 it comes from switzerland which is where they keep 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.209
 the gold in the banks and this one comes 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.209
 they looked for the mountains 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.400
 beauty also has its risks 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.710
 when I always have a motorcycle 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.180
 same reason why I stop making a 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.159
 Photo 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.370
 I've seen such a nice little prince with 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:14.209
 that river that meanders I stop 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.049
 careless and carlos well I have the callus that 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.049
 I have to lift the bike 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.870
 of coria this rock formation and has 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.319
 these lichens 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.750
 clinging to them curious what you see 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.390
 Here however the greatest curiosity 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:43.230
 it's the midnight sun that so far north 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.230
 you never get to put away 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.190
 set signaling is over 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.739
 absurdity of the world because they do not see the 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.170
 Spanish, you have to put something Spanish 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.590
 Spanish come and wood the stone sticker 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.590
 Sirs 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.780
 this is the flight box is supposed to 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.970
 it's a highway but like winter 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.160
 it destroys it and is always in works is 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.549
 practically a gravel track but 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.380
 good has pretty good firm and the 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.530
 only problem is truck traffic 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.970
 but there is alaska and that is 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.970
 they treated the adventure 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.070
 Alaska 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.070
 the objectives are being met
