00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
learning that I mean trying to put JC on

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:31.830 
learning that I mean trying to put JC on
doing<00:05:30.970> a<00:05:31.060> certain<00:05:31.240> thing<00:05:31.360> in<00:05:31.600> a<00:05:31.660> certain

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
doing a certain thing in a certain

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.950 
doing a certain thing in a certain
situation<00:05:32.140> as<00:05:32.650> you<00:05:32.770> difficult<00:05:33.220> right<00:05:33.960> well

situation as you difficult right well

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.170 
situation as you difficult right well
Vicky's<00:05:35.530> had<00:05:35.740> a<00:05:35.770> double<00:05:36.220> up<00:05:36.370> but<00:05:36.640> it's<00:05:36.820> still<00:05:37.120> a

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
Vicky's had a double up but it's still a

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.230 
Vicky's had a double up but it's still a
long<00:05:37.510> road<00:05:37.750> I<00:05:38.400> thought<00:05:39.400> if<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:39.729> one<00:05:39.880> chip

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
long road I thought if the one chip

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.180 
long road I thought if the one chip
disadvantage

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.980 

that's<00:05:45.190> probably<00:05:45.820> enough<00:05:46.120> for<00:05:46.150> JC<00:05:46.540> to<00:05:46.780> take

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
that's probably enough for JC to take

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.940 
that's probably enough for JC to take
her<00:05:47.139> on<00:05:47.290> for<00:05:47.620> a<00:05:47.650> hundred<00:05:47.740> thousand<00:05:48.460> olin<00:05:48.970> right
