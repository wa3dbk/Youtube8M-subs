00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.399
 and that is, we have a bag stretched out 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.420
 the butter that we thrust in there she 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.420
 gradually disappeared dissolved 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 and voids are overgrown with muscle tissue 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.619
 due to this symptom and it works 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.570
 thereby 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.100
 athlete demonstrate such big 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.560
 muscle gains 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.029
 [music] 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.029
 by the way if we proceed from the fact that 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:35.809
 synthol this such know temporary thing 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.000
 to free up space which 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.030
 then must be overgrown with muscle tissue 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.040
 it becomes obvious very important 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:50.540
 withdrawal symptom is desirable to use with 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.489
 powerful anabolic drugs bar 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.520
 chesko steroids growth hormone and so 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.280
 further because anabolic steroids 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.920
 but let's just say anabolic 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.859
 will promote faster 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.429
 zara cracking her new muscle tissue 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:10.280
 formed voids ie synthol itself 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:14.300
 on their own without chemistry will work much 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.580
 worse than similar chemistry, in principle, 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.380
 situation as with growth hormone yes that is 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.380
 growth hormone sol without anabolic 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.410
 steroids don't work well but 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.720
 together it works fine with them the 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.689
 the same symptoms synthol desirable 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.290
 used on komi pain otherwise effect 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:37.520
 would not be as significant as it could 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.640
 Well be fine with that everything is clear I 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.799
 imagine how the sky is already moving 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.540
 many haters have hair about this 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:51.229
 plot will continue to bomb so to speak 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.630
 let's talk about how to prick how to prick well 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.509
 let's take for some example but 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.450
 some muscle group easiest 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.829
 Probably take biceps will have biceps 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.329
 everything is very simple and clear so we 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.660
 let's say there is a syringe 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.239
 Here I have no syringe I am already natural 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.989
 no way I will pretend that 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.989
 here is this syringe 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:24.320
 we take bitsuha let's say and here we have 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:28.430
 bitsuha we want it to increase in size 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.370
 here we need to know some important 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.610
 moments for any muscle groups when 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.390
 you you use synthol you work with 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.840
 muscular 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.990
 cleverly or with a muscle bundle as 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.819
 biceps we have consists of two muscular 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.740
 heads 2 muscle bundles 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.130
 then accordingly we will need 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.730
 work with two beams on the right hand 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.720
 with two bunches on the left hand but there is 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.590
 internal beam 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:03.070
 this one here is an external bunch this one 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.989
 here is usually not all but see the separation 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.450
 such a small transition between external and 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.790
 by the internal beam and based on this 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.459
 we can understand where you will need 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.550
 make punctures in the essence of the point is that 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.489
 here we do it 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.209
 everyday synthol injections 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:29.060
 we have two beams on each hand 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:34.450
 respectively, the two arms of the beam 4 is here 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.450
 we need 4 shots a day 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.829
 4 shots this is the first moment that is, we 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.390
 working with bundles second very important 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.049
 moment when using synthol 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.000
 is that every day doing 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.920
 new injection in the appropriate 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.970
 muscle bundle need to change the place of injection 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:03.410
 well, roughly speaking, if you were injected today 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.680
 at this point and at this point 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.980
 then tomorrow you can't be in this prick 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.070
 tomorrow you are calling a little further here 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.680
 after tomorrow here here then 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.200
 come back go up that is 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.709
 you are constantly changing the points you like 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:26.470
 every muscle bundle you inject it 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:29.930
 on all sides in a circle externally beam 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:34.880
 inner bundle on each arm i.e. 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:37.729
 you have a day out on the biceps 4 injection but 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.390
 every other day. near you 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.560
 changing is very important in order to 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.620
 you 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.990
 no deformation was created if you will 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.950
 prick in the same place synthol 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.650
 there will be such a roll so that there will be 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.660
 seal one place with bristling in 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.690
 other places will be blown away as originally 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.720
 so that you have a uniform 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.510
 lifting your beam in order not to 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.910
 it was noticeable that there was something foreign 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.500
 you should blow off evenly with 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.090
 all sides ie change places 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.090
 injections every day
