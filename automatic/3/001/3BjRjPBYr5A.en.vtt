00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
all like a section of it so you don't

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.280 
all like a section of it so you don't
just<00:03:16.040> sit<00:03:17.040> here<00:03:17.190> for<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.430> long<00:03:17.640> time<00:03:18.110> now<00:03:19.110> when<00:03:19.260> I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
just sit here for a long time now when I

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.290 
just sit here for a long time now when I
do<00:03:19.410> my<00:03:19.680> sections<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.310> sections<00:03:20.730> are<00:03:21.000> pretty

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
do my sections the sections are pretty

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.210 
do my sections the sections are pretty
up<00:03:22.260> then<00:03:22.530> across<00:03:22.860> as<00:03:23.100> well<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:25.680> do<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.890> section

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
up then across as well you do a section

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.120 
up then across as well you do a section
you<00:03:26.660> comb<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.900> gently<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.500> make<00:03:28.680> sure<00:03:28.830> that

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
you comb it up gently to make sure that

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.550 
you comb it up gently to make sure that
you<00:03:29.280> got<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.790> space<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.870> take<00:03:31.080> your<00:03:31.230> curling

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
you got the space you take your curling

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.550 
you got the space you take your curling
iron<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.330> initially<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.510> rub<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.260> curling

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
iron and initially you rub the curling

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.150 
iron and initially you rub the curling
iron<00:03:34.709> across<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:36.030> root<00:03:36.590> then<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.709> take<00:03:37.950> it

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
iron across the root then you take it

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.000 
iron across the root then you take it
you<00:03:39.120> pull<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.450> up<00:03:39.570> all<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.140> way<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.739> end

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
you pull it up all the way to the end

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.560 
you pull it up all the way to the end
and<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.690> curl<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:44.550> usually<00:03:44.880> hold<00:03:45.420> the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
and you curl and I usually hold the

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.560 
and you curl and I usually hold the
curls<00:03:45.989> toward<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.590> top<00:03:46.880> until<00:03:47.880> about<00:03:48.209> 10

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
curls toward the top until about 10

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.979 
curls toward the top until about 10
seconds<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:52.489> there<00:03:53.489> we<00:03:53.640> have<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:54.209> pretty<00:03:54.840> good

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
seconds and there we have a pretty good

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.040 
seconds and there we have a pretty good
curl<00:03:55.380> when<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.190> pin<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.000> down<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.660> make<00:03:57.870> sure<00:03:58.019> I

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
curl when I pin it down and make sure I

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.430 
curl when I pin it down and make sure I
pin<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.500> inside<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.610> curl<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:01.110> that<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.320> don't

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
pin it inside the curl so that I don't

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.750 
pin it inside the curl so that I don't
make<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:01.920> too<00:04:02.070> straight

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
make it too straight

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.030 
make it too straight
but<00:04:03.239> whatever<00:04:03.390> doing<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.620> just<00:04:04.800> keep

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
but whatever doing it and you just keep

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.320 
but whatever doing it and you just keep
on<00:04:05.280> sectioning<00:04:06.030> piece<00:04:06.270> by<00:04:06.480> piece<00:04:06.510> like<00:04:07.110> that

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
on sectioning piece by piece like that

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.370 
on sectioning piece by piece like that
until<00:04:09.330> you've<00:04:09.660> made<00:04:09.900> your<00:04:10.080> way

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
alright see it and then you pin it in

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.820 
alright see it and then you pin it in
the<00:04:29.890> inside<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.640> curl<00:04:31.440> okay<00:04:32.440> I'm<00:04:32.650> going<00:04:32.770> to
