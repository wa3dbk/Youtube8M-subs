00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.250
 You can find it at the address of 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.930
 facebook that is here on the screen 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.670
 so that also to lend my name is 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.100
 josÃ© Ã ngel and today we will talk about the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.470
 nexus 5 the new Google standard bearer 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.420
 after the resounding success with the nexus 4 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.450
 google cleans those mistakes and we 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.750
 presents a terminal with a screen 49 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:33.350
 ips plaus a processor snapdragon 800 2 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.350
 gigas of ram and two versions 16 and 32 gb 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.440
 with him we have the team has about 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.149
 speakers on the bottom that such 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.840
 Do not bother when listening 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.970
 music or use it the jack that allows us 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.370
 have any headset of any 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.100
 brand in itself has us a screen 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.769
 that lets us see in the sunlight and we 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.879
 lets write and as operating system 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:00.879
 we came across kitkat 4.4 android 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.220
 that allows us thanks to google now 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.649
 launcher have the google now to a 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.660
 side and the iv what comes to be the 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.759
 application screens thanks to 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.430
 processor that manages dragon welfare 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.570
 800 to 2.3 gigahertz we can 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.570
 manage with fluency 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.700
 one of the nexus's weak points 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.730
 previous was the camera and this time google 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.520
 he wanted to polish it but it does not reach the level of 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.549
 a high-end team 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.920
 even so we have decent results with 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.890
 a good detail capture but 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.350
 times with noise likewise we have a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.020
 new mode that has included google is the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.049
 hdr mode more that will give us a greater 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.420
 capture of light we can add the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.969
 focus speed you have this time 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.450
 in nexus to be able to take the shots of 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.450
 the pictures 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.450
 one of the weakest points of the nexus 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:59.329
 is your battery 2300 media are not capable 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.429
 of moving to the processor and they are not able 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.229
 to last a full day so 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.709
 we will have to be glued to the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.709
 current 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.280
 google with the nexus 5 teaches us that no 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.410
 there is a need to pay a lot for 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.330
 have an excellent team and with kitkat 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.730
 shows us all the potential it has 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.490
 android to be able to customize it and 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.950
 mold it our way as the nexus 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.400
 5 is like a clay doll for 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.040
 mold to our liking if you like the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.350
