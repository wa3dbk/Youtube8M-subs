00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
especially with my beer dip recipe I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.160 
especially with my beer dip recipe I
have<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:43.940> make<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.300> for<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:44.660> another<00:01:45.230> time

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
have to make that for you another time

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.140 
have to make that for you another time
by<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.230> way<00:01:48.500> these<00:01:49.250> keep<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:49.790> an<00:01:49.910> airtight

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
by the way these keep in an airtight

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.180 
by the way these keep in an airtight
container<00:01:50.540> just<00:01:51.320> in<00:01:51.500> case<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:51.830> might<00:01:52.010> have

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
container just in case you might have

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.820 
container just in case you might have
some<00:01:52.850> leftovers<00:01:53.360> for<00:01:53.570> about<00:01:53.780> three<00:01:54.170> weeks<00:01:54.200> but

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
some leftovers for about three weeks but

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.410 
some leftovers for about three weeks but
I<00:01:55.070> think<00:01:55.550> they'll<00:01:55.670> probably<00:01:55.760> be<00:01:56.060> gone<00:01:56.240> before

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
I think they'll probably be gone before

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.550 
I think they'll probably be gone before
that<00:01:57.370> just<00:01:58.370> a<00:01:58.460> great<00:01:58.640> way<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:58.820> take<00:01:59.120> ordinary

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.660 
that just a great way to take ordinary
pretzels<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.660> make<00:02:02.660> them<00:02:02.780> fake<00:02:02.990> tastes<00:02:03.920> extra

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
pretzels and make them fake tastes extra

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.230 
pretzels and make them fake tastes extra
special<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.210> think<00:02:05.690> I<00:02:05.720> better<00:02:05.870> have<00:02:06.050> one
