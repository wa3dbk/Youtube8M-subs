00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
very technically difficult site again we

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.050 
very technically difficult site again we
seem<00:00:22.630> to<00:00:22.749> specialize<00:00:23.230> in<00:00:23.259> them<00:00:23.679> 9<00:00:24.519> meter<00:00:24.789> drop

from the house to the entrance gates and
we<00:00:27.699> came<00:00:27.880> up<00:00:27.910> with<00:00:28.179> a<00:00:28.210> wonderful<00:00:28.839> plan<00:00:29.050> to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
we came up with a wonderful plan to

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.220 
we came up with a wonderful plan to
retain<00:00:29.949> the<00:00:30.099> soil<00:00:30.310> and<00:00:30.609> create<00:00:31.449> these<00:00:31.630> lovely

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230

retain the soil and create these lovely
usable<00:00:33.010> level<00:00:33.700> areas<00:00:34.150> within<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.660> garden

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
usable level areas within the garden

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.240 
usable level areas within the garden
water<00:00:36.550> is<00:00:37.350> fantastic<00:00:38.350> in<00:00:38.469> a<00:00:38.530> garden<00:00:38.890> and<00:00:39.010> you

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
water is fantastic in a garden and you

well<00:00:41.649> a<00:00:42.989> difficult<00:00:43.989> garden<00:00:44.260> like<00:00:44.410> this

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
well a difficult garden like this

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.790 
well a difficult garden like this
benefits<00:00:45.309> hugely<00:00:45.879> from<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.420> ability<00:00:46.780> to<00:00:47.289> draw

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
benefits hugely from the ability to draw

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.240 
benefits hugely from the ability to draw
the<00:00:48.129> plan<00:00:48.760> up<00:00:49.059> into<00:00:49.660> three<00:00:49.899> dimension<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:51.129> you

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
the plan up into three dimension and you

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.430 
the plan up into three dimension and you
can<00:00:51.399> see<00:00:51.609> here<00:00:52.000> how<00:00:52.329> we've<00:00:52.989> been<00:00:53.170> able<00:00:53.289> to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
can see here how we've been able to

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.520 
can see here how we've been able to
prove<00:00:53.859> our<00:00:54.250> design<00:00:54.670> that<00:00:55.359> it<00:00:55.629> is<00:00:55.870> realistic

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
prove our design that it is realistic

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.419 
prove our design that it is realistic
it's<00:00:57.100> buildable<00:00:57.699> it's<00:00:58.059> practical<00:00:58.839> and

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
it's buildable it's practical and

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.090 
it's buildable it's practical and
achievable<00:01:00.429> and<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.750> this<00:01:02.109> site<00:01:02.320> really<00:01:02.890> was

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
achievable and this this site really was

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.490 
achievable and this this site really was
a<00:01:03.370> challenge<00:01:03.879> to<00:01:04.059> work<00:01:04.269> on<00:01:04.540> but<00:01:05.379> we've

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
a challenge to work on but we've

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.770 
a challenge to work on but we've
introduced<00:01:06.010> water<00:01:06.340> which<00:01:06.790> goes<00:01:07.030> incredibly

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
introduced water which goes incredibly

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.109 
introduced water which goes incredibly
well<00:01:07.990> with<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.440> hoof<00:01:08.650> house<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.670> hoof<00:01:09.880> house

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
well with the hoof house the hoof house

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.050 
well with the hoof house the hoof house
has<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:11.110> great<00:01:11.350> deal<00:01:11.530> of<00:01:11.590> glass<00:01:12.430> on<00:01:12.790> the

has a great deal of glass on the
external<00:01:13.390> surfaces<00:01:14.049> and<00:01:14.350> we<00:01:15.220> also<00:01:15.369> have

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
external surfaces and we also have

picked up a wonderful architectural
detail<00:01:18.040> from<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.520> hoof<00:01:18.790> house<00:01:19.030> design<00:01:19.810> which

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
detail from the hoof house design which

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.380 
detail from the hoof house design which
is<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.920> rain<00:01:21.130> chain<00:01:21.490> so<00:01:21.820> whorehouses<00:01:22.210> don't

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
is the rain chain so whorehouses don't

is the rain chain so whorehouses don't
have<00:01:22.930> down<00:01:23.530> pipes<00:01:23.829> they<00:01:24.220> have<00:01:24.399> a<00:01:24.430> chain<00:01:24.759> which

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
have down pipes they have a chain which

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.240 
have down pipes they have a chain which
the<00:01:25.180> rain<00:01:25.360> water<00:01:25.600> falls<00:01:25.930> down<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.890> we've<00:01:27.040> used

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
the rain water falls down and we've used

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.639 
the rain water falls down and we've used
that<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:27.759> our<00:01:27.939> four<00:01:28.329> tier<00:01:28.570> water<00:01:28.960> cascade

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649
