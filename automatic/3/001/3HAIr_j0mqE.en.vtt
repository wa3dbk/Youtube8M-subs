00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.969 
really nice I'll say that much it's
definitely<00:01:41.159> something<00:01:41.670> different<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.860> know

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
definitely something different you know

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.039 
definitely something different you know
I<00:01:44.040> didn't<00:01:44.490> know<00:01:44.909> how<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.210> design<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.869> pattern

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
I didn't know how the design and pattern

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.310 
I didn't know how the design and pattern
was<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.040> person<00:01:47.509> or<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> picture

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
was actually in person or in the picture

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.450 
was actually in person or in the picture
and<00:01:49.439> tell<00:01:49.560> us<00:01:49.619> off<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.890> person<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.340> it's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and tell us off in person so it's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.289 
and tell us off in person so it's
basically<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:51.780> almost<00:01:52.200> looks<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.430> or

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
basically it almost looks like a or

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.249 
basically it almost looks like a or
feels<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:57.890> lasered<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.659> 3m<00:02:00.659> kind<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.170> a

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
feels like a lasered in 3m kind of a

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.819 
feels like a lasered in 3m kind of a
deal<00:02:01.500> or<00:02:01.890> maybe<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.600> black<00:02:04.020> foam<00:02:04.350> positive

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
deal or maybe like a black foam positive

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.850 
deal or maybe like a black foam positive
what<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:05.219> overlay<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.820> 3m<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.140> it's

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
what they overlay of 3m on it so it's

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.880 
what they overlay of 3m on it so it's
not<00:02:08.009> coated<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:09.000> actually<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:10.289> 3m<00:02:10.739> is

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
not coated it's actually the 3m is

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.890 
not coated it's actually the 3m is
separate<00:02:11.340> from

like<00:04:00.139> if<00:04:00.500> they<00:04:00.620> actually<00:04:00.769> didn't<00:04:01.099> use<00:04:01.129> green

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.830 
like if they actually didn't use green
and<00:04:01.669> maybe<00:04:02.030> used<00:04:02.359> a<00:04:02.720> blue<00:04:03.560> or<00:04:04.659> some<00:04:05.659> other

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
and maybe used a blue or some other

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.360 
and maybe used a blue or some other
colorways<00:04:06.229> to<00:04:06.620> it'll<00:04:06.919> definitely<00:04:07.129> be
