00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:38.260 

you

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.470 

okay<00:00:39.500> okay<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.950> only<00:00:41.730> me

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
okay okay so only me

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.810 
okay okay so only me
we<00:00:42.930> made<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> digitally<00:00:43.620> controlled<00:00:43.820> electric

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
we made a digitally controlled electric

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.049 
we made a digitally controlled electric
guitar<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:48.110> basically<00:00:49.610> what<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.700> did<00:00:50.850> was

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
guitar so so basically what we did was

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.939 
guitar so so basically what we did was
we<00:00:51.090> took<00:00:51.480> out<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> internal<00:00:52.379> circuit<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
we took out the internal circuit of the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.010 
we took out the internal circuit of the
electric<00:00:53.760> guitar<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.540> we<00:00:54.629> made<00:00:54.750> everything

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
electric guitar and we made everything

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.100 
electric guitar and we made everything
digital<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:56.970> have<00:00:57.120> now<00:00:57.360> or<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> can

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
digital so what we have now or you can

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.220 
digital so what we have now or you can
see<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.650> these<00:00:59.430> are<00:00:59.460> instead<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.420> knob

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
see here is these are instead of a knob

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.439 
see here is these are instead of a knob
at<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.650> stroke<00:01:01.890> did<00:01:02.339> attached<00:01:03.269> to<00:01:03.420> a

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
at a stroke did attached to a

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
at a stroke did attached to a
potentiometer<00:01:03.900> we<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.739> rotary<00:01:05.100> encoders

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
potentiometer we have rotary encoders

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.380 
potentiometer we have rotary encoders
which<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.479> these<00:01:06.600> knobs<00:01:07.430> inside<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.700> inside

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
which are these knobs inside all inside

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.210 
which are these knobs inside all inside
the<00:01:09.600> guitar<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.410> the<00:01:10.500> circuitry<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the guitar is all the circuitry for the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.900 
the guitar is all the circuitry for the
rotary<00:01:11.520> encoders<00:01:11.940> and<00:01:12.170> what<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.910> each

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
rotary encoders and what they do is each

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.980 
rotary encoders and what they do is each
one<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.240> communicating<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.899> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
one is communicating with the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.520 
one is communicating with the
microcontroller<00:01:16.649> and<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.810> microcontroller

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
microcontroller and the microcontroller

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.040 
microcontroller and the microcontroller
then<00:01:19.770> programs<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.399> digital<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.330> digital

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
then programs a digital a digital

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.080 
then programs a digital a digital
potentiometer<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> values<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
potentiometer with the values that it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.389 
potentiometer with the values that it
receives<00:01:24.750> from<00:01:24.869> these<00:01:25.140> rotary<00:01:25.590> encoders<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
receives from these rotary encoders so

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.010 
receives from these rotary encoders so
from<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.789> viewpoint<00:01:27.300> of<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> final

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
from the viewpoint of the final

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080 
from the viewpoint of the final
electronics<00:01:28.649> it's<00:01:28.830> still<00:01:29.070> an<00:01:29.220> analog<00:01:29.640> sister

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
electronics it's still an analog sister

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.300 
electronics it's still an analog sister
it's<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.899> just<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.350> potentiometer<00:01:31.830> but

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
it's a it's a just a potentiometer but

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.160 
it's a it's a just a potentiometer but
it's<00:01:32.460> precisely<00:01:32.910> because<00:01:33.210> essentially<00:01:33.869> all

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
it's precisely because essentially all

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.040 
it's precisely because essentially all
the<00:01:34.380> components<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.920> used<00:01:35.160> to<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.369> didja

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
the components that used to be didja

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.690 
the components that used to be didja
analog<00:01:37.050> you<00:01:37.440> know<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.679> potentiometers<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
analog you know the potentiometers a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.820 
analog you know the potentiometers a
tone<00:01:38.880> knobs<00:01:39.090> are<00:01:39.330> now<00:01:39.479> desert<00:01:40.170> ok<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.649> is

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
tone knobs are now desert ok and what is

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.040 
tone knobs are now desert ok and what is
in<00:01:40.979> control<00:01:41.250> hey<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.640> does<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.179> so

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
in control hey what does this get you so

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.719 
in control hey what does this get you so
now<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> thing<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.619> every<00:01:44.340> time<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> know

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
now the thing is every time you know

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.919 
now the thing is every time you know
when<00:01:44.940> you're<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> performer<00:01:45.240> if<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:45.899> a

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
when you're a performer if you're a

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.050 
when you're a performer if you're a
performer<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.679> a<00:01:46.740> guitar

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
performer and if you have a guitar

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.940 
performer and if you have a guitar
you've<00:01:48.060> had<00:01:48.179> the<00:01:48.390> misfortune<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:49.229> having<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
you've had the misfortune of having to

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.669 
you've had the misfortune of having to
change<00:01:50.190> different<00:01:50.630> pickups<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.929> having<00:01:52.590> to

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
change different pickups and having to

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.380 
change different pickups and having to
adjust<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:53.190> every<00:01:53.429> time<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.729> change<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.119> pickup

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
adjust it every time you change a pickup

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.240 
adjust it every time you change a pickup
so<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.380> kind<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.649> painful<00:01:55.920> process

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
so it's kind of a painful process

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.130 
so it's kind of a painful process
especially<00:01:56.880> if<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.690> know<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.959> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
especially if you're you know in the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.930 
especially if you're you know in the
middle<00:01:58.440> of<00:01:58.560> playing<00:01:59.009> at<00:01:59.190> sovereign<00:01:59.429> you<00:01:59.819> know

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
middle of playing at sovereign you know

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.029 
middle of playing at sovereign you know
the<00:02:00.090> performance<00:02:00.599> and<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.890> want

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
the performance and you have to you want

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.100 
the performance and you have to you want
to<00:02:02.099> quickly<00:02:02.280> change<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.720> settings<00:02:04.080> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
to quickly change the the settings of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.270 
to quickly change the the settings of
your<00:02:04.170> guitar<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.709> that<00:02:04.830> sound<00:02:05.069> that<00:02:05.130> you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
your guitar to get that sound that you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.389 
your guitar to get that sound that you
want<00:02:05.539> so<00:02:06.539> you<00:02:07.470> can't<00:02:07.709> it's<00:02:07.890> almost<00:02:08.099> impossible

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
want so you can't it's almost impossible

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.919 
want so you can't it's almost impossible
to<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.910> during<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> performance<00:02:09.479> because

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to that during a performance because

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.330 
to that during a performance because
you're<00:02:10.080> playing<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.590> can't<00:02:10.800> just<00:02:11.039> change

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
you're playing and you can't just change

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.690 
you're playing and you can't just change
and<00:02:11.580> adjust<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.940> tone<00:02:13.099> but<00:02:14.099> with<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.430> you

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
and adjust the tone but with this you

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.180 
and adjust the tone but with this you
can<00:02:15.000> enables<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:15.989> do<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.500> with<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.130> a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
can enables you to do that with just a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.410 
can enables you to do that with just a
push<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.520> button<00:02:17.550> because<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.390> have

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
push of a button because you have

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.120 
push of a button because you have
presets<00:02:18.959> that's<00:02:19.380> right<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.069> have

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
presets that's right and so you have

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.330 
presets that's right and so you have
digital<00:02:20.610> memory<00:02:20.819> presets<00:02:21.650> haha<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.280> he

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
digital memory presets haha so he

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.850 
digital memory presets haha so he
basically<00:02:23.459> saves<00:02:24.090> all<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:25.590> know<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
basically saves all that you know the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.260 
basically saves all that you know the
trouble<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.670> went<00:02:26.879> through<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.180> get

that sound that you want and
you<00:02:29.660> don't<00:02:29.810> know<00:02:29.930> long<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.230> have<00:02:30.379> to<00:02:30.580> try<00:02:31.580> and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
you don't know long you have to try and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.610 
you don't know long you have to try and
get<00:02:32.330> back<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.720> sound<00:02:32.959> middle<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.319> save<00:02:33.500> it

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
get back that sound middle to save it

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.110

for<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.950> okay<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.340> let's<00:02:34.610> see<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> couple<00:02:34.940> of

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
for you okay so let's see a couple of

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.960 
for you okay so let's see a couple of
presets<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.920> what<00:02:37.400> we<00:02:37.489> haven't<00:02:37.790> shown

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
presets you so so what we haven't shown

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.900 
presets you so so what we haven't shown
yet<00:02:38.150> is<00:02:38.420> there's<00:02:38.810> an<00:02:38.930> LCD<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:40.550> we<00:02:40.610> set<00:02:40.819> up

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
yet is there's an LCD that we set up

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.860 
yet is there's an LCD that we set up
that's<00:02:41.120> back<00:02:41.450> here<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.110> coming<00:02:42.349> back<00:02:42.410> here<00:02:42.680> um

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
that's back here you coming back here um

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.940 
that's back here you coming back here um
the<00:02:44.870> LCD<00:02:46.000> would<00:02:47.000> be<00:02:47.200> ideally<00:02:48.200> inside<00:02:48.590> or<00:02:48.739> close

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
the LCD would be ideally inside or close

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.170 
the LCD would be ideally inside or close
to<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.190> front<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.489> guitar<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.060> user

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
to the front of the guitar so the user

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.440 
to the front of the guitar so the user
can<00:02:50.300> use<00:02:50.599> it<00:02:50.780> like<00:02:51.500> for<00:02:51.709> example<00:02:51.800> right<00:02:52.190> here

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
can use it like for example right here

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.300 
can use it like for example right here
what<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.569> shows<00:02:53.599> right<00:02:53.959> now<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.980> shows<00:02:55.160> the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
what it shows right now is it shows the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.449 
what it shows right now is it shows the
preset<00:02:55.730> you're<00:02:55.849> on<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:57.200> shows<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.650> pickup<00:02:58.010> it

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
preset you're on it shows the pickup it

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.880 
preset you're on it shows the pickup it
shows<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.030> volume<00:02:59.330> setting<00:02:59.660> which<00:02:59.830> pouria<00:03:00.830> is

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
shows the volume setting which pouria is

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.680 
shows the volume setting which pouria is
changing<00:03:01.220> right<00:03:01.340> now<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.910> two<00:03:02.090> tone<00:03:02.390> knob

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
changing right now and the two tone knob

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.100 
changing right now and the two tone knob
settings<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.760> if<00:03:05.090> pouria<00:03:05.390> presses<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.840> next

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
settings so if pouria presses the next

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.809 
settings so if pouria presses the next
button<00:03:06.349> or<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.500> previous<00:03:06.920> button<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.730> can

button or the previous button you can

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.569 
button or the previous button you can
see<00:03:08.030> all<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.299> presets<00:03:08.870> change<00:03:09.200> as<00:03:09.470> he<00:03:10.310> presses

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
see all the presets change as he presses

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.180 
see all the presets change as he presses
the<00:03:10.849> button<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:12.140> delay<00:03:12.440> should<00:03:12.920> be<00:03:13.040> only

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
the button so the delay should be only

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.250 
the button so the delay should be only
close<00:03:13.519> to<00:03:13.670> about<00:03:13.849> 10<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.390> 20<00:03:14.599> milliseconds

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
close to about 10 to 20 milliseconds

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.400 
close to about 10 to 20 milliseconds
total<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.329> as<00:03:17.599> you're<00:03:17.780> what<00:03:18.019> you're<00:03:18.140> doing

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
total and so as you're what you're doing

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.199 
total and so as you're what you're doing
is<00:03:18.500> pressing<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.040> preset<00:03:19.489> button<00:03:19.880> here<00:03:20.060> so

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
is pressing the preset button here so

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.150 
is pressing the preset button here so
you<00:03:20.329> have<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.510> forward<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.110> back<00:03:21.290> on<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.829> tooth

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
you have a forward and back on the tooth

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.520 
you have a forward and back on the tooth
this<00:03:22.519> forward<00:03:22.940> he's<00:03:24.099> cute<00:03:25.099> yeah<00:03:26.470> okay<00:03:27.470> so

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
this forward he's cute yeah okay so

let's hear let's hear it do something

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.710 
let's hear let's hear it do something
here

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:55.170 

that<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.810> more<00:03:33.930> basic<00:03:34.170> past<00:03:34.590> very<00:03:34.920> busy

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.940 

good<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.690> we'll<00:03:56.990> start<00:03:57.200> over<00:03:57.290> here<00:03:57.560> we<00:03:57.920> have

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
good so we'll start over here we have

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.610 
good so we'll start over here we have
the<00:03:58.340> user<00:03:58.760> interface<00:03:59.020> here<00:04:00.020> where<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.470> user

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
the user interface here where the user

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.340 
the user interface here where the user
can<00:04:00.710> see<00:04:01.010> what's<00:04:01.220> going<00:04:01.310> on<00:04:01.580> with<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.820> presets

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
can see what's going on with the presets

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.410 
can see what's going on with the presets
but<00:04:03.350> first<00:04:03.530> we<00:04:03.830> have<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.580> tone<00:04:04.820> knobs<00:04:05.120> and

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
but first we have the the tone knobs and

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.060 
but first we have the the tone knobs and
the<00:04:06.140> previous<00:04:06.320> tone<00:04:06.590> knobs<00:04:06.770> that<00:04:06.830> are<00:04:06.980> now

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
the previous tone knobs that are now

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.410 
the previous tone knobs that are now
digitally<00:04:07.670> interfaced<00:04:08.150> with<00:04:08.300> the

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
cover it up and you know to like it look

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
cover it up and you know to like it look
nicer<00:04:44.290> cool<00:04:45.290> so<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.919> so<00:04:46.340> this<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:47.120> analog

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
nicer cool so the so this the the analog

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.050 
nicer cool so the so this the the analog
signal<00:04:48.230> path<00:04:48.470> is<00:04:48.980> through<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.580> pickups

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
signal path is through the pickups

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.560 
signal path is through the pickups
directly<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.490> digital<00:04:52.570> potentiometers

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
directly to the digital potentiometers

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.500 
directly to the digital potentiometers
and<00:04:53.840> then<00:04:54.500> out<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:55.190> amplifier<00:04:55.490> as<00:04:56.060> usual

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
and then out to the amplifier as usual

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.600 
and then out to the amplifier as usual
it<00:04:57.169> essentially<00:04:57.770> yeah<00:04:57.890> it<00:04:58.070> is<00:04:58.190> it's<00:04:58.460> also

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
it essentially yeah it is it's also

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.610 
it essentially yeah it is it's also
connected<00:04:58.910> to<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.479> N<00:04:59.690> OGG<00:04:59.900> multiplexer<00:05:00.410> right

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
connected to the N OGG multiplexer right

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.460 
connected to the N OGG multiplexer right
to<00:05:01.010> dungeon<00:05:01.340> meghna<00:05:01.580> mixing<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.470> mixing

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
to dungeon meghna mixing and and mixing

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.320 
to dungeon meghna mixing and and mixing
the<00:05:03.560> two<00:05:03.680> signals<00:05:03.890> so<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:04.820> system<00:05:05.090> is<00:05:05.210> very

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
the two signals so the system is very

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.909 
the two signals so the system is very
quiet<00:05:05.570> I'm<00:05:05.780> not<00:05:05.900> hearing<00:05:06.110> a<00:05:06.169> 60<00:05:06.500> Hertz<00:05:06.650> noise

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
quiet I'm not hearing a 60 Hertz noise

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.370 
quiet I'm not hearing a 60 Hertz noise
I'm<00:05:07.220> really<00:05:07.580> any<00:05:08.120> junk<00:05:08.479> no<00:05:08.720> no<00:05:09.080> crackling

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
I'm really any junk no no crackling

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.860 
I'm really any junk no no crackling
right<00:05:09.950> so<00:05:10.160> we<00:05:10.910> found<00:05:10.940> that<00:05:11.300> if<00:05:11.479> you<00:05:11.600> place

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
right so we found that if you place

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.860 
right so we found that if you place
these<00:05:12.380> wires<00:05:12.710> that<00:05:13.160> uh<00:05:13.370> that<00:05:13.910> bring<00:05:14.780> the

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
these wires that uh that bring the

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.960 
these wires that uh that bring the
pickups<00:05:15.229> into<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.560> analog<00:05:15.800> multiplexer<00:05:16.490> if

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
pickups into the analog multiplexer if

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.060 
pickups into the analog multiplexer if
you<00:05:17.180> place<00:05:17.510> these<00:05:17.720> wires<00:05:17.990> close<00:05:18.380> to<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.650> LCD

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
you place these wires close to the LCD

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.010 
you place these wires close to the LCD
screen<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.580> lot<00:05:20.120> of<00:05:20.240> times<00:05:20.390> you<00:05:20.540> get<00:05:20.690> some<00:05:20.900> of

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
screen a lot of times you get some of

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.780 
screen a lot of times you get some of
the<00:05:21.080> noise<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.590> you<00:05:21.770> get<00:05:22.010> you'll<00:05:22.190> get<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:22.400> 60

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
the noise and you get you'll get a 60

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.150 
the noise and you get you'll get a 60
Hertz<00:05:22.970> tone<00:05:23.270> coming<00:05:23.690> out<00:05:23.810> mm-hmm<00:05:24.350> but<00:05:24.979> if<00:05:25.040> we

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
Hertz tone coming out mm-hmm but if we

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.430 
Hertz tone coming out mm-hmm but if we
keep<00:05:25.340> it<00:05:25.490> far<00:05:25.700> enough<00:05:25.760> away<00:05:26.000> um<00:05:26.390> there's<00:05:27.350> no

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
keep it far enough away um there's no

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.170 
keep it far enough away um there's no
notice<00:05:27.860> so<00:05:28.160> figure<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.520> actually<00:05:28.820> put<00:05:29.030> this

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
notice so figure to actually put this

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.210 
notice so figure to actually put this
inside<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.140> guitar<00:05:30.440> we<00:05:30.650> would<00:05:30.770> want<00:05:30.950> to<00:05:31.040> keep

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
inside the guitar we would want to keep

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.909 
inside the guitar we would want to keep
it<00:05:31.370> at<00:05:31.940> least<00:05:32.240> six<00:05:33.110> or<00:05:33.229> seven<00:05:33.500> inches<00:05:33.590> away

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
it at least six or seven inches away

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.130 
it at least six or seven inches away
Frank<00:05:34.340> so<00:05:34.700> presumably<00:05:34.970> this<00:05:35.510> would<00:05:35.720> be<00:05:35.810> inside

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
Frank so presumably this would be inside

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.050 
Frank so presumably this would be inside
the<00:05:36.290> guitar<00:05:36.650> but<00:05:36.979> this<00:05:37.160> would<00:05:37.340> be<00:05:37.370> right<00:05:37.700> here

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
the guitar but this would be right here

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.969 
the guitar but this would be right here
right<00:05:38.360> perhaps<00:05:38.720> or<00:05:39.020> somewhere<00:05:39.350> inside<00:05:39.620> we

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
right perhaps or somewhere inside we

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.430 
right perhaps or somewhere inside we
have<00:05:40.520> this<00:05:40.790> we<00:05:41.000> have<00:05:41.120> just<00:05:41.300> like<00:05:41.720> coming<00:05:42.110> all

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
have this we have just like coming all

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.480 
have this we have just like coming all
the<00:05:42.530> wires<00:05:42.710> are<00:05:42.800> coming<00:05:43.010> out<00:05:43.100> from<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.310> back

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
the wires are coming out from the back

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.190 
the wires are coming out from the back
mm-hmm<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.300> know<00:05:44.419> it<00:05:44.690> doesn't<00:05:44.780> look<00:05:44.990> as

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
mm-hmm you know it doesn't look as

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.540 
mm-hmm you know it doesn't look as
beautiful<00:05:45.500> in<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:45.890> back<00:05:46.040> foot<00:05:46.220> tonight<00:05:46.460> you

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
beautiful in the back foot tonight you

00:05:46.550 --> 00:06:16.879 
beautiful in the back foot tonight you
can't<00:05:46.790> no<00:05:46.910> calluses<00:05:47.380> not<00:05:48.380> for<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:48.620> front

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:25.970
