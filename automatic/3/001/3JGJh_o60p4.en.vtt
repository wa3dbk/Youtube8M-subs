00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 or whether we're right here with 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.460
 all the magic of the circus as I said in 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.380
 the note and the 900 circus without clowns 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.450
 we do not exactly hear some here 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.120
 who are doing their show especially 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.210
 for us then the clowns 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.400
 dancers and also musicians they us 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.680
 surprise on the stage jessica 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.740
 astrid doing everything a little bit 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.689
 tale that they dance sing in the end we are going to 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.119
 talk in a few more minutes but 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.199
 let's listen to a fragment of this from 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.199
 show they do 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.020
 who are we seeing on screen 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.300
 jessica if they are the lions and precisely 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.950
 we are with the lion friend and who is going 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.989
 to tell a little about the sun and 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.300
 everything that you present every night 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.580
 here in the green circus if you look at us 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.820
 we are the comic part of the show 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.640
 the lions directly from mexico to 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.470
 Peru we can say that it is the only circus 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.940
 to know a kid is a teacher to have 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.890
 a little piece of music that is seen by some 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.890
 that this one is seen to see we're going 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.930
 to these so they do not want the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.180
 walking topos we can say jessica that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.110
 It is the only authorized circus 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.259
 present lions not accurate can we is the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.759
 unique circus that presents lion and perfect 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.250
 and what do you think if they help us get 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.950
 all this because the attraction of the circus 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.259
 it is precisely the transform the car 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.319
 transform the only one in all america 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.549
 latina and do not forget we're in 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:52.619
 megaplaza we wait for you in megaplaza 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.439
 megaplaza shopping center we wait for you 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.319
 perfect then the cherry came out and 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.569
 now you have to see precisely jessica 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:05.000
 because what has brought us here is 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.000
 a car to say the least spectacular 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.580
 I'm going to present it 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.060
 and there it makes its appearance is a car of 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:22.739
 real size precisely and there it is 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.569
 there is someone who handles ismael does his 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.980
 presentation there 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.980
 speaks to us yet 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.630
 it's a true transform the guys 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.460
 in almost nothing really with this 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.840
 and attentive because at any time 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.840
 the car transform 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.490
 there is 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:54.230
 the station was transformed while 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.240
 in less than two seconds 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.840
 let's show where the lights turn on 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.490
 also to be able to see it better and 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.490
 we are at cost there 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.830
 so that more or less in their homes they can 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.000
 see the real size of what he is 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.640
 transformers jessica we are not 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.130
 pressed the same as watching this 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.010
 When I was 8 or 10 years old I would have stayed 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.710
 to live around here but in me the circus is 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.450
 well there's a lot of magic there's a lot of 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.460
 invitation as you said so that 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.830
 may not only come this circus 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:35.760
 but to all the circuses that there are in all 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.760
 whatever and they see this again 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.980
 and I like the trolleys what 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.060
 pretty how many infractions comes from 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.640
 this car and so I was wondering if someone 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.500
 he handled it new because then he can take out 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.489
 to the driver because the driver today 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.489
 has it behind 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.180
 There he likes to show himself the car 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.640
 linda is very modern 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.829
 and precisely all the people of the circus 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.620
 already begins to leave precisely for the 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.200
 goodbye this microwave the friends that 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.180
 clowns juggle friends 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.680
 beat everyone is here we are 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.690
 also on stage with them 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.729
 stealing a little bit of the master show 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.169
 finally the invitation for all 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.050
 people come because there is so much to see 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.650
 here 200 you know we expect them here in 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.750
 mega company in front of sun and sea 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.169
 we hope the north plaza does not 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:42.990
 forget little friends from Monday to Friday two 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:42.990
