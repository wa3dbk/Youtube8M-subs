00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.562
 In this video I will answer the question of what you have to do as suddenly during the altitude tests 

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:13.243
 you were diagnosed with a lack of binocular vision and as a consequence you were not allowed to work or work 

00:00:13.243 --> 00:00:15.446
 which you have been doing for many years. 

00:00:16.414 --> 00:00:20.586
 Of course, I'm talking about a situation where the spatial vision you had previously preserved 

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:28.933
 Well, let's not say how the previous medical rulings, let's say so gently were pulled. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.662
 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki, I am a doctor of transport medicine from Wroclaw. 

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.980
 And traditionally I will start with an Internet user's email. 

00:00:39.052 --> 00:00:42.642
 "Hello, I am asking for advice on what to do in this situation. 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.049
 I am an electrician, I have been working in the profession for 27 years and so far I have been able to pass such tests without any problem. 

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:56.556
 Recently, however, the workplace sent me for periodic examinations to another doctor, and what turned out? 

00:00:57.097 --> 00:00:59.750
 That I did not pass the height tests. 

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:06.391
 It was stated in them that I have trouble with visual impairment, although it seems to me that 

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:14.248
 I went through this study, but it was found that I did not have spatial or stereoscopic vision. 

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:22.057
 I spilled this test on a booklet in which there were cards, one of them divided into four squares. 

00:01:22.057 --> 00:01:29.169
 There were two diagonals in the diagonals, two in the hat-slippers, in which the wheels were supposedly hidden, supposedly one bigger, 

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:34.300
 the other smaller, but I could not see these wheels. 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.000
 And my question here is whether I am already a height invalide or whether it is somehow cured. 

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:48.880
 Somewhere I have heard that it is possible to work in contact lenses in some special situations. 

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:54.110
 I am also asking your doctor for an answer, best regards "- Paul from Krakow. 

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:58.640
 Answering these questions one by one, such a small introduction. 

00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:07.377
 It is known that the age gets worse with age. I'm an example of that and 27 years of Internet user's work, 

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:13.090
 that the internet user is not the youngest employee in his company. 

00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:20.100
 If I was in this situation, I would quickly go to the second ophthalmologist for some independent opinion. 

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:26.540
 If this problem is to correct contact lenses or any other treatment 

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:33.910
 Well, probably this eye specialist will tell you what you should do next. 

00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:45.080
 At the same time, I would appeal against this medical certificate to the Provincial Center for Occupational Medicine. 

00:02:46.288 --> 00:02:49.930
 There, you will undergo another ophthalmological examination with another eye doctor. 

00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:57.090
 And you can hope that if this result of the previous study was accidental 

00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:01.190
 Well, the next should be better. 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.370
 Sometimes it happens so that the subject does not really understand what is going on. 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:14.560
 The doctor will over-interpret it as a mistake or as a lack of binocular vision. 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.860
 And this is particularly true when you are being examined by some other new method for the first time. 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:29.539
 However, as I mentioned earlier, I am talking here only about cases when the spatial vision you had before 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:30.730
 fine. 

00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:36.990
 And not if we say a positive judgment was somehow "sorted out". 

00:03:39.144 --> 00:03:44.620
 That's where I end, if of course you have some experience in a similar or even identical situation. 

00:03:45.182 --> 00:03:47.580
 Be sure to write in the comments under this video. 

00:03:48.492 --> 00:03:52.090
 Perhaps someone will solve his problem. 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.380
 Often, it is even densely an identical problem. 

00:03:55.976 --> 00:03:59.190
 If you like this video, give me a like-mind, give me a thumb. 

00:03:59.925 --> 00:04:04.900
 And even if you really liked it, put it on your social network 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.000
 or any of your website. 

00:04:09.373 --> 00:04:15.040
 As usual, the most discussions about altitude and vision problems 

00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:20.020
 takes place on my website www.Badania-Lekarz-Medycyny-Pracy.com. 

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:23.340
 And there, of course, drop in right after watching this video. 

00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:31.990
 The link is in the description of the film, of course in the description of the movie if you watch it on the YouTube channel MedicalMedicinePracy 

00:04:32.837 --> 00:04:38.618
 of course, if you want more such videos, be sure to subscribe to my channel, it's somewhere here 

00:04:38.618 --> 00:04:41.280
 for subscription, I never know where. 

00:04:41.976 --> 00:04:43.540
 Usually here or here. 

00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:52.150
 Once a week, I will try to send you some interesting material about employee surveys, driver research 

00:04:53.027 --> 00:04:56.130
 or related topics related to work medicine. 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.870
 Also Darek Kraśnicki from Wroclaw said, see you in my next video. 

00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:07.700
 And by the way, if you are after all a young employee or young internet users 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:16.560
 and you are just about to start learning in a profession, towards a profession similar to the one mentioned here 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:21.620
 and you have problems with binocular vision, say after treated or untreated squint. 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:27.380
 I strongly advise you against education in these areas, especially those related to work at heights 

00:05:28.566 --> 00:05:34.570
 professional driving of vehicles or some similar professions. 

00:05:35.608 --> 00:05:41.110
 As you saw in this video, the lack of proper binocular vision is the most common reason for not letting you 

00:05:41.112 --> 00:05:46.655
 to work at heights and it's better to avoid it in the future. 

00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:54.730
 He did not have such stressful situations, that you work over a dozen years and suddenly someone deprives you of this job. 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:01.180
 Said Darek Kraśnicki from Wrocław, specialist in transport medicine.
