been doing the show for about a year at
that<00:02:37.760> point<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:38.630> were<00:02:38.660> trying<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.230> think

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
that point and we were trying to think

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.040 
that point and we were trying to think
up<00:02:39.650> some<00:02:39.920> new<00:02:40.040> episode<00:02:40.520> ideas<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.240> we<00:02:41.870> thought

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
up some new episode ideas and we thought

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.650 
up some new episode ideas and we thought
of<00:02:42.260> one<00:02:42.530> where<00:02:42.950> Alan<00:02:43.580> tries<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:44.030> fix<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.480> top

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
of one where Alan tries to fix the top

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.380 
of one where Alan tries to fix the top
floor<00:02:45.020> because<00:02:45.620> when<00:02:46.340> we<00:02:46.490> were<00:02:46.640> kids<00:02:46.910> playing

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
floor because when we were kids playing

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.240 
floor because when we were kids playing
with<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.840> dollhouse<00:02:48.050> we<00:02:48.770> had<00:02:48.860> always<00:02:48.980> hated

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
with the dollhouse we had always hated

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.630 
with the dollhouse we had always hated
how<00:02:49.550> unstable<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.420> top<00:02:50.600> floor<00:02:50.930> was<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.950> we

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
how unstable the top floor was so we

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.790 
how unstable the top floor was so we
were<00:02:53.060> looking<00:02:53.210> at<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.570> house<00:02:53.720> one<00:02:54.020> day<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.230> we

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
were looking at the house one day and we

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.160 
were looking at the house one day and we
realized<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.670> there<00:02:55.850> was<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> plastic<00:02:56.450> piece

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
realized that there was a plastic piece

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.500 
realized that there was a plastic piece
that's<00:02:57.650> supposed<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.070> flip<00:02:58.310> out<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:58.880> support

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
that's supposed to flip out and support

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.680 
that's supposed to flip out and support
the<00:02:59.630> top<00:02:59.840> floor<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.410> as<00:03:01.070> kids<00:03:01.550> we<00:03:02.150> never<00:03:02.450> knew

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
the top floor and as kids we never knew

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.050 
the top floor and as kids we never knew
about<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:03.200> we<00:03:03.320> never<00:03:03.500> used<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.910> we

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
about it so we never used it and so we

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.520 
about it so we never used it and so we
were<00:03:05.209> thinking<00:03:05.450> well<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.290> would<00:03:06.410> be<00:03:06.500> a

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
were thinking well that would be a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.710 
were thinking well that would be a
really<00:03:06.740> funny<00:03:07.010> idea<00:03:07.160> for<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.760> show<00:03:08.000> if<00:03:08.270> Alan

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
really funny idea for the show if Alan

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.500 
really funny idea for the show if Alan
didn't<00:03:09.110> know<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.590> support<00:03:09.950> piece<00:03:10.220> existed<00:03:10.910> so

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
didn't know the support piece existed so

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.360 
didn't know the support piece existed so
he<00:03:11.690> spent<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.170> whole<00:03:12.200> episode<00:03:12.410> trying<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.130> fix

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
he spent the whole episode trying to fix

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.310 
he spent the whole episode trying to fix
it<00:03:13.610> even<00:03:14.300> though<00:03:14.390> he<00:03:14.540> never<00:03:14.660> needed<00:03:14.990> to

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
it even though he never needed to

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.940 
it even though he never needed to
Katniss<00:03:16.220> ever<00:03:16.520> kept<00:03:16.970> Neil<00:03:17.270> says<00:03:17.840> dear<00:03:18.650> Kevin
