might<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> back<00:00:30.119> rub<00:00:30.300> or<00:00:30.449> something<00:00:30.720> anyway

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
might be a back rub or something anyway

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.920 
might be a back rub or something anyway
I've<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.790> seared<00:00:33.180> them<00:00:33.329> off<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.809> then

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.810 
cook them in Amy's mushroom soup and
they're<00:00:37.500> kind<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.770> thickened<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.520> like

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
they're kind of thickened it up like

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.299

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
reduced it down slightly so it's kind of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.770 
reduced it down slightly so it's kind of
