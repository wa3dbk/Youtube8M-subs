00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.620
Am I on screen?

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.480
Hi, this is Elmo.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.460
I am at Nihonbashi now.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.580
This place is so beautiful.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.200
I have fallen in love with this place.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920
Oh! It has the same colour as Elmo.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280
What's written over there?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.960
Ta-ka-shi-ma-ya

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.040
Hi. Good afternoon.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.980
What's your name?

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.820
Rose

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
Elmo is called Elmo.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.460
Welcome to our store.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.220
Welcome to our store.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640
Good afternoon. I am Elmo.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.460
Welcome to our store, Elmo.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200
Where is this place?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.200
This is a department store.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.280
A department store.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.340
It is a place where all kinds of things are being sold.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.900
All kinds of things? That's amazing!

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.980
What's this?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.780
This is ojigi.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.260
It is the Japanese way of greetings.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.520
Ojigi

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.660
How is it done?

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.000
Please try to follow my actions.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.960
OK. Please teach me.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.320
First, place your hands in front of you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.640
and on top of each other.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.760
Hands in front and on top of each other.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.060
Then, you do a 45-degree angle bow

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.380
and lower your head.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.240
OK. I will try my best to follow you.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.500
Like this?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.300
Yes, that's right!

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.080
You did a great job!

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.720
Ojigi is so fun!

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.140
Place your hands on top of each other.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.760
Ojigi!

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.220
What a graceful slant!

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.940
Let's try other stuff!

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.160
Where shall we go?

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.660
There!

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.320
Good afternoon!

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.540
He's doing his greetings.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.480
He can't stop doing it!

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.980
Good afternoon.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.280
Good afternoon.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
Hey, what shop is this?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This is a ningyoyaki (Japanese baked doll cakes) shop.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.580
Ningyo-yaki? (Baked dolls?)

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.060
Yes, ningyoyaki.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.420
Are you baking dolls?

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.800
Excuse me, are you really baking dolls?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.980
That's right. I am baking the real stuff.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.020
The dolls are shouting, " Hot! Hot!".

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.280
Yah, poor dolls.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.880
They are not real dolls.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.300
Thank goodness.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.380
Look here.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.540
These are the faces of the Seven Gods of Fortune.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.640
I am baking these faces.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.360
There's red bean paste inside.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.860
There's red bean paste inside?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.500
It's a snack?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.960
That's right. It's a snack.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.920
I was so worried just now.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.645
Elmo, do you eat baked snacks like this?

00:03:23.645 --> 00:03:24.700
Is it OK if I have some?

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.200
Of course.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.560
I will love to have some!

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.160
It's ready!

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.720
Here you are.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.980
Thank you!

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.200
Let's eat the ningyoyaki!

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.420
It's yummy!

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.060
Thank you for today!

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.080
It's nothing.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.080
Ojiki!

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.100
What a good child you are, Elmo!

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.100
You do your greetings well!

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.480
See you!

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.480
See you!

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.880
Ojigi is fun!

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.140
Ojigi!

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.340
Ojigi!

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.940
Good afternoon!

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.660
Good afternoon!

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.220
Elmo loves ojigi!
