00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.559 
in spite of all the snow on the ground
it's<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.870> spring<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:04.589> guess<00:00:04.799> it's<00:00:05.370> damn<00:00:06.330> near

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
it's a spring I guess it's damn near

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.080 
it's a spring I guess it's damn near
April<00:00:06.990> already<00:00:07.160> well<00:00:08.160> out<00:00:08.250> that'll<00:00:08.550> melt<00:00:08.730> and

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
there somewhere on the tripod gonna be

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.839 
there somewhere on the tripod gonna be
kind<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.689> tricky<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:24.990> aim<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.859> but<00:00:26.070> put<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.760> up

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
kind of tricky to aim it but put it up

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.820 
kind of tricky to aim it but put it up
there<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.150> aim<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.050> towards<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> car<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.800> if

I<00:00:28.920> can't<00:00:29.099> get<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> shot<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.640> way<00:00:31.130> then<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.219> think

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
I can't get a shot that way then I think

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.280 
I can't get a shot that way then I think
once<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.360> actually<00:00:33.719> gets<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.020> warm

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
once it actually gets a little warm

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.500 
once it actually gets a little warm
around<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.670> put<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.030> stand<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
around here put that on the stand and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.490 
around here put that on the stand and
clean<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> mess

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
yeah all right I got the battery in it's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.779 
yeah all right I got the battery in it's
kind<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:43.010> facing<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> wrong<00:00:44.219> way<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:44.489> it'll

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
kind of facing the wrong way but it'll

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.229 
kind of facing the wrong way but it'll
work<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.270> got<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> choke<00:00:46.020> set<00:00:47.000> I'm<00:00:48.000> probably

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
running long I think I might have a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.700 
running long I think I might have a
little<00:00:51.570> bit<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> fuel<00:00:52.079> leak<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.379> there<00:00:52.530> I'm

hear<00:03:12.650> it

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.589 

that<00:03:15.490> air<00:03:16.120> sucking<00:03:16.510> so

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
that air sucking so

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.869 
that air sucking so
I<00:03:18.629> gotta<00:03:19.290> fix<00:03:19.469> that<00:03:19.560> booster<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.340> would<00:03:20.579> replace

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.760 

well<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.910> get

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.130 

well<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.490> figure<00:03:32.730> that's<00:03:32.910> probably<00:03:33.630> enough<00:03:33.930> for

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
well I figure that's probably enough for

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.660 
well I figure that's probably enough for
today<00:03:34.350> I'll<00:03:34.710> let<00:03:34.860> it<00:03:34.890> these<00:03:35.160> two<00:03:35.310> videos

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
today I'll let it these two videos

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.700 
today I'll let it these two videos
together<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.210> see<00:03:37.020> what<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.200> get<00:03:37.260> out<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.590> it

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
together and see what I get out of it

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.350 
together and see what I get out of it
hopefully<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.400> battery<00:03:38.700> didn't<00:03:38.970> die<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.240> the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
hopefully the battery didn't die on the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.330 
hopefully the battery didn't die on the
other<00:03:39.510> one

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:05:14.129

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789

well the mice didn't get inside the car
but<00:05:17.090> they<00:05:17.930> definitely<00:05:18.080> got<00:05:18.440> inside<00:05:18.800> the

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
but they definitely got inside the

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.760 
but they definitely got inside the
exhaust<00:05:19.569> and<00:05:20.569> they<00:05:20.780> took<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.050> bunch<00:05:21.289> of<00:05:21.500> corn

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
exhaust and they took a bunch of corn

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.580 
exhaust and they took a bunch of corn
with<00:05:22.069> him<00:05:22.840> when<00:05:23.840> tried<00:05:24.050> this<00:05:24.199> round<00:05:24.440> it's

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
with him when tried this round it's

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.960 
with him when tried this round it's
gonna<00:05:24.650> smell<00:05:24.830> like<00:05:25.009> burnt<00:05:25.280> corn<00:05:25.580> for<00:05:25.880> the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
gonna smell like burnt corn for the

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.260 
gonna smell like burnt corn for the
first<00:05:26.210> few<00:05:26.389> miles<00:05:26.660> I<00:05:26.870> guess<00:05:26.930> oh<00:05:27.759> well<00:05:28.759> they<00:05:29.120> did

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
first few miles I guess oh well they did

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.670 
first few miles I guess oh well they did
the<00:05:29.389> same<00:05:29.539> thing<00:05:29.750> with<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:29.960> Bobcat<00:05:30.410> and<00:05:30.590> it

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
the same thing with the Bobcat and it

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.340 
the same thing with the Bobcat and it
still<00:05:30.919> works<00:05:31.099> fine
