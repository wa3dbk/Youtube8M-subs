the time we had recently bought a house

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.480 
the time we had recently bought a house
at<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.810> lowest<00:00:47.500> possible<00:00:47.800> rate<00:00:48.250> that<00:00:48.430> we

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
at the lowest possible rate that we

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.770 
at the lowest possible rate that we
could<00:00:48.640> have<00:00:48.730> you<00:00:48.970> know<00:00:49.000> purchased<00:00:49.480> at<00:00:49.630> that

could have you know purchased at that

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.350 
could have you know purchased at that
time<00:00:50.050> in<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:50.860> finance<00:00:51.190> rate<00:00:51.430> and<00:00:51.640> so<00:00:52.120> we<00:00:52.240> had

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
time in the finance rate and so we had

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.729 
time in the finance rate and so we had
we<00:00:52.570> were<00:00:52.780> being<00:00:52.989> really<00:00:53.140> smart<00:00:53.440> with<00:00:53.560> our

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
we were being really smart with our

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.800 
we were being really smart with our
money<00:00:53.920> but<00:00:54.160> as<00:00:54.310> the<00:00:54.550> gas<00:00:54.730> prices<00:00:55.270> ended<00:00:55.690> up

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
money but as the gas prices ended up

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.750 
money but as the gas prices ended up
doubling<00:00:56.350> over<00:00:56.560> that<00:00:57.160> few<00:00:57.370> months<00:00:57.610> that

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
doubling over that few months that

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.460 
doubling over that few months that
summer<00:00:58.030> we<00:00:58.360> really<00:00:58.780> were<00:00:58.900> feeling<00:00:59.200> the<00:00:59.290> pinch

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
summer we really were feeling the pinch

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.440 
summer we really were feeling the pinch
in<00:01:00.070> our<00:01:00.250> budget<00:01:00.579> and<00:01:00.700> we<00:01:00.910> didn't<00:01:01.270> want<00:01:01.420> to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
in our budget and we didn't want to

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.240 
in our budget and we didn't want to
start<00:01:01.690> running<00:01:01.780> into<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.170> red<00:01:02.350> every<00:01:03.040> month

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
start running into the red every month

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.399 
start running into the red every month
so<00:01:03.820> we<00:01:03.910> had<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.210> get<00:01:04.329> creative<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:05.049> one<00:01:05.199> of<00:01:05.320> the

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
so we had to get creative and one of the

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.140 
so we had to get creative and one of the
things<00:01:05.620> that<00:01:05.800> I<00:01:05.979> decided<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.640> do<00:01:06.760> since<00:01:06.970> I<00:01:07.120> was

not working at the time

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.620
