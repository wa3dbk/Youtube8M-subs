here<00:00:21.930> as<00:00:22.140> gospel<00:00:22.500> it's<00:00:23.400> not<00:00:23.609> necessarily<00:00:24.420> true

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
here as gospel it's not necessarily true

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.929 
here as gospel it's not necessarily true
it's<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.350> theory<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.949> let's<00:00:26.580> dive<00:00:26.880> right

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
it's just a theory so let's dive right

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.870 
it's just a theory so let's dive right
in<00:00:27.740> what<00:00:28.740> are<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.890> chances<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.400> Agent

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
in what are the chances that Agent

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.930 
in what are the chances that Agent
Coulson<00:00:30.060> could<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:30.869> an<00:00:31.170> inhuman<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:32.189> temper

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
Coulson could be an inhuman now temper

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.299 
Coulson could be an inhuman now temper
that<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.420> don't<00:00:33.960> mean<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.170> an<00:00:34.469> actual<00:00:34.770> inhuman

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
that I don't mean like an actual inhuman

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.209 
that I don't mean like an actual inhuman
like<00:00:35.520> black<00:00:35.730> balls<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.840> potentially<00:00:37.559> could

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
like black balls but potentially could

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.360 
like black balls but potentially could
fury<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.969> moved<00:00:39.480> heaven<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> earth<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.370> you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
fury have moved heaven and earth to you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.160 
fury have moved heaven and earth to you
know<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.489> guess<00:00:41.760> exposed<00:00:42.210> him<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.750> tarigan

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170

know I guess exposed him to the tarigan
mists<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.010> could<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.370> possibly

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
mists and that could have possibly

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.549 
mists and that could have possibly
brought<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> back<00:00:45.329> somehow<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.960> know<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.410> sounds

sort<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.600> storm<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> internet<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
sort of a storm on the internet and

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.810 
sort of a storm on the internet and
everybody's<00:01:14.100> believing<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.549> he's<00:01:14.700> an

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.460 
everybody's believing that he's an
inhuman<00:01:15.180> i<00:01:15.420> personally<00:01:15.960> think<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.409> would

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
inhuman i personally think that it would

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.020 
inhuman i personally think that it would
be<00:01:16.619> an<00:01:16.710> interesting<00:01:16.860> way<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.700> know<00:01:17.820> I

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
be an interesting way to you know I

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.910 
be an interesting way to you know I
guess<00:01:18.630> introduced<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> Inhumans<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
guess introduced the Inhumans and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.460 
guess introduced the Inhumans and
introduced<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.460> tarragon<00:01:20.850> missed<00:01:21.470> because

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
introduced the tarragon missed because

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.870 
introduced the tarragon missed because
I'm<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:22.979> Black<00:01:23.250> Bolt<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.610> seeing

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
I'm all for Black Bolt and seeing

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.920 
I'm all for Black Bolt and seeing
everything<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.479> course<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.810> been

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
everything and of course it's been

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.480 
everything and of course it's been
widely<00:01:25.080> reported<00:01:25.290> before<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.310> humans

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
widely reported before that in humans

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.300 
widely reported before that in humans
would<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> guess<00:01:27.060> replace<00:01:27.420> mutants<00:01:28.310> because

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
would I guess replace mutants because

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.190 
would I guess replace mutants because
x-men<00:01:29.790> owns<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> word<00:01:30.360> mutants<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.900> Marvel

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
x-men owns the word mutants and Marvel

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.830 
x-men owns the word mutants and Marvel
can't<00:01:31.409> use<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.850> humans<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.390> guess<00:01:33.659> we're

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
can't use it so in humans I guess we're

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.240 
can't use it so in humans I guess we're
placing<00:01:33.990> mutants<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.560> that's<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
placing mutants and that's you know the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.530 
placing mutants and that's you know the
rumor<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.520> Quicksilver<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.060> Scarlet<00:01:36.180> Witch

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
rumor that Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.760 
rumor that Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch
are<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.079> humans<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.590> not

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
are going to be in humans and not

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.069 
are going to be in humans and not
mutants<00:01:38.579> how<00:01:38.850> many<00:01:39.030> times<00:01:39.240> take<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> shot<00:01:39.810> every

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
mutants how many times take a shot every

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.289 
mutants how many times take a shot every
time<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.259> say<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.650> humans<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.100> mutants<00:01:41.400> but

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
time I say in humans and mutants but

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.530 
time I say in humans and mutants but
anyways<00:01:42.930> i'm<00:01:43.740> personally<00:01:44.369> again<00:01:44.820> I'm<00:01:45.119> for

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
anyways i'm personally again I'm for

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.480 
anyways i'm personally again I'm for
this<00:01:45.689> theory<00:01:46.049> only<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.189> think<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
this theory only because I think it's a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.889 
this theory only because I think it's a
great<00:01:47.610> way<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.850> introduce<00:01:48.090> those<00:01:48.390> characters

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
great way to introduce those characters

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.600 
great way to introduce those characters
I<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.439> want<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.619> see<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.890> know<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.100> humans

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
I really want to see you know in humans
