unlucky for veteran

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.390 
unlucky for veteran
because<00:05:30.780> his<00:05:30.930> first-round<00:05:31.410> matchup<00:05:32.039> was

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
so yes the bracket system was brutal but

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.180 
so yes the bracket system was brutal but
consider<00:05:41.110> this
