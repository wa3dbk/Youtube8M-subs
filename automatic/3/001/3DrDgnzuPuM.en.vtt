00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
inside of your pencil case you can just

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.700 
inside of your pencil case you can just
watch<00:05:16.550> what<00:05:16.970> I'm<00:05:17.150> doing<00:05:17.420> here<00:05:17.780> I'm<00:05:17.960> cutting<00:05:18.530> an

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
watch what I'm doing here I'm cutting an

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.080 
watch what I'm doing here I'm cutting an
emoji<00:05:18.950> to<00:05:19.160> make<00:05:19.310> sure<00:05:19.430> it's<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.730> right<00:05:19.880> size

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
emoji to make sure it's the right size

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.150 
emoji to make sure it's the right size
and<00:05:20.150> then<00:05:20.480> I'm<00:05:20.660> sticking<00:05:21.170> it<00:05:21.230> down<00:05:21.500> so<00:05:21.890> it

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
and then I'm sticking it down so it

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.520 
and then I'm sticking it down so it
won't<00:05:22.310> show<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.790> full<00:05:23.060> emoji<00:05:23.630> but<00:05:24.080> it's<00:05:24.230> still

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
won't show the full emoji but it's still

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.280 
won't show the full emoji but it's still
taking<00:05:25.070> up<00:05:25.220> that<00:05:25.790> blank<00:05:26.600> space<00:05:27.140> there<00:05:27.170> and

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
taking up that blank space there and

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.830 
taking up that blank space there and
this<00:05:30.290> step<00:05:30.890> is<00:05:31.130> completely<00:05:31.670> optional<00:05:31.820> but<00:05:32.450> I

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
this step is completely optional but I

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.500 
this step is completely optional but I
wanted<00:05:33.290> to<00:05:33.440> steal<00:05:33.680> all<00:05:33.980> of<00:05:34.010> my<00:05:34.400> emojis<00:05:34.670> down<00:05:35.120> so
