00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.640
 I will actually make you the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.210
 demonstration of how to pass the wire 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.520
 of silk thing that I find essential or 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.970
 a question of prevention and a good 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.939
 hygiene 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.580
 regarding the type of wire to 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.559
 use it's not important that he 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.670
 must they be waxed or not and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.680
 that that depends on the technique of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.870
 passage of silk threads 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.519
 it will actually take the year son is 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.589
 very important to take a long thread 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.730
 for what reason because take a 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.890
 grandson 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.350
 it will prevent us from having a portion 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.210
 who is clean all the time when we are 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.070
 moves from one tooth to another so that's 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 very important to take my son so 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.790
 to be able to move easily while 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.830
 in the long run and have a portion that is 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.239
 clean every time we come out of a 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.479
 region and we go into another 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.049
 eye ok so let's go watch on the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.340
 model what is it then the thing 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.350
 keep the wire close so never have 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.509
 fingers far apart from each other 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.610
 because the control is not so 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.430
 very important when we pass enough to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.620
 to have your fingers close we go 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.230
 start by exercising a proof a 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.440
 pressure which surrounds the first 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:35.070
 tooth and we block the loin and we go the 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.220
 rape not to traumatize the gum 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.400
 by doing this movement once the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.400
 first I finished little that can 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.440
 happen that the film so we'll go in 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.080
 turns and the other in convoy exercise a 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.900
 pressure on each other in and let's do 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.960
 the same grating movement so we do not 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.990
 if we ever go shredded and so we go 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.360
 go surrounded the tooth we go to Lille to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.540
 rapper and we'll go surrounded the tooth of 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.790
 that side and we'll go shredded so 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.399
 we 're never going to blink 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.310
 that's not good but we're going to rap and 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.760
 to apply it and when we go out I take 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.250
 a new portion and I move I 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.280
 come in and even close fingers 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.999
 jeans turn the tooth I clean myself and 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.590
 I start to grated after that I do 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.719
 a pressure on the second time I 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.299
 want to clean and I always had it in 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:33.029
 being careful not to go 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.129
 so hurt the gum neither on one side 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.939
 neither of the other so here now we're going 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.010
 hires to do the 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:41.279
 demonstration 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:44.510
 again the fingers close and 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:47.810
 not far to have better control 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.810
 and we go 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.100
 and we're going to do the same thing or go 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.710
 make a pressure on the other one and 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.710
 we're going to lie down and go out 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.770
 I moved and I come back from 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.360
 new 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.400
 so I have a portion that is new 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.460
 so we will surround the tooth and we will 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.920
 to go along we do not make movements that 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.200
 can hurt who can leave the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.130
 gum and we will go in turns and 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.560
 the other in and we will do the same 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.730
 movement again never 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.590
 hurt because we really want 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.930
 easily traumatized the gum with the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.710
 time there we can cut is downright 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.070
 so well surrounded so much from the outside 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.070
 only from the inside 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:53.160
 and when we go out so when we go out I 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.819
 take a new portion and I 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.590
 therefore moves I go again 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.620
 I'm going to surround the tooth I want 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.140
 clean and look at my fingers are not 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.390
 not very far they are very close and 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.250
 I never do a movement like that 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.049
 who will traumatize the gums with 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.860
 the time once I'm done 7 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.919
 in the gent turn each other in and I 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.690
 even the grating movement ever from 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.220
 sawing so once again knows it the 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.049
 sawing movement shame we come back 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.610
 no and we go out like that it is not used to 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.690
 nothing to really clean them 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.040
 each of the teeth and that's so it was 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.040
 his phase is the son of his
