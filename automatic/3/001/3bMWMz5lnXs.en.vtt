what<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.890> future<00:00:08.069> requirements<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
what is the future requirements the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.169 
what is the future requirements the
dreams<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.990> yourself<00:00:10.790> well<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.820> think<00:00:11.940> that

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
dreams of yourself well I think that

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.150 
dreams of yourself well I think that
what<00:00:12.690> we're<00:00:12.840> always<00:00:13.049> up<00:00:13.349> against<00:00:13.679> with<00:00:13.799> 3ds

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
what we're always up against with 3ds

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.189 
what we're always up against with 3ds
there's<00:00:14.460> two<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.639> everything<00:00:15.020> there's<00:00:16.020> two

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
there's two of everything there's two

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.109 
there's two of everything there's two
lenses<00:00:16.680> there's<00:00:17.070> two<00:00:17.279> sets<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.670> servos<00:00:18.090> for

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
lenses there's two sets of servos for

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.660 
lenses there's two sets of servos for
the<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:18.960> for<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.350> lenses<00:00:19.770> there's<00:00:20.039> two

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
the for the for the lenses there's two

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.759 
the for the for the lenses there's two
cameras<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:21.660> we're<00:00:22.350> always<00:00:22.500> trying

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
cameras and so on so we're always trying

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.300 
cameras and so on so we're always trying
to<00:00:22.920> make<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.250> smaller<00:00:23.519> lighter<00:00:24.710> smarter<00:00:25.710> so

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
to make it smaller lighter smarter so

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.040 
to make it smaller lighter smarter so
that<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.580> does<00:00:26.760> more<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> 3d<00:00:27.570> functions

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
that it does more of the 3d functions

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.019 
that it does more of the 3d functions
for<00:00:28.320> us<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.619> think<00:00:28.859> now<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.699> know<00:00:29.730> that

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
for us and I think now that we know that

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.820 
for us and I think now that we know that
we've<00:00:30.119> got<00:00:30.300> such<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> good<00:00:30.750> collaborative<00:00:31.470> base

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
we've got such a good collaborative base

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.910 
we've got such a good collaborative base
I'm<00:00:32.189> sure<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.300> continue<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:34.500> him<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
I'm sure that we can continue to him to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.430 
I'm sure that we can continue to him to
him<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.700> improve<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.989> camera<00:00:37.320> itself

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
him to improve it that the camera itself

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.830 
him to improve it that the camera itself
I<00:00:37.829> don't<00:00:38.040> feel<00:00:38.309> needs<00:00:38.579> much<00:00:38.760> improvement<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
I don't feel needs much improvement the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.410 
I don't feel needs much improvement the
actual<00:00:40.140> core<00:00:40.860> camera<00:00:41.579> technology<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.329> had

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
actual core camera technology they had

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.819 
actual core camera technology they had
the<00:00:42.510> images<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.170> created<00:00:43.530> by<00:00:43.620> these<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
the images that are created by these I

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.830 
the images that are created by these I
think<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.879> many<00:00:44.969> people<00:00:45.090> are<00:00:45.570> are

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
think that so many people are are

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.799 
think that so many people are are
welcoming<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.980> fact<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.370> they<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:47.809> finally

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
welcoming the fact that they now finally

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.420 
welcoming the fact that they now finally
can<00:00:48.989> drive<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> stake<00:00:49.800> through<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.070> heart<00:00:50.309> of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
can drive a stake through the heart of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.840 
can drive a stake through the heart of
film<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:51.449> they<00:00:51.660> choose<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.350> mean<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.399> we

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
film if they choose to I mean and and we

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.520 
film if they choose to I mean and and we
we<00:00:54.239> don't<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.539> much<00:00:54.660> choice<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.260> 3d

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
we don't have much choice in the 3d

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.590 
we don't have much choice in the 3d
business<00:00:55.739> film<00:00:56.100> film<00:00:56.610> solutions<00:00:57.180> don't<00:00:57.420> work

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
business film film solutions don't work

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.970 
business film film solutions don't work

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
to be a big breakthrough for us in 3d is
to<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:36.900> those<00:01:37.049> other<00:01:37.320> sort<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.040> film

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
to get all those other sort of film

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.609 
to get all those other sort of film
based<00:01:38.850> practitioner<00:01:39.630> practitioners<00:01:40.470> across

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
based practitioner practitioners across

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.469 
based practitioner practitioners across
the<00:01:41.250> double<00:01:41.549> divided<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.090> that's<00:01:42.329> been

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the double divided because that's been

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.450 
the double divided because that's been
our<00:01:42.570> problem<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.350> been<00:01:43.560> two<00:01:43.740> jumps<00:01:44.070> not<00:01:44.250> one

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
our problem it's been two jumps not one

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.480 
our problem it's been two jumps not one
to<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.240> from<00:01:45.509> being<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.840> film<00:01:46.170> based

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
to go from being a film based

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.530 
to go from being a film based
world-class<00:01:47.490> dp2<00:01:48.950> doing<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.100> 3d<00:01:50.490> movie<00:01:50.729> has

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
world-class dp2 doing a 3d movie has

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.810 
world-class dp2 doing a 3d movie has
required<00:01:52.020> two<00:01:52.290> jumps<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.310> got<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> go<00:01:53.640> digital

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
required two jumps you got to go digital

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.330 
required two jumps you got to go digital
and<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.720> got<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.960> learn<00:01:55.049> 3d<00:01:55.500> at<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.860> at<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and you got to learn 3d at the at the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
and you got to learn 3d at the at the
same<00:01:56.579> time<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.090> been<00:01:57.270> tough<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.990> get

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
same time and it's been tough to get

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.050 
same time and it's been tough to get
people<00:01:58.439> across<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.979> across<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.700> double

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
people across that across that double

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.639 
people across that across that double
jump<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.719> camera<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.170> going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.380> help<00:02:01.530> an

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
jump this camera is going to help an

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.380 
jump this camera is going to help an
awful<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:02.009> with<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.369> yeah<00:02:02.729> although<00:02:03.240> we

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
awful lot with that yeah although we

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.730 
awful lot with that yeah although we
thought<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.689> was<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.049> tough<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.409> Hugo

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
thought it was going to be tough on Hugo

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.950 
thought it was going to be tough on Hugo
it<00:02:04.950> actually<00:02:05.549> was<00:02:05.700> fairly<00:02:05.939> easy<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.840> know

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
it actually was fairly easy you know

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.510 
it actually was fairly easy you know
because<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.380> easy<00:02:07.530> once<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:07.979> did<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:08.369> it's

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
because it's easy once they did but it's

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.900 
because it's easy once they did but it's
psychological

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
psychological

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.000 
psychological
I<00:02:09.940> mean<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.420> camera<00:02:10.720> did<00:02:10.930> allow<00:02:11.260> us<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.890> know

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
I mean the camera did allow us you know

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.740 
I mean the camera did allow us you know
we<00:02:12.190> weren't<00:02:12.400> we<00:02:12.880> weren't<00:02:13.120> challenged<00:02:13.570> by<00:02:13.690> the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
we weren't we weren't challenged by the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.560 
we weren't we weren't challenged by the
camera<00:02:14.230> at<00:02:14.380> all<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:15.250> know<00:02:15.370> he<00:02:15.610> was<00:02:16.000> exploring

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
camera at all you know he was exploring

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.050 
camera at all you know he was exploring
the<00:02:17.290> same<00:02:17.770> direction<00:02:18.130> that<00:02:18.430> he<00:02:18.520> wanted<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.910> go

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
the same direction that he wanted to go

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.480 
the same direction that he wanted to go
which<00:02:19.390> was<00:02:19.870> good<00:02:20.320> for<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.560> film<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.160> I

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
which was good for the film and I

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.860 
which was good for the film and I
thought<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.970> camera<00:02:22.270> performed<00:02:22.720> well

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
thought that the camera performed well

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.270 
thought that the camera performed well
but<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.140> think<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.500> your<00:02:23.590> point<00:02:23.650> about<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
but I think to your point about the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.970 
but I think to your point about the
future<00:02:24.580> i<00:02:24.910> think<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.840> good<00:02:26.080> good<00:02:26.680> thing

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
future i think that the good good thing

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.830 
future i think that the good good thing
on<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.280> road<00:02:27.310> map<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.090> future<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.630> we're

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
on the road map to the future is we're

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.140 
on the road map to the future is we're
working<00:02:29.230> together<00:02:29.440> we're<00:02:30.220> identifying<00:02:30.670> areas

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
working together we're identifying areas

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.670 
working together we're identifying areas
where<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:31.720> can<00:02:31.900> share<00:02:32.170> some<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.530> those

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
where you can share some of those

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.700 
where you can share some of those
responsibilities<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.180> 3d<00:02:34.720> requirement

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
responsibilities of the 3d requirement

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.480 
responsibilities of the 3d requirement
whether<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.400> be<00:02:36.580> sensor<00:02:37.270> shifting<00:02:37.810> or<00:02:38.050> or

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
whether it be sensor shifting or or

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.530 
whether it be sensor shifting or or
applications<00:02:39.490> where<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.820> motor<00:02:40.060> drive<00:02:40.330> might

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
applications where the motor drive might

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.420 
applications where the motor drive might
come<00:02:40.750> from<00:02:40.780> them<00:02:41.080> at<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.470> camera<00:02:41.830> itself<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
come from them at the camera itself the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.340 
come from them at the camera itself the
camera<00:02:42.760> body<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.540> know<00:02:43.600> we're<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:43.810> looking

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
camera body you know we're just looking

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.290 
camera body you know we're just looking
for<00:02:44.380> all<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.800> those<00:02:44.890> areas<00:02:45.160> where<00:02:45.550> we<00:02:45.670> can<00:02:45.700> we

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
for all of those areas where we can we

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.630 
for all of those areas where we can we
can<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.720> know<00:02:46.930> share<00:02:47.380> responsibilities<00:02:48.340> in

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
can you know share responsibilities in

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.520 
can you know share responsibilities in
the<00:02:48.700> same<00:02:49.060> goal<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.840> think<00:02:50.080> whether<00:02:50.260> it's

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
the same goal and I think whether it's

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.770 
the same goal and I think whether it's
engineering<00:02:51.040> resources<00:02:51.520> what<00:02:52.330> we've<00:02:52.510> learned

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
engineering resources what we've learned

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.930 
engineering resources what we've learned
from<00:02:52.870> 3d<00:02:53.470> what<00:02:53.980> you've<00:02:54.130> learned<00:02:54.400> from<00:02:54.520> being<00:02:54.760> a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
from 3d what you've learned from being a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.000 
from 3d what you've learned from being a
powerful<00:02:55.570> camera<00:02:55.840> manufacturer<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.710> think

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
powerful camera manufacturer I think

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.100 
powerful camera manufacturer I think
that<00:02:57.130> really<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:58.240> exciting<00:02:58.540> part<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:59.050> the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
that really is the exciting part of the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.500 
that really is the exciting part of the
future<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.400> think<00:03:00.610> this<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:01.270> is<00:03:01.420> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
future and I think this is this is the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.890 
future and I think this is this is the
beginning<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:02.020> that<00:03:02.560> future<00:03:03.840> could<00:03:04.840> you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
beginning of that future could you

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.130 
beginning of that future could you
comment<00:03:05.290> on<00:03:05.620> lenses<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.610> their<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.600> be<00:03:07.750> stands

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
comment on lenses of their to be stands

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.250 
comment on lenses of their to be stands
with<00:03:08.260> lenses<00:03:08.800> on<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.310> 3d<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.150> what<00:03:10.480> would<00:03:11.230> you

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
with lenses on the 3d and what would you

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.760 
with lenses on the 3d and what would you
like<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.920> see<00:03:12.130> there<00:03:13.140> well<00:03:14.140> i<00:03:14.170> think<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.740> know

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
like to see there well i think you know

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.699 
like to see there well i think you know
obviously<00:03:15.459> you're<00:03:16.000> introducing<00:03:16.600> a<00:03:16.870> new<00:03:16.959> lens

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
obviously you're introducing a new lens

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.650 
obviously you're introducing a new lens
complement<00:03:18.520> here<00:03:18.910> which<00:03:19.150> I'm<00:03:19.300> very<00:03:19.330> excited

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
complement here which I'm very excited

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.110 
complement here which I'm very excited
about<00:03:20.350> because<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:21.640> know<00:03:21.730> it's<00:03:21.880> it's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
about because you know it's it's

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.460 
about because you know it's it's
starting<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.570> head<00:03:22.660> in<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.900> direction<00:03:22.959> that

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
starting to head in the direction that

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.270 
starting to head in the direction that
we<00:03:23.980> we<00:03:24.459> need<00:03:24.670> more<00:03:24.850> range<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.720> less<00:03:26.230> sighs<00:03:26.530> you

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
we we need more range and less sighs you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.949 
we we need more range and less sighs you
know<00:03:27.459> I<00:03:27.670> mean<00:03:28.060> that's<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.420> bottom<00:03:28.720> line<00:03:28.750> for

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
know I mean that's the bottom line for

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.010 
know I mean that's the bottom line for
us<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.920> sightless<00:03:30.730> eyes<00:03:30.970> translates<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.900> less

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
us and sightless eyes translates to less

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.720 
us and sightless eyes translates to less
weight<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.950> is<00:03:33.130> this<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:33.490> a<00:03:33.520> fantastic

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
weight and this is this is a fantastic

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.320 
weight and this is this is a fantastic
you<00:03:34.540> know<00:03:34.660> direction<00:03:35.080> for<00:03:35.620> us<00:03:35.770> because<00:03:36.330> we

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
you know direction for us because we

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.690 
you know direction for us because we
need<00:03:38.050> to<00:03:38.260> raise<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.739> bar<00:03:38.950> on<00:03:38.980> what<00:03:39.400> we<00:03:39.520> can

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
need to raise the bar on what we can

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.310 
need to raise the bar on what we can
accomplish<00:03:39.970> with<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.540> larger<00:03:40.930> sensor

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
accomplish with the larger sensor

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.110 
accomplish with the larger sensor
cameras<00:03:41.770> you<00:03:42.130> know<00:03:42.160> we<00:03:42.370> come<00:03:42.520> from<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:42.850> strong

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
cameras you know we come from a strong

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.449 
cameras you know we come from a strong
two-thirds<00:03:43.660> inch<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.650> know<00:03:44.739> accomplishment

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
two-thirds inch you know accomplishment

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.370 
two-thirds inch you know accomplishment
where<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:46.209> know<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.420> lenses<00:03:46.810> usually<00:03:47.200> have

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
where you know the lenses usually have

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.130 
where you know the lenses usually have
less<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.920> weight<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.340> twice<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:48.910> range<00:03:49.660> and

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
less the weight and twice the range and

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.960 
less the weight and twice the range and
I<00:03:50.410> think<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.890> know<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.190> engineers<00:03:51.640> really

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
I think you know the engineers really

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.670 
I think you know the engineers really
got<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.180> put<00:03:52.330> their<00:03:52.510> heads<00:03:52.690> down<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.200> come<00:03:53.650> up

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
got to put their heads down and come up

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.350 
got to put their heads down and come up
with<00:03:53.890> solutions<00:03:54.100> in<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.700> one<00:03:54.880> inch<00:03:55.090> sensor

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
with solutions in the one inch sensor

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.320 
with solutions in the one inch sensor
market<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.920> you<00:03:57.580> know<00:03:57.700> solve<00:03:58.090> those<00:03:58.270> issues

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
market to you know solve those issues

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.360 
market to you know solve those issues
it's<00:03:58.870> all<00:03:59.020> about<00:03:59.260> size<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.890> weight<00:04:00.070> for<00:04:00.340> us

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
it's all about size and weight for us

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.180 
it's all about size and weight for us
and<00:04:00.670> no<00:04:01.150> compromise<00:04:01.750> on<00:04:01.989> performance<00:04:02.620> which<00:04:03.040> I

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
and no compromise on performance which I

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.490 
and no compromise on performance which I
know<00:04:03.250> is<00:04:03.520> not<00:04:03.640> easy<00:04:03.970> for<00:04:04.120> for<00:04:04.810> your<00:04:04.930> engineers

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
know is not easy for for your engineers

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.979 
know is not easy for for your engineers
but<00:04:05.770> you<00:04:06.220> know<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.489> we<00:04:07.209> gotta<00:04:07.420> sharpen<00:04:07.720> the

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
but you know it we gotta sharpen the

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.600 
but you know it we gotta sharpen the
pencil<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.560> we<00:04:08.680> always<00:04:08.950> got<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.280> hit<00:04:09.430> that

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
pencil and we always got to hit that

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.280 
pencil and we always got to hit that
goal<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:10.030> say<00:04:10.180> can<00:04:10.630> we<00:04:10.750> take<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.110> weight<00:04:11.260> out

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
goal to say can we take the weight out

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.140 
goal to say can we take the weight out
somewhere<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.160> not<00:04:12.280> compromise<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.880> quality

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
somewhere and not compromise the quality

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.870 
somewhere and not compromise the quality
so<00:04:13.630> I'm<00:04:13.720> very<00:04:13.750> excited<00:04:13.989> about<00:04:14.440> that<00:04:14.730> you<00:04:15.730> guys

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
a great lens introduction that allow us

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.920 
a great lens introduction that allow us
to<00:04:43.310> get<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.730> get<00:04:43.940> some<00:04:44.180> of<00:04:44.300> those<00:04:44.389> shots<00:04:44.630> that

you<00:04:45.080> see<00:04:45.460> where<00:04:46.460> we<00:04:46.639> couldn't<00:04:46.970> get<00:04:47.180> up<00:04:47.330> close

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
you see where we couldn't get up close

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.020 
you see where we couldn't get up close
and<00:04:47.630> personal<00:04:47.870> but<00:04:48.800> we<00:04:48.919> we<00:04:49.250> could<00:04:49.460> still<00:04:49.730> get

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
and personal but we we could still get

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.730 
and personal but we we could still get
that<00:04:50.090> that<00:04:50.600> essence<00:04:51.110> of<00:04:51.260> what<00:04:51.440> Cirque
