presume that you know a lot of the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.470 
presume that you know a lot of the
basics<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.300> I'll<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.720> jump<00:00:31.140> right<00:00:31.470> into<00:00:31.800> it

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
basics so I'll just jump right into it

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.270 
basics so I'll just jump right into it
first<00:00:33.480> thing<00:00:33.690> we'll<00:00:33.870> need<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.860> add<00:00:35.250> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
first thing we'll need to do is add a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
first thing we'll need to do is add a
movie<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.770> want<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.890> play<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.899> movie<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.079> the

World Trade Center collapsing ad that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
World Trade Center collapsing ad that
movie<00:00:45.230> I'm<00:00:46.230> gonna<00:00:46.530> hit<00:00:46.739> my<00:00:46.980> scroll<00:00:47.370> button<00:00:48.920> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
movie I'm gonna hit my scroll button so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.220 
movie I'm gonna hit my scroll button so
that<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:51.000> zoom<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> little<00:00:51.600> bit<00:00:54.230> right

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
that we can zoom out a little bit right

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.580 
that we can zoom out a little bit right
off<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> bat<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.550> might<00:00:56.760> notice<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.590> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
off the bat you might notice that the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.439 
off the bat you might notice that the
sound<00:00:58.859> wave<00:00:59.129> doesn't<00:00:59.489> match<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.059> number<00:01:00.329> of

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
sound wave doesn't match the number of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.479 
sound wave doesn't match the number of
frames<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> video<00:01:02.180> that<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:04.489> my

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
frames of the video that is because my

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.870 
frames of the video that is because my
frame<00:01:05.909> rate<00:01:06.260> isn't<00:01:07.260> matching<00:01:07.710> my<00:01:08.580> frame<00:01:08.850> rate

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
frame rate isn't matching my frame rate

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.780 
frame rate isn't matching my frame rate
output<00:01:09.479> isn't<00:01:09.659> matching<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:12.630> actual<00:01:13.170> movie

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
output isn't matching the actual movie

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.910 
output isn't matching the actual movie
I'm<00:01:14.790> gonna<00:01:15.060> guess<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:17.990> 29.97<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.710> was

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I'm gonna guess that it's 29.97 or was

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.020 
I'm gonna guess that it's 29.97 or was
recorded<00:01:20.549> at<00:01:20.869> 29.97<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
recorded at 29.97 and now we have a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.100 
recorded at 29.97 and now we have a
match<00:01:27.680> so<00:01:28.680> good<00:01:29.130> nothing<00:01:29.479> for<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> start<00:01:30.930> right

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
match so good nothing for a start right

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.620 
match so good nothing for a start right
there<00:01:31.259> one<00:01:31.770> little<00:01:32.070> trick<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:32.549> your<00:01:33.360> sound

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
there one little trick there your sound

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.830 
there one little trick there your sound
wave<00:01:33.900> doesn't<00:01:34.439> match<00:01:34.680> your<00:01:35.159> video<00:01:35.840> it's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
wave doesn't match your video it's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.980 
wave doesn't match your video it's
because<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.560> frame<00:01:37.979> rate<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.909> wrong<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
because your frame rate is wrong for the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.480 
because your frame rate is wrong for the
video<00:01:41.450> alright<00:01:42.770> we're<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:43.890> gonna<00:01:44.040> need<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
video alright we're not gonna need the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.960 
video alright we're not gonna need the
sound<00:01:44.759> wave<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.990> I'm<00:01:46.799> gonna<00:01:47.070> delete<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.610> now

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
sound wave so I'm gonna delete it now

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.609 
sound wave so I'm gonna delete it now
that<00:01:48.180> we're<00:01:48.360> matched<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.960> by<00:01:49.310> hitting<00:01:50.310> X<00:01:50.729> and

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
that we're matched up by hitting X and

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.490 
that we're matched up by hitting X and
left<00:01:52.619> clicking<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.170> about

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
left clicking that and this is about

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.660 
left clicking that and this is about
speed<00:01:56.159> control<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.259> we're<00:01:58.530> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.950> add<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
speed control so we're going to add a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.069

record this movie in slow motion we

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.710 
record this movie in slow motion we
would<00:02:45.320> double<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.460> length<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.090> frames

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
would double the length of the frames

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.040 
would double the length of the frames
right<00:02:48.680> now<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:51.790> 753<00:02:52.790> frames<00:02:53.150> which<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:53.600> over

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
right now it is 753 frames which is over

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.040 
right now it is 753 frames which is over
here<00:02:54.290> which<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:54.710> a<00:02:54.740> cool<00:02:55.040> thing<00:02:55.750> my<00:02:56.750> frames

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
so that whatever I open up will usually

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.290 
so that whatever I open up will usually
play<00:03:07.580> without<00:03:08.710> rewinding<00:03:09.710> after<00:03:10.100> only<00:03:10.300> 250

the slow motion a simple way to do that
is<00:03:20.510> just<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.870> double<00:03:21.230> this<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.870> an<00:03:24.230> even
