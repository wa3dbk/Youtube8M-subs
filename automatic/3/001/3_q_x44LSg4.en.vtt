00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.060 
contraction and that one really gets
that<00:04:00.480> peak<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.970> can<00:04:03.120> concentrate<00:04:03.870> them<00:04:04.170> so

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
that peak so you can concentrate them so

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.100 
that peak so you can concentrate them so
I<00:04:05.130> did<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> couple<00:04:05.580> sets<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.970> those<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.570> then<00:04:06.750> I

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
I did a couple sets of those and then I

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.680 
I did a couple sets of those and then I
burn<00:04:07.770> them<00:04:07.980> out<00:04:08.100> on<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.490> preacher<00:04:08.730> curls<00:04:09.150> with

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690

some<00:04:09.930> manual<00:04:10.230> resistance<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:11.150> for<00:04:12.150> those<00:04:12.300> I

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
some manual resistance and for those I

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.020 
some manual resistance and for those I
start<00:04:13.410> with<00:04:13.530> about<00:04:13.740> 10<00:04:14.010> reps<00:04:14.280> something<00:04:14.880> word
