here<00:00:05.040> at<00:00:05.160> Wentworth<00:00:05.430> today<00:00:05.759> we're<00:00:05.970> we're

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
here at Wentworth today we're we're

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.970 
here at Wentworth today we're we're
getting<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.390> very<00:00:06.420> early<00:00:07.080> look<00:00:07.319> at<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.589> brand<00:00:07.890> new

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
getting a very early look at a brand new

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.700 
getting a very early look at a brand new
range<00:00:08.400> from<00:00:08.760> Wilson<00:00:09.240> now<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.719> say<00:00:10.050> range<00:00:10.380> in

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
range from Wilson now I say range in

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.709 
range from Wilson now I say range in
particular<00:00:11.010> because<00:00:11.610> Wilson<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:12.570> been

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
particular because Wilson have been

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.570 
particular because Wilson have been
renowned<00:00:13.019> for<00:00:13.259> producing<00:00:13.290> excellent<00:00:14.070> one-off

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
renowned for producing excellent one-off

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.760 
renowned for producing excellent one-off
clubs<00:00:14.969> whether<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> set<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.049> iron's<00:00:16.470> or

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
clubs whether it be a set of iron's or

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.400 
clubs whether it be a set of iron's or
an<00:00:17.010> excellent<00:00:17.430> driver<00:00:18.020> but<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
an excellent driver but this is the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.200 
an excellent driver but this is the
first<00:00:19.590> time<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.369> very<00:00:20.400> long<00:00:20.730> time<00:00:20.939> that

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
first time in a very long time that

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.210 
first time in a very long time that
they've<00:00:21.510> produced<00:00:21.840> an<00:00:22.080> entire<00:00:22.439> range<00:00:22.769> under

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
they've produced an entire range under

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.200 
they've produced an entire range under
the<00:00:23.430> same<00:00:23.640> name

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the same name

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.660 
the same name
the<00:00:24.510> d100<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.830> reason<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.400> is

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the d100 the reason for this is

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.820 
the d100 the reason for this is
technology<00:00:27.480> runs<00:00:27.750> throughout<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> set<00:00:28.619> from

ions hybrids to fairways and even to
driver<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:32.099> all<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.460> right<00:00:32.969> light

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
driver it's all about right light

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.530 
driver it's all about right light
technology<00:00:34.070> this<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.219> based<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.640> Wilson<00:00:36.360> say

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
technology this is based on Wilson say

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.959 
technology this is based on Wilson say
engineers<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.440> worked<00:00:37.469> out<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.280> light

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
engineers have worked out that light

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.549 
engineers have worked out that light
weight<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.329> excellent<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:39.989> you've<00:00:40.320> seen

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
weight is excellent and you've seen

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.950 
weight is excellent and you've seen
light<00:00:40.770> weight<00:00:41.010> come<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.579> tour<00:00:41.820> now<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.360> well

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
light weight come in on tour now as well

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.720 
light weight come in on tour now as well
as<00:00:43.079> game<00:00:43.290> improvers<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> lighter<00:00:44.309> weight

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
as game improvers the lighter weight

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.430 
as game improvers the lighter weight
means<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.480> produce<00:00:45.629> faster<00:00:46.200> swing

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
means you can produce faster swing

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.830 
means you can produce faster swing
speeds<00:00:46.800> without<00:00:47.160> any<00:00:47.399> extra<00:00:47.820> effort<00:00:47.940> but

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
speeds without any extra effort but

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.380 
speeds without any extra effort but
still<00:00:49.079> produce<00:00:49.230> extra<00:00:49.860> distance<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.239> I'll

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
still produce extra distance so so I'll

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.330 
still produce extra distance so so I'll
come<00:00:51.660> ideal<00:00:52.079> combination<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.860> any<00:00:53.010> type<00:00:53.309> of

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
come ideal combination for any type of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.760 
come ideal combination for any type of
golfer<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.660> what<00:00:54.840> Wilson<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.440> done<00:00:55.590> they've

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
golfer but what Wilson have done they've

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.979 
golfer but what Wilson have done they've
taken<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.190> step<00:00:56.430> further<00:00:56.850> they<00:00:57.570> say<00:00:57.809> that

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
taken that step further they say that

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.260 
taken that step further they say that
light<00:00:58.140> weight<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.530> good<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.070> don't<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.149> go

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
light weight is good but don't just go

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.580 
light weight is good but don't just go
light<00:01:00.449> for<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.750> sake<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.440> to

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
light for the sake of it you have to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.280 
light for the sake of it you have to
save<00:01:01.829> weight<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> right<00:01:02.579> places<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
save weight in the right places in the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.350 
save weight in the right places in the
shaft<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> grip<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.369> head<00:01:05.670> which<00:01:06.150> all

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
shaft and the grip in the head which all

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.990 
shaft and the grip in the head which all
combine<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.990> give<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.290> added<00:01:07.580> consistency<00:01:08.580> as

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
combine to give you added consistency as

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.750 
combine to give you added consistency as
well<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> added<00:01:09.780> distance<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.760> probably

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
well as the added distance now probably

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.789 
well as the added distance now probably
the<00:01:12.119> best<00:01:12.330> product<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.960> entire<00:01:13.080> line<00:01:13.350> for

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the best product in the entire line for

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.999 
the best product in the entire line for
me<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> new<00:01:14.760> D<00:01:15.000> 100<00:01:15.570> hybrid<00:01:16.020> straightaway

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
me was the new D 100 hybrid straightaway

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.499 
me was the new D 100 hybrid straightaway
when<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.310> got<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.790> really<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.360> look

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
when I got this I really like the look

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.539 
when I got this I really like the look
of<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> first<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.439> all<00:01:19.530> tried<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> 22

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
of it I first of all tried out the 22

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.060 
of it I first of all tried out the 22
degree<00:01:20.759> version<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.840> head<00:01:22.049> slightly<00:01:22.500> change

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
degree version the head slightly change

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
degree version the head slightly change
as<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.640> go<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> stronger<00:01:24.540> lofts<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.470> get

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
as you go to stronger lofts that get

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.350 
as you go to stronger lofts that get
larger<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.580> me<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.909> works<00:01:27.150> brilliantly

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
larger for me this works brilliantly

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.390 
larger for me this works brilliantly
because<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> means<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.439> transition<00:01:28.979> from<00:01:29.009> long

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
because it means to transition from long

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.130 
because it means to transition from long
irons<00:01:29.759> into<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.210> more<00:01:30.390> compact<00:01:30.810> headed

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
irons into the more compact headed

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380 
irons into the more compact headed
hybrids<00:01:31.650> works<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.189> well<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.119> also

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
hybrids works really well but then also

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.929 
hybrids works really well but then also
a<00:01:33.659> smooth<00:01:34.079> transition<00:01:34.680> into<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.490> larger

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
a smooth transition into the larger

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.060 
a smooth transition into the larger
headed<00:01:36.299> lower<00:01:36.479> lofts<00:01:37.049> into<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.710> fairway

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
headed lower lofts into your fairway

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890 
headed lower lofts into your fairway
woods<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.579> throughout<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> bag<00:01:39.450> you've<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.869> a

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
woods so throughout the bag you've got a

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.569 
woods so throughout the bag you've got a
transition<00:01:40.770> which<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.100> should<00:01:41.369> feel

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
transition which you should feel

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.300 
transition which you should feel
comfortable<00:01:42.090> with<00:01:42.350> like<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.380> say<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.799> 22

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
comfortable with like I say this 22

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.819 
comfortable with like I say this 22
degree<00:01:44.880> version<00:01:45.329> was<00:01:45.540> fantastic<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.710> an

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
degree version was fantastic this is an

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.560 
degree version was fantastic this is an
all-around<00:01:47.100> performer<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.180> got<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> great

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
all-around performer it's got a great

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.450 
all-around performer it's got a great
look<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.110> quite<00:01:49.409> compact<00:01:49.860> little<00:01:49.979> head<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
look in quite compact little head that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.190 
look in quite compact little head that
produced<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.060> lot<00:01:51.180> more<00:01:51.390> forgiveness<00:01:51.720> than<00:01:52.079> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
produced a lot more forgiveness than I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.740 
produced a lot more forgiveness than I
thought<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.860> might<00:01:53.040> do<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.640> black<00:01:53.880> PVD<00:01:54.329> face

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
thought it might do the black PVD face

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.240 
thought it might do the black PVD face
combined<00:01:55.229> with<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> white<00:01:55.649> grooves<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.219> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
combined with the white grooves is a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.889 
combined with the white grooves is a
great<00:01:56.520> combination<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.600> get<00:01:57.719> this

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
great combination because you get this

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.959 
great combination because you get this
streamlined<00:01:58.530> look<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.399> there<00:01:59.549> still<00:01:59.759> seems

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
streamlined look but there still seems

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.399 
streamlined look but there still seems
like<00:02:00.180> there's<00:02:00.360> loads<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.780> loft<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.200> you're<00:02:01.320> not

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
like there's loads of loft so you're not

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.749 
like there's loads of loft so you're not
trying<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.740> force<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.250> up<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> air

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
trying to force it up in the air

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.399 
trying to force it up in the air
particularly<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.719> you're<00:02:04.110> trying<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
particularly when you you're trying to

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.080 
particularly when you you're trying to
hit<00:02:04.560> shots<00:02:04.770> out<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.070> rough<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.520> semi<00:02:05.790> rough

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
hit shots out of rough and semi rough

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.240 
hit shots out of rough and semi rough
this<00:02:06.360> I've<00:02:06.899> tried<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.560> range<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.099> on

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
this I've tried on the range and out on

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.040 
this I've tried on the range and out on
the<00:02:08.340> course<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.209> does<00:02:09.539> pop<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the course and it really does pop the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.320 
the course and it really does pop the
ball<00:02:10.229> ride<00:02:10.530> up<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:11.069> without<00:02:11.489> spinning<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.120> too

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
ball ride up but without spinning it too

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.180 
ball ride up but without spinning it too
