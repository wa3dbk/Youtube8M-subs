worse so I would tend to have pimples
that<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.910> really<00:00:48.270> envy<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.050> inflamed<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.950> they

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that I really envy and inflamed and they

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.750 
that I really envy and inflamed and they
tend<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.820> always<00:00:51.120> pop<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.840> my<00:00:52.010> temples<00:00:53.010> my

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
tend to always pop up on my temples my

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.479 
tend to always pop up on my temples my
nose<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.989> chin<00:00:55.020> area<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.219> I've<00:00:56.309> been

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
nose and my chin area so I've been

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.229 
nose and my chin area so I've been
trying<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:57.000> multiple<00:00:57.629> ways<00:00:57.980> methods

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
trying out multiple ways methods

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.910 
trying out multiple ways methods
medication<00:01:00.239> all<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.960> attempts<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.410> clear<00:01:01.829> up

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
medication all in attempts to clear up

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.250 
medication all in attempts to clear up
my<00:01:02.100> skin<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.149> think<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.600> actually<00:01:04.049> maybe

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
my skin but I think it's actually maybe

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.230 
my skin but I think it's actually maybe
even<00:01:04.650> more<00:01:04.830> drier<00:01:05.129> because<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> new

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
even more drier because of all the new

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.630 
even more drier because of all the new
stuff<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.049> introduced<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.979> my<00:01:08.130> face

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
stuff that introduced to my face

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.850 
stuff that introduced to my face
so<00:01:08.909> initially<00:01:09.750> when<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.049> first<00:01:10.080> received<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
so initially when I first received the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.500 
so initially when I first received the
color<00:01:11.070> cleanse<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:11.850> very<00:01:12.090> skeptical

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
color cleanse I was very very skeptical

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.690 
color cleanse I was very very skeptical
because<00:01:12.840> I've<00:01:13.170> already<00:01:13.350> tried<00:01:13.740> many<00:01:14.040> facial

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
because I've already tried many facial

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.190 
because I've already tried many facial
brushes<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.299> popular<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> market

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
brushes that are popular in the market

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.380 
brushes that are popular in the market
they<00:01:16.799> haven't<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.340> worked<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:18.030> me

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
they haven't really worked for me

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.390 
they haven't really worked for me
firstly<00:01:19.020> because<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.590> found<00:01:19.770> their<00:01:20.009> bristles

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
firstly because I found their bristles

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.640 
firstly because I found their bristles
although<00:01:20.759> they<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:20.970> soft<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> hand<00:01:22.080> when

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
although they are soft on the hand when

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
although they are soft on the hand when
I<00:01:22.740> try<00:01:23.070> them<00:01:23.340> at<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> shops<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:24.420> I

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
I try them at the shops but when I

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.240 
I try them at the shops but when I
actually<00:01:24.600> use<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.350> face<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.890> feels<00:01:26.130> very

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
actually use it on my face it feels very

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.120 
actually use it on my face it feels very
abrasive<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.409> soft<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:28.979> I

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
abrasive and not really as soft as I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.679 
abrasive and not really as soft as I
thought<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.579> would<00:01:29.729> be<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.210> bristles<00:01:30.600> would

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
thought it would be the bristles would

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.840 
thought it would be the bristles would
be<00:01:30.810> too<00:01:31.049> harsh<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.439> my<00:01:31.619> skin<00:01:31.650> causing<00:01:32.460> my<00:01:32.579> skin
