00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.160
 order the numbers below the lowest for 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.470
 bigger 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.360
 pause the video and try to do it yourself 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.360
 order numbers from lowest to highest 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.199
 Now let's do it together. 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.140
 none of these numbers are valuable to 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.930
 left of the comma of this evil there is 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.330
 no unit here 01 units was 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.170
 units is units was units was 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.180
 unity 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.760
 Now I'll move on to the next house. 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.830
 decimal place by the largest decimal place and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.530
 I'm going to the kids. 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.200
 I 'm going home from 10ยบ C and this number has 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.820
 10 10ยบ that too 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.450
 this one also has zero tenth 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.469
 and this one has seven tenths 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.840
 this one has the 10th seven of them will 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.180
 leave this one because I want to order 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.230
 from lowest to highest 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.550
 none of these four numbers have tenths 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.320
 Let's see the hundredth house that has 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.890
 seven hundredths 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.000
 this is seven hundredths that has seven 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.720
 hundredths 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 and this one also does not have hundredths he does not 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.770
 he has tenths or hundredths he will be 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.689
 the smaller it does not have tenths or hundredths 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.080
 this one has tenths 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.119
 there are no tenths more 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.340
 There are hundredths. Everyone has the same 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.000
 amount 7 cents 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.110
 now let's see the house of thousandths 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.060
 This one has nine thousandths that has zero 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.899
 thousandth and that also has zero thousandth 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.329
 of these three 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:52.579
 this is the largest because it had thousandths 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:58.049
 between these three are now missing the two 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:00.079
 do not have tenths and have exactly seven 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.630
 hundredths 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:06.810
 they do not have thousandths 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.239
 but this one is nine tenths of a thousandths 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.259
 while the other has no tenth 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.370
 thousandth 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.010
 This is better than the other I finished guess 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.099
 I have ordered the numbers from the lowest to the greatest 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.700
 The secret is to go to the positional value 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.819
 more significant or a value that is 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.040
 greater than in this case is the 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.110
 units 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.409
 compare for her then move on to 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.239
 the smaller houses on the right continue 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.799
 comparing the houses and will 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.799
 coordinate numbers
