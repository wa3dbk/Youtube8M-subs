00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
be doing a variety you could go like

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.570 
be doing a variety you could go like
this<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.970> know<00:04:55.090> you<00:04:55.150> can<00:04:55.419> go<00:04:55.600> like<00:04:55.780> this

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
this you know you can go like this

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.790 
this you know you can go like this
probably<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.669> standard<00:04:58.210> king<00:04:58.479> it<00:04:59.200> still<00:04:59.590> is

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
probably the standard king it still is

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.250 
probably the standard king it still is
like<00:04:59.830> this<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:01.000> pull<00:05:01.330> up<00:05:01.539> on<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.840> elbow<00:05:02.229> of

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
like this you pull up on the elbow of

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:10.740 
like this you pull up on the elbow of
the<00:05:02.380> opposite<00:05:02.950> one<00:05:08.910> like<00:05:09.910> that<00:05:10.120> see<00:05:10.450> the

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
the opposite one like that see the

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.850 
the opposite one like that see the
reason<00:05:10.870> that<00:05:11.110> this<00:05:11.320> is<00:05:11.530> probably<00:05:11.620> the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
reason that this is probably the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.340 
reason that this is probably the
standard<00:05:12.370> is<00:05:12.789> cuz<00:05:13.060> it's<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.539> angle<00:05:13.750> it<00:05:14.169> makes

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
standard is cuz it's the angle it makes

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.409 
standard is cuz it's the angle it makes
a<00:05:14.470> nice<00:05:14.620> angle<00:05:14.950> is<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.760> angle<00:05:15.789> of<00:05:16.210> your

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
a nice angle is the angle of your

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.690 
a nice angle is the angle of your
forearm<00:05:17.080> is<00:05:17.560> in<00:05:17.740> line<00:05:17.950> as<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.190> angle<00:05:18.400> your

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
forearm is in line as the angle your

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.340 
forearm is in line as the angle your
body<00:05:18.940> is<00:05:19.330> squeezed<00:05:21.180> alright<00:05:22.180> so<00:05:22.870> let's<00:05:23.020> do<00:05:23.200> it

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
body is squeezed alright so let's do it

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.600 
body is squeezed alright so let's do it
four<00:05:24.280> times<00:05:24.520> its<00:05:24.820> ladies<00:05:25.090> four<00:05:25.330> times<00:05:25.570> our

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
four times its ladies four times our

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.960 
four times its ladies four times our
