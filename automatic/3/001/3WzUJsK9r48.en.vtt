00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.030
 greetings to all youtube users 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.760
 this time this video is for 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:17.170
 show them the remodeling of the fish tank 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.950
 where I have my tents and talk to them 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:24.550
 little in this video only from the 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.990
 unicel many people do not believe about 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.990
 of the utility of unicel 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.300
 and they mount their fish tanks without this I already 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.950
 had mounted the previous fish tank with a 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.080
 one centimeter thickness 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.890
 and when wanting to change the furniture of the place 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.050
 move it even if it takes away like 80% of 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.200
 water but I left the decorations and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.090
 filters do not try to move with care and 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.150
 the vibrations made me give 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.730
 found a corner of the fish tank and I 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.130
 began to spill the liquid for that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.470
 reason also served that is I had to 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.470
 buy another fish tank and remodel it all 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.430
 if they have any sound equipment or 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.430
 something else 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.610
 these vibrations can affect the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.110
 fish tank and the unicel what it does is 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.090
 dampen a little and there are not as many 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.300
 vibrations while thicker they can 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.350
 get it in this case and it increases the 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.760
 my fish tank costume is like about 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.950
 260 liters is always less than what 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.930
 they sell and apart one is not going to fill it 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.010
 everything then more or less is like 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:38.200
 about 260 liters and the thickness of the unicel 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.200
 it is 2.5 centimeters 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.630
 it's good this is the explanation 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.310
 short of this and afterwards I'm going to upload 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.310
 the videos I hope you liked 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.920
 is what I do to make it 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.180
 completely hidden 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.180
 I have the pacifiers 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.420
 here 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.200
 neither the new search in the part of 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.200
 behind 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.750
 hidden with the truth 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.970
 if the decorations are left, this is 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.590
 the typical one that I taught them with the way 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.019
 with the suckers 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.890
 all the decorations below have 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.900
 Pacifiers are stuck so that in this 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.780
 case the carps are very playful like this 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.510
 they always have the habit of getting you out 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.939
 all then 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.150
 I do this trick so they do not ruin me 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.790
 the decorations and this little boat that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.519
 is there is with the stone and grad now 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.590
 because I 'm going to put it on top so 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.510
 take out the boat bubbles and have a 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.510
 pretty father effect 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.280
 this is the final part of the video where 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:25.300
 I already learned the filters here is my 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.400
 canister filter home 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.230
 and this one where you just put the water 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.230
 these are the last decorations 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.220
 and here are my folders 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.030
 They are two tents here 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.170
 two layers coi 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.310
 the jong-un tents that are from here in 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.310
 Morelos from Cuernavaca 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.260
 Yellow carp from Miami 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.460
 and in the other tent white ribbon with 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.460
 black is from shanghai 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.280
 and I have two peppers two 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.580
 leopard runners 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.380
 and two other runners who lived 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.670
 read the name of the species because it is 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.470
 the coat 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.800
 well this is all for the video we 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.300
 we see in the following video tutorial and 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.700
 I hope you have seen again how 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.070
 weapon 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:35.170
 I forgot as always to mention 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:38.220
 that you use to stir the water save in 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.220
 the buckets that I had 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:46.120
 25% of the water from the other fish tank then 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:48.129
 75% water was so new to you 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.310
 It was 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.140
 with blue bacteria 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.990
 with a little bit of turbidity for me 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.480
 rinse the water and complementary to believe 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.660
 what is the anti chlorine and the conditioner 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.780
 of water 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.600
 only these three things 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.680
 because the salt this can affect them 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.699
 the runners then I do not use salt 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.699
 and then I 'm
