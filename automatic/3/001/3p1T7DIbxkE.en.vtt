00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
them and very interesting like his whole

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.869 
them and very interesting like his whole
mind<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.449> crime<00:06:00.169> Brian<00:06:00.949> equals<00:06:01.430> victory

mind to the crime Brian equals victory

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.360 
mind to the crime Brian equals victory
like<00:06:02.120> he<00:06:02.300> just<00:06:02.509> doesn't<00:06:02.990> believe<00:06:03.229> in<00:06:03.469> honor<00:06:04.129> at

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
like he just doesn't believe in honor at

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.029 
like he just doesn't believe in honor at
all<00:06:04.520> so<00:06:05.210> that<00:06:05.449> was<00:06:05.659> very<00:06:05.690> interesting<00:06:06.050> so<00:06:06.889> he

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
all so that was very interesting so he

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.999 
all so that was very interesting so he
leaves<00:06:07.279> and<00:06:07.909> then<00:06:08.089> I'm<00:06:08.330> he<00:06:08.719> read<00:06:08.930> this<00:06:09.139> this

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
leaves and then I'm he read this this

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.950 
leaves and then I'm he read this this
collapses<00:06:10.669> I<00:06:10.699> think<00:06:11.389> it<00:06:11.449> was<00:06:11.539> from<00:06:11.779> the

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
collapses I think it was from the

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.269 
collapses I think it was from the
aftershock<00:06:12.469> of<00:06:12.500> what<00:06:12.770> happened<00:06:13.159> of<00:06:13.250> course

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:13.279 
aftershock of what happened of course

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:16.029 
aftershock of what happened of course
that<00:06:13.729> understandable<00:06:14.569> this<00:06:15.020> great<00:06:15.650> guys<00:06:15.830> had

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039

no we're just dying like that that's the

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.619 
no we're just dying like that that's the
