00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
good afternoon I'm going to do a demo of

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:16.160 
good afternoon I'm going to do a demo of
a<00:00:06.620> Z<00:00:07.620> boost<00:00:09.260> so<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.290> can<00:00:10.559> zoom<00:00:10.590> into<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:15.109> this<00:00:16.109> is

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
a Z boost so I can zoom into it this is

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.420 
a Z boost so I can zoom into it this is
the<00:00:16.470> CA<00:00:16.770> n<00:00:17.279> T<00:00:18.380> 0<00:00:19.380> 0<00:00:19.850> for<00:00:20.850> 1

the CA n T 0 0 for 1

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.189 
the CA n T 0 0 for 1
it's<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.670> tri-band<00:00:25.550> yagi<00:00:26.550> antenna<00:00:27.140> kind<00:00:28.140> of

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
it's a tri-band yagi antenna kind of

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.590 
it's a tri-band yagi antenna kind of
looks<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.439> popsicle<00:00:29.810> with<00:00:30.810> 75<00:00:31.769> ohm

device<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:43.489> just<00:00:44.489> installed<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.300> today<00:00:45.750> since

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
device I just installed this today since

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.040 
device I just installed this today since
it's<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.789> close<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> 50<00:00:48.450> degrees<00:00:48.480> today

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it's in it's close to 50 degrees today

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.869 
it's in it's close to 50 degrees today
it's<00:00:49.739> been<00:00:49.950> very<00:00:50.940> cool<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.690> New<00:00:51.840> England

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
it's been very cool here in New England

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.369 
it's been very cool here in New England
but<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.910> wanted<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.449> demo<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:57.109> got<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.230> from

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
but I wanted to demo it I got this from

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.119 
but I wanted to demo it I got this from
a<00:00:58.500> website<00:00:58.710> in<00:01:00.079> well<00:01:01.079> based<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.590> Brooklyn<00:01:02.039> but

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
a website in well based in Brooklyn but

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.329 
a website in well based in Brooklyn but
it<00:01:02.250> took<00:01:02.399> absolutely<00:01:02.699> forever<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.570> get<00:01:03.690> this

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
it took absolutely forever to get this

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.160 
it took absolutely forever to get this
that's<00:01:05.339> about<00:01:05.519> 60<00:01:05.970> bucks<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.080> I

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that's about 60 bucks for this that I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.980 
that's about 60 bucks for this that I
paid<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.640> want<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.630> how<00:01:09.750> good<00:01:09.930> it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
paid for it so I want to see how good it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.050 
paid for it so I want to see how good it
is<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.320> got<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.590> further<00:01:10.950> furthest<00:01:11.549> away<00:01:11.670> from

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
is I got it further furthest away from

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.810 
is I got it further furthest away from
the<00:01:12.979> pole<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.760> pointed<00:01:15.150> toward<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
the pole and it's pointed toward the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.940 
the pole and it's pointed toward the
cell<00:01:17.820> sites<00:01:18.180> our<00:01:18.420> behind<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.170> hill<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.710> top

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950

cell sites our behind that hill on top
of<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.220> mountain<00:01:20.689> we're<00:01:21.689> going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> test

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
of a mountain we're going to do a test

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.710 
of a mountain we're going to do a test
with<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:24.229> width<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.470> without<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:27.299> 4G

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
a speed test wirelessly I think it'd be

the signal is blinking full with this I

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.460 
the signal is blinking full with this I
want<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.650> show<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.889> little<00:03:36.010> difference

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
want to show you a little difference

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.890 
want to show you a little difference
after<00:03:38.470> ii<00:03:39.900> actually<00:03:40.900> go<00:03:40.989> like<00:03:41.169> this<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:43.720> we're

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
after ii actually go like this and we're

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.490 
after ii actually go like this and we're
going<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.079> plug<00:03:44.409> in<00:03:44.470> see<00:03:44.889> what<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.099> does

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.760 

and<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.520> should<00:03:52.760> drop<00:03:53.000> down<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:57.110> drop<00:03:57.410> down<00:03:57.590> to

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
and it should drop down you drop down to

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:06.360 
and it should drop down you drop down to
like<00:03:57.950> three<00:04:01.600> three<00:04:02.600> bars<00:04:02.930> from<00:04:03.620> this<00:04:03.830> location

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
like three three bars from this location

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.570 
like three three bars from this location
let's<00:04:07.370> do<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.610> test<00:04:07.970> with<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:10.640> unfold<00:04:11.800> over<00:04:12.800> here

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
let's do a test with it unfold over here

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.650 
let's do a test with it unfold over here
wirelessly<00:04:14.950> using<00:04:16.120> speedtest.net<00:04:17.620> okay<00:04:19.660> and

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
wirelessly using speedtest.net okay and

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.290 
wirelessly using speedtest.net okay and
we'll<00:04:20.810> just<00:04:20.959> go<00:04:21.109> back<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.350> new<00:04:21.620> server<00:04:22.240> this<00:04:23.240> is

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
we'll just go back to new server this is

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.220 
we'll just go back to new server this is
without<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:24.200> booster<00:04:25.930> I'm<00:04:26.930> still

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
without the booster I'm still

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.690 
without the booster I'm still
undetermined<00:04:27.770> with<00:04:27.860> this<00:04:28.010> antenna<00:04:28.370> I<00:04:28.430> haven't

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
undetermined with this antenna I haven't

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.000 
undetermined with this antenna I haven't
used<00:04:28.910> it<00:04:29.030> enough<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.510> see<00:04:30.470> if<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.620> makes<00:04:30.770> up<00:04:30.920> a

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
used it enough to see if it makes up a

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:40.480 
used it enough to see if it makes up a
huge<00:04:31.160> difference<00:04:32.620> this<00:04:33.620> is<00:04:33.860> without<00:04:39.250> 30<00:04:40.250> to

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
huge difference this is without 30 to

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.940 
huge difference this is without 30 to
make<00:04:40.730> 32<00:04:41.500> milliseconds<00:04:42.500> for<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.740> ping<00:04:42.919> is

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
make 32 milliseconds for the ping is

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:55.570 
make 32 milliseconds for the ping is
good<00:04:44.650> I'm<00:04:45.650> getting<00:04:45.919> about<00:04:46.520> 13<00:04:48.100> down<00:04:54.340> this<00:04:55.340> has

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
good I'm getting about 13 down this has

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.530 
good I'm getting about 13 down this has
an<00:04:55.760> N<00:04:56.080> card<00:04:57.080> in<00:04:57.260> it<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:58.700> up<00:04:58.790> was<00:04:58.940> about<00:04:59.150> six<00:04:59.390> to

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
an N card in it the up was about six to

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.159 
an N card in it the up was about six to
seven<00:04:59.570> I<00:05:00.140> know<00:05:01.360> it's<00:05:02.360> very<00:05:02.450> kind<00:05:02.780> of<00:05:02.840> strange

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
seven I know it's very kind of strange

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.870 
seven I know it's very kind of strange
see<00:05:03.470> now<00:05:03.590> it's<00:05:03.800> for<00:05:04.130> some<00:05:04.310> reason<00:05:04.610> it's<00:05:04.730> only

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
see now it's for some reason it's only

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.420 
see now it's for some reason it's only
one<00:05:06.700> so<00:05:07.700> we're<00:05:07.880> gonna<00:05:07.970> do<00:05:08.180> a<00:05:08.210> little<00:05:08.390> test

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
one so we're gonna do a little test

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.710 
one so we're gonna do a little test
once<00:05:10.430> it's<00:05:10.610> done<00:05:12.880> yeah<00:05:13.880> that's<00:05:14.150> very<00:05:14.240> poor<00:05:14.690> I

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
once it's done yeah that's very poor I

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.440 
once it's done yeah that's very poor I
didn't<00:05:15.050> even<00:05:15.140> it<00:05:15.800> wasn't<00:05:16.070> even<00:05:16.130> a<00:05:16.310> mega<00:05:16.550> 1/2<00:05:16.910> so

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
didn't even it wasn't even a mega 1/2 so

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:27.969 
didn't even it wasn't even a mega 1/2 so
let's<00:05:18.440> uh<00:05:19.240> let's<00:05:20.240> switch<00:05:20.630> it<00:05:20.660> plug<00:05:21.590> it<00:05:21.710> back<00:05:21.740> in

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.879 

and<00:05:29.060> we'll<00:05:30.060> note<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.389> signal<00:05:30.810> I'm<00:05:31.169> a<00:05:31.229> 4G<00:05:31.770> LTE

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
and we'll note the signal I'm a 4G LTE

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:40.520 
and we'll note the signal I'm a 4G LTE
router<00:05:36.710> it's<00:05:37.710> almost<00:05:38.430> full<00:05:39.410> besides<00:05:40.410> the

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
router it's almost full besides the

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.529 
router it's almost full besides the
phone<00:05:40.770> that's<00:05:40.949> full<00:05:41.220> whole<00:05:41.370> time<00:05:41.639> so<00:05:42.060> that's

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
phone that's full whole time so that's

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.529 
phone that's full whole time so that's
on<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:42.810> 3G<00:05:43.199> network<00:05:43.229> so<00:05:43.910> here<00:05:44.910> goes<00:05:45.090> we're

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
on the 3G network so here goes we're

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:56.510 
on the 3G network so here goes we're
going<00:05:45.690> to<00:05:46.580> reset<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.729> test<00:05:53.150> and<00:05:55.430> we're<00:05:56.430> just

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
going to reset the test and we're just

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:10.100 
going to reset the test and we're just
gonna<00:05:56.789> start<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.509> speed<00:05:57.720> test<00:05:57.990> here<00:06:09.110> things

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
gonna start the speed test here things

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.650 
gonna start the speed test here things
at<00:06:10.289> 39<00:06:13.220> this<00:06:14.220> is<00:06:14.370> about<00:06:14.550> 10<00:06:14.850> it's<00:06:15.120> between<00:06:15.270> 10

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
at 39 this is about 10 it's between 10

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.000 
at 39 this is about 10 it's between 10
and<00:06:15.720> 15<00:06:16.229> it<00:06:16.350> varies<00:06:16.650> tremendously<00:06:16.830> a<00:06:19.010> little

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
and 15 it varies tremendously a little

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.589 
and 15 it varies tremendously a little
over<00:06:20.190> 8<00:06:20.400> but<00:06:20.610> it<00:06:20.699> was<00:06:20.820> more<00:06:21.000> this<00:06:21.120> morning<00:06:21.449> was

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 
over 8 but it was more this morning was

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.050 
over 8 but it was more this morning was
about<00:06:21.630> 14<00:06:22.229> know<00:06:22.889> what<00:06:23.160> causes<00:06:23.430> it<00:06:23.699> to<00:06:23.729> change

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
about 14 know what causes it to change

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:34.580 
about 14 know what causes it to change
so<00:06:24.240> much<00:06:28.250> here's<00:06:29.250> the<00:06:29.400> upload<00:06:33.080> yeah<00:06:34.080> it<00:06:34.440> was

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
so much here's the upload yeah it was

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.430 
so much here's the upload yeah it was
more<00:06:34.770> than<00:06:34.860> that<00:06:35.010> I<00:06:35.070> was<00:06:35.190> about<00:06:35.340> 7<00:06:36.169> but<00:06:37.169> it's<00:06:37.289> at

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
more than that I was about 7 but it's at

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.279 
more than that I was about 7 but it's at
5<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:38.190> little<00:06:38.550> more<00:06:38.669> than<00:06:38.789> 5<00:06:39.169> actually<00:06:40.169> it's

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
5 a little more than 5 actually it's

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.409 
5 a little more than 5 actually it's
almost<00:06:40.440> 6

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 
almost 6

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:50.000 
almost 6
I<00:06:45.470> had<00:06:46.470> it<00:06:46.590> about<00:06:46.680> seven<00:06:46.830> earlier<00:06:48.680> and<00:06:49.680> I<00:06:49.770> say

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
I had it about seven earlier and I say

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.939 
I had it about seven earlier and I say
this<00:06:50.159> is<00:06:50.310> remote<00:06:50.780> wirelessly<00:06:51.780> but<00:06:52.169> I<00:06:52.380> want<00:06:52.889> to

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:52.949 
this is remote wirelessly but I want to

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.439 
this is remote wirelessly but I want to
do<00:06:53.010> another<00:06:53.159> I'll<00:06:53.430> do<00:06:53.580> another<00:06:53.760> test<00:06:54.060> and<00:06:54.210> post

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:54.449 
do another I'll do another test and post

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:00.860 
do another I'll do another test and post
it<00:06:54.630> maybe<00:06:54.810> later<00:06:55.110> but<00:06:56.389> I'm<00:06:57.389> not<00:06:57.570> sure<00:06:57.810> why<00:06:59.870> it's

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
it maybe later but I'm not sure why it's

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.219 
it maybe later but I'm not sure why it's
doing<00:07:01.080> this<00:07:01.380> but<00:07:02.570> depends<00:07:03.570> where<00:07:03.720> it<00:07:03.810> is<00:07:03.930> I

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
doing this but depends where it is I

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.640 
doing this but depends where it is I
tried<00:07:04.740> moving<00:07:04.919> it<00:07:05.190> around<00:07:05.280> I<00:07:05.520> had<00:07:05.729> the<00:07:06.650> remote

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
tried moving it around I had the remote

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.129 
tried moving it around I had the remote
things<00:07:07.889> there<00:07:08.099> but<00:07:08.130> I<00:07:08.310> don't<00:07:08.729> think<00:07:09.030> it<00:07:09.150> was<00:07:09.270> I

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 
things there but I don't think it was I

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.620 
things there but I don't think it was I
think<00:07:11.010> the<00:07:11.250> antenna<00:07:11.610> was<00:07:11.760> probably<00:07:12.270> seeing

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
think the antenna was probably seeing

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.750 
think the antenna was probably seeing
the<00:07:13.229> booster<00:07:13.880> so<00:07:14.880> I<00:07:14.909> moved<00:07:15.240> it<00:07:15.449> more<00:07:15.990> of<00:07:16.139> a

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
the booster so I moved it more of a

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.640 
the booster so I moved it more of a
little<00:07:17.760> block<00:07:18.539> a<00:07:18.570> little<00:07:18.930> bit<00:07:19.050> by<00:07:19.139> the<00:07:19.199> windows

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.650 
little block a little bit by the windows

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.370 
little block a little bit by the windows
here<00:07:20.720> so<00:07:21.720> and<00:07:22.349> this<00:07:23.280> device<00:07:23.610> um<00:07:23.970> I<00:07:24.479> had<00:07:25.110> voice

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 
here so and this device um I had voice

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.129 
here so and this device um I had voice
with<00:07:25.650> it<00:07:25.770> but<00:07:25.889> I<00:07:25.949> don't<00:07:26.010> know<00:07:26.370> and<00:07:29.210> it<00:07:30.210> it<00:07:30.840> works

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:31.139 
with it but I don't know and it it works

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:34.399 
with it but I don't know and it it works
pretty<00:07:31.500> well<00:07:32.180> so<00:07:33.180> I<00:07:33.630> had<00:07:33.900> to<00:07:33.990> get<00:07:34.110> the<00:07:34.199> data

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:34.409 
pretty well so I had to get the data

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:35.870 
pretty well so I had to get the data
back<00:07:34.620> after<00:07:34.979> I<00:07:35.010> ported<00:07:35.400> it<00:07:35.520> back<00:07:35.669> to<00:07:35.849> a

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 
back after I ported it back to a

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.740 
back after I ported it back to a

it<00:07:38.470> took<00:07:39.310> some<00:07:40.060> time<00:07:40.120> because<00:07:41.370> these<00:07:42.370> are<00:07:42.580> have

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 
it took some time because these are have

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:45.180 
it took some time because these are have
a<00:07:42.789> non<00:07:43.030> removable<00:07:43.389> SIM<00:07:43.930> card<00:07:44.289> let<00:07:44.860> me<00:07:44.949> show<00:07:45.130> you
