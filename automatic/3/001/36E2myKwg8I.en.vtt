00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Good morning, everyone, today I would like to make you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.860
 see something you never would have thought 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.860
 to see for myself that is the tubular start 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.170
 actually I never use the polar virtue 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.279
 however we say that it is a bit part of the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.100
 childhood memories and therefore was one 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.430
 of the first edges I learned is therefore 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.380
 more for a kind of question 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.189
 I would still like to show you affective 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.200
 although in reality I never use it is a 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:42.660
 type of board that a kind of boot that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.120
 does not need a waste wire like 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.670
 in the street or Italian-style tubular e 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.399
 also because it is precisely the tubular way 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.579
 the German obviously because I am here 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.930
 so let's proceed and how 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.780
 setting up a thousand and a little bit e 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.280
 long tail custom ie queue startup 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.710
 long is however completely different 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:16.640
 so let's see we keep two long threads 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:21.150
 with the tail as for the long tail boot e 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.409
 we take with the iron and we turn the thread 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.869
 we made the first shirt equal to 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.400
 as you normally do at this point 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.130
 there is a thread underneath 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.890
 and it is this of a child who is above 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.659
 we must always go under the thread 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.780
 that is under and above the wire that is 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:48.060
 above which below up and dry loop e 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.329
 then vice versa upside down under it 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.920
 zero and let's go on like this 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.590
 assembling all the points we need 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.740
 you don't see that there is an extra spin 11 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.090
 winding in more than fixing 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.670
 the pach attack 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.590
 then below over lap 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.780
 oh well let's say we end up here because 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.530
 otherwise we go on tomorrow 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.480
 at this point we have the shirts 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.030
 coupled as it already seems to be 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.830
 turn in the right way upside down 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.500
 so what do I do I get this 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:33.739
 thread ride the mif heringer work e 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.319
 therefore I proceed to work the first one 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.580
 knitted definitely he will work always has 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.769
 right 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.160
 then we see that this should be 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:46.430
 the right is turned backwards is 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.069
 turned here is why we work it has 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.470
 right then like all the workings 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.470
 tubular that are respected that is the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.680
 backhand and we pass it without 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:05.650
 work it and continue like this until 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:09.350
 luckily the iron is 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:16.030
 very small so we can do it to 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:22.640
 see I will also show you the iron 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:27.320
 next so you can see how 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.950
 comes really well we say it is 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.620
 this starts for me just like vi 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.220
 I said a value more than anything affective 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.819
 I don't think I'll use it anymore and only that 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:44.120
 so I remember these 80s sweaters 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.780
 that I did with very high edges a 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.870
 cost and 1 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.260
 and of course they had to have the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.400
 in fact I used to make a tubular tube 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.650
 completely tubular to have 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.640
 a crazy elasticity that then in reality 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.760
 there was not 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.940
 well then we have finished working it 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.480
 and here's how it looks like a normal 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.880
 tubular machines a tubular broth 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.050
 very very nice though absolutely 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.900
 useless 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:19.200
 well I wanted you to see this 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.200
 little pearl not the next one
