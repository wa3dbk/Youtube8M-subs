00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 to beat those today let's talk about 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.540
 rhythmic reading 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.680
 to study rhythmic reading 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.350
 you first need to know the 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.289
 musical figures that are them 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.949
 ACM soon to be the minimum to minimum 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.439
 eighteenth -note dubbed and fake acm 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.960
 it is very important to know how much each 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.300
 figure is worth by time ie how many 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.339
 notes each figure will be worth the time 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.260
 there are also several ways to 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.720
 study reading rhythm 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.630
 one is to take a levada and isolate 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.920
 every note that each battery piece 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.770
 she is touched 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.199
 so we can identify which figure 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.719
 is being played in a certain part 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.629
 of the compass and also how it would only do 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.969
 if it was separate from the other notes 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.370
 today we will make this process take 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.370
 Let's study this one, check it out. 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.180
 we can identify on the face that for 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.890
 we are using the eighth and 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.200
 these isolated figures from the other 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.200
 they would take a look 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.000
 already the box is being played in the head 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.490
 the second time and the fourth time 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.620
 we can use spread head pause 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.220
 the first and third time see 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.220
 as a son 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.910
 part of the butt is harder on the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.770
 first time head 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.380
 we will be using a sixteenth 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.660
 followed by a carrion punctuated in the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.000
 Second time head we have a break 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.780
 then full and we have two sixteenth notes 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.360
 at the end of time one on and one after 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.450
 error in the third time we took a break 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.820
 round two in the head of time two 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.970
 forces positioned at the place where 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.580
 would be the second sixteenth note and these 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.860
 two forces will be followed by yet another 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.020
 Five full break in and out of time in 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.940
 followed by the last sixteenth of the 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.459
 third time already in the fourth time 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.880
 We'll have a break spread See how 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.880
 stay 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.450
 I find it very interesting and 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.519
 dismembering the figures in this way because 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.489
 so we can better understand how 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.350
 that taken the pace was created now 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.019
 I'll show full levy. 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.590
 adding each note in its respective 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.060
 battery part individually and yes 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.660
 we will play everything together 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.660
 check it out 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.120
 It is very important to study the crowd 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.250
 rhythmic reading and you can study 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.380
 even when you're not sitting in the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.660
 battery you may only be using the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.060
 music book a pencil an eraser 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.200
 and adds notes by creating your own 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.690
 own ideas 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.520
 if you know how to read sheet music but feel 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.860
 difficulty in some cases that 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.020
 advises to do this begins to write 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.030
 your own ideas that you will see 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.810
 that your creativity will increase 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.480
 very 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.740
 I hope I have helped if you liked this. 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.700
 video click liked and let lilic 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.100
 extraordinary if you want part 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:58.010
 access to your site the link is in the 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.010
 Description A hug and see you next week
