back into cereal in a big way lately you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.060

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
know i went kind of years without eating

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.719 
know i went kind of years without eating
it<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.580> was<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.790> psycho<00:01:06.150> serial<00:01:06.450> I

think<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.860> possibly<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.979> good<00:01:11.220> way<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> lose

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
think it's a possibly a good way to lose

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.250 

all<00:04:13.760> right<00:04:13.940> let's<00:04:14.330> go<00:04:15.340> let's<00:04:16.340> try<00:04:16.610> this<00:04:16.670> again

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
all right let's go let's try this again

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.930 
all right let's go let's try this again
all<00:04:18.260> this<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:19.040> water<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.489> everything<00:04:19.580> else

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
all this the water and everything else

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.850 
all this the water and everything else
least<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:20.870> don't<00:04:20.989> have<00:04:21.080> to<00:04:21.200> go<00:04:21.320> get<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.560> chaos

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
least I don't have to go get the chaos

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:29.130 
least I don't have to go get the chaos
and<00:04:26.050> maybe<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.170> can<00:04:27.500> get<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.340> end<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.580> this

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
and maybe I can get to the end of this

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.590 
and maybe I can get to the end of this
level<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:31.430> isn't<00:04:31.670> even<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.880> hard<00:04:32.150> one<00:04:32.360> this

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
level this isn't even the hard one this

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.980 
level this isn't even the hard one this
is<00:04:32.750> so<00:04:33.350> this<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:33.680> usually<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:33.980> easy<00:04:34.220> one<00:04:34.490> I

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
is so this is usually the easy one I

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.900 
is so this is usually the easy one I
usually<00:04:35.990> have<00:04:36.140> most<00:04:36.410> problems<00:04:36.800> in<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:37.460> second

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
usually have most problems in the second

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:45.000 
usually have most problems in the second
deck<00:04:39.700> I'm<00:04:40.700> getting<00:04:40.940> ahead<00:04:41.120> of<00:04:41.240> myself<00:04:41.330> again

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
somewhere there's a platform aha

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.140 
somewhere there's a platform aha
checkpoint<00:04:58.250> never<00:04:58.490> have<00:04:58.670> to<00:04:58.790> do<00:04:58.880> that<00:04:58.910> again

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
checkpoint never have to do that again

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
noticed that the last checkpoint I

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.740 
noticed that the last checkpoint I
forgot<00:05:03.200> to<00:05:03.320> mention<00:05:03.350> this<00:05:03.710> but<00:05:04.460> if<00:05:04.760> you<00:05:04.910> when

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
you come back to a checkpoint the that

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.740 
you come back to a checkpoint the that
jump<00:05:13.580> did<00:05:13.760> not<00:05:13.790> work<00:05:14.120> like<00:05:14.300> it<00:05:14.480> was<00:05:14.600> supposed

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
jump did not work like it was supposed

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:22.960 
jump did not work like it was supposed
to<00:05:15.230> it<00:05:15.440> yeah<00:05:15.919> see<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:21.169> checkpoint<00:05:21.800> if<00:05:22.160> you

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
to it yeah see the checkpoint if you

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.830 
to it yeah see the checkpoint if you
don't<00:05:23.270> get<00:05:24.020> it<00:05:24.230> again<00:05:24.770> when<00:05:25.250> you<00:05:25.370> respond<00:05:25.880> it

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
don't get it again when you respond it

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.430 
don't get it again when you respond it
doesn't<00:05:27.440> count<00:05:28.570> that's<00:05:29.570> it<00:05:29.960> sounds<00:05:30.320> really

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
doesn't count that's it sounds really

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.950 
doesn't count that's it sounds really
stupid<00:05:30.740> but<00:05:31.010> that's<00:05:31.610> how<00:05:31.820> it<00:05:31.850> is<00:05:32.030> like<00:05:32.390> you

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
stupid but that's how it is like you

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.050 
stupid but that's how it is like you
have<00:05:32.990> every<00:05:33.710> time<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:34.280> come<00:05:34.490> back<00:05:34.520> at<00:05:34.940> the

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
have every time you come back at the

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.520 
have every time you come back at the
checkpoint<00:05:35.510> you<00:05:35.750> have<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.110> reget<00:05:36.410> the

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
checkpoint you have to reget the

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.330 
checkpoint you have to reget the
checkpoint<00:05:37.040> or<00:05:37.850> it<00:05:38.060> doesn't<00:05:38.210> come<00:05:38.890> so<00:05:39.890> say<00:05:40.130> I

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
checkpoint or it doesn't come so say I

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.580 
checkpoint or it doesn't come so say I
didn't<00:05:40.669> get<00:05:40.760> the<00:05:40.880> checkpoint<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:41.930> I<00:05:42.140> died<00:05:42.380> now

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
didn't get the checkpoint and I died now

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.640 
didn't get the checkpoint and I died now
I'd<00:05:42.830> go<00:05:43.010> back<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.960> well<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:44.990> don't<00:05:45.140> know<00:05:45.320> I've

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
I'd go back to well I don't know I've

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.249 
I'd go back to well I don't know I've
never<00:05:46.160> done<00:05:46.880> it

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.080 

maybe<00:05:50.259> maybe<00:05:50.800> you<00:05:50.979> don't<00:05:51.130> have<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:51.490> reget<00:05:51.789> it<00:05:51.910> I

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
maybe maybe you don't have to reget it I

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.839 
maybe maybe you don't have to reget it I
figured<00:05:52.599> you<00:05:52.720> do<00:05:52.930> I<00:05:53.199> thought<00:05:53.979> I<00:05:54.009> did<00:05:54.250> once<00:05:54.490> and

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
figured you do I thought I did once and

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.670 
figured you do I thought I did once and
then<00:05:55.690> I<00:05:55.750> got<00:05:55.900> sent<00:05:56.139> back<00:05:56.199> to<00:05:56.349> like<00:05:56.590> the

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
then I got sent back to like the
