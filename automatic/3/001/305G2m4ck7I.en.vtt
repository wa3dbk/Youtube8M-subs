actually vote no to not surrender which
is<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.070> surprising<00:00:41.160> at<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.640> point<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
is a little surprising at this point I

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.369 
is a little surprising at this point I
don't<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.629> possibly<00:00:42.960> hope<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.199> get

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
don't see what they possibly hope to get
out<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.650> here<00:00:43.830> I<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> grab<00:00:44.730> on

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
you and that would be what we call a bad

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.719 
you and that would be what we call a bad
thing<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.770> other<00:01:37.830> hand<00:01:38.070> maybe<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.610> means

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
thing on the other hand maybe that means

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.520 
thing on the other hand maybe that means
you'll<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:38.970> able<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> power<00:01:39.479> system<00:01:39.930> which<00:01:40.350> i

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
you'll be able to power system which i

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
think the knocked-up will definitely

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:52.060 
think the knocked-up will definitely
cancel<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> spell

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.580 

so<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.780> team<00:01:53.990> has<00:01:54.460> two<00:01:55.630> lanes<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:56.960> super

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
so the team has two lanes of super

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.530 
so the team has two lanes of super
creeps<00:01:57.830> coming<00:01:58.190> their<00:01:58.310> way<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:59.330> naked

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
creeps coming their way and a naked

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.540 
creeps coming their way and a naked
nexus<00:02:00.170> they're<00:02:00.500> forced<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:00.830> defend<00:02:01.010> their<00:02:01.370> I

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
nexus they're forced to defend their I

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.950 
nexus they're forced to defend their I
don't<00:02:02.030> think<00:02:02.060> there's<00:02:02.330> anything<00:02:02.600> they<00:02:02.840> could

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
don't think there's anything they could

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.630 
don't think there's anything they could
do<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.140> possibly<00:02:03.650> stop<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:03.920> push<00:02:04.160> on<00:02:04.250> our<00:02:04.400> side

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
do to possibly stop a push on our side

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.280 
do to possibly stop a push on our side
as<00:02:05.030> soon<00:02:05.270> as<00:02:05.360> everyone<00:02:05.690> comes<00:02:05.930> back<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.260> life

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
as soon as everyone comes back to life

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.669 
as soon as everyone comes back to life
and<00:02:06.710> teams<00:02:07.190> up<00:02:07.369> again<00:02:08.200> see<00:02:09.200> I'm<00:02:09.289> working<00:02:09.410> on<00:02:09.619> a

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
and teams up again see I'm working on a

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.190 
and teams up again see I'm working on a
frozen<00:02:10.100> heart<00:02:10.459> at<00:02:10.640> this<00:02:10.759> point<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.480> figured

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
frozen heart at this point I figured

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.170 
frozen heart at this point I figured
that<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.800> biggest<00:02:13.010> threats<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.820> I<00:02:13.850> had

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
that the the biggest threats that I had

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.510 
that the the biggest threats that I had
to<00:02:14.270> worry<00:02:14.450> about<00:02:14.540> here<00:02:15.050> were<00:02:15.370> melee<00:02:16.370> damage

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
to worry about here were melee damage

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.280 
to worry about here were melee damage
and<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:16.940> said<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.330> cooldown<00:02:17.780> reduction<00:02:17.900> would

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
and I said the cooldown reduction would

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.280 
and I said the cooldown reduction would
be<00:02:18.410> good<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.800> was<00:02:19.790> sort<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.060> just<00:02:20.240> at<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.840> point

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
be good I was sort of just at that point

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.670 
be good I was sort of just at that point
picking<00:02:21.530> whatever<00:02:23.080> what<00:02:24.080> was<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.440> sold

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
picking whatever what was it that sold

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.440 
picking whatever what was it that sold
me<00:02:24.709> oh<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.070> Israel<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.610> enemy<00:02:25.850> Israel<00:02:26.000> who

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
me oh that Israel the enemy Israel who

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.000 
me oh that Israel the enemy Israel who
actually<00:02:26.600> went<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.080> kind<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.680> an<00:02:27.739> attack

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
actually went the kind of an attack

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.100 
actually went the kind of an attack
speed<00:02:28.280> attack<00:02:28.910> damage<00:02:29.120> build<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.900> figured

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
speed attack damage build so I figured

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.510 
speed attack damage build so I figured
all<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.590> armor<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:30.860> gonna<00:02:31.040> be<00:02:31.130> good<00:02:31.220> against

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
all the armor is gonna be good against

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.380 
all the armor is gonna be good against
everyone<00:02:31.790> except<00:02:32.030> arise<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:33.560> what<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.980> hell

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
everyone except arise so what the hell

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.290 
everyone except arise so what the hell
but<00:02:35.390> it's<00:02:36.020> not<00:02:36.320> really<00:02:36.590> my<00:02:36.860> favorite<00:02:37.430> item<00:02:38.090> on

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
but it's not really my favorite item on

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.530 
but it's not really my favorite item on
blitz<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:39.580> just<00:02:40.580> figured<00:02:40.880> what<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.060> heck<00:02:41.300> I

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
blitz I just figured what the heck I

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.030 
blitz I just figured what the heck I
don't<00:02:41.840> want<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.050> die<00:02:42.080> anymore<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.920> will

don't want to die anymore and that will

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.250 
don't want to die anymore and that will
help<00:02:43.160> me<00:02:43.280> not<00:02:43.459> die<00:02:43.750> but<00:02:44.750> someone<00:02:45.110> I'm<00:02:45.200> gonna
