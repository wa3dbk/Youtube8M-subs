00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.460
 world in France is saying to himself 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.719
 oh my god but patrick is no longer there 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.640

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.990
 car an airplane is officially 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.960
 rest assured first of all I want to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.099
 just excuse me for being late 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.779
 simply that I certainly 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.789
 why video but must know that I 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.230
 am in exams his parents and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.270
 that it is not easy to always 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.040
 align the two ends but in any case 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.750
 I simply made the mistake of not 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.149
 or prevent that I totally apologize 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.040
 and my now I want to tell you that 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.329
 I'm still in the exam but it's 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 a little quieter because I have 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.809
 finished all the writings and just 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.460
 I have more clio did it's a little bit 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.270
 quieter so so here it is 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.940
 simply that today 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.649
 on the menu of the day that if I can say a 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.760
 challenge that has never been requested but 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.250
 at the same time I never thought 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.320
 do this challenge I finally have the challenge of 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 winning a match was women with everything 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.739
 just two broken fingers in red 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.290
 explain I was part of basketball 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.970
 with a friend simply and on a 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.979
 bad bounce just that I the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.510
 believe the bullet very clever of my 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.710
 share I got torn back 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.530
 ligaments with two fingers I you 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.659
 would put the picture if I come back 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.210
 bottom ah yes but do not pay attention to 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.490
 little brothel behind it is for 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.020
 the job is just pass a 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.270
 little no so I go outside it 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.090
 can try to win a match 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.440
 simply with two members still 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.180
 only because it's a little bit 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.640
 I stopped my daddy what is it because 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.830
 yes you tapas tap the good catch and 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.240
 all and not very easy to navigate it's 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.580
 a bit boring and we'll see what we 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.830
 can do and are aware that I am 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.450
 sure even though it's a few 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.060
 time I could play fifa 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.230
 even if people born five last six 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.210
 matches and is that defeats 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.800
 although I am in the summary this last 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.990
 works I absolutely understand this 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.250
 is happening even though I can find 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.110
 all the excuses of the world 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.100
 no i'm sure frankly nice of 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.110
 simple but I'm sure we can 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.370
 succeed in doing something clean 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.500
 what i still statham confessed 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.080
 euros silva a form this cartel a 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.090
 short form eurogoals i'm sure we 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.679
 can do beautiful things together to 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.119
 chase the match and we go there 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.080
 just go legal it's fine 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.680
 would try the months I promise you this 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.560
 match it's going to be a disease match 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.360
 so first line quiet and calm 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.860
 see what we can do but 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.440
 why I can redo I coach 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.940
 that's all but go country but I 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.100
 understand the scpa look at this but 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.120
 even him equals little crazy what good 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.380
 finally I decided to repeal 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.520
 to shorten suffering because 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:41.080
 I arrived absolutely nothing to see so 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:43.380
 I'm going to raise another match ok ok in 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.970
 anyway what we can do 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.959
 annie company you resist the company 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.030

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.900

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.870
 the third is a third corner 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.890
 pretty good rails and east but 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.180

 punch passes time they 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.090
 the habit of being cashed is the 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.200
 match there we understand that there is no 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.410

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.690
 still it's cool anyway 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.460
 to have days like that you animate ray 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.590
 milland your team you will sometimes 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.780
 which sometimes allow to deliver 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.760
 incredible stuff like this one and 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.880
 it is for my greatest pleasure that 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.020
 these three times sacred bond aka more than 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.650
 five minutes to play it's not over 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.760
 azita random combinations of the little 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.460
 mark go from the internet and you're going to 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.530
 hurt the expectations that are dying in 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.870
 five to three final wins and for 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.980

 still to win four men 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.310
 with two doubles and so I remember 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.450
 I think that prey 2 movies will and will be 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.160
 successful at the end of the match and the tribute 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.960

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.010
 it was a great match on my part but 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.150
 it's a nice game in general of which 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.200
