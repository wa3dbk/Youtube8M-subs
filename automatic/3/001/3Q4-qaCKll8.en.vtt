 people are taking care of inner beauty 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.199
 the intellectual beauty of our 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.010

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.560

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.540
 my blog on the dot com beauty 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.820
 and why should not you be 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.040
 Wondering why I'm doing this? 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.320
 video for those who have not yet 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.329
 You know who does not accompany mine. 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.310
 parents are studying English in 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.350
 states and the united states in san 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.270
 francisco for about four 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.220
 months and they only had knowledge 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.399
 this university when they already 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.399
 were there for the entire search time 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.950
 that they were looking for a place to 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.250
 study but are francisco 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.600
 I was present I helped them a lot 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.689
 and we really did not have any 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.299
 access to any information from this 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.170
 siri college and when they stayed 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.469
 knowing this is where they are in San Francisco 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.810
 they went to meet and they loved to be enchanted 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.180
 with the structure with teachers with 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.950
 the courses and everything else that the school is 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.900
 needing 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.200
 students at the moment because they depend on 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.569
 of a number of students to form 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.300
 to join in classes 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.340
 so besides helping them I want to help 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.530
 Are you listening to me maybe? 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.099

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.810
 opportunity to take account of the 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.120
 truth of grace you will not have to cost 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.290
 none to study will have the other 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.410
 expenses 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.940
 but I had this feedback from my parents 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.370
 I had this return that really 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.260
 it's worth it so indicating 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.950

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.330
