00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.530 

now<00:03:37.290> it's<00:03:37.710> time<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.190> separate<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:38.940> fluff<00:03:39.300> and

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
now it's time to separate in fluff and

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.150 
now it's time to separate in fluff and
the<00:03:39.660> first<00:03:39.900> thing<00:03:40.080> I'm<00:03:40.260> going<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.440> do<00:03:40.650> is

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
the first thing I'm going to do is

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:53.750 
the first thing I'm going to do is
unravel<00:03:41.580> all<00:03:42.150> of<00:03:42.360> my<00:03:42.510> twist<00:03:52.160> okay<00:03:53.160> now<00:03:53.550> it's

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
unravel all of my twist okay now it's

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.580 
unravel all of my twist okay now it's
time<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:54.060> separate<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:54.840> we're<00:03:55.080> separating

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
time to separate and we're separating

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.500 
time to separate and we're separating
your<00:03:55.680> curls<00:03:56.040> just<00:03:56.190> stretch<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.760> parallel<00:03:57.180> and

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
your curls just stretch the parallel and

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.360 
your curls just stretch the parallel and
we're<00:03:57.750> naturally<00:03:58.020> separates<00:03:58.800> just<00:03:59.100> split<00:03:59.340> it

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
we're naturally separates just split it

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.340 
we're naturally separates just split it
apart<00:03:59.520> and<00:03:59.940> this<00:04:00.360> is<00:04:00.510> why<00:04:00.660> defining<00:04:01.230> and

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
apart and this is why defining and

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.080 
apart and this is why defining and
detangling<00:04:01.800> was<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.100> vital<00:04:02.370> earlier<00:04:02.910> because

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
detangling was so vital earlier because

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.660 
detangling was so vital earlier because
detangling<00:04:03.840> helps<00:04:04.320> with<00:04:04.530> speeding<00:04:05.280> up<00:04:05.459> this

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
detangling helps with speeding up this

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.940 
detangling helps with speeding up this
process<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.480> defining<00:04:07.020> will<00:04:07.500> help<00:04:07.770> with

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
process and defining will help with

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.030 
process and defining will help with
achieving<00:04:08.520> more<00:04:09.000> curls<00:04:09.630> in<00:04:09.810> this<00:04:10.080> style<00:04:10.290> ok<00:04:10.980> so

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
achieving more curls in this style ok so

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.040 
achieving more curls in this style ok so
