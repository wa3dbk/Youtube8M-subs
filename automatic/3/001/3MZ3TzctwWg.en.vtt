00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
I think that'll maybe help it out make

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.219 
I think that'll maybe help it out make
it<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.340> little<00:02:06.429> more<00:02:06.520> like<00:02:06.849> party<00:02:07.300> pacing<00:02:08.140> and

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
it a little more like party pacing and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.190 
it a little more like party pacing and
so<00:02:08.380> sweet<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:09.039> also<00:02:09.759> I'm<00:02:10.060> going<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.330> saute<00:02:11.080> up

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
I'm just not used to it I guess and it's
