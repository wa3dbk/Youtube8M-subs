00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
they made sure that they didn't come out

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.999 
they made sure that they didn't come out
of<00:01:29.189> her<00:01:29.369> any<00:01:29.520> other<00:01:29.729> any<00:01:30.090> other<00:01:30.930> flags<00:01:31.409> or<00:01:31.860> they

didn't come over any other side so yeah
so<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> reason<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.509> having<00:01:36.659> years<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
so the reason of having years because I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.210 
so the reason of having years because I
realized<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.829> didn't<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.009> any

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
realized that we didn't have any

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.649 
realized that we didn't have any
teammates<00:01:38.549> covering<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> right<00:01:39.060> flank<00:01:39.360> from
