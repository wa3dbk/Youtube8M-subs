00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.320
 truth is that they go towards a thousand coins not

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.600

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.860
 but I did not have much luck so little 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.790
 because the following about you know the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.370
 man who just downloaded now 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.810

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.050

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.620
 200 thousand more coins come on let's go 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.620

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.040
 this car but we talked lost coins 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.780
 ians that despite the statistics that 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.610
 it has and they are good but then it is that 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.190
 give me nothing has no strength no me 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.430
 convinces and good I hope that I have 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.990
 liked these envelopes of one hundred thousand coins 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.850
 that's how you already know how to leave like and 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.970
 more more for content of these that 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.290
 well we're just suffering, you know that 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.760
 I just usually open on it 's when there's 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.830
 about 50 thousand or one hundred thousand coins 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.360
 that are the only ones that I think that 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.040
 It's worth it because they're the only ones 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.840
 They assure you that something will come out 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.340
 sometimes you see that friends are not 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.410
 always but sometimes something comes out is not 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.960
 like the men of 7500 open open 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.030
 you will know open it is a thing that 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.220
 every 100,000 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.290
