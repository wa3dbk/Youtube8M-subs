 we would not attend 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.390
 it's really hard 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.990

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.750
 gaming experience that is way better than many know 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.830
 especially the half resolution because we did not know and all 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.690
