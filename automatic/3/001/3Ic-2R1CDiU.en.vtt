00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.319
 mister satisfied more for result per 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.540
 the performance of his 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.880
 but the result probably matters little 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.429
 for how we resumed the race for the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.179
 performance especially in the second 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.279
 phase when we changed structure 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.630
 in fact we did not expect the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.390
 their structure in fact they played 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.269
 with a one plus one between the lines, and then 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.210
 we suffered this though 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.510
 honestly even in the first half where 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.750
 we may not have been beautiful and we have 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.760
 exploited the amplitude as in the second 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.309
 time the two most notable occasions 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.090
 we had us with the miracle on 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.280
 baclet and the resounding cruciani ball 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.930
 they left a couple of times in 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.610
 counter-attack and one of these also 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.190
 fortunately they have us with a rebound 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.110
 done then runs second with great 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.090
 frankness they no longer existed 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.879
 they never got out of their way 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.059
 we always play through the game 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.369
 through the search for free man 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.909
 I think we deserved the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.979
 result regardless result not 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.350
 it was easy to recover against a team 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.700
 young and aggressive fresher than us 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.070
 we have so many men out 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.619
 condition important players who 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.049
 we have therefore recently taken them 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.140
 even taking advantage of the heat in 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.570
 probably in the first half they have us 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.460
 attacked us they didn't let us play 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.220
 those that ours is our typology 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.020
 of game that we second time 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.270
 varied we did one plus two 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.189
 in front we used a lot more 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.930
 the breadth we brought left handed who 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.759
 I think the added value of this 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.430
 team between the lines regardless of the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.009
 goal he has made is only his mind 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.899
 we have put in great difficulty not 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.090
 it was easy because buckler is in maybe e 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.439
 it never existed and therefore we have 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.829
 lost the cod when we already had it 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.840
 replaced partial then will go to a 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.039
 kid is therefore 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.740
 we have definitely recovered the race 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.200
 the performance satisfies me but there is 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.879
 still a lot of work and we'll do it with 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.619
 want with an application in 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.910
 an application as I told you the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.500
 Caserta work in progress 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.590
 even if in the first part of the game 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.480
 here before the goal of the advantage of 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.049
 baldassini was that chance of 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.970
 Baghlan 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.430
 that was sensational, in short, she was 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.319
 he could go ahead in one 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.180
 shooting has changed a bit of everything from Caserta 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.739
 He leaned his attack and he wanted 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.970
 win the league not until the end but 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.950
 we are a team that wants to win 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.349
 against anyone everywhere because we impose 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.810
 our game 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.579
 I repeat it is a period that we are not able to 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.730
 take advantage of the countless goal balls and 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.780
 that is, we had two balls 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.269
 impressive on 0 to 0 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.250
 they are broken down even when that 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.079
 maybe they deserved because they did 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.890
 the same played twice then 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.540
 congratulations 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.470
 on the spot they were lucky because 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.930
 there was a rebound though they were good 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.980
 then we revisited the race with so much 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.280
 experience I think 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.500
 after so many years there's that second one 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.410
 time I can vary several times 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.959
 structure to vary accommodation of 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.459
 game tactical tools and with the 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.560
 frankness that distinguishes me then 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.950
 there was more game never 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.730
 most existed they could no longer happen 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.940
 we were attacking their poor little ones 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.410
 they often looked for the long ball e 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.859
 sooner or later you take the goal 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.680
 because we were there left handed the best in 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:35.160
 field a eurogol on its part however in 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.900
 attack feel she approved varial is 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.569
 the first time he plays from the first 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.220
 minute however flanked buckley though 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.569
 neither of them worried more than 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.250
 so much the opposing goalkeeper 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.640
 but we in the last three games 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.610
 we would have made 15 16 goal balls 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.470
 I mean when you get advice 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.290
 often not in front of the door 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.630
 put it in, this worries me 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.250
 the fact that we put 27 balls in 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.110
 half we never attacked his own 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.720
 time we credit the cross and bach 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.480
 boiled by making goals already made a half 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.459
 miracle the goalkeeper that's what 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.380
 I'm more dissatisfied for 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.810
 what concerns the advanced department us 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.810
 baclet is not in condition then we have 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.070
 a kid 94 I never played 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.150
 because everyone says we are one 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.640
 team of phenomena 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.169
 we have declared and declared it 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.550
 once again we aim for the jump 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.230
 of category however because we have one 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.060
 good team but also the other singles 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.400
 teams at some point we have 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.919
 played just to make you understand with one 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.060
 that last year he played in francavilla 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.340
 interregional in front and another that 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.440
 played in the Beretti della Juve 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.840
 therefore two are not stabia, but not for the painting 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.460
 great players though we also say 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.540
 the truth because it seems that we are the 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.669
 manchester city 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.710
 we are a good team made up of 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.400
 good players from good men but not 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.060
 is that we have 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.060
 tevez and the east is in front
