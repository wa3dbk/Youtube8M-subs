bullet always goes in the head I don't

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.959 
bullet always goes in the head I don't
know<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:47.039> blessed<00:00:47.579> weapon

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969

for<00:00:48.239> me<00:00:48.390> even<00:00:49.110> though<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.829> know<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.090> range<00:00:51.600> is

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
for me even though you know the range is

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.689 
for me even though you know the range is
not<00:00:52.020> perfect<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> hand<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.010> not<00:00:53.190> perfect

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
not perfect and the hand is not perfect

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.790 
not perfect and the hand is not perfect
there<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.820> some<00:00:54.149> wind<00:00:54.449> drift<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> bullet

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
there is some wind drift in the bullet

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.040 
there is some wind drift in the bullet
to<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.190> head<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> target<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.750> it's

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
to the head of the target and it's

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.160 
to the head of the target and it's
really<00:00:58.500> amazing<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.210> I<00:01:00.210> think<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.719> really

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170

weapon like the Leupold mark 4 I can go

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.249 
weapon like the Leupold mark 4 I can go
up<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.560> 1<00:01:16.560> kilometer<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.610> 300<00:01:18.180> meters<00:01:18.540> which

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
up to 1 kilometer and 300 meters which

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.520 
up to 1 kilometer and 300 meters which
is<00:01:19.290> amazing<00:01:19.970> but<00:01:20.970> most<00:01:21.360> importantly<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.500> can

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
is amazing but most importantly you can

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.160 
is amazing but most importantly you can
find<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.310> red<00:01:23.759> tape<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.750> find<00:01:25.020> the

find the red tape or you can find the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.980 
find the red tape or you can find the
green<00:01:25.470> tape<00:01:25.710> five<00:01:26.130> round<00:01:26.460> magazine<00:01:27.000> during

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
green tape five round magazine during

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.469 
green tape five round magazine during
green<00:01:28.200> tape<00:01:28.439> improve<00:01:29.310> their<00:01:29.579> velocity<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
green tape improve their velocity of the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.420 
green tape improve their velocity of the
bullet<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> means<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.979> go<00:01:32.159> for

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
bullet so the means if you go for

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.760 
bullet so the means if you go for
long-range<00:01:33.150> sniping<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.110> bullet<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.560> be

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
long-range sniping the bullet will be

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.130 
long-range sniping the bullet will be
less<00:01:35.040> affected<00:01:35.670> by<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> wind<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> will<00:01:36.960> reach

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
less affected by the wind and will reach

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.249 
less affected by the wind and will reach
the<00:01:37.350> target<00:01:37.560> faster<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> comes<00:01:39.780> down<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the target faster when it comes down to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.210 
the target faster when it comes down to
over<00:01:41.220> 800<00:01:42.030> meters<00:01:42.420> shots<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.189> be

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
over 800 meters shots this can be

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.249 
over 800 meters shots this can be
crucial<00:01:44.670> because<00:01:45.000> by<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> time<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.110> shoot

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
crucial because by the time you shoot

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.469 
crucial because by the time you shoot
the<00:01:46.380> target<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.070> target<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.759> easily<00:01:48.299> move

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the target the target can easily move

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.080 
the target the target can easily move
one<00:01:49.140> second<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.189> enough<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.729> miss

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
one second can be enough for you to miss

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.359 
one second can be enough for you to miss
the<00:01:51.119> target<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> red<00:01:52.560> tape<00:01:52.740> ammunition

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the target and the red tape ammunition

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.670 
the target and the red tape ammunition
is<00:01:53.850> something<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.899> hit<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> target

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
is something that if you hit the target

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.160 
is something that if you hit the target
unless<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.159> hit<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.549> feeds<00:01:56.850> or<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.719> target

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
unless you hit the feeds or the target

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.679 
unless you hit the feeds or the target
most<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> time<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.430> one<00:01:59.969> shot<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.659> kill

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
most of the time is one shot one kill
