00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello i am some of tablet eee and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.270
 Today is best spring weather again 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.830
 in berlin and because you want to go out then 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.570
 Of course you can also take your music with you 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.219
 I have three bluetooth speakers 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.009
 here today for you compared to 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.960
 a jabra soul made in big or 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.710
 or middle then I have 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.650
 the dropbox that he knows right away 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.810
 middle version and tina brassel with 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.699
 mini speakers these two i want 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 Compare yourself today 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.669
 And at the end I'll just say something 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.500
 best price performance solution is what it is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.570
 here since the large difference therefore clear 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.030
 the size you have here 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.920
 very small and I just put them 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.550
 a little bit in a row 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.700
 then you just see it the best 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.050
 djs mac mini is a ticker than that 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.520
 champs but that really takes 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.160
 not much she is a bit wider 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.809
 as you can see but it is also the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.020
 shortest that means it's really here 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.890
 the most compact variant off to the 250th 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.440
 gram I would say 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.019
 this bond m box is already clear 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.700
 It is harder to realize that definitely and what 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.020
 you can see here are two 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.580
 Speakers are here are also two 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.909
 and in the middle I still believe 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.979
 a small subwoofer 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.009
 at least the magic and cem box sounds 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.049
 is pretty bulky of all 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.409
 but we will come to that soon 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.570
 the size so then here so in the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.180
 compare the so mini compared 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.759
 to the big one thus one sees clearly 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.729
 You can tell that definitely a weighty 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.579
 took 2 easy twice as hard as 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.640
 which thus mini and forth on the size 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.350
 If you pull it too, it's clear 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.409
 not so compact you can not do it 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.820
 just to put the suitcase so 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.210
 there is thus little halt significantly 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.310
 better otherwise from the buttons 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.750
 all three have this time here 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.420
 typical buttons once such a 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.850
 multifunctional button most of the time 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.310
 all the battery says louder quieter 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.229
 They also have everyone and on the sides 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.990
 There is a on and off switch received 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.380
 millimeter headphones or 1 1 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.160
 All the devices have that too 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.050
 here also as mp3-player attach 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.390
 and of course one too 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.510
 micro-usb connection to load the good 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.090
 so that's the one I have each 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.400
 bottom of the bottom one and a half 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.740
 millimeter cable cable integrates that 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.470
 is always there it is always down here 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.050
 and you can do so much easier 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.510
 device mp3 player or whatever 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.030
 connect without big in the bluetooth 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.400
 Attitudes are what we should be 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.720
 also ram we have nfc that means we 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.600
 You can easily use the smartphone 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.330
 rausholen with android is fine 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.460
 Turn on nfc and stop here and already 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.860
 is paired wrap music play goes 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.020
 so of course with the big one as well 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.330
 with the job and john bocks it works 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.780
 not so you have the setting 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.400
 go and there the device we koppe 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.010
 make a quick soundcheck I've got 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.500
 the sabers homemade mini one with my 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.190
 ldpd and the swords ten meters wide 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.170
 walk away 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.050
 turn up the music and I'm curious 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:17.570
 how much of it still arrives so could 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:20.450
 I race so we can hear it that is 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.070
 in any case, a lot and that distorted 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.950
 are the farc the connection is still there 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.550
 It's five meters man still get 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.550
 a lot with 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.090
 Now it's 50 percent you get 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.180
 not so much with but also fuller 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.560
 volume is really very urgent 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.560
 and that again 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.210
 at first, the saber increases with what 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.650
 the big variant is his and we 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.550
 also always go back five meters away 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.550
 and I 'm going to open a bit 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:04.190
 at once distance music from you hear it 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.250
 is clearly sata ssd would be smaller 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.050
 even say but the sound distorts me 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.540
 It just sounded like a musician 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.940
 that makes a lot more fun okay the last one 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.970
 in the league is the job boom box speaker 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.260
 and as you will soon hear 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.390
 Be sure from the beginning 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.460
 fuller and bulkier though he 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.850
 actually no subwoofer has like 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.440
 the yellow box and we just go 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:33.470
 five meters away and look 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.960
 how much you hear so again 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.980
 equal distance and that is full 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.660
 turned up you unfortunately do not hear that way anymore 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.770
 a lot so you really have the least 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.990
 it is the quietest speaker and that is 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.930
 a bit sad, but back there 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.070
 they all stand 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.620
 It's a pity, though 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.640
 it really is my opinion 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.640
 best sound 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.539
 so now we have the soundcheck coming 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.979
 We conclude these two bluetooth 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.780
 speaker what is my personal wife 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.949
 It does not look that easy 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.080
 to answer 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.550
 we have three or two here 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.830
 different sizes 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.380
 my personal favorite is i think 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.690
 times the orange box since one and a half 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.180
 use it just offers the 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.850
 but the best sound is far from it 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.000
 as long as the two for the 1000th 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.620
 Listen to the music on the dining table 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.160
 sharing on the track is not 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.380
 problem 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.530
 You will hardly hear them on the beach 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.729
 she's just too quiet for that 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.940
 the two are better for that 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:45.080
 suitable for home music super 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:48.410
 but not loud music but rather listen 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.060
 high quality is not more 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.520
 costs 120 euros and thus the 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.070
 most expensive options the next cheaper 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.860
 option here is the abra thus there is 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.669
 in different colors and costs 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.139
 90 euro 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:06.479
 she is the really loudest and best 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.530
 from the sound, she still has her own 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.080
 built-in subwoofer 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:14.370
 nevertheless the box a little bit hearty 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.919
 more voluminous the jabra, however, is for 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.250
 the outdoor use best suited you 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.979
 offers loud and good sound for 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.620
 parties on the beach eating is really good 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.870
 and you also hear five meters away 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.690
 away the music that's really nice 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:34.409
 The capsule with mini is the smallest 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.780
 version for traveling super so if you 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:38.759
 for example a lot of hard work she is really 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.000
 very well suited you can sometimes 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:44.070
 but take it has to be loud but 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.720
 qualitatively as you heard not like that 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.909
 high quality sound like the big one here 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.370
 costs 70 euros and so that the 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.740
 cheapest variant is also 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.720
 switzerland and spill-proof so 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.460
 Therefore, really good to the stand 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.280
 to take along is not a pity if 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.349
 she breaks down so to speak that is 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.630
 So really difficult to draw a conclusion 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:04.259
 What is really the best variant you are 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.900
 have seen 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.070
 different purposes and 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.900
 that's just the way it comes 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.740
 different recommendation to materialize 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.949
 point 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.740
 take to the beach and loud and good 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:19.110
 musicians for the home so that's 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.740
 actually the conclusion but said in the 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.870
 comments to 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.280
 what do you like best of these? 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.150
 be loud speakers that would be real 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.919
 interest 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.389
 if you liked the video there 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:28.889
 I thumb up and subscribe to the 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:32.060
 penner to forest to videos not miss 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:32.060
 I am one of telit
