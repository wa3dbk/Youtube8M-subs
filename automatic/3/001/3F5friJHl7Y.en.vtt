hi my name is Sam of a part engineer at
I<00:00:17.060> read<00:00:17.240> power<00:00:17.420> and<00:00:18.050> I'm<00:00:18.170> going<00:00:18.380> to<00:00:18.470> talk<00:00:18.619> to

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
I read power and I'm going to talk to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.280 
I read power and I'm going to talk to
you<00:00:18.860> about<00:00:18.950> the<00:00:19.280> new<00:00:19.430> our<00:00:19.760> power<00:00:20.180> revolt<00:00:20.570> when

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
you about the new our power revolt when

you about the new our power revolt when
designing<00:00:21.650> this<00:00:21.950> system<00:00:22.460> we<00:00:23.180> decided<00:00:23.630> to<00:00:23.750> veer

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
designing this system we decided to veer

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.370 
designing this system we decided to veer
away<00:00:24.590> from<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.220> traditional<00:00:26.080> giant<00:00:27.080> steel

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
away from the traditional giant steel

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.790 
away from the traditional giant steel

black clunky box that everyone has and
it's<00:00:31.250> been<00:00:31.400> around<00:00:31.610> for<00:00:31.880> such<00:00:32.000> a<00:00:32.029> long<00:00:32.210> time

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
it's been around for such a long time

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.240 
it's been around for such a long time
and<00:00:32.720> we<00:00:33.290> wanted<00:00:33.560> it<00:00:33.680> to<00:00:33.800> something<00:00:33.980> more

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
and we wanted it to something more

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.990 
and we wanted it to something more
unique<00:00:34.550> something<00:00:35.800> sleek<00:00:36.800> sexy<00:00:37.550> and

unique something sleek sexy and
aggressive<00:00:38.450> looking<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.470> we<00:00:39.680> took<00:00:39.829> all<00:00:40.010> those

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
aggressive looking and we took all those

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.240 
aggressive looking and we took all those
ideas<00:00:40.790> into<00:00:41.649> consideration<00:00:42.649> and<00:00:42.920> that's<00:00:43.100> how

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
ideas into consideration and that's how

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.729 
ideas into consideration and that's how
we<00:00:43.310> got<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.940> remote<00:00:44.090> so<00:00:44.840> here<00:00:45.140> we<00:00:45.170> have<00:00:45.320> the

12<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:06.329> should<00:03:07.329> say<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:07.840> is<00:03:07.989> actually

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
12 I should say that this is actually

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.050 
12 I should say that this is actually
not<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.590> first<00:03:08.799> time<00:03:08.950> we<00:03:09.099> cross<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.519> system

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
not the first time we cross the system

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.170 
not the first time we cross the system
on<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.239> ground<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:12.670> no<00:03:12.790> surprise<00:03:12.849> that

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
on the ground so it's no surprise that

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.030 
on the ground so it's no surprise that
the<00:03:13.450> side<00:03:13.629> panel<00:03:13.989> came<00:03:14.110> off<00:03:14.290> but<00:03:14.890> what's

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
the side panel came off but what's

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.250 
the side panel came off but what's
important<00:03:15.549> is<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.209> internal<00:03:16.450> components<00:03:16.689> and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
important is the internal components and

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.500 
important is the internal components and
making<00:03:17.590> sure<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.829> their<00:03:17.950> function<00:03:18.340> so<00:03:19.150> I'm

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
making sure that their function so I'm

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.460 
making sure that their function so I'm
going<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.720> try<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.870> put<00:03:20.079> this<00:03:20.140> back<00:03:20.349> together

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
going to try to put this back together

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:31.600 
going to try to put this back together
and<00:03:21.010> fire

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.360 

looks<00:03:32.270> like<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.540> works<00:03:32.690> there<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.800> have<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.010> I

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
looks like it works there you have it I

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
looks like it works there you have it I
have<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.730> powerful<00:03:35.260> breaking<00:03:36.260> snapper
