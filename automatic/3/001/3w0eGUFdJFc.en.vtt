 hello and welcome how to do double that says 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.710
 We're going to make an ice cream sandwich. 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.100
 very simple plasticine but it seems 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.340
 We really need a burglary in the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.240
 pasta knife pencil was the workshop 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.300
 brown plasticine white 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.580
 [Music] 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.099
 first let's split the plasticine 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.059
 nuts and bolts to have both 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.020
 the rock halves until it 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.119
 rectangle 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.119
 [Music] 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.360
 then we'll cut the edges of the zango 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.360
 do it 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.560
 I already go with the other half. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.560
 [Music] 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.210
 and now we have two sandwich halves 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.490
 and now we just have to do another side 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.119
 handle and limited white plasticine 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:21.080
 interpret the process has to stay 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:23.330
 same size as cookies is now 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:40.820
 round both look so many with their fingers 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:44.060
 and we gather everything and me and to finish 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:50.330
 Let's make holes in the wafer using 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:53.390
 pencil and is already frozen 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.580

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.340
