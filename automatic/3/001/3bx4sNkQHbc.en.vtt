00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.540
 easier more efficient comfortable 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.889
 sparkling and with many new ones 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.830
 equipped with assistant systems 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.309
 sixth generation of the 7 bmws to the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.010
 begin 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.890
 visually he looks sportier dynamic 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.150
 and fresher than the predecessor 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.600
 in fact , it is mainly due to the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.750
 use of carbon and aluminum 130 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.400
 kilograms less than its predecessor 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.910
 technical villa also sets new standards 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.730
 put 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.280
 The luxury liner takes the driver in one 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.129
 perfect luxury feel-good atmosphere 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.469
 leather wood and precious metals at times 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.570
 even driving it yourself and what else 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.579
 even the annoying sounds much better 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.649
 Park from two case examples and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.300
 Highway Assistant of up to 110 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.760
 kilometers of autonomous driving 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.370
 but also allows our remote 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.670
 control parking our world's first 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.250
 Offer of the autonomous box 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.500
 Under the hood, there are first 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.619
 a six-cylinder diesel member on 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.080
 Displacement and 265 ps power 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.430
 he should set standards in consumption 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.990
 and with 4.3 liters of diesel what could be done 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.479
 119 grams of co2 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.640
 who likes to purr petrol 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.780
 that can be between a six- or a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.909
 choose eight-cylinder 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.430
 the big v8 makes a hybrid 450 hp 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.260
 is already planned 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.670
 yes, we will be ours next year 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.010
 Introduce 740 each 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.650
 The vehicle will be about 40 kilometers 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.620
 have and will have electrical reach 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.300
 a consumption of 21 liters, say 49 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.770
 have gramme co2 and thus also one 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.770
 be benchmark in his class 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.260
 bmw promises that the new 7 will be like that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.330
 agile and easy to move like 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.280
 much smaller and lighter 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.860
 Models on the one hand helps with that 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.229
 weight savings to the other new 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.030
 techniques for the chassis and ours 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.009
 series chassis that already a 25 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.890
 trainer and variable damper control 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.470
 It does exactly that with this 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.450
 to handle light masses perfectly and 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.680
 then we can talk about x4 so ours 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.890
 klingenthal distraction or 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.190
 roll stabilization active drive where else 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.690
 time on it also being put to new 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.820
 here must show how it is in the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.130
 practice can actually handle the 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.430
 controlling certain functions 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.500
 by gesten a 3d sensor does it 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.940
 possible certain functions per 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.040
 to control hand movement 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.019
 you can use the gesture control 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.820
 certain selected number of 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.720
 functions are very intuitive 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.820
 serve 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.950
 including include in the example that 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.989
 you can accept or reject calls 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.470
 that you can adjust the volume by simple 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.870
 gesture can control and at the same time 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.220
 also a gesture freely assignable with 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.780
 Depositing functions that the customer 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.970
 there either the display for example 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.440
 turns off or his home address 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.360
 deposited or other simple 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.340
 functions 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.010
 The new 7 Series is manufactured in the BMW plant 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.519
