00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
think that's actually kind of

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.830 
think that's actually kind of
interesting<00:01:41.189> I'd<00:01:41.939> really<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> see<00:01:42.659> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
interesting I'd really like to see that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.330 
interesting I'd really like to see that

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.609 
I mean that offers a lot more
customization<00:01:45.329> when<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.020> comes<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.320> create<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
customization when it comes to create a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.960 
customization when it comes to create a

an ACR I would have killed that guy no

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.860 
an ACR I would have killed that guy no
problem<00:02:51.959> but<00:02:52.920> because<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.520> heavy<00:02:53.870> heavy

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
problem but because of the heavy heavy

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.440 
problem but because of the heavy heavy
gun<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.500> aim<00:02:56.070> down<00:02:56.100> your<00:02:56.489> site<00:02:56.730> faster<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
gun you aim down your site faster it

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.199 
gun you aim down your site faster it
pops<00:02:58.140> out<00:02:58.380> slower<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.580> think<00:02:59.850> you<00:02:59.970> knife

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
pops out slower and I think you knife

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.530 
pops out slower and I think you knife
slower<00:03:00.570> too<00:03:01.070> not<00:03:02.070> sure<00:03:02.250> about<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.459> one<00:03:02.730> but

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
slower too not sure about that one but

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.930 
slower too not sure about that one but
there's<00:03:04.020> so<00:03:04.290> many<00:03:04.500> things<00:03:04.620> holding<00:03:05.250> them<00:03:05.430> 60

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
there's so many things holding them 60

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.850 
there's so many things holding them 60
back<00:03:06.150> but<00:03:06.690> there<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.020> some<00:03:07.320> things<00:03:07.500> they<00:03:07.709> did

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
back but there are some things they did

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.400 
back but there are some things they did
right<00:03:08.070> in<00:03:08.130> this<00:03:08.340> game<00:03:08.580> one<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.720> when<00:03:10.020> you<00:03:10.170> lay

right in this game one is when you lay
down<00:03:10.440> on<00:03:11.000> your<00:03:12.000> drop<00:03:12.360> shot<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:13.519> practically

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
down on your drop shot you practically

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.560 
down on your drop shot you practically
have<00:03:14.640> no<00:03:15.030> recoil<00:03:15.660> or<00:03:16.310> or<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.370> know<00:03:17.640> moving

so<00:03:57.120> much<00:03:57.180> faster<00:03:57.450> with<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:58.100> better<00:03:59.100> mobility

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
so much faster with a better mobility

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.449

I'm not sure if an ACR can shoot through
everything<00:04:18.720> in<00:04:18.990> LMG<00:04:19.410> can<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:20.550> it's<00:04:20.820> just<00:04:21.150> like

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
everything in LMG can but it's just like

everything in LMG can but it's just like
an<00:04:21.680> LMG<00:04:22.680> should<00:04:22.890> just<00:04:23.070> tear<00:04:23.460> through<00:04:23.940> care

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
and stuff you know it should just be

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.130 
and stuff you know it should just be
ripping<00:04:32.100> through<00:04:32.280> everything<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:33.780> elms<00:04:34.020> you

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270

the video up to me if Black Ops 2
doesn't<00:04:55.580> successfully<00:04:56.810> put<00:04:57.810> in<00:04:57.990> LMGs<00:04:58.620> and

doesn't successfully put in LMGs and

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.580 
doesn't successfully put in LMGs and
make<00:04:59.790> them<00:05:00.060> a<00:05:00.240> really<00:05:00.630> good<00:05:00.750> weapon<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.200> think

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
make them a really good weapon I think
