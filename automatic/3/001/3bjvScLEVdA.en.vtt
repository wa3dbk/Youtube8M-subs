00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
interchange I got this boot top it's a

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.529 
interchange I got this boot top it's a
little<00:02:04.340> bit<00:02:04.490> like<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.640> crop<00:02:04.939> top<00:02:05.149> but<00:02:05.360> not

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
little bit like a crop top but not

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.660 
little bit like a crop top but not
exactly<00:02:06.049> a<00:02:06.289> little<00:02:06.560> bit<00:02:06.649> too<00:02:06.829> long<00:02:07.039> for<00:02:07.369> crop
