 Hi everyone, my name is Stefan 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.550
 agliata I am 41 years old I teach swimming e 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.039
 Fitness club from the Harbor 20 years 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.599
 sign also at school and I am an instructor 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.599
 of isof 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.900
 the first moment a man approaches 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.570
 child to the water element after the first 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.390
 then vaccination around 4 months 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.020
 the child can be taken to the pool 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.140
 in any swimming building and or 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 through a course through the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.100
 let's say the parents have the first one 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.379
 approach to water the first time 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.019
 a mom carries the baby in the water can 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.540
 start making him feel the element 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.210
 through the immersion of the feet and pian 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.090
 the whole body should be kept always keeping the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.760
 baby in front facing 6 in a manner 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.180
 such that the child associates the element 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.940
 water also to the parental figure who 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.210
 be it mum or dad and having anyway 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.110
 the comfort of a figure affectively 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.810
 near him 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.210
 as regards the instruments to be 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.479
 adopt for the first approach in water 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.150
 let's say that up to three years 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.630
 I would avoid contact with water that that 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.820
 include armrests, tubes or tablets 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.829
 because the child does not have le 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.140
 engine coordination to be able to 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.060
 however also manage the supports 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.250
 floating then contact with 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.890
 water always comes through the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.219
 contact with the parent who is in arm 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.920
 a child keeps the parent keeps it in 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.710
 feet or hold it supine iv to do 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.109
 some slips move it into the water 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.899
 etc. etc. and at three years instead 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:04.109
 you can begin to introduce supports 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.770
 float and teach let's say others 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:10.350
 movements that are a tad more 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.760
 independent as floating supports 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.270
 my advice is to use 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.070
 the armrests 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.590
 as they give the possibility to 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.780
 child to move the upper limbs 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.770
 the life jacket is a tad bit more 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.480
 constrictive from the point of view of 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.520
 of the use of the arms as the 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.110
 child to remain in fact harnessed 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.050
 under the armpits and is limited by 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.110
 instead regards breathing and 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.060
 the contact of the face with water is 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.610
 important at the beginning will bring the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.410
 child in a progressive manner 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.080
 teaching him to blow on the water ad 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.480
 place your mouth to make bubbles 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.010
 because in this way it will be easier 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.500
 forward learning the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.690
 breathing that is free style frog 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.160
 in such a way that the child comes into 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.700
 confidence with the breathing cycle 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:08.090
 in water the first style of the four 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.820
 note coded with which to start e 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.460
 the back the back simply because 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.250
 does not presuppose the teaching of 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.190
 breathing as the body of the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.260
 that child is supine belly up the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.740
 buoyancy is taught but not there 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.870
 where the big problem may be a 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.230
 limit of the immersion of the face in 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.230
 water
