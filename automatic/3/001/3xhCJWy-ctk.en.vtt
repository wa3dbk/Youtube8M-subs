00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.100
 and criticism has been moved for the channel 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.200
 this time from a restaurant house and 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.549
 well previously I had brought this 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.039
 so they're going to have to go see 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.380
 this video but in the next video 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.420
 You will find the links to download this 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.460
 mod practically without watching the video anything 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.919
 more would be links that will take them 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.140
 direct to the downloads and good the 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.079
 file is chopped and js install them and 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.020
 ready but good that's a house of 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.600
 fashion a redstone mold house but 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.309
 good this house as it works well this 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.079
 house has mechanism the king rest 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.789
 obviously it is better designed than 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.039
 previous that had already gone up but hey 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.180
 this house is only a house the link 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.340
 of download you will find in the description 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.960
 video will be the first one that will be and 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.000
 good as you see in this part we enter and 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.489
 in this part lights are pretty lights 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.859
 beautiful and good in this part we have what 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.390
 that would be our little room and we understand 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.920
 the lights are turned on one by one 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.800
 obviously it has a pretty mechanism 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.580
 good that I have put him for for this 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.310
 reason but good in the rest as they see 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.990
 late start and this house is 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.490
 designed nothing more for people who 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.790
 also want to do the revisions of 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.590
 mod 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.450
 I'm fine they have not done it and they say ok 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.870
 I want to do a review but not 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.030
 I have a house but well this is this 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.950
 coincidentally it is compatible with the rest 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.960
 not the mod that I have obviously the one 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.340
 cristian to the description of the video to 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.900
 that works to perfection 5 in 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.430
 this part will also have to look 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.590
 They tend gradually and as you can see is 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.540
 Pretty pretty the house is decorated 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.860
 be pretty decorated for you 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.530
 nothing else the only thing they do is the 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.030
 review and everything goes quite well and come 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.790
 in this part we turn off the lights 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.850
 they turn off obviously in that part we have 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.400
 in a little house that would be the lobby for 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.290
 say it so here are some things already 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.590
 that there are others in these parts we have 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.200
 some things and in that other one also but 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.720
 good to the case that we say we are of 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.030
 night does not look much and we paid for it 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.490
 light and I say we light them light 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.830
 automatically all and see it are 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.869
 pretty good and in that peace of a 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.600
 door disguisedly hidden 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.360
 As you can see , we crushed it here and it would open us 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.360
 the secret door and we would go out and in this 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.310
 part the voucher we are going to close in this 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.319
 part we would have our jacuzzi 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.770
 what would be pretty good we get 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.510
 to swim and wii to her mother box and the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.610
 it's really pretty this house 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.610
 I recommend it 100% and this part 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.140
 we have the bathroom is worth that in this part 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.150
 we understand the light and as they see they light 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.069
 the lights in this part is the lever 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.790
 so we can go to the bathroom and do 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.019
 little to say so and good at home 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.930
 it's a little bit simple 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.819
 I did not care much but there is a good 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.709
 pretty house in this part of the 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.900
 been putting mechanisms so that it 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.819
 it will close and the water will enter but I could not 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.880
 put it on I did not understand it well because still 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.220
 they do not dominate resonates one hundred percent 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.930
 and well, this house is quite 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.030
 beautiful today is ours for the part of 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.440
 up and good at the top is 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.720
 leave them without section so that you 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.720
 can see the mechanism that has this 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.000
 very tangled the truth but good in 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.430
 this part no longer in this is already the 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.050
 mechanism more better more stable and as 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.150
 they see the system without you big for 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.130
 you to do a review and 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.920
 it's pretty cool the truth the house 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.290
 I quite liked the bad thing is that I did not 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.450
 in a survival mode so that this one 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.310
 did in the house where I live which 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.270
 would come quite well and here if we put 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.500
 in arc mode how to say it we 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.730
 it would come quite well and in this part 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.440
 is what they would be 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.450
 the mechanism that has in this part 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.799
 is the water to fall and well that 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.080
 download link will find in the 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.819
 video description so you know 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.190
 that this can only raise you comment 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.870
 over last week say something 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.760
 perhaps it is requested they are supposed to have 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.200
 that would not pay but they are not 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.620
 descending and paying so we turn off 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.780
 we turn the lights off 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.670
 young woman turning off in a very 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.799
 elegant indeed and right now we're 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.810
 we are daytime we can still see 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.310
 more because we have recent windows 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.260
 windows to stick the pressure 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.380
 perfection sorry for my bad 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.970
 language spelling and good 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.530

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.510

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.949

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.710
