00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.470
 very good all this to the gamer and for 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.569
 come we are when you dispute in 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.460
 competitive multiplayer never play 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.019
 dispute the few times that the played is 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.240
 failed because I'm not very good at 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.190
 play against all these when with 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.500
 stage rocks or I would say in our 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.930
 against but it's a subscriber and here it is 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.940
 of guardians for the wind as you see their 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.510
 grimoire level already speaks for itself or 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.650
 it has two thousand 895 me that I have 2,680 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.870
 I think I have enough and that 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.760
 I do not focus on it either 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.020
 now I was going to show you your armor 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.279
 because it's really worth seeing 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.870
 because it's all the armor of the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.239
 iron standard that can carry the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.280
 titan also has felix lie 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.019
 güerita so good more than anything there will be 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.420
 to focus on not crossing over with this 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.100
 dude while we play dispute already 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.129
 I say I'm a manco and this can go 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.019
 very good or very bad or normal in short 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.019
 let's try to concentrate on very well 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.050
 so you see here all are titans - 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.580
 I'm another hunter there and there 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.950
 attachments 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.660
 I'm sure myth that this and the shotgun 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.519
 no and do not call me sow for using the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.990
 shotgun in all against all that yes 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.170
 that not for you everyone goes shotgun 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.600
 sure but there is street the hatreds not 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.750
 let's face the first 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.830
 Come on, save you lamented that there are 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.350
 or you have fallen your last word can not 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.619
 commit said 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.380
 let's go up there in front of dead to 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.299
 death a fault leaves them or is what has 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.409
 past is to be killed including one 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.460
 He has killed him and the other has burned 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.740
 ready 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.330

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.970

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.860

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.350
 there is nothing if you get in here is 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.300

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.130
 true has the worst connection of all the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.080
 heading and going first explains before 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.370
 well that goes for everyone that is 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.540
 complaint of their connection when they go 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.940
 losing and you see that it is not necessary 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.140
 have a connection 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:45.300
 to see to see there was here we have someone 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.120

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.890
 we have caught each other there is 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.890
 competition consists 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.470
 I do not know what to call it, call it chemistry and 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.110
 chemistry between us 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.540
 oh my god 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.760

 it was missing to be invisible and this one comes and 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.810
 it takes advantage I almost took it 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.190
 It's not good or I'm not going to tell you 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.269
 I do not expect to win the game because 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.129
 you always have to have facebook e 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.540
 try to give everything but it will be 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.340
 complicated yet I'll try 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.720
 distribute as much as you can as always 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.030
 by colt wings 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.030
 there we have someone who does not escape 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.319
 to shit I should not have fired 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.930
 likewise it does not give or I do not think it 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.629
 I have heard 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.780
 to see come here is the moment you know I'm 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.780
 here 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.130
 no no no 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.690
 as it is already christopher in ek I do not know why 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.510
 what did I think it was like a Russian name or 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.360
 something with having seen the letters 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.010
 in short, we carry half of what it takes 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.780
 the winner so let's concentrate 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.310
 heavy ammunition on the way that can 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.049
 change things before the whole world is going 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.049
 to be there has to yes 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.860

 I am and I love you uncle I love you uncle 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.019
 you could have shared it 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.549
 we could not have killed us uncle what 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.290
 I'm not talking to him I would have him 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.269
 to have said four fuck wanted 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.370
 use my my machine gun that could 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.780
 have changed things 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.130
 and now although I killed this one is not going to 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.239
 drop ammo because from the 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.239
 Sultan update 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.650
 aroused for me to get it charged 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.870
 or no no son of a bitch he knew he was going to 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.610
 return to his death is using the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.600
 machine gun that already used the how's 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.780
 called the holder hammer at level 300 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.400
 he knows it's good to have good is that 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.420
 anything of the iron standard 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.250
 it's good 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.690
 - the whip of tamerlán that did not finish me 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.160
 to convince is not that there is 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.190
 I tried a lot the floor that I do with my 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.140

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.600
 Concentrate wild Concentrate on truth 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.240
 this concentrate is trying to hate 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.910

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.530

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.390
 play concentrated but the people here 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.760
 who is playing here is good to see if 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.020
 with the super we are motivated a little and 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.840
 change things because I find myself 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.610
 all the time to this and rocks of o has 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.170
 something against me has a small radar 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.330
 that tells you where I am at all times 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.740
 come here was that christopher sends the 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.770
 low because he has committed suicide so of 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.400
 waits come let's try to trace a 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.440
 little at least be seconds 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.169
 the first place can be left this 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.139
 and why he is not a subscriber I give him a gift 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:35.169
 he left it he could get it but for 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.800
 that since the former often 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.800
 Let's see 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.590
 where are the people 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:54.840
 we have someone here also a fight 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:58.590
 there is the bastard waiting for the 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.760
 time transports you and that grenade does not 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.410
 has removed anyone from life explain me that 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.969
 I do not need a mirage I want 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.039
 know it 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:09.289
 to see God, it is already ready 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.279
 to finish the game this 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.279
 he got it 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.310
 where is 4 seal spent days 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:23.169
 disappeared oh my god no please 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.870
 oh my god how it catches you valley I do not know 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.730
 I expected 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.960
 it's been like one of those scenes in the 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.760
 that the new one jumps on top of the 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.410
 protagonist and almost it is loaded but not 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.060
 because somehow I had a 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.470
 knife and he has nailed it without believing or 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.940
 OMG 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.340
 that he has also loaded me without wanting 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.070
 the end this one is already about to finish the 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:46.720
 heading as we go to christopher going to 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:48.520

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.260
 I get super throw someone 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.550
 see if the frame of this today does not kill 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.330
 nobody is fine if he is going to kill someone 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.720
 and is that the second 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:01.070
 here is someone 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.870
 oh my god I do not know if he has put me 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.090
 like I got something out there 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.800
 my name appeared in a moment I 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.810
 load to the east and in a moment and at the end 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.610
 I appeared to see how he got me 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.390
 something but it 's removed fast we're going to 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:17.570
 see and not played that bad or is to follow 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.040
 killing more than he killed and this guy 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.560
 the ship has been removed so this website 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.810
 this is the flagship by the way 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.550
 to not clear we are not when to stand 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.960
 I am wrong in so yes it is but it 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.430
