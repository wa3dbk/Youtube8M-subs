00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
want to talk about whether or not it's

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:06.920 
want to talk about whether or not it's
safe<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.750> eat

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
safe to eat

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.890 
safe to eat
fish<00:00:07.440> caught<00:00:08.069> from<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.519> Pacific<00:00:09.120> Ocean<00:00:09.630> or

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
fish caught from the Pacific Ocean or

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.940 
fish caught from the Pacific Ocean or
not<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:12.750> know<00:00:12.840> tell<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.410> first<00:00:13.679> off

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
not and so you know tell you first off

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.900 
not and so you know tell you first off
that<00:00:14.490> my<00:00:15.179> first<00:00:15.690> assumption<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.830> yes<00:00:17.520> it

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
that my first assumption is that yes it

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.810 
that my first assumption is that yes it
is<00:00:18.300> safe<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> eat<00:00:19.260> fish<00:00:19.680> from<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> Pacific

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
is safe to eat fish from the Pacific

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.420 
is safe to eat fish from the Pacific
Ocean<00:00:21.230> especially<00:00:22.230> if<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.650> eat<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.070> smaller

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
Ocean especially if you eat the smaller

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.570 
Ocean especially if you eat the smaller
varieties<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.630> don't<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:25.109> mercury<00:00:25.920> in

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
varieties that don't have mercury in

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.279 
varieties that don't have mercury in
them<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:28.670> you<00:00:29.670> know<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.289> radiation

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
them and you know the the radiation

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.810 
them and you know the the radiation
concern<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.510> concern<00:00:33.590> but<00:00:34.590> because<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.520> so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
concern is a concern but because it's so

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.530 
concern is a concern but because it's so
far<00:00:36.210> away<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:37.079> don't<00:00:37.460> believe<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:39.239> as

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
far away I don't believe that it's as

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.200 
far away I don't believe that it's as
big<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.230> concern<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.309> lot<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.820> people

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
big of a concern as a lot of people

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.680 
big of a concern as a lot of people
think<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:44.120> I've<00:00:45.120> been<00:00:45.300> watching

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
think that it is and I've been watching

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.619 
think that it is and I've been watching
some<00:00:45.719> videos<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.770> YouTube<00:00:47.280> today<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
some videos on YouTube today and the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.900 
some videos on YouTube today and the
first<00:00:48.870> thing<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.350> strikes<00:00:49.770> me<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
first thing that strikes me with the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
first thing that strikes me with the
videos<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.690> people<00:00:52.140> telling<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.890> stay

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
videos of people telling you to stay

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.910 
videos of people telling you to stay
away<00:00:53.160> from<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.850> fish<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.960> those<00:00:55.620> people

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
away from the fish is that those people

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.119 
away from the fish is that those people
are<00:00:57.079> extremist<00:00:58.340> listen<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.489> their<00:00:59.670> voices

attitudes etc and it's what I've learned
about<00:01:08.700> people<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> far<00:01:10.409> left<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.340> people

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
about people on the far left and people

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.620 
about people on the far left and people
that<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:12.360> living<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.990> life<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.470> fear<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.630> that

there is legitimacy obviously it's a
nuclear<00:01:36.049> problem<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.380> nuclear<00:01:37.970> big

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
nuclear problem it's a nuclear big

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.679 
nuclear problem it's a nuclear big
disaster<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.110> know<00:01:40.250> but<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.610> very<00:01:41.970> far<00:01:42.360> away

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
disaster you know but it's very far away

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.730 
disaster you know but it's very far away
and<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:44.399> nuclear<00:01:44.790> radiation<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.600> being

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
and the nuclear radiation is being

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.160 
and the nuclear radiation is being
dispersed<00:01:46.740> over<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.189> huge<00:01:47.729> huge<00:01:48.360> area<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
world that were exposed to a lot more

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.569 
world that were exposed to a lot more
directly<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.869> lot<00:02:01.079> more<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:03.360> higher

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
directly and a lot more you know higher

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.650 
directly and a lot more you know higher
concentrations<00:02:05.869> daily<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.170> auto<00:02:08.660> accidents

concentrations daily and auto accidents

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.510 
concentrations daily and auto accidents
I<00:02:09.750> mean<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> chances<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.039> go<00:02:11.250> out<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
I mean the chances that you go out and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.040 
I mean the chances that you go out and
get<00:02:12.060> into<00:02:12.360> an<00:02:12.510> auto

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
get into an auto

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.970 
get into an auto
accident<00:02:13.620> today<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.430> mean<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.770> danger<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.950> that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
accident today I mean the danger of that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.870 
accident today I mean the danger of that
is<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.110> significantly<00:02:19.110> higher<00:02:19.590> than<00:02:20.010> eating

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
is so significantly higher than eating

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.910 
is so significantly higher than eating
fish<00:02:21.450> every<00:02:22.020> single<00:02:22.590> day<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:24.740> mean<00:02:25.740> the

fish every single day I mean the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.730 
fish every single day I mean the
radiation<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.030> get<00:02:27.540> from<00:02:27.990> going<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.590> an
