00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.960 

good<00:00:00.690> morning<00:00:01.020> guys<00:00:01.170> just<00:00:01.469> do<00:00:01.650> you<00:00:01.709> hear<00:00:01.970> been

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
good morning guys just do you hear been

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.760 
good morning guys just do you hear been
working<00:00:03.330> with<00:00:03.449> deaf<00:00:03.659> most<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.140> morning<00:00:04.500> we

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
working with deaf most the morning we

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.950 
working with deaf most the morning we
started<00:00:05.100> out<00:00:05.540> with<00:00:06.540> 200<00:00:07.350> ohms<00:00:07.529> off<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.220> pot

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
started out with 200 ohms off of the pot

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.390 
started out with 200 ohms off of the pot
and<00:00:09.960> we<00:00:10.110> hooked<00:00:10.320> everything<00:00:10.530> up<00:00:10.769> in<00:00:10.950> tesla

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
and we hooked everything up in tesla

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.799 
and we hooked everything up in tesla
mode<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.730> running<00:00:11.969> off<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.300> two

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
mode and running off of the two

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.279 
mode and running off of the two
batteries<00:00:13.290> 24<00:00:13.950> volt<00:00:14.190> mode<00:00:14.750> it's<00:00:15.750> at<00:00:15.990> twenty

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
batteries 24 volt mode it's at twenty

four<00:00:16.440> point<00:00:16.710> four<00:00:16.980> right<00:00:17.220> now<00:00:17.660> we've<00:00:18.660> worked

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
four point four right now we've worked

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.769 
four point four right now we've worked
our<00:00:19.050> way<00:00:19.080> down<00:00:19.289> all<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> way<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.550> 5<00:00:21.029> watt<00:00:21.240> one

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
our way down all the way to a 5 watt one

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.189 
our way down all the way to a 5 watt one
ohm<00:00:22.250> resistor<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:24.539> I'm<00:00:24.779> gonna<00:00:24.930> go<00:00:25.050> ahead<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
ohm resistor and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.570 
ohm resistor and I'm gonna go ahead and
fire<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.710> right<00:00:26.340> now

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
fire this up right now

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.189 
fire this up right now
I<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.090> went<00:00:27.300> ahead<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.510> filtered<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> water

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
I just went ahead and filtered the water

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.179 
I just went ahead and filtered the water
back<00:00:28.470> out<00:00:29.420> cell<00:00:30.420> voltage<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.050> reading<00:00:31.410> 2.4

watch<00:00:37.440> how<00:00:37.680> far<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.070> amp<00:00:38.280> meter<00:00:38.460> moves<00:00:41.239> it's

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
watch how far the amp meter moves it's

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.380 
watch how far the amp meter moves it's

it<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.250> little<00:02:09.520> earlier<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.539> couldn't

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
it a little earlier and you couldn't

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:31.550 
it a little earlier and you couldn't
even<00:02:10.869> see<00:02:11.170> this<00:02:11.320> see<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.950> cell

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:51.760 

that's<00:02:31.980> your<00:02:32.160> super<00:02:32.550> thick<00:02:32.790> through<00:02:33.000> there

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.580 

down<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.880> side<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.360> coin<00:02:53.540> cell<00:02:54.290> over<00:02:54.560> here

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
down the side of the coin cell over here

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:20.950 
down the side of the coin cell over here
and<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.880> little<00:02:56.150> there<00:02:56.330> SH<00:02:56.360> out<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.750> it

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.240 

just<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.830> porn<00:03:22.070> out<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.370> there<00:03:23.740> you<00:03:24.740> cannot<00:03:25.010> see

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
just a porn out of there you cannot see

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.290 
just a porn out of there you cannot see
you<00:03:25.370> down<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.800> first<00:03:27.800> two<00:03:27.980> plastic<00:03:28.300> bolts

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
you down to the first two plastic bolts

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.800 
you down to the first two plastic bolts
going<00:03:29.540> through<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.900> cell<00:03:30.110> at<00:03:30.230> all<00:03:34.570> yeah<00:03:35.570> it's

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
going through the cell at all yeah it's

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.690 
going through the cell at all yeah it's
just<00:03:36.580> 18.9<00:03:37.580> on<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.120> voltage<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:39.340> yeah<00:03:40.340> two

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
just 18.9 on the so voltage and yeah two

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.060 
just 18.9 on the so voltage and yeah two
batteries<00:03:41.120> down<00:03:41.330> there's<00:03:41.570> 24<00:03:42.170> point<00:03:42.470> one<00:03:42.740> so

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
batteries down there's 24 point one so

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.090 
batteries down there's 24 point one so
he<00:03:43.190> dropped<00:03:43.520> it<00:03:43.640> off<00:03:44.530> yeah<00:03:45.530> that's<00:03:45.830> what<00:03:45.980> we

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
he dropped it off yeah that's what we

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.130 
he dropped it off yeah that's what we
got<00:03:46.130> for<00:03:46.520> amp<00:03:46.730> draw<00:03:46.940> we're<00:03:47.450> just<00:03:47.630> barely<00:03:47.900> on

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
got for amp draw we're just barely on

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.210 
got for amp draw we're just barely on
the<00:03:48.760> right<00:03:49.760> side<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.420> zero<00:03:50.920> it's<00:03:51.920> as<00:03:52.070> far

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
the right side of the zero it's as far

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.160 
the right side of the zero it's as far
as<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.430> came<00:03:52.580> up<00:03:52.790> back<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.900> we<00:03:53.960> could<00:03:54.050> probably

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
as it came up back so we could probably

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.550 
as it came up back so we could probably
even<00:03:54.410> go<00:03:54.650> lower<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.160> resistance<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:57.260> again

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
even go lower in resistance and again

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.700 
even go lower in resistance and again
we're<00:03:57.740> at<00:03:57.920> three<00:03:58.580> point<00:03:58.880> three<00:03:59.090> four<00:03:59.630> five<00:04:00.350> at
