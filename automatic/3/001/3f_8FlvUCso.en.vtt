00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.900
 pattern I would normally flavor 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.730
 but I just wanted to upload it 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.280
 perfect always a very nice young team 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.750
 I like Aromas very much in Jordan 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.160
 can just play sentences with perse 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.020

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.550
 fifa in point more tests are screened 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.170
 busy after considering the last time 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.100
 Vault commentary sound and very sorry 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.480
 fixed 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.090
 if people kept wanting to see it 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.500
 from dasty sanskrit then i hear it 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.810
 well 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
 but what i wanted to talk about is the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.070
 video that I upload for 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.290
 losing the requirement of 500 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.780
 my time day technology 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.040
 500 likes yes it is absurd nature goes 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.410
 never succeed i don't have a thousand 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.140
 seven would be more when half 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.450
 of the people you may vote septem 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.660
 that person so crisis his way 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.660
 full 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.660
 or dagelijkshadee I do not think you 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.730
 send a ring because I was just yes 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.899
 I am already almost fifa in the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.789
 ceiling 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.829
 well on jos nuyts include the top 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.539
 coat with it and then you have mark 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.920
 but Marcus also a house under max 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.450
 best grimaud to upload inside 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.119
 The Netherlands 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.490
 and for the rest I have something like them 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.470
 really want me to upload there then 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.930
 so they themselves come to you you know as 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.299
 as if there are so many people who 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.700
 me doesn't really have that kind of thing that i looks 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.340
 that's where they have to go 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.530
 say daily shake because I think so 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.439
 I prefer that to this who daily 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.180
 has that they can't get through me 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.430
 then I own a hayloft not 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.530
 his taste is loose they ask me then 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.090
 apparently the taste of milan and that is 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.829
 apparently then and butts well of course 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.150
 if it is very positive 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.549
 so i don't think i have one 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.369
 guest role for do I prefer that 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.470
 that as people i encouraged by the way 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.570
 not another I'm going to say now as people 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.180
 itself one thought this access that person 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.700
 really gotta get there and 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.460
 is milan even has something like ok 9 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.259
 What can I do without a guest role? 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.790
 him hard to hema bottom I think 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.860
 that I just weighed it 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.810
 when you see how many people we go 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.270
 actually be there well then I think 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.220
 not that I would do my time 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.340
 so that's how this super darnay for 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.530
 a game channel 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.700
 no idea really no idea what I do before 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.110
 going on 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.459
 I see I see it all the know 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.010
 you i have the i am already busy enough 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.120
 now i got there yesterday is for yesterday 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.670
 so you 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.750
 Tuesday along Thursday what the fuck I am 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.160
 a bit hot days 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.200
 Thursday I received a letter from my 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.900
 education 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.730
 that I have a bass advice or five a pasta 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.170
 then connect 5 and study advice so that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.049
 means that I am not through my education 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.370
 we liked 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.069
 combination of things that don't make it 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.110
 can do body and nowhere else 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.420
 we are going to do similar studies 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.790
 not exactly the same but looks like 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.410
 it's a about school rotterdam 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.030
 it's a bit different again 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.069
 a pity of course it is for me 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.380
 third time in four years 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.420
 I've missed you and that is 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.590
 pretty annoying that people will 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.170
 understand that does not have to explain 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.610
 how annoying it is not being able to continue 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.890
 deal with what you are doing 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.110
 people understand it a bit 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.790
 ladies it features i let people 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.400
 a little better me because i don't want any 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.230
 party do what our pendrecht that pan 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.900
 video still had those demands close to 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.750
 we can dance about that differently 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.130
 I don't see myself doing it in the future 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.170
 he thought I would tell people now and then 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.750
 We kind of know how things work 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.430
 you know how that works with youtube how that 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.920
 is my school than people one 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.209
 kind of connections with you 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.769
 channel us there I do not know are 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.569
 be interested in 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.069
 but it makes people more 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.470
 understand the situation and the people 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.200
 will love how this is all for me 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.510
 works to plus hopefully bacteria that 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.160
 that and you now that 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.900
 and other than I hear it minute 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.560
 case about what protects you now 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.780
 o'clock 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.099
 I lost very very very much at 20 to 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.319
 their only chance to run the competition 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.060
 and labels flexible where I have to go 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.010
 a statement is unfortunate that none 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.440
 the siku to everything or so but i like it 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.910
 supervised kwak then says nothing in and 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.010
 so is a mich isle or as really unwise 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.540
 good typing 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.519
 sorry without having a good match here 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.019
 played against you find one though 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.579
 better seemed very exciting but that was it 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.630
 not to be more annoying that they twice 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.680
 scored 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.930
 for the rest went the privilege 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.940
 super good especially grass in your slit eyes 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.310
 had a really good match and 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.510
 before that a match against roda jc 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.219
 and I just come in as something of the will 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.359
 you know i just want my very well 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.310
 feeling the winter break in with a 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.630
 ample lead so that I am in the second 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.820
 seasonal half now and then 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.680
 like pointy replay but good here 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.210
 that's how a corner with lens scores me 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.860
 not play but certainly not ahead 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.630
 with a short score but it is real 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.030
 a good head up and managed to force 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.560
 if of course that would have been finished 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.420
 and then they chance such a very good one here 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.640
 merchants are malki a stranger to it 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.560
 must be tim so far next and correct 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.570
 Then yet sure what chance but first 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.490
 I still came on his lens really shot with 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.260
 precision and the rift match here 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.240
 caps a second goal with his 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.070
 second chance of the competition 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.410
 adopted very well shot 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.230
 turned and then into the corner in the goal 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.700
 shot and they stand the two zero and 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.290
 then patterns like me are still 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.690
 some chance irish or fledder gives the ball 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.100
 walk on and on to mochi now 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.990
 by and two defenders are and 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.300
 happy and saves teton in the one-on-one 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.700
 situation then you have a lens here and the 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.800
 balance caring with tired tired tired tired 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.000
 to you see yah you speak 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.080
 really become now 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.760
 narsingh is the ball here and I go 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.650
 of course for the sweating role with lens 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.570
 source it 's a hardest one 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.980
 so happy in where she had that 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.260
 people deer in this competition can 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.310
 grab them state 3 0 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.110
 and of course that is it 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.090
 end result naturally nice the one 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.250
 sheet I believe I now have six clean 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.450
 sheets in 12 matches still quite 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.680
 yummy 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.260
 since the squat gate i can just 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.640
 say which is still going tons desk 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.990
 he is already four points high this 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.970
 season icesave worth half a million 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.440
 quite a lot for the keeper 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.760
 but this episode is coming to an end 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.650
