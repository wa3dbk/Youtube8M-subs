00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.770
 our slogan for sport here in 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.740
 jungkerath is active in the Eifel begins 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.320
 with us I have the last 15 years 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.720
 with well over 10,000 motion analyzes 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.330
 found that complaints at the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.340
 Sports often occur not only from 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.989
 material are dependent but 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.640
 especially with runners very often with 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.830
 Malformation of the foot flaws 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.860
 The knee and leg axis with muscular 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.829
 imbalances with coordinative weaknesses 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.570
 or have to do with wrong training 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.100
 that was the reason who got the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.320
 athletes and athletes there too 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.610
 would like to help all that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.969
 goes beyond the material 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.469
 these motion analyzes in one 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.030
 needs to offer reasonable quality 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.860
 Of course, a certain technical 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.369
 we have our equipment here 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.030
 running lab with high quality cameras with 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.170
 a very professional treadmill with 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.940
 light and different cameras the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.160
 are coordinated at the beginning 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.759
 the analysis is always with us 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.940
 detailed analysis conversation that is 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.560
 the reasons the customers once reported 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.360
 about existing problems about 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.380
 complaints my recommendation always 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.509
 then when I'm in front of you 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.280
 big run the first marathon first 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.350
 just try a check-up 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.509
 to let go to look is to work with 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.180
 my chassis anything can in order 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.860
 I think big 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.009
 training load is on me 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.360
 the running style is okay so far is not 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.640
 Only the cardiovascular system is exercised 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.740
 but in principle all other parts 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.000
 of the body which is almost as important 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.679
 are also after the anamnesis 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.869
 Articular points and the pain region 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.310
 marked with felt-tip pen on the skin like that 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.319
 can we then afterwards the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.179
 body angles and deviations from the 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.380
 taken by sun so document through 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.799
 the synchronous representation of different 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.450
 We can record positions 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.280
 clarify where exactly is in 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.830
 Biomechanical drainage to problems 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.870
 Come and see us exactly what 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.580
 happens if the foot itself something 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.720
 happens in the middle of the stagnation phase or 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.700
 the imprint phase and which 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.590
 this has an impact on the rest 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.829
 body parts as part of our analysis 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.390
 we do barefoot with our probands 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.610
 recordings and 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.400
 Also recordings start with the current ones 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.810
 running shoes that is often very 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.730
 enlightening because many people are barefoot 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.740
 still a very healthy and effective 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.350
 running style then actually have 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.780
 often too much with the game 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.620
 dampen too much support downright 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.500
 is messed up and you last the shoe 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.480
 endes really as a co-cause of 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.790
 many complaints are knee-high 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.040
 may or expose back problems 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.260
 should the problems you have on 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.110
 muscular orlauf technical causes 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.790
 We can rely on the results 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.510
 then individual training plan 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.450
 create 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.870
 that can be in agility exercises in 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.019
 strengthening exercises in individual 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.300
 coordination exercises and of course 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.700
 Consist in their special running technique 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.380
 At the end of the analysis, they receive from us 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.450
 of course, a detailed analysis 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.360
 report with training plan on request 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.920
 also in a double version for 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.320
 Physiotherapist or doctor for her 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.420
 on the day you get from us 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.820
 another dvd with all the videos we have 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.260
 have created with during the analysis 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.239
 a special player program like that 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.250
 that's partly on your computer 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.850
 always play individually again 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.769
 an optimal running technique is the guarantee 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.680
 for a permanent complaint-free 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.409
 to run 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.209
 that's what it actually is 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.950
 most people want the least 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.010
 are high performance athletes 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.980
 almost all want to go through the beautiful hobby 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.079
 keep fit and stay healthy and that 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.379
 works ideally then if 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.420
 actually technology and that on technology 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.269
 and material technology that is in the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.189
 case shoes and equipment optimally on 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.189
 the own running style are turned off
