have<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:13.910> very<00:03:14.180> very<00:03:14.510> hard<00:03:14.750> schedule<00:03:14.989> if<00:03:15.170> we<00:03:15.290> do

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
have a very very hard schedule if we do

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.949 
have a very very hard schedule if we do
that<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:16.519> would<00:03:16.549> be<00:03:17.209> close<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.810> saying
