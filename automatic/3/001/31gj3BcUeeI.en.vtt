00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.130
 hi to all guide readers 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.230
 solitary in the titanic saprese here 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.720
 we have the new acer iconia with us 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.040
 elected the new tablet on which the story 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.560
 it is a history that 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.440
 atom processor ready for any crime 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.960
 music 17 yes santa 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.880
 the very interesting thing is not with 8 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.860
 21 inches more and from such one of the most 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.990
 small tables 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.510
 windows we can see precisely the 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.400
 device it treats like any 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.560
 acer tolotto device in the last 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.230
 years of a screen device 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.880
 capacitive but without digitizer 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.070
 active so it is not possible to use 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.590
 the pens on this device 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.480
 the screen is definitely small too 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.270
 if indeed still very usable 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.610
 because however the dimensions are of 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.739
 then about 20 centimeters of diagonal 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.750
 8 inches 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.460
 the material is very good 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.170
 however it is totally plastic that 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.729
 means a chance to reduce 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.630
 costs because this device that 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.970
 it costs just 329 basic but modern flights 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.640
 however, excellent quality plastic 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.890
 surely it is a device 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.200
 much better built than the 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.460
 v 500 wax that currently on the market 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.960
 with 10-inch screen point we see 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.410
 windows 8 and intel atom processor then 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.810
 a band device in inverted commas 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.120
 low in terms of performance but also 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.180
 of price but still sufficiently 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.450
 powerful to run windows 8 in the 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.799
 its full version 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.869
 first impressions of this 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.060
 device are definitely very good 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.430
 it is an extremely light device 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.930
 which jumps very well in your hand and 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.490
 technically it could also enter 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.049
 in the pocket of the jacket because anyway 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.200
 it is quite compact it is a 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.520
 atom processor 27 60 so it's the same 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.709
 processor that is on almost 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.989
 totality of low-end tablets 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.000
 currently on the market that guarantees 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.220
 good system responsiveness 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.209
 operating in what is right is not that 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.209
 friendly face 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.130
 novelty is very interesting about this 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.170
 device represents of the package 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.720
 that we can see office home and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.319
 student then word excel powerpoint e 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.720
 onenote in the 2000 version and trains are 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.140
 integrated for free within 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.140
 this device 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.790
 other very interesting features 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.040
 are the screen in 16 10 million sixteen 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.360
 this means a greater one 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:51.660
 usability in orientation in 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.520
 vertical orientation then 16 of the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.450
 seeds means that the screen is a bit 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.440
 wider and therefore better used 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.400
 raise applications because there is some 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.940
 more space than 16 us but 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.430
 however this is still well used 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.989
 of 1280 x 800 pixel resolution 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.400
 so it's not a high screen 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.800
 resolution 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.890
 but this is absolutely good 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.420
 if you can say why already one less one 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.830
 higher resolution would have ricetto 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.870
 too the stop interface 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.829
 with this resolution with these 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.590
 diagonal remains perfectly 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.660
 usable we do a quick 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.090
 we can see on the doors 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.400
 which has a micro hdmi port and one 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.430
 micro usb port so anyway from 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.780
 use with adapters is present not 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.360
 in this model but on others 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.840
 devices an entry for the sim then 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.450
 possibility to have connectivity 3g e 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.730
 a microsd slot to expand the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.959
 discourse in this case is a 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.660
 disk and mmc then to a low ssd 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.860
 performance available from 32 64 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.590
 gigabytes therefore in fact quite little 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.060
 roomy but always expandable on this 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.360
 side there are the slot 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.180
 single imitation 3.5 jack for 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.680
 the audio and the two speakers that are 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.140
 all placed in the back 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.959
 is a tablet designed somehow for 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.370
 be used vertically as yes 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.530
 can also notice from the presence of the 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.530
 button at the bottom 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.240
 this is the ceremony he had
