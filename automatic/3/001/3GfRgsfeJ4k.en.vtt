bring<00:02:34.730> any<00:02:35.120> different<00:02:35.540> sensibility<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.290> as

bring any different sensibility to it as

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.170 
bring any different sensibility to it as
a<00:02:36.590> queer<00:02:37.190> filmmaker<00:02:37.670> does<00:02:37.849> she<00:02:37.940> possibly

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
a queer filmmaker does she possibly

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.199 
a queer filmmaker does she possibly
understand<00:02:39.080> like<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.040> ostracization<00:02:40.610> of

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
understand like the ostracization of

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.050 
understand like the ostracization of
being<00:02:41.739> different<00:02:42.739> somehow<00:02:43.190> i<00:02:43.370> don't<00:02:43.849> know

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
being different somehow i don't know

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.449 
being different somehow i don't know
that<00:02:44.090> she<00:02:44.450> died<00:02:44.660> not<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.440> not<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:45.860> in<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.280> way

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
that she died not that not that in a way

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.800 
that she died not that not that in a way
that<00:02:46.489> really<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.000> think<00:02:47.060> manifests<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:47.750> the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
that really I think manifests in the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.509 
that really I think manifests in the
film<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.110> mean<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.319> think<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.860> the

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
film I mean I think that the the the

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.580 
film I mean I think that the the the
novel<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.269> De<00:02:50.450> Palma<00:02:50.780> version<00:02:51.140> very<00:02:51.290> much

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
novel and the De Palma version very much

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.680 
novel and the De Palma version very much
speak<00:02:52.069> to<00:02:52.280> queer<00:02:52.519> audiences<00:02:53.150> because<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.629> that

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
speak to queer audiences because of that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.350 
speak to queer audiences because of that
whole<00:02:53.870> notion<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.530> being<00:02:54.980> an<00:02:55.550> outsider<00:02:55.700> and

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
whole notion of being an outsider and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.630 
whole notion of being an outsider and
and<00:02:56.599> you<00:02:57.080> know<00:02:57.170> maybe<00:02:57.319> yeah<00:02:58.160> exact<00:02:58.459> being

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640

of us made that trip to the library but

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.340 
of us made that trip to the library but
you<00:03:10.640> know<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:11.150> wasn't<00:03:11.390> telekinesis<00:03:12.110> we<00:03:12.260> were

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
you know it wasn't telekinesis we were

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.010 
you know it wasn't telekinesis we were
looking<00:03:12.620> up<00:03:12.740> in<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.040> card<00:03:13.370> catalog<00:03:13.990> so<00:03:14.990> I

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
looking up in the card catalog so I

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.780 
looking up in the card catalog so I
think

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
think

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.100 
think
if<00:03:16.000> anything<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.390> think<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.689> existence<00:03:17.019> of

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
if anything I think the existence of

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.789 
if anything I think the existence of
this<00:03:17.230> movie<00:03:17.439> sort<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:18.510> cements<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:20.049> story<00:03:20.500> as

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
this movie sort of cements this story as

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.539 
this movie sort of cements this story as
this<00:03:21.400> kind<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.909> like<00:03:23.010> archetypal<00:03:24.010> mythos<00:03:24.519> that

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
this kind of like archetypal mythos that

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.069 
this kind of like archetypal mythos that
it<00:03:25.090> would<00:03:25.180> be<00:03:25.239> we're<00:03:25.329> just<00:03:25.450> gonna<00:03:25.540> tell<00:03:25.810> over

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
it would be we're just gonna tell over

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.030 
it would be we're just gonna tell over
and<00:03:26.170> over<00:03:26.319> again<00:03:26.409> it's<00:03:26.620> gonna<00:03:26.739> be<00:03:26.890> like<00:03:27.010> a

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
and over again it's gonna be like a

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.309 
and over again it's gonna be like a
Christmas<00:03:27.459> Carol<00:03:27.819> or<00:03:27.939> the<00:03:28.420> Passion<00:03:28.870> Play<00:03:29.019> I

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
Christmas Carol or the Passion Play I

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.630 
Christmas Carol or the Passion Play I
think<00:03:29.590> there's<00:03:29.739> going<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:29.890> be<00:03:29.950> more<00:03:30.159> versions

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
think there's going to be more versions

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.190 
think there's going to be more versions
of<00:03:30.790> Carrie<00:03:31.030> as<00:03:31.239> we<00:03:31.390> get<00:03:31.569> older<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:31.900> know<00:03:32.109> you

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
of Carrie as we get older and know you

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.300 
of Carrie as we get older and know you
know<00:03:32.290> within<00:03:32.439> our<00:03:32.530> lifetime<00:03:32.859> someone's<00:03:33.159> gonna

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
know within our lifetime someone's gonna

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.369 
know within our lifetime someone's gonna
do<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.549> again<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:33.970> think<00:03:34.239> because<00:03:34.629> the<00:03:35.109> Beat's

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
do it again I think because the Beat's

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.470 
do it again I think because the Beat's
we<00:03:35.709> know<00:03:35.890> every<00:03:36.280> single<00:03:36.609> one<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.939> them<00:03:37.150> we<00:03:37.299> know

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
we know every single one of them we know

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.750

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
so we know all the steps so I think it's

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.909 
so we know all the steps so I think it's
just<00:03:51.310> it's<00:03:51.519> become<00:03:51.939> this<00:03:52.120> sort<00:03:52.359> of<00:03:52.919> universal

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
just it's become this sort of universal

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.940 
just it's become this sort of universal
myth<00:03:54.250> that<00:03:54.819> said<00:03:55.209> this<00:03:55.510> movie<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.439> not

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
myth that said this movie is not

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.890 
myth that said this movie is not
different<00:03:57.879> enough<00:03:57.970> from<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.510> previous

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
different enough from the previous

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.099 
different enough from the previous
versions<00:03:59.319> to<00:03:59.530> really<00:03:59.909> pop<00:04:00.909> on<00:04:01.120> its<00:04:01.299> own<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.689> I

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
versions to really pop on its own and I

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.819 
versions to really pop on its own and I
so<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.319> don't<00:04:02.590> know<00:04:02.889> quite<00:04:03.280> why<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.519> exists<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:05.799> a

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
so I don't know quite why it exists to a

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.589 
so I don't know quite why it exists to a
whole<00:04:06.069> new<00:04:06.250> generation<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:07.450> that's

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
whole new generation and that's

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.420 
whole new generation and that's
necessarily<00:04:08.049> a<00:04:08.200> bad<00:04:08.260> thing<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:08.859> is<00:04:08.950> still<00:04:09.400> a

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
necessarily a bad thing it is still a

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.280 
necessarily a bad thing it is still a
harrowing<00:04:10.000> in<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.180> lot<00:04:10.329> of<00:04:10.359> ways<00:04:10.540> Bruin<00:04:10.959> when<00:04:11.200> it

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
harrowing in a lot of ways Bruin when it

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.869 
harrowing in a lot of ways Bruin when it
gets<00:04:11.439> right<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.220> first<00:04:12.430> one<00:04:12.549> got<00:04:12.700> right

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.060 
there's a sense of sort of almost
nihilistic<00:04:55.960> and<00:04:56.169> justice<00:04:56.560> in<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:56.740> original

crazy<00:05:46.840> religious<00:05:47.350> ecstasy<00:05:47.710> that<00:05:48.300> Piper

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
crazy religious ecstasy that Piper

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.850 
crazy religious ecstasy that Piper
Laurie<00:05:49.510> would<00:05:49.810> have<00:05:49.960> at<00:05:50.140> certain<00:05:50.440> points<00:05:50.770> it

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
Laurie would have at certain points it

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.030 
Laurie would have at certain points it
made<00:05:50.980> her<00:05:51.100> all<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:51.430> scarier<00:05:52.200> both<00:05:53.200> creepier

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
made her all the scarier both creepier

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.770 
made her all the scarier both creepier
in<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.370> original<00:05:54.760> but<00:05:55.120> perhaps<00:05:55.270> because

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
in the original but perhaps because

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.180 
in the original but perhaps because
there<00:05:55.960> was<00:05:56.080> novelty<00:05:56.500> to<00:05:56.680> it<00:05:56.800> then<00:05:56.950> like<00:05:57.070> if

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
there was novelty to it then like if

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.680 
there was novelty to it then like if
this<00:05:57.280> were<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.490> true<00:05:57.760> Harry<00:05:58.090> that<00:05:58.270> existed

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
this were the true Harry that existed

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.020 
this were the true Harry that existed
between<00:05:58.840> have<00:05:59.320> the<00:05:59.560> comparison<00:05:59.890> to<00:06:00.160> make<00:06:00.310> yeah

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
between have the comparison to make yeah

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.640 
between have the comparison to make yeah
I<00:06:01.210> think<00:06:01.270> they<00:06:01.540> would<00:06:01.990> seem<00:06:02.200> more<00:06:02.440> than

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
I think they would seem more than

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.770 
I think they would seem more than
sufficient<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.430> us<00:06:03.580> I<00:06:03.790> do<00:06:04.300> question<00:06:04.600> the

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
sufficient to us I do question the

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.120 
sufficient to us I do question the
casting<00:06:05.170> of<00:06:05.230> chloë<00:06:05.410> grace<00:06:05.530> moretz<00:06:06.010> though

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
casting of chloë grace moretz though

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.710 
casting of chloë grace moretz though
because<00:06:06.280> it's<00:06:06.850> really<00:06:07.060> hard<00:06:07.330> to<00:06:07.420> make<00:06:07.600> her

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
because it's really hard to make her

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.920 
because it's really hard to make her
look<00:06:07.870> dumpy<00:06:08.110> yes<00:06:09.390> although<00:06:10.390> I'll<00:06:10.540> say<00:06:10.570> after

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
look dumpy yes although I'll say after

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.530 
look dumpy yes although I'll say after
this<00:06:11.140> and<00:06:11.440> and<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:11.980> kick<00:06:12.550> ass<00:06:12.730> too<00:06:13.090> I<00:06:13.300> wish

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
this and and and kick ass too I wish

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.050 
this and and and kick ass too I wish
somebody<00:06:13.810> would<00:06:14.080> write<00:06:14.350> her<00:06:14.860> a<00:06:15.070> Heather's<00:06:15.820> or

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
somebody would write her a Heather's or

somebody would write her a Heather's or
Amin<00:06:16.390> girls<00:06:16.750> because<00:06:17.050> I<00:06:17.170> think<00:06:17.230> she's<00:06:17.770> dead

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
Amin girls because I think she's dead

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.190 
Amin girls because I think she's dead
she's<00:06:18.520> these<00:06:19.180> are<00:06:19.300> the<00:06:19.450> closest<00:06:19.900> she's<00:06:20.050> come

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
she's these are the closest she's come

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.420 
she's these are the closest she's come
to<00:06:20.230> kind<00:06:20.470> of<00:06:20.530> high<00:06:20.620> school<00:06:20.860> movies<00:06:21.190> at<00:06:21.310> this

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
to kind of high school movies at this

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.100 
to kind of high school movies at this
point<00:06:21.640> and<00:06:21.850> she<00:06:22.180> does<00:06:22.360> them<00:06:22.510> really<00:06:22.720> well<00:06:22.900> and

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
point and she does them really well and

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.750 
point and she does them really well and
I<00:06:23.200> think<00:06:23.410> it<00:06:23.470> would<00:06:23.590> be<00:06:23.650> fun<00:06:23.860> to<00:06:23.890> see<00:06:24.130> her<00:06:24.250> kind

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
I think it would be fun to see her kind

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.130 
I think it would be fun to see her kind
of<00:06:24.850> play<00:06:25.060> against<00:06:25.360> type<00:06:25.540> and<00:06:25.750> do<00:06:25.870> something

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
of play against type and do something

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.460 
of play against type and do something
with<00:06:26.230> that<00:06:26.550> I<00:06:27.550> will<00:06:28.180> say<00:06:28.390> that<00:06:28.570> the<00:06:28.690> other<00:06:28.840> kids

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
with that I will say that the other kids

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.100 
with that I will say that the other kids
