00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:34.469
 has been 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.819

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.569
 I do not like to be a basketball team 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:47.260

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.009
 the trustee juan arias 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.009
 As long as we stay like this for a while, we do not believe in the room 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.909
 and on the other hand this novel wheelock lately played very well 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.389
 a macabre is an assembly 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.119

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.759
 that explains 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:07.050
 I propose to myself 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.080
 I do not think that you are opposed because we are of the same person 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:12.669
 in agreement 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:13.979
 he mentioned 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:15.519
 President

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.379
 rare weird 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.619
 we crossed was left without president we eliminated another 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.299
 also the country and they did not know that the one that the sorianos lowered 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.449
 no no 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.099
 with them we must hurry to elect a new president before he returns to 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.099
 disappear one of us 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.679

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.849

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.889

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.889
 It is relative 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.829
 relative 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.829
