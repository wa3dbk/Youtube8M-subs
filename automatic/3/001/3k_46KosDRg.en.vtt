notice i will keep on my safety glasses
because<00:00:21.460> you<00:00:21.759> should<00:00:21.910> always<00:00:22.179> have<00:00:22.449> your<00:00:22.570> eyes

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
because you should always have your eyes

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.120 
because you should always have your eyes
protective<00:00:23.259> but<00:00:23.410> you<00:00:23.500> never<00:00:23.710> know<00:00:23.920> what's

protective but you never know what's

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.950 
protective but you never know what's
going<00:00:24.250> to<00:00:24.310> fly<00:00:24.519> so<00:00:25.300> let's<00:00:25.480> go<00:00:25.630> ahead<00:00:25.689> and<00:00:25.839> get

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
going to fly so let's go ahead and get

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.200 
going to fly so let's go ahead and get
started<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.699> i<00:00:27.970> am<00:00:28.660> going<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.140> take<00:00:29.410> my

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
started so i am going to take my

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.210 
started so i am going to take my
acquires<00:00:31.210> which<00:00:31.660> are<00:00:31.929> my<00:00:32.500> round<00:00:32.740> nose<00:00:32.830> pliers

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
acquires which are my round nose pliers

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.280 
acquires which are my round nose pliers
if<00:00:33.460> i<00:00:33.579> needed<00:00:33.880> to<00:00:34.090> make<00:00:34.210> just<00:00:34.510> one<00:00:34.750> jump<00:00:35.110> ring

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
if i needed to make just one jump ring

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.930 
if i needed to make just one jump ring
it<00:00:35.410> doesn't<00:00:35.710> matter<00:00:35.860> what<00:00:36.160> size<00:00:36.400> you're<00:00:36.760> just

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
it doesn't matter what size you're just

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.910 
it doesn't matter what size you're just
going<00:00:37.090> to<00:00:37.150> do<00:00:37.270> it<00:00:37.360> approximately<00:00:37.840> one<00:00:38.650> jump

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
going to do it approximately one jump

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.210 
going to do it approximately one jump
ring<00:00:39.130> or<00:00:40.030> maybe<00:00:40.210> two<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.530> I<00:00:41.560> have<00:00:41.830> some<00:00:42.010> brass

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
ring or maybe two so I have some brass

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.680 
ring or maybe two so I have some brass
here<00:00:42.430> that's<00:00:42.580> 18<00:00:42.970> gauge<00:00:43.180> which<00:00:43.360> is<00:00:43.480> a<00:00:43.510> good

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
here that's 18 gauge which is a good

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.540 
here that's 18 gauge which is a good
gauge<00:00:43.870> to<00:00:44.080> work<00:00:44.200> with<00:00:44.410> so<00:00:45.010> I'm<00:00:45.160> going<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:45.430> go

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
gauge to work with so I'm going to go

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.580 
gauge to work with so I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:45.580> and<00:00:45.910> take<00:00:46.030> my<00:00:46.240> wire<00:00:46.450> put<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:47.050> into<00:00:47.350> my

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
ahead and take my wire put it into my

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.130 
ahead and take my wire put it into my
pliers<00:00:47.860> and<00:00:48.280> just<00:00:48.310> keep<00:00:49.060> bending<00:00:49.360> around<00:00:49.780> till

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
pliers and just keep bending around till

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.780 
pliers and just keep bending around till
it<00:00:50.290> goes<00:00:50.560> around<00:00:50.800> a<00:00:51.100> few<00:00:51.280> times<00:00:53.730> now<00:00:54.730> the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
it goes around a few times now the

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.280 
it goes around a few times now the
benefit<00:00:55.240> of<00:00:55.270> this<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:55.570> that<00:00:55.720> I<00:00:55.870> can<00:00:56.080> do<00:00:56.170> it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
benefit of this is that I can do it

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.530 
benefit of this is that I can do it
pretty<00:00:56.470> quickly<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:57.460> drawback<00:00:57.700> is<00:00:58.090> that<00:00:58.120> none

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
pretty quickly the drawback is that none

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.700 
pretty quickly the drawback is that none
of<00:00:58.570> these<00:00:58.750> are<00:00:58.780> going<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:59.020> be<00:00:59.080> the<00:00:59.230> same<00:00:59.410> exact

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
of these are going to be the same exact

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.220 
of these are going to be the same exact
size<00:00:59.950> as<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.580> can<00:01:00.700> see<00:01:00.850> it's<00:01:01.000> all<00:01:01.120> tapered<00:01:01.510> so

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
size as you can see it's all tapered so

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.660 
size as you can see it's all tapered so
those<00:01:02.590> top<00:01:02.980> one<00:01:03.160> is<00:01:03.250> going<00:01:03.340> to<00:01:03.400> be<00:01:03.490> a<00:01:03.520> little

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
those top one is going to be a little

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.130 
those top one is going to be a little
bit<00:01:03.790> smaller<00:01:04.059> than<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.360> one<00:01:04.479> next<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:04.900> so

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
bit smaller than the one next to it so

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.890 
bit smaller than the one next to it so
although<00:01:05.619> it's<00:01:06.340> quick<00:01:06.549> it's<00:01:07.240> not<00:01:07.509> exactly

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
although it's quick it's not exactly

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.600 
although it's quick it's not exactly
efficient<00:01:08.350> for<00:01:08.470> everybody<00:01:08.800> being<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.400> same

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
efficient for everybody being the same

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.130 
efficient for everybody being the same
exact<00:01:09.880> size<00:01:10.090> but<00:01:10.360> that's<00:01:10.510> okay<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.990> nice

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
exact size but that's okay the nice

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.780 
exact size but that's okay the nice
thing<00:01:11.170> about<00:01:11.380> this<00:01:11.710> is<00:01:11.920> that<00:01:12.250> we<00:01:12.490> can<00:01:12.640> actually

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
thing about this is that we can actually

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.720 
thing about this is that we can actually
click<00:01:13.150> them<00:01:13.980> so<00:01:14.980> that<00:01:15.010> if<00:01:15.220> you<00:01:15.310> don't<00:01:15.520> have<00:01:15.700> a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
click them so that if you don't have a

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.520 
click them so that if you don't have a
saw<00:01:16.000> frame<00:01:16.240> handy<00:01:16.660> you<00:01:16.840> can<00:01:16.870> actually<00:01:17.290> just

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
saw frame handy you can actually just

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.570 
saw frame handy you can actually just
clip<00:01:17.950> this<00:01:18.190> so<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:18.970> can<00:01:19.060> clip<00:01:19.390> one<00:01:19.630> at<00:01:19.750> a<00:01:19.780> time

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.200 

so<00:01:26.150> you'll<00:01:26.300> see<00:01:26.540> I<00:01:27.280> was<00:01:28.280> able<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.580> clip<00:01:28.940> pretty

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
so you'll see I was able to clip pretty

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.900 
so you'll see I was able to clip pretty
quickly<00:01:29.480> I<00:01:29.810> will<00:01:29.900> clip<00:01:30.230> this<00:01:30.350> last<00:01:30.620> one<00:01:30.800> too<00:01:33.910> so

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
quickly I will clip this last one too so

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.460 
quickly I will clip this last one too so
I<00:01:34.970> did<00:01:35.240> three<00:01:35.480> jump<00:01:35.720> rings<00:01:35.900> really<00:01:36.050> quickly

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
I did three jump rings really quickly

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.140 
I did three jump rings really quickly
again<00:01:36.710> they're<00:01:36.980> not<00:01:37.100> all<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.280> same<00:01:37.400> size<00:01:37.790> and

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
again they're not all the same size and

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.120 
again they're not all the same size and
we'll<00:01:38.690> get<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.870> close-up<00:01:39.110> shot<00:01:39.470> later<00:01:39.680> on<00:01:39.860> that

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
we'll get a close-up shot later on that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.780 
we'll get a close-up shot later on that
you<00:01:40.160> can<00:01:40.310> see<00:01:40.730> the<00:01:41.060> drawback<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.660> this<00:01:41.840> is<00:01:42.790> that

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
you can see the drawback of this is that

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.150 
you can see the drawback of this is that
when<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:44.870> clip<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.440> actually<00:01:45.710> makes<00:01:46.040> a

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
when you clip it it actually makes a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.430 
when you clip it it actually makes a
little<00:01:46.310> divot<00:01:46.730> on<00:01:46.850> your<00:01:47.360> wire<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.050> when

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
little divot on your wire so that when

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.930 
little divot on your wire so that when
you<00:01:48.560> bend<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.950> back<00:01:49.070> together<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.730> have<00:01:49.850> it

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
you bend it back together to have it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.150 
you bend it back together to have it
closed<00:01:50.180> jump<00:01:50.450> ring<00:01:50.770> it's<00:01:51.770> going<00:01:51.980> to<00:01:52.040> have<00:01:52.130> a

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
closed jump ring it's going to have a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.070 
closed jump ring it's going to have a
little<00:01:52.280> divot<00:01:52.640> not<00:01:53.090> exactly<00:01:53.360> perfect<00:01:53.870> but<00:01:53.990> it

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
little divot not exactly perfect but it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.380 
little divot not exactly perfect but it
depends<00:01:54.320> on<00:01:54.530> what<00:01:55.040> project<00:01:55.460> you're<00:01:55.610> doing<00:01:55.640> so

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
depends on what project you're doing so

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.210 
depends on what project you're doing so
this<00:01:56.840> is<00:01:56.990> not<00:01:57.110> exactly<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.680> smartest<00:01:57.920> way<00:01:58.190> to

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
this is not exactly the smartest way to

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.620 
this is not exactly the smartest way to
do<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:58.580> but<00:01:58.700> if<00:01:58.760> you're<00:01:58.970> in<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.120> hurry<00:01:59.150> you<00:01:59.450> just

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
do it but if you're in a hurry you just

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.790 
do it but if you're in a hurry you just
need<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.840> make<00:01:59.930> a<00:01:59.990> jump<00:02:00.200> ring<00:02:00.350> really<00:02:00.530> quick

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
need to make a jump ring really quick

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.190 
need to make a jump ring really quick
this<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.250> really<00:02:01.370> efficient<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.690> if<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:03.050> need

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
this is really efficient so if you need

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.870 
this is really efficient so if you need
to<00:02:03.290> do<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> few<00:02:03.560> more<00:02:03.890> jump<00:02:04.190> rings<00:02:04.400> that<00:02:04.670> were

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
to do a few more jump rings that were

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.780 
to do a few more jump rings that were
all<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.479> same<00:02:05.510> size<00:02:05.930> i<00:02:06.410> would<00:02:07.250> recommend

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
all the same size i would recommend

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.520 
all the same size i would recommend
getting<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:08.060> mandrel<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.570> for<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:09.050> purpose

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
getting a mandrel and for this purpose

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.050 
getting a mandrel and for this purpose
i'd<00:02:09.830> grab<00:02:10.070> to<00:02:10.220> drill<00:02:10.429> bit<00:02:10.580> just<00:02:10.729> because<00:02:10.790> it

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
i'd grab to drill bit just because it

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.210 
i'd grab to drill bit just because it
was<00:02:11.090> handy<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:12.260> these<00:02:12.410> are<00:02:12.560> great<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.890> have<00:02:13.040> by

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
was handy and these are great to have by

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.470 
was handy and these are great to have by
the<00:02:13.280> way<00:02:13.370> because<00:02:13.610> joe<00:02:13.790> buds<00:02:13.940> come<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.180> every

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
the way because joe buds come in every

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.540 
the way because joe buds come in every
size<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:14.990> if<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.200> needed<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.530> weird<00:02:15.740> size<00:02:16.010> you

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
size so if you needed a weird size you

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.220 
size so if you needed a weird size you
have<00:02:16.610> drill<00:02:16.910> bits<00:02:17.090> laying<00:02:17.330> around<00:02:17.600> use<00:02:18.020> them

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
have drill bits laying around use them

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.199 
have drill bits laying around use them
so<00:02:18.890> we're<00:02:19.040> going<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.250> grab<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.610> drill<00:02:19.820> bit<00:02:20.000> and

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
so we're going to grab a drill bit and

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.240 
so we're going to grab a drill bit and
i'm<00:02:20.600> going<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.870> grab<00:02:20.959> my<00:02:21.320> Bernhard<00:02:21.770> pliers

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
i'm going to grab my Bernhard pliers

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.240 
i'm going to grab my Bernhard pliers
which<00:02:22.640> are<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.900> parallel<00:02:24.380> pliers<00:02:24.740> but<00:02:25.130> they

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
which are the parallel pliers but they

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.250 
which are the parallel pliers but they
have<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.430> little<00:02:25.670> edge<00:02:26.120> inside<00:02:26.750> there<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.080> little

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
have a little edge inside there a little

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.720 
have a little edge inside there a little
valley<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.830> you'll<00:02:28.010> see<00:02:28.250> with<00:02:28.459> serrated

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
valley that you'll see with serrated

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.570 
valley that you'll see with serrated
teeth<00:02:29.090> this<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:29.959> perfect<00:02:30.170> for<00:02:30.530> holding<00:02:30.739> on<00:02:31.160> to

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
teeth this is perfect for holding on to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.040 
teeth this is perfect for holding on to
your<00:02:31.670> drill<00:02:31.910> bit<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.570> just<00:02:32.600> slide

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
your drill bit so you can just slide

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.020 
your drill bit so you can just slide
your<00:02:33.080> drill<00:02:33.590> bit<00:02:33.769> right<00:02:34.190> into<00:02:34.459> that<00:02:34.760> Valley

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
your drill bit right into that Valley

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.420 
your drill bit right into that Valley
and<00:02:35.420> close<00:02:36.019> it<00:02:36.050> like<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.410> vise<00:02:36.650> grip<00:02:36.920> it'll<00:02:37.250> stay

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
and close it like a vise grip it'll stay

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.710 
and close it like a vise grip it'll stay
close<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:37.910> actually<00:02:38.030> don't<00:02:38.239> have<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.540> hold

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
close so I actually don't have to hold

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.080 
close so I actually don't have to hold
it<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.650> this<00:02:40.070> is<00:02:40.100> nice<00:02:40.430> because<00:02:40.610> it's<00:02:40.790> sturdy

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
it so this is nice because it's sturdy

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.030 
it so this is nice because it's sturdy
now<00:02:41.780> i'm<00:02:41.870> going<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.080> go<00:02:42.170> ahead<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.590> take<00:02:42.769> my

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
now i'm going to go ahead and take my

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.220 
now i'm going to go ahead and take my
wire<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.730> again<00:02:44.360> i'm<00:02:44.480> going<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.660> use<00:02:44.750> 18<00:02:45.080> gauge

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
wire and again i'm going to use 18 gauge

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.960 
wire and again i'm going to use 18 gauge
brass<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.860> i'm<00:02:46.040> going<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.280> open<00:02:46.310> up<00:02:46.700> this

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
brass and i'm going to open up this

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.590 
brass and i'm going to open up this
flyer<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.680> i<00:02:48.709> can<00:02:48.950> get<00:02:49.310> my<00:02:49.459> wire<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:50.090> there

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
flyer so that i can get my wire in there

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.050 
flyer so that i can get my wire in there
so<00:02:51.019> that<00:02:51.050> both<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.920> wire<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.700> drill<00:02:52.910> bit

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
so that both the wire and the drill bit

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.020 
so that both the wire and the drill bit
are<00:02:53.630> clamped<00:02:54.230> tightly

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.449 

so<00:02:58.540> once<00:02:58.810> they<00:02:58.959> are<00:02:58.990> actually<00:02:59.350> in<00:02:59.800> there<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.220> can

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
so once they are actually in there I can

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.920 
so once they are actually in there I can
go<00:03:00.610> ahead<00:03:00.730> whoops<00:03:02.160> malfunction<00:03:03.160> slightly

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
go ahead whoops malfunction slightly

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.880 
go ahead whoops malfunction slightly
might<00:03:04.930> take<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.110> little<00:03:05.260> bit<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.440> work<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.770> get

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
might take a little bit of work to get

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.580 
might take a little bit of work to get
your<00:03:06.100> wire<00:03:06.490> in<00:03:06.850> there<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.840> it's<00:03:08.200> happy

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
your wire in there so that it's happy

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.610 
your wire in there so that it's happy
and<00:03:08.800> really<00:03:09.670> secure<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:10.810> might<00:03:10.959> take<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.200> one

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
and really secure so I might take a one

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.170 
and really secure so I might take a one
or<00:03:11.709> two<00:03:11.830> times<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.190> get<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.340> in<00:03:12.520> there<00:03:12.670> but<00:03:13.030> once

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
or two times to get it in there but once

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.370 
or two times to get it in there but once
it's<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:13.480> there<00:03:13.510> i'm<00:03:13.720> going<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.930> go<00:03:14.080> ahead<00:03:14.110> and

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
it's in there i'm going to go ahead and

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.650 
it's in there i'm going to go ahead and
bend<00:03:14.800> my<00:03:15.130> wire<00:03:15.400> around<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.120> drill<00:03:16.390> bit<00:03:16.540> and

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
bend my wire around the drill bit and

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.660 
bend my wire around the drill bit and
you'll<00:03:17.200> see<00:03:17.350> if<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.560> keep<00:03:17.770> it<00:03:17.920> taut<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.459> works

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
you'll see if you keep it taut it works

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.260 
you'll see if you keep it taut it works
better<00:03:19.860> so<00:03:20.860> this<00:03:21.220> way<00:03:21.370> if<00:03:21.520> i<00:03:21.670> needed<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.090> make<00:03:22.239> a

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
better so this way if i needed to make a

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.640 
better so this way if i needed to make a
bunch<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.600> jump<00:03:22.810> rings<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.170> were<00:03:23.290> all<00:03:23.470> the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
bunch of jump rings that were all the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.559 
bunch of jump rings that were all the
same<00:03:23.680> size<00:03:24.069> this<00:03:24.730> is<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:24.910> really<00:03:25.180> quick<00:03:25.360> and

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
same size this is a really quick and

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.949 
same size this is a really quick and
efficient<00:03:26.020> way<00:03:26.110> to<00:03:26.140> do<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:27.630> i<00:03:28.630> still

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
efficient way to do so and i still

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.509 
efficient way to do so and i still
notice<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.440> brass<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.890> soft<00:03:30.130> enough<00:03:30.190> we

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
notice that the brass is soft enough we

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.610 
notice that the brass is soft enough we
can<00:03:30.640> do<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:30.880> with<00:03:31.060> my<00:03:31.090> own<00:03:31.209> fingers<00:03:31.720> it's<00:03:32.410> not

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
can do this with my own fingers it's not

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.660 
can do this with my own fingers it's not
a<00:03:32.680> big<00:03:32.890> deal<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:35.709> keep<00:03:35.980> going<00:03:36.310> until<00:03:36.489> you

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
a big deal so keep going until you

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.550 
a big deal so keep going until you
figure<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.300> got<00:03:37.480> enough<00:03:37.750> jump<00:03:37.930> rings<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.290> and

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
figure you got enough jump rings and and

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.810 
figure you got enough jump rings and and
try<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:38.890> make<00:03:39.040> more<00:03:39.310> than<00:03:39.340> what<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.640> actually

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
try to make more than what you actually

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.400 
try to make more than what you actually
need<00:03:40.209> because<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.690> know<00:03:40.780> sometimes<00:03:41.230> things

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
need because you know sometimes things

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.960 
need because you know sometimes things
happen<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.980> you<00:03:42.370> will<00:03:42.489> get<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:42.640> couple<00:03:42.880> of

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
happen and you will get a couple of

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.259 
happen and you will get a couple of
rejects<00:03:43.830> so<00:03:44.830> I've<00:03:45.190> taken<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:45.670> as<00:03:45.790> far<00:03:45.819> as<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.209> can

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
rejects so I've taken it as far as I can

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.820 
rejects so I've taken it as far as I can
go<00:03:46.510> so<00:03:46.720> I'm<00:03:46.840> going<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.019> go<00:03:47.170> ahead<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.350> open<00:03:47.560> up

already<00:04:10.150> prepared<00:04:10.690> with<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.350> saw<00:04:11.590> blade<00:04:11.620> i'm

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
already prepared with a saw blade i'm

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.490 
already prepared with a saw blade i'm
using<00:04:12.310> a<00:04:12.549> 40<00:04:12.790> saw<00:04:13.120> blade<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:14.079> i'm<00:04:14.200> going<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:14.380> go

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
blade so that it'll cut nicely now to

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.539 
blade so that it'll cut nicely now to
start<00:04:18.970> this<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.600> can<00:04:19.810> leave<00:04:20.079> your<00:04:20.470> wire<00:04:21.220> on

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
start this you can leave your wire on

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.150 
start this you can leave your wire on
the<00:04:22.000> drill<00:04:22.600> bit<00:04:22.720> itself<00:04:23.169> just<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:23.919> get<00:04:24.070> it

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
the drill bit itself just to get it

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.770 
the drill bit itself just to get it
started<00:04:24.190> so<00:04:24.940> i'm<00:04:25.150> going<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.330> go<00:04:25.419> ahead<00:04:25.510> and

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
started so i'm going to go ahead and

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.340 
started so i'm going to go ahead and
just<00:04:26.530> make<00:04:26.710> a<00:04:26.740> little<00:04:27.039> divot<00:04:28.080> just<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:29.169> get<00:04:29.289> it

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
just make a little divot just to get it

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.529 
just make a little divot just to get it
started<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:30.550> now<00:04:30.700> that<00:04:30.729> I've<00:04:30.970> got<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.210> started

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
started so now that I've got it started

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.400 
started so now that I've got it started
my<00:04:31.750> saw<00:04:31.960> frame<00:04:32.200> will<00:04:32.350> go<00:04:32.470> easily<00:04:32.800> through<00:04:33.729> this

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
my saw frame will go easily through this

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.080 
my saw frame will go easily through this
now<00:04:35.410> you<00:04:35.500> can<00:04:35.770> leave<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.370> drill<00:04:36.550> bit<00:04:36.669> in<00:04:36.820> if<00:04:36.970> it

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
now you can leave the drill bit in if it

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.520 
now you can leave the drill bit in if it
makes<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.390> easier<00:04:37.510> for<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:37.990> hold<00:04:38.229> on<00:04:38.380> to
