00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.490
 the crossover stormed the 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.020
 market for vehicles capable of transporting 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.590
 children and valley on the road of 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.990
 vacation 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.419
 but the followers of cars a little more 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.160
 low knowing best reconcile volume 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.660
 trunk and handling are still 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:46.460
 there and for them 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:47.830
 peugeot offers the 308 sw visually 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.790
 we're always dealing with a 308 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.650
 the aggressiveness contained in the traits 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.780
 therefore remains at the benefit of a pace 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.900
 more statutory and without paying into the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.900
 caricature 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.229
 fires slightly tapered and the 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.659
 chrome grille reinforces the rise in 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.549
 range wanted by the manufacturer the most 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.860
 It was therefore difficult to integrate the 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.140
 safe without denaturing the lotto line 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.880
 for this, peugeot designers have 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.590
 broken the often cubic facts of this 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.659
 kind of vehicle giving the illusion 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.880
 a profile sloping backwards 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.890
 thanks to a glass pattern more 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.600
 dynamic and a hatchback that has nothing to 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.600
 vertical and it works well 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.120
 in terms of rating the 308 sw is getting longer 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.370
 some 33 cm to the benefits well 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.730
 heard in the first place the trunk of which 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.770
 the capacity goes to 660 liters or 240 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.740
 liters of better than the sedan we ride 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.780
 even at 1775 liters folded bench 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.710
 allowing peugeot to exceed its 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.180
 favorite rival 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.830
 the golf volkswagen on board outside a 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.820
 little more space to the rear seats 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.470
 nothing changes 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.570
 the dashboard stays the same and 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.790
 embark with him the little steering wheel and 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.010
 raised meters some drivers 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:10.640
 complain about it but let's say it for us 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.810
 it's all good we 'll just criticize the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.980
 reaction time of the touch pad 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.980
 always too long 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.609
 all 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.390
 our model is equipped with a 2 liter 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.430
 diesel baptized blue h offense standard 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.860
 euro 6 this block of new generation 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.540
 bring Peugeot into a new era with 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.430
 always more efficiency for a 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.130
 consumption and emissions always 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.900
 smaller in terms of numbers the one 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.540
 it develops 150 horses and a couple 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.200
 maximum 270 better than put to 2000 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.260
 revolutions / minute 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.720
 it performs 0 to 100 in 8 versions and 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.720
 proposes a maximum speed of 210 km h 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.820
 consumption in mixed cycle is 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.680
 announced at 4 liters per 100 km as 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.900
 comparison of 2 liter tdi of the world 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.610
 dreamed of the Euro 5 standard offers 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.920
 equivalent performance for 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.540
 logically a depollution lower than 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.670
 driving this engine makes forget the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.260
 previous hd with a more conspiracy 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.590
 present and the key to recovery 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.590
 technical 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.710
 in addition peugeot benefits from the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.510
 marketing the 308 sw for 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.350
 launch on his catalog a new 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.400
 Automatic box 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.250
 the hac the 6 finally we say goodbye and to 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.200
 never to bmp6 despite its principle of 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.640
 converter operation one gets 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.080
 very clearly in terms of 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.370
 approval of a double box 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.470
 clutch type dsg 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.300
 in fact if we did not know before 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.500
 get behind the wheel would not detecting 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.550
 not to use 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.550
 the difference between the two 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.650
 in addition the rear gear suitable for 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.080
 support the loads humor profits 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.049
 the dynamism or even the sportiness of 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.790
 this 308 sw the direction rather well 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.920
 calibrated and not too much assistance 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.310
 artificial gives the smile behind 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.310
 the steering wheel 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.709
 definitely in this 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.430
 configuration of engines and 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.980
 transmissions 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.690
 we hold with this 308 one of the models 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.350
 the most pleasant to lead of his 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.310
 category
