the old film SLR loner camera that I

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.220 
the old film SLR loner camera that I
learned<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.460> shoot<00:03:15.490> on<00:03:15.820> back<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:16.210> college<00:03:16.480> back

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
learned to shoot on back in college back

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.630 
learned to shoot on back in college back
in<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.440> days<00:03:17.590> when<00:03:17.830> digital<00:03:18.040> cameras<00:03:18.489> were

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
in the days when digital cameras were

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.250 
in the days when digital cameras were
still<00:03:18.910> pretty<00:03:19.120> crappy<00:03:19.600> and<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.930> megapixel

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
still pretty crappy and a megapixel

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.080 
still pretty crappy and a megapixel
would<00:03:20.770> cost<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.220> black<00:03:21.580> mark<00:03:21.850> at<00:03:22.000> the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
would cost you a black mark at the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.840 
would cost you a black mark at the
kidney<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:23.380> will<00:03:23.560> focus<00:03:23.830> nice<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.430> close<00:03:24.610> so

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
kidney it will focus nice and close so

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.220 
kidney it will focus nice and close so
your<00:03:25.000> depth<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.360> field<00:03:25.420> can<00:03:25.660> get<00:03:26.050> too

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
your depth of field can get too
