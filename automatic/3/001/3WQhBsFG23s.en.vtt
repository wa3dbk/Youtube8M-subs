00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.780
 to put on 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.820
 [Music] 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.860
 and I bring you here a video tutorial 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.410
 of how to enter any page that 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.380
 is blocked either at the university 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.990
 institute colleges or even in your 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:31.240
 work good in many places explain 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.010
 that you have to download I do not know what 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.500
 global proxy servers 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.170
 we need to download programs neither 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.390
 nothing simply I will explain in 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.980
 three forms is valid if one does not work 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.739
 program the other one and if the 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.480
 other then it appears the other one is worth as well some 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.880
 only some computers work so 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.100
 well it works in the whole class of all 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.560
 the windows classes windows either 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.230
 windows xp windows 7 windows seen in 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.320
 I guess well and good what 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.080
 we would have to do would be to write 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.880
 http on the people of p normal but not 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.680
 We put two points will work as 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.229
 always do not do not do not put it on 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.530
 http s2 points 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.470
 for example ww 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.020
 next to facebook for example facebook 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.440
 that would be a page that would be 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.409
 blocked either in a public place of 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.229
 learning and that 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.479
 Well, as you can see, I do not have the page 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.020
 blocked but it is assumed that if the 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.320
 was blocked would have charged but 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.420
 good 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.690
 if that does not work, you can try another 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.570
 what would this be in windows xp appears 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.030
 here run worth here we can put 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.729
 pull cmd we put the rudder cmd 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.550
 us this in windows xp us 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.920
 you speak and execute we write cmd and 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.110
 us and this is worth once in the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.640
 determined term as you want to call 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:04.790
 cmd we write 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:07.030
 space the page www.facebook.com 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.240
 the people 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.280
 and we're waiting for him to load all this 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.610
 all this and we have to copy this 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.610
 number 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.709
 31.3 that number 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.770
 we will copy this number and 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.450
 we will copy here 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.450
 and then I would not leave the facebook 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.440
 I'm going to use the video once with the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.180
 code with the number copied we 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.550
 let's use the same but good what 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.440
 we copy people 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.130
 as you can see is the facebook if it were 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.510
 blocked, it would also come out 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.700
 but good if you do not want to know 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.120
 facebook we ping and we put another 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.120
 page 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:00.280
 and that would be another way would also have 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.720
 another way that would be the windows xp equal 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.900
 we're going to team in windows xp it 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.700
 call my pc computer to hard drive disk 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:13.140
 local windows this same the xp we search 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.530
 system 32 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.960
 there are 32 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:23.300
 we look for drivers and we look for etc 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.730
 and in host we will open with 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.490
 we will open it with the notebook or 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.190
 with a word processor whether the 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.840
 of notes metapÃ¡n 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.840
 the word for you already know all that 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.070
 we are going to open 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.070
 other programs 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.770
 here once here we get to all these 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.880
 numbers 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.410
 it is valid if the page is blocked 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.520
 down here we would leave I do not know that I do not know 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:59.030
 how much this space number www of the 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.040
 page that was blocked because if 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.960
 come out here that was blocked the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.330
 page the page that we would like 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.670
 unlock we eliminate it worth 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.230
 example if it is put would be put this 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.990
 number not to you maybe it comes out 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.580
 another but good more or less to a number 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.760
 similar 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.060
 santi to this number space www point and 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.299
 the page would not go for example 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.400
 facebook.com 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.380
 that means that it would be blocked not 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.380
 for us to unlock what 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.940
 we have to do is go here cross it out 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.280
 and save 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.110
 we save it and it's already 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.730
 the page would already be unlocked 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.700
 we reload with f5 and it would be 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.990
 unlocked 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:47.510
 I remind you that I do not take charge 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.249
 I am responsible for the misuse of 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.050
 good use of this one 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:54.000
 of this 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.669
 of this good trick is not a trick either 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.390
 it's just information from this 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.030
 information 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.169
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.080
 help them 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.229
 and the next video is going to be a menu 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.720
 4 as you know every two or three videos 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:15.330
 is a menu of 44 for ps3 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.310
 and well this has been all I hope that you 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.310
 have liked and until next time
