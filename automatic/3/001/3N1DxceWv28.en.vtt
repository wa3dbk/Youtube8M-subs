00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
first thing I want to talk about is the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.140 
first thing I want to talk about is the
shark<00:01:03.989> cage<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.769> opening<00:01:05.280> sequence<00:01:05.729> here

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
shark cage in the opening sequence here

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.870 
shark cage in the opening sequence here
you'll<00:01:06.869> note<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.619> drops<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.280> little<00:01:08.640> tiny

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
you'll note that it drops a little tiny

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.200 
you'll note that it drops a little tiny
bit<00:01:09.000> every<00:01:09.570> time<00:01:09.810> hip<00:01:10.680> pulls<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.460> rope<00:01:11.640> which

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
bit every time hip pulls the rope which

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.750 
bit every time hip pulls the rope which
I<00:01:12.390> thought<00:01:12.570> was<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> really<00:01:13.110> neat<00:01:13.290> effect<00:01:13.830> it's

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
I thought was a really neat effect it's

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.010 
I thought was a really neat effect it's
something<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.360> might<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.780> notice

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
something that you might not notice

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
something that you might not notice
straight<00:01:16.740> out<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.520> there's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.150> subtle<00:01:18.420> little

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
straight out but there's a subtle little

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.749 
straight out but there's a subtle little
thing<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.799> there<00:01:20.009> where<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
thing right there where it just kind of

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.940 
thing right there where it just kind of
shakes<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.390> bit<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.530> subtle<00:01:22.740> little

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
shakes a little bit it's a subtle little

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.230 
shakes a little bit it's a subtle little
thing<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> think<00:01:23.549> added<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
thing that I think added to the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.240 
thing that I think added to the
animation<00:01:24.780> you'll<00:01:25.290> note<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> spent<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.130> whole

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
animation you'll note I spent a whole

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
animation you'll note I spent a whole
lot<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> time<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.330> any<00:01:27.659> time<00:01:28.020> on

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
lot of time on that and not any time on

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.200 
lot of time on that and not any time on
moving<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> characters<00:01:29.310> around<00:01:29.490> because

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
moving the characters around because

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.440 
moving the characters around because
they<00:01:30.420> barely<00:01:30.720> move<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.229> all<00:01:31.700> also<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.939> rope<00:01:33.180> in

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
they barely move at all also the rope in

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.450 
they barely move at all also the rope in
the<00:01:33.509> corner<00:01:34.079> there<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.470> also<00:01:34.950> spent<00:01:35.369> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the corner there I also spent a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.890 
the corner there I also spent a
tremendous<00:01:35.610> amount<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.240> time<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.720> would

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
tremendous amount of time on you would

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.359 
tremendous amount of time on you would
not<00:01:37.049> think<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.770> making<00:01:38.759> rope<00:01:39.210> would<00:01:40.369> exactly

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
not think that making rope would exactly

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.359 
not think that making rope would exactly
be<00:01:41.520> sure<00:01:42.240> difficult<00:01:42.750> i<00:01:42.930> guess<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.829> i<00:01:43.890> wanted

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
be sure difficult i guess but i wanted

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.399 
be sure difficult i guess but i wanted
to<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.790> lined<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.210> perfectly<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.750> with

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
to get it lined up perfectly and with

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.190 
to get it lined up perfectly and with
the<00:01:46.560> whole<00:01:46.740> animation<00:01:47.399> as<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.450> pulling<00:01:48.899> at<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the whole animation as is pulling at it

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200 
the whole animation as is pulling at it
it<00:01:49.649> was<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.040> nightmare<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.970> i<00:01:51.030> eventually

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
it was just a nightmare but i eventually

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.209 
it was just a nightmare but i eventually
got<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.460> on<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.759> plan<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.509> scabs<00:01:55.219> originally
