00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.630
 call of duty black ops on the map la 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.880
 domination and that the sniper dsr then there 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.180
 on this gameplay I have a made a big 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.119
 carnage with this slide and again I have not 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.349
 talked about this carnage or my chain 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.449
 youtube on this video but in any case 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.629
 it will be a pretty special video where I 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.250
 will talk about them lobbies anyway 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.900
 firstly I 'll do a little quiz 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.730
 at dawn there will be mw2 black ops in 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.520
 a double v3 black golf ops beach 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.840
 boys and gta 5 stays that there really 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.500
 all the games all the games you 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.350
 can have 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.539
 there are bad ones on it and tell you 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.120
 our paid tickets on that between 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.879
 interface and up to three stars spend 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.350
 to say that frankly when I was 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.850
 newburgh and that I'm telling you that it's 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.829
 free his ranks lathus starts off that one 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.680
 have big youtuber I will not say the 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.840
 name but they charge over ten 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.149
 stars spend even maximum 15 starpass 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.410
 you say that's scammed so there 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.910
 it's a lobby that really does not cost 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.459
 dear and i would say on mw2 good buddy is going 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.920
 you make the no be all the collar and 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:24.349
 prestige max that means basically that 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.450
 cost a star goes on a w 2 and on 

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:29.810
 black ops will be the god mode and the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.259
 maxent prestige of the school this 6th the bi 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 will cost of starpass and on mw3 it will be 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.440
 also the god mode and we stick it goes 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.149
 cost too two stars spend on 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.530
 black hawk of this will be two stars go 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.330
 with LCol simply no god mode 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.740
 risk of smar shackle if you 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.390
 put the godman good after that you from 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.000
 choose me I do not advise the taste of 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.690
 mode on black ops 2 sure i'm 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.280
 kid you will have one there will be a number of 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.810
 stars pass that will be increased will pass 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.810
 three tapas instead of two stars 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.540
 pass to the interfaces because when 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.550
 a colossus who just went out so he 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.580
 there are really risks of banishment 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.319
 so there is a lobby that is special anti 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.360
 banishment for that 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.510
 the ticket costs 1 starpass more 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.630
 you will have lawn the collar is in extension 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.489
 this level max so I do not know I think 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.000
 that it will be a precise maximum five 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.340
 max levels and I could really 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.720
 have fun without being banished worry 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.069
 no there is no risk of 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.459
 banishment on gathering that it's for 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:38.420
 that a star goes on and up and on gta 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:42.350
 5 then the guest at 50 miles interface 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.860
 for the for the money to settle these 21 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.250
 millions and interfaces for the level 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.410
 that you want roughly between unnamed 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.269
 I would say you choose the level 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.549
 between zero friends if you want 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.320
 level is willing goudji this ultra movie 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.610
 level 10 if you thousand levels you 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.420
 upgrade 1000 and it costs when 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.519
 same interface 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.230
 so if you want both of these two 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.680
 stars go on so you will have the money 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.150
 the higher the level and there is no risk 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.340
 of banishment I want to forget about them 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.920
 do I not banished again then so much 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.690
 better and I do not advise you I 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.090
 do not advise to say yeah guys 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.530
 it's risky no no no under gta has 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.170
 never risked to make a hobby does the 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.299
 they will not ban you and I want to 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.650
 to say take care of yourself in the 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.350
 destruction I will put all the prices and 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.350
