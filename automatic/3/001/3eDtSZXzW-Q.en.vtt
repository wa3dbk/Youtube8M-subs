00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
you want to plug it up so I'm going to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.620 
you want to plug it up so I'm going to
kind<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.590> start<00:01:31.979> out<00:01:32.369> further<00:01:33.030> than<00:01:33.180> what<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
kind of start out further than what it

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.480 
kind of start out further than what it
shows<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.299> take<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.490> you're

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
shows and you just take it and you're

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.109 
shows and you just take it and you're
going<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> tape<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.390> base<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.259> your

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
going to tape it to the base of your

going to tape it to the base of your
Lots

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.550 

and<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.609> just<00:01:49.820> keep<00:01:50.090> turning<00:01:50.420> taking<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.140> turn

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
and you just keep turning taking it turn

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.200 
and you just keep turning taking it turn
it<00:01:51.859> and<00:01:52.670> taping<00:01:53.539> it<00:01:53.840> or<00:01:54.049> glue<00:01:54.799> in<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.280> hot<00:01:55.909> glue

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
it and taping it or glue in it hot glue

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.899 
it and taping it or glue in it hot glue
gun<00:01:56.689> works<00:01:56.990> better<00:01:57.500> because<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.310> can<00:01:58.520> keep<00:01:58.700> it

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
gun works better because you can keep it

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.919 
gun works better because you can keep it
forever

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.020 

and<00:02:02.929> you<00:02:03.079> just<00:02:03.319> keep<00:02:03.560> taking<00:02:04.159> it<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.490> turning

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
and you just keep taking it and turning

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.410 
and you just keep taking it and turning
it<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:07.729> taping<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.660> or<00:02:08.869> gluing<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:10.420> all

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
it and taping it or gluing it and all

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.940 
it and taping it or gluing it and all
the<00:02:11.989> way<00:02:12.019> around<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.780> tighter<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.709> do

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
the way around the tighter that you do

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:30.760 
the way around the tighter that you do
it<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.630> better<00:02:20.630> it<00:02:20.959> looks<00:02:21.260> later<00:02:22.220> on

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.950 

and<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.460> just<00:02:31.670> keep<00:02:31.910> doing<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.660> until<00:02:33.020> it<00:02:33.980> is

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
and you just keep doing this until it is

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.010 
and you just keep doing this until it is
completed<00:02:35.960> with<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.380> lights<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:41.090> think<00:02:41.780> I'm

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
completed with the lights I think I'm

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.170 
completed with the lights I think I'm
going<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:45.310> stop<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.640> video<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:48.040> start

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
going to stop this video and start

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.840 
going to stop this video and start
number<00:02:50.180> three<00:02:50.480> but<00:02:51.440> I'm<00:02:51.890> going<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.520> go<00:02:52.700> ahead

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
number three but I'm going to go ahead

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.060 
number three but I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:53.150> finish<00:02:53.390> putting<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.050> lights<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.590> before

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
and finish putting the lights on before

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.340 
and finish putting the lights on before
I<00:02:55.100> start<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.000> next<00:02:56.030> step<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.690> is<00:02:59.930> video

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
I start the next step so this is video

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.010 
I start the next step so this is video
