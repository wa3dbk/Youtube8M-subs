00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.320 
protective I think if you stood on this
things<00:00:27.269> inside<00:00:27.660> would<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:28.019> pretty<00:00:28.230> safe<00:00:29.330> let's

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
things inside would be pretty safe let's

go<00:00:30.480> over<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> good<00:00:30.929> points<00:00:31.320> first<00:00:31.650> these

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
go over the good points first these

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.630 
go over the good points first these
locks<00:00:32.340> are<00:00:32.790> really<00:00:33.149> good<00:00:33.329> quality<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.640> I've

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
locks are really good quality and I've

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
had no problems with them I don't even

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.020

anymore I think it was one of those
things<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.850> what's<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> point<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.329> locking

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
things that what's the point of locking

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.479 
things that what's the point of locking
this<00:00:42.780> thing<00:00:43.050> when<00:00:43.320> someone<00:00:44.040> could<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.250> walk

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.730 
notice like what the inside looks like
crap<00:01:11.220> because<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:12.420> covered<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.350> sheet

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
crap because it's covered with a sheet

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.560 
crap because it's covered with a sheet
of<00:01:14.420> one<00:01:15.420> sided<00:01:15.720> soft<00:01:16.259> velcro<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.100> right

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
of one sided soft velcro like this right

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.050 
of one sided soft velcro like this right
and<00:01:18.570> let's<00:01:19.530> say<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.250> your<00:01:20.460> pedal<00:01:20.850> on

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
and let's say you have got your pedal on

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.940 
and let's say you have got your pedal on
the<00:01:21.119> board<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:23.460> take<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> off<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:25.680> sheet

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
the board as you take it off the sheet

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.670 
the board as you take it off the sheet
that<00:01:26.100> was<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.400> there<00:01:26.610> rips<00:01:27.119> out<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> velcro

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
that was in there rips out so the velcro

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
that was in there rips out so the velcro
that<00:01:28.979> comes<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.460> these<00:01:29.610> things<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.240> useless

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that comes with these things is useless

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.740 
that comes with these things is useless
now<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.610> thing<00:01:32.880> set<00:01:33.119> me<00:01:33.240> back<00:01:33.270> maybe

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
that's fine but I'll show you the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.470 
that's fine but I'll show you the
biggest<00:02:14.129> problem<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.879> with<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.209> right

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
biggest problem I have with this right

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.070 
biggest problem I have with this right
let's<00:02:16.379> put<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.739> in

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
let's put that in

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.950 
let's put that in
so<00:02:19.080> we've<00:02:19.200> got<00:02:19.700> two<00:02:20.700> pedals<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.210> fine

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
so we've got two pedals in fine

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.390 
so we've got two pedals in fine
Luther<00:02:22.620> closes<00:02:23.300> no<00:02:24.300> worries<00:02:24.720> at<00:02:24.840> all<00:02:25.220> now<00:02:26.220> what

if<00:02:26.520> you're<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> wire<00:02:27.060> player<00:02:27.450> no<00:02:28.290> one<00:02:28.470> shows<00:02:28.980> you

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
if you're a wire player no one shows you

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.830 
if you're a wire player no one shows you
this<00:02:30.320> doesn't<00:02:31.320> fit<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:33.180> might<00:02:33.360> say<00:02:33.540> all<00:02:33.690> right

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
this doesn't fit you might say all right

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.930 
this doesn't fit you might say all right
well<00:02:34.140> maybe<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.470> can<00:02:34.770> turn<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.400> wire<00:02:35.580> pedal

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
well maybe I can turn the wire pedal

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.720 
well maybe I can turn the wire pedal
this<00:02:36.090> way<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.500> you've<00:02:37.620> got<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.160> know<00:02:38.250> that

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
this way so you've got it you know that

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.400 
this way so you've got it you know that
way<00:02:38.880> when<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.180> use<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.600> one<00:02:39.840> other<00:02:40.020> pedal

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
way when you use it and one other pedal

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.170 
way when you use it and one other pedal
you<00:02:41.310> know<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.550> might<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.790> kind<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.030> cool

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
you know that might be kind of cool

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.660 
you know that might be kind of cool
except<00:02:42.570> for<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:45.330> doesn't<00:02:45.600> close<00:02:46.670> can't

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
except for it doesn't close can't

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.360 
except for it doesn't close can't
actually<00:02:48.030> shut<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.560> unit<00:02:49.560> with<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:49.770> standard

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
actually shut the unit with a standard

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.449 
actually shut the unit with a standard
wire<00:02:50.550> pedal<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.030> there<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:53.100> kind<00:02:53.370> of

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
wire pedal in there so that kind of

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.930 
wire pedal in there so that kind of
sucks<00:02:54.380> what<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.440> ended<00:02:55.740> up<00:02:55.860> doing<00:02:56.070> recently<00:02:56.550> was

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
sucks what I ended up doing recently was

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.470 
sucks what I ended up doing recently was
taking<00:02:57.330> off<00:02:57.450> all<00:02:57.750> my<00:02:58.650> velcro<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.970> all<00:03:00.150> my

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
taking off all my velcro to all my

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.410 
taking off all my velcro to all my
pedals<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.050> -<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.220> painting<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.030> thumbs<00:03:03.270> I

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
pedals and - the painting the thumbs I

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.660 
pedals and - the painting the thumbs I
had<00:03:03.540> for<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.780> few<00:03:03.990> days<00:03:04.680> afterwards<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.459> was<00:03:05.640> a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
had for a few days afterwards it was a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.820 
had for a few days afterwards it was a
good<00:03:05.910> idea<00:03:06.270> just<00:03:07.140> like<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.320> said<00:03:07.410> if<00:03:07.680> you've

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
good idea just like I said if you've

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.770 
good idea just like I said if you've
only<00:03:07.920> got<00:03:08.100> two<00:03:08.459> pedals<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.030> plan<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.480> just

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
only got two pedals and you plan on just

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.060 
only got two pedals and you plan on just
using<00:03:10.140> those<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.760> good<00:03:12.000> option<00:03:13.070> any

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
using those this is a good option any

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.270 
using those this is a good option any
more<00:03:14.430> than<00:03:14.610> two<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.410> you'll<00:03:16.410> find<00:03:16.740> that<00:03:16.980> it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
more than two and you'll find that it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.380 
more than two and you'll find that it
really<00:03:17.310> starts<00:03:17.880> getting<00:03:18.030> crowded<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.880> you

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
really starts getting crowded and you

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.540 
really starts getting crowded and you
know<00:03:22.080> you<00:03:22.140> could<00:03:22.320> probably<00:03:22.440> probably<00:03:23.370> get

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
know you could probably probably get

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.330 
know you could probably probably get
away<00:03:23.670> with<00:03:23.820> three<00:03:24.330> but<00:03:24.900> you'll<00:03:25.050> find<00:03:25.410> on<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
away with three but you'll find on the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.479 
away with three but you'll find on the
sides<00:03:26.840> these<00:03:27.840> rails<00:03:28.200> are<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.470> little<00:03:28.709> high<00:03:28.950> so

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
sides these rails are a little high so

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.699 
sides these rails are a little high so
putting<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:30.000> jacking<00:03:30.840> can<00:03:31.019> be<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.140> pain<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.650> you

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
putting a jacking can be a pain so you

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.690 
putting a jacking can be a pain so you
have<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.010> adjust<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.630> distance<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:34.190> how<00:03:35.190> close

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
have to adjust the distance of how close

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.340 
have to adjust the distance of how close
to<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.910> edges<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.420> can<00:03:36.570> have<00:03:36.750> these<00:03:36.959> as<00:03:37.170> well

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
to the edges you can have these as well

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.460 
to the edges you can have these as well
so<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.310> think<00:03:38.430> three<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.209> about<00:03:39.450> as<00:03:39.690> maximum<00:03:40.230> as

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
so I think three is about as maximum as

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.820 
so I think three is about as maximum as
you<00:03:40.530> can

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
you can

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.360 
you can
realistically<00:03:41.550> put<00:03:41.880> in<00:03:42.680> but<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.860> problem<00:03:44.220> I

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
realistically put in but the problem I

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.250 
realistically put in but the problem I
have<00:03:44.519> with<00:03:44.640> these<00:03:44.850> like<00:03:45.300> I<00:03:45.420> said<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
have with these like I said is that the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.770 
have with these like I said is that the
velcro<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.920> comes<00:03:47.160> with<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.970> sheet<00:03:48.540> that

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
velcro that comes with this sheet that

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.270 
velcro that comes with this sheet that
they<00:03:48.900> put<00:03:49.170> on<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.590> garbage<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.720> yeah<00:03:51.720> so

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
they put on is garbage and yeah so

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.910 
they put on is garbage and yeah so
that's<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.400> CMV<00:03:53.760> hard<00:03:54.120> case<00:03:54.360> in<00:03:54.660> reality<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.350> know

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
that's a CMV hard case in reality I know

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.410 
that's a CMV hard case in reality I know
a<00:03:55.950> few<00:03:56.160> shops<00:03:56.489> have<00:03:56.640> got<00:03:56.790> their<00:03:56.970> Mo's<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.269> these

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
a few shops have got their Mo's of these

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.710 
a few shops have got their Mo's of these
and<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:59.160> know<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.519> don't<00:04:00.000> have<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.239> problem<00:04:00.600> with

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
and you know I don't have a problem with

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.650 
and you know I don't have a problem with
Chinese<00:04:01.140> stuff<00:04:01.890> generally<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.790> don't<00:04:03.180> mind<00:04:03.510> it

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
Chinese stuff generally I don't mind it

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.199 
Chinese stuff generally I don't mind it
if<00:04:03.840> it's<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.230> good<00:04:04.410> quality<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:05.010> this<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.060> one

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
if it's a good quality but this is one

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.210 
if it's a good quality but this is one
of<00:04:06.239> those<00:04:06.390> units<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:07.170> really<00:04:07.500> serves<00:04:07.890> no

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
of those units that really serves no

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.390 
of those units that really serves no
purpose<00:04:08.430> or<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:09.299> only<00:04:09.810> purpose<00:04:10.110> it<00:04:10.230> serves<00:04:10.440> is

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
purpose or the only purpose it serves is

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.229 
purpose or the only purpose it serves is
to<00:04:11.820> pedals<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.650> standard<00:04:13.650> pedals<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.850> keep

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
to pedals and standard pedals so keep

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.150 
to pedals and standard pedals so keep
that<00:04:15.360> in<00:04:15.420> mind<00:04:15.540> if<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.870> do<00:04:15.989> buy<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:16.200> if<00:04:16.890> you

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
that in mind if you do buy this if you

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.320 
that in mind if you do buy this if you
have<00:04:17.940> anything<00:04:18.209> as<00:04:18.419> high<00:04:18.600> as<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.100> wire<00:04:20.100> pedal<00:04:20.459> in

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
have anything as high as a wire pedal in

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.780 
have anything as high as a wire pedal in
height<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.900> some<00:04:22.770> pedals<00:04:23.130> are<00:04:23.310> quite<00:04:23.550> big

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
height and some pedals are quite big

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.390 
height and some pedals are quite big
then<00:04:24.540> it's<00:04:24.690> not<00:04:24.810> going<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.080> fit<00:04:25.289> so<00:04:25.950> keep<00:04:26.280> that

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
then it's not going to fit so keep that

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.370

sin<00:04:39.719> be<00:04:39.960> good<00:04:40.650> for<00:04:40.919> beginners<00:04:42.139> not<00:04:43.139> really

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
sin be good for beginners not really

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.929 
sin be good for beginners not really
good<00:04:43.740> for<00:04:43.979> people<00:04:44.159> that<00:04:44.460> want<00:04:44.849> to

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
good for people that want to

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.969 
good for people that want to
consistently<00:04:45.449> change<00:04:45.900> things<00:04:46.229> in<00:04:46.409> and<00:04:46.560> out<00:04:46.710> I

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
consistently change things in and out I

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.219 
consistently change things in and out I
think<00:04:48.560> they're<00:04:49.560> pretty<00:04:50.009> much<00:04:50.159> crap<00:04:50.759> so<00:04:51.229> there

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
think they're pretty much crap so there

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.129 
think they're pretty much crap so there
it<00:04:52.319> is<00:04:52.379> that's<00:04:52.650> my<00:04:52.770> honest<00:04:53.009> review
