00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello i have douglas again 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.540
 ordered and every now and then a packet 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.490
 do not show you something in there tomorrow we 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.980
 drive as always with the whole 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.460
 Bun dÃ¶ns what's always there in it 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.189
 I once before or cartier the eau 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.050
 de toilette as a bun I get 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.470
 ran again I do not know how that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:32.930
 smells very fresh but not mine 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:38.250
 I do not like to know so well 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:41.730
 then from viva juicy has the moor juicy 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:47.399
 Couture is also 15 days I know 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:50.989
 not where that smells very good, but also 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.559
 very sweet you just have to love, too 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.809
 very nice 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.030
 Then I had a sample from biotherm 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.359
 I was also looking forward to it this 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.090
 new blood serum oil is now mine 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.890
 sample down like a little me like that 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.270
 I'm curious if already at the first 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.600
 Something merkel that the skin especially 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.070
 soft or so but even if it is me 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.140
 I will not buy myself because 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.549
 I think it costs 60 euros or even 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.580
 even more so I will not be in 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:25.290
 invest a cream ear in serum and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.290
 then I have from elisa on such a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.979
 get variety 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.829
 that means only Elizabeth II sees here 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.229
 a little fancier out of here though 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.840
 Not so my fragrance that monika 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.369
 So I do not find fragrance bad 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.040
 but just remember 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.240
 more mature women over 50 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.030
 but it is not bad definitely 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.970
 thanks as a free gift if you have something 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.549
 Once ordered from tk , there was the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.140
 bodylotion as well as delicious and 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.060
 funny I have exactly that 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.870
 I also wanted to buy a follow-up 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.920
 I'll show it to you again 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.480
 and yes I have bodylotion now 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.550
 Let's see if I use the or 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.660
 I do not know because I have a chance 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.390
 already so many 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.340
 and yes, the judge like the couple before 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.170
 in my opinion would have been very good otherwise 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.820
 I did not order that daddy there 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.710
 I was lucky that it was also the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.140
 body lotion plus there is also the 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.880
 So not the same from this green series 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.820
 a bit like apple really good 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.440
 and fresh I show you again the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:35.320
 last sample I got from 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.930
 lancom dream sound correct export 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.790
 correct against dark spots 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.500
 maybe age clicks or something 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.310
 I think this is something like one 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.700
 made bite is also one thing 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.990
 so to speak, that was the first step 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.490
 Ten years old, it totally blinds here 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.590
 but it only has such a mini sample yes 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.450
 now my pc is synonymous no matter 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.230
 so now we come to the things the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.180
 I have asked five things 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:14.500
 exactly as I said the couple of dj 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:17.130
 be delicious it says I believe only be 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.730
 delicious donald carroll from new york 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.650
 and it's just the green light very good 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.000
 I like it very fresh super good 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.550
 probably fit better in the 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.060
 summer but with scents 80 of the now 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.820
 not so on it so probably that would be 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.350
 with then a few more form of a sacrifice 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.200
 that's why I have two 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.190
 intended to buy from nicki minaj 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.160
 I necessarily have 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.280
 that is a very sweet scent I with the 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.060
 flacon so cool I would be 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.560
 Keep although I actually 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.000
 never do but I somehow find that 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.680
 very nice 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.519
 then you can pull off your head like that 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.769
 complete and that smells very sweet sweet 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.390
 but still fresh but that must 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.450
 you already like the very sweet 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.150
 Fragrances do not like for it is not and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.430
 it reminds me of a mix of 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.290
 The drugstore that I once had 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.970
 that was so gollner but i know 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.500
 not even like that and if it is 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.560
 that was even before ten 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.400
 years or so but that really smells 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.709
 well I like it then I have from 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.260
 Bad is ordering a dry shampoo 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.020
 This time it was strong in the brown I had 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.280
 before that the medium brown or I know 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.510
 not more like that in any case 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.150
 of the dark I have now 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.010
 order that 's also available in real costs 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.470
 as much but I had rather online 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.530
 ordered that's why I have the same 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.870
 by the way, I think that's very good 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.470
 you do not have a gray suit just for 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.500
 dark haired super and it stops too 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.660
 long tent really longer than valea 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.790
 and i also have no breathing problem 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.940
 which valeo I had used 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.740
 sometime in the bathroom so achim problems 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.470
 what asthma is in the case of 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.290
 whole room was sprayed and there 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.729
 not and you do not have to 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.050
 Truly do it right 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.400
 it is enough if you are a bit with the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.690
 hands goes through and you can see 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.970
 nothing at all 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.890
 and yes I'm excited about it and 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.340
 I also did not buy another one 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.340
 more 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:20.350
 and now two more cosmetics products 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:23.530
 I once had a treat from von 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.840
 yves sarault the orange product 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.840
 lipstick so beautiful the packaging 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:33.010
 out in the color eight I think that has 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.290
 Also took exactly pink in conference could 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.530
 I look so beautiful and noble 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.910
 I totally like this golden wrapping 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.320
 as I said the number eight is one 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.640
 beautiful rose tone very difficult as I said 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.680
 from the barn row 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:52.180
 that's how it looks on the lips 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.940
 just such a delicate pink old rose question 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.570
 I too today and it shimmers completely 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.990
 easy and yes I think color is very nice 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.730
 discreet 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.030
 Good for everyday life and I like it a lot 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.460
 good the smells also feels really good 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.830
 Super silky smooth 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.270
 soft on the lips and I can 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.160
 definitely recommend it 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.310
 but of course it's a proud price 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.470
 and the prices that I dazzle you 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.800
 then they paid you because of me 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:24.040
 had I think 15 percent gave it 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:28.780
 Grabmal Douglas had recently and then 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:30.390
 I then paid 15 percent yes everything 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:35.130
 So it was again reduced 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:37.150
 then I have the new benefit 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.170
 highlighter bought me little 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.580
 highlighter place i mean europe tour 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.560
 and yes, I did not have any of them yet 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.450
 benefit and i find packaging so cute 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.390
 and I just wanted to try it 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.430
 and I like that and have it here 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.230
 such a game in it and also in 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.030
 paint 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.620
 he manages to do so here 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.150
 wood handle and I have already 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.260
 not bad for me either 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:05.170
 And the industry is such an old-pink tone 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.540
 with very nice shimmer that looks like that 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.310
 I wish you the right time 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.820
 you can see that on my hand back 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:17.350
 probably not and it smells like that 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:19.780
 good after to be really sweet and fresh and 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:23.290
 powdery not so good 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:26.500
 you could use that as a couple here 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.450
 you hardly ever see it on his 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.670
 back of the hand one sees somehow so pink 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.910
 I do not even know why 

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:35.590
 but I wear it today too and give it up 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.870
 good color he has a beautiful 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.090
 But do not agree too pushy and 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.830
 I think they are really great and I am 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:45.550
 glad I bought myself 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:48.250
 yes that was already my hall I hope so 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.020
 I liked you and yes from me 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.460
 on instagram this becomes very much the goal 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.680
 looking forward 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.330
 yes, you can also look up to female shopping 

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.340

 that with the 15 percent seen 

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:05.080
 and also with all the free prizes 

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.849
 So it was worth it there 

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.460

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:12.419
