to cut your tape to be three quarters of
an<00:02:32.230> inch<00:02:32.380> thick<00:02:33.010> I'm<00:02:33.850> going<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.120> place<00:02:34.360> two

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
an inch thick I'm going to place two

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.930 
an inch thick I'm going to place two
pieces<00:02:35.880> making<00:02:36.880> an<00:02:37.090> X<00:02:37.390> /<00:02:37.810> 8<00:02:37.989> in<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.380> center<00:02:38.940> so

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
pieces making an X / 8 in the center so

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.070 
pieces making an X / 8 in the center so
wrap<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.630> excess<00:02:41.019> tape<00:02:41.320> onto<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.459> back<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.989> we

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
wrap the excess tape onto the back so we

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.530 
wrap the excess tape onto the back so we
taped<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.410> top<00:02:44.590> again<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.250> now<00:02:45.670> we're<00:02:46.330> going

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
taped the top again and now we're going

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.650 
taped the top again and now we're going
to<00:02:46.660> create<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.350> diamond<00:02:48.280> shape<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.420> middle

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
to create a diamond shape in the middle

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.680 
to create a diamond shape in the middle
so<00:02:49.870> we're<00:02:50.019> going<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.320> measure<00:02:50.700> each<00:02:51.700> exposed

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
so we're going to measure each exposed

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.930 
so we're going to measure each exposed
untaped<00:02:53.620> side<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.370> make<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.549> little<00:02:54.790> mark

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
untaped side and make a little mark

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.210 
untaped side and make a little mark
right<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.480> middle<00:02:55.630> I'll<00:02:56.380> paint<00:02:56.799> inside

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.949 
right in the middle I'll paint inside
the<00:02:57.430> tape<00:02:57.610> diamond<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.269> create<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.660> design

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959
