00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
internally inside the gauge head what

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.330 
internally inside the gauge head what
happens<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.140> air<00:01:39.170> temperature<00:01:39.560> comes<00:01:40.130> up

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
happens is the air temperature comes up

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.270 
happens is the air temperature comes up
at<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.000> same<00:01:41.270> time<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:42.049> pressure<00:01:42.619> inside<00:01:42.920> the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
at the same time the pressure inside the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.859 
at the same time the pressure inside the
gauge<00:01:43.460> will<00:01:43.729> come<00:01:43.909> up<00:01:44.090> as<00:01:44.240> well<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.750> need

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
gauge will come up as well so you need

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.570 
gauge will come up as well so you need
to<00:01:44.990> equalize<00:01:45.470> that<00:01:45.650> pressure<00:01:45.979> inside<00:01:46.369> the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
to equalize that pressure inside the
