is modeling from yeah I'll modeling yeah
I'll<00:00:14.350> show<00:00:14.650> them<00:00:14.709> how<00:00:14.799> to<00:00:14.830> make<00:00:15.039> the<00:00:15.160> carbon

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:15.609 
I'll show them how to make the carbon

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.009 
I'll show them how to make the carbon
right<00:00:16.330> first<00:00:16.740> okay<00:00:17.740> so<00:00:18.670> what<00:00:19.210> this<00:00:19.359> suit<00:00:19.630> is

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
need to make a mixed metal ingot and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.840 
need to make a mixed metal ingot and
then<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.189> put<00:01:06.369> that<00:01:06.520> into<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.880> over<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:09.729> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
alright and then you'll get an advanced

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.789 
alright and then you'll get an advanced
alloy<00:01:23.119> yes<00:01:24.119> which<00:01:24.930> you'll<00:01:25.110> need<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> ill

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
