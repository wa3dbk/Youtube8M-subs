00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
than the hard head it has such a nice

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.180 
than the hard head it has such a nice
fragrance<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.590> just<00:02:48.620> smells<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.040> lot

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.349 
right here is a race pace which is just
this<00:03:14.329> right<00:03:14.780> here<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.769> i'm<00:03:15.889> in<00:03:16.250> number<00:03:16.940> two

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
this right here and i'm in number two

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.080 
this right here and i'm in number two
and<00:03:18.200> i<00:03:18.859> picked<00:03:19.220> this<00:03:19.280> up<00:03:19.489> yesterday<00:03:19.910> actually

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
and i picked this up yesterday actually

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.270 
and i picked this up yesterday actually
when<00:03:20.900> my<00:03:21.049> friends<00:03:21.410> she<00:03:21.590> always<00:03:21.859> raised<00:03:22.040> about

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
when my friends she always raised about

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.180 
when my friends she always raised about
it<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.639> I<00:03:23.180> thought<00:03:23.720> are<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:24.680> know<00:03:24.799> she

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
it and I thought are you know she

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.710 
it and I thought are you know she
doesn't<00:03:25.579> wear<00:03:25.730> any<00:03:25.849> makeup<00:03:26.030> or<00:03:26.450> anything<00:03:26.480> like

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
doesn't wear any makeup or anything like

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.690 
doesn't wear any makeup or anything like
that<00:03:26.870> because<00:03:27.680> her<00:03:28.220> skin<00:03:28.250> is<00:03:28.519> really

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
that because her skin is really

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.400 
that because her skin is really
sensitive<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.480> anything<00:03:29.959> she<00:03:30.079> puts<00:03:30.109> on<00:03:30.349> her

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
sensitive and anything she puts on her

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.379 
sensitive and anything she puts on her
skin<00:03:30.769> it<00:03:30.980> just<00:03:31.250> makes<00:03:31.370> her<00:03:31.489> face<00:03:31.700> break<00:03:31.940> out<00:03:32.060> so

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
skin it just makes her face break out so

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.849 
skin it just makes her face break out so
she<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:32.959> doesn't<00:03:33.319> wear<00:03:33.410> makeup<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:33.829> I

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
she just doesn't wear makeup so I

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.170 
she just doesn't wear makeup so I
thought<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:34.280> really<00:03:34.549> really<00:03:34.730> need<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:34.940> try<00:03:35.060> it

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
thought I really really need to try it

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.229 
thought I really really need to try it
and<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:36.250> really<00:03:37.250> liked<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.669> it<00:03:37.790> works<00:03:38.030> really

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
and I really liked it it works really

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.720 
and I really liked it it works really
nice<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.900> I'm<00:03:39.889> actually<00:03:40.190> wearing<00:03:40.430> right<00:03:40.700> now

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730

using<00:03:42.650> this<00:03:43.010> right<00:03:43.190> here<00:03:43.370> to<00:03:43.459> cover<00:03:43.609> up<00:03:43.760> the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
using this right here to cover up the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.640 
using this right here to cover up the
most<00:03:44.060> spots<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.540> imperfections<00:03:45.109> i<00:03:45.230> have<00:03:45.410> and

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
most spots and imperfections i have and

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.500 
most spots and imperfections i have and
just<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.489> course<00:03:46.669> like<00:03:46.849> my<00:03:47.030> bronzer<00:03:47.389> and<00:03:47.450> blush

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510

just of course like my bronzer and blush
and<00:03:47.989> i<00:03:48.650> love<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:49.549> and<00:03:49.579> i<00:03:49.790> think<00:03:50.120> it<00:03:50.209> works

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
and i love it and i think it works

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.330 
and i love it and i think it works
really<00:03:50.480> well<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.989> only<00:03:51.139> downside<00:03:51.859> i<00:03:51.889> would

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
really well the only downside i would

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.479 
really well the only downside i would
say<00:03:52.609> about<00:03:52.819> it<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:54.560> almost<00:03:54.829> feels<00:03:55.250> like<00:03:55.280> it

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
say about it is it almost feels like it

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.580 
say about it is it almost feels like it
has<00:03:55.730> somewhat<00:03:56.299> it<00:03:56.569> can<00:03:56.750> be<00:03:56.870> somewhat<00:03:57.230> sticky

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
has somewhat it can be somewhat sticky

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.800 
has somewhat it can be somewhat sticky
at<00:03:57.859> times<00:03:58.130> so<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.819> really<00:03:59.419> have<00:03:59.569> to<00:03:59.780> be

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
at times so you really have to be

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.360 
at times so you really have to be
careful<00:03:59.900> not<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.620> get<00:04:00.709> a<00:04:00.769> lot<00:04:00.980> at<00:04:01.069> all<00:04:01.190> because

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
careful not to get a lot at all because

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.849 
careful not to get a lot at all because
a<00:04:01.760> little<00:04:01.970> goes<00:04:02.150> such<00:04:03.049> a<00:04:03.079> long<00:04:03.230> way<00:04:03.620> with<00:04:03.799> this

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
a little goes such a long way with this

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.860 
a little goes such a long way with this
stuff<00:04:04.310> is<00:04:04.609> the<00:04:04.730> first<00:04:04.970> time<00:04:05.060> i<00:04:05.209> put<00:04:05.599> on<00:04:05.720> this
