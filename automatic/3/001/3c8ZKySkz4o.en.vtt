the web more in question is kind of like

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.570 
the web more in question is kind of like
it's<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.449> really<00:00:21.930> got<00:00:22.080> long<00:00:22.439> range<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.160> but

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
it's a really got long range on it but

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.759 
it's a really got long range on it but
yet<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:23.850> still<00:00:23.970> an<00:00:24.180> SMG<00:00:24.539> talking<00:00:25.529> about<00:00:25.680> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
yet it's still an SMG talking about of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.710 
yet it's still an SMG talking about of
course<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.279> Peacekeeper<00:00:26.910> which<00:00:27.420> came<00:00:27.689> with

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
course the Peacekeeper which came with

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.169 
course the Peacekeeper which came with
the<00:00:28.199> revolution<00:00:28.920> dlc<00:00:29.460> which<00:00:29.670> wasn't<00:00:29.880> too<00:00:30.060> long

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the revolution dlc which wasn't too long

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.740 
the revolution dlc which wasn't too long
ago<00:00:31.669> obviously<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> guns<00:00:32.940> been<00:00:33.120> nerfed<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.600> bit

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
ago obviously the guns been nerfed a bit

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.690 
ago obviously the guns been nerfed a bit
so<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> doesn't<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:34.800> quite<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.250> much<00:00:35.430> damage

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
so it doesn't do quite as much damage

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.630 
so it doesn't do quite as much damage
but<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.930> still<00:00:37.170> pretty<00:00:37.410> powerful<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.280> I

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
but it's still pretty powerful and I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.160 
but it's still pretty powerful and I
found<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.149> very<00:00:39.239> useful<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.989> still

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
found it to be very useful it's still

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.440 
found it to be very useful it's still
one<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.350> my<00:00:40.440> favorite<00:00:40.829> smgs<00:00:41.370> despite<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
one of my favorite smgs despite the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.720 
one of my favorite smgs despite the
decrease<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.140> damage<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:44.250> very<00:00:44.430> very

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
decrease in damage it's very very

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.850 
decrease in damage it's very very
accurate<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.660> very<00:00:45.930> steady<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.649> got

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
accurate it's very steady it's got

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.619 
accurate it's very steady it's got
hardly<00:00:47.160> any<00:00:47.250> recoil<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> which<00:00:48.270> makes<00:00:48.450> it

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
hardly any recoil on it which makes it

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.450 
hardly any recoil on it which makes it
really<00:00:48.870> easy<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.620> take<00:00:49.829> down<00:00:49.860> multiple

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
really easy to take down multiple

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.040 
really easy to take down multiple
enemies<00:00:50.760> at<00:00:50.850> once<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.210> clip<00:00:51.449> size<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.870> pretty

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
enemies at once the clip size is pretty

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.500 
enemies at once the clip size is pretty
decent<00:00:52.559> too<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.910> take<00:00:54.090> down<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> good

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
decent too so you can take down a good

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.000 
decent too so you can take down a good
you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.840> three<00:00:55.320> four<00:00:55.590> enemies<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.480> good

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010

magazine clip size if you really want to

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.410 
magazine clip size if you really want to
if<00:01:02.039> you're<00:01:02.280> capable<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.730> doing<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.210> mean<00:01:03.329> if

you get your shots dead-on it's very

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
you get your shots dead-on it's very
easy<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.820> take<00:01:06.030> out<00:01:06.150> three<00:01:06.210> or<00:01:06.450> four<00:01:06.659> guys<00:01:06.810> at

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
easy to take out three or four guys at

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.679 
easy to take out three or four guys at
once<00:01:07.110> um<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> we're<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.479> go<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
once um so we're going to go with a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.330 
once um so we're going to go with a
peacekeeper<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> weapon<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
peacekeeper of the weapon the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.690 
peacekeeper of the weapon the
attachments<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.240> usually<00:01:12.659> used<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.110> foregrip

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
attachments I usually used a foregrip

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
attachments I usually used a foregrip
along<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> reflex<00:01:15.420> sight<00:01:16.070> for<00:01:17.070> grip

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
along with the reflex sight for grip

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370 
along with the reflex sight for grip
obviously<00:01:17.610> adds<00:01:17.790> more<00:01:17.939> accuracies<00:01:18.600> probably

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
obviously adds more accuracies probably

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.960 
obviously adds more accuracies probably
reduces<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> recoil<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> little<00:01:20.880> bit

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
reduces the recoil just a little bit

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
reduces the recoil just a little bit
more<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:22.020> reflex<00:01:22.530> scope<00:01:22.860> gives<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> little

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
more the reflex scope gives you a little

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.630 
more the reflex scope gives you a little
bit<00:01:23.700> more<00:01:24.259> distance<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.920> gun<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.280> also

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
bit more distance on the gun it also

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.039 
bit more distance on the gun it also
gives<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.689> little<00:01:27.900> red

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
gives just that you know that little red

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.450 
gives just that you know that little red
dot<00:01:28.259> sight<00:01:28.619> which<00:01:28.799> makes<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.280> bit

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
dot sight which makes it a little bit

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.700 
dot sight which makes it a little bit
easier<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.790> aim<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.150> your<00:01:30.180> enemies<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
easier to aim at your enemies and I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.630 
easier to aim at your enemies and I
believe<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.009> actually<00:01:32.159> improves<00:01:32.400> your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
believe it actually improves your

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.270 
believe it actually improves your
accuracy<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.360> yeah<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.530> yeah<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.189> great

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
accuracy to yeah so yeah that's a great

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.370 
accuracy to yeah so yeah that's a great
attachment<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.780> your<00:01:36.900> secondary

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
attachment for it for your secondary

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.740 
attachment for it for your secondary
usually<00:01:38.159> go<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> b23r<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> my

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
usually go the b23r it's one of my

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.690 
usually go the b23r it's one of my
favorite<00:01:40.079> pistols<00:01:40.439> personally<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
favorite pistols personally it's a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.130 
favorite pistols personally it's a
little<00:01:41.909> bit<00:01:42.030> overpowered<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:42.720> opinion<00:01:42.990> but

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
little bit overpowered in my opinion but

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.690 
little bit overpowered in my opinion but
at<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.470> same<00:01:43.649> time<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.399> use<00:01:44.549> it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
at the same time I like to use it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.940 
at the same time I like to use it
because<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.479> quick<00:01:46.020> two<00:01:46.259> three<00:01:46.649> shots

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
and the enemies down it's especially

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.480 
and the enemies down it's especially
good<00:01:49.049> when<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.439> run<00:01:50.220> out<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.340> your

good when you run out of your
peacekeeper<00:01:50.970> ammo<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.479> need<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> swap<00:01:51.930> to

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
peacekeeper ammo and you need to swap to

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.510 
peacekeeper ammo and you need to swap to
something<00:01:52.350> real<00:01:52.470> quick<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.950> maybe<00:01:53.130> finish

something real quick and maybe finish

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.190 
something real quick and maybe finish
off<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> kill<00:01:54.000> or<00:01:54.299> even<00:01:54.600> get<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> kill<00:01:54.990> because

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
off a kill or even get a kill because

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.240 
off a kill or even get a kill because
you<00:01:55.259> know<00:01:55.350> another<00:01:55.560> guys<00:01:55.799> coming<00:01:55.979> around<00:01:56.159> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you know another guys coming around a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310 
you know another guys coming around a
corner<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> great<00:01:57.570> pistol<00:01:57.930> used<00:01:58.140> for

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
corner this is a great pistol used for

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.389 
corner this is a great pistol used for
that<00:01:58.469> we're<00:01:58.920> not<00:01:59.009> going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.189> put<00:01:59.310> any

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
that we're not going to put any

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.340 
that we're not going to put any
attachments<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:01.049> before<00:02:01.200> we

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
attachments on that and then before we

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.690 
attachments on that and then before we
get<00:02:01.469> into<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> perks<00:02:02.070> are<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> throw<00:02:02.549> on

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
get into the perks are going to throw on

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.940 
get into the perks are going to throw on
a<00:02:02.729> wild<00:02:03.060> card<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.619> for

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
a wild card and that is going to be for

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.059 
a wild card and that is going to be for
the<00:02:04.979> perk<00:02:05.340> 1<00:02:05.610> greed<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:07.200> reason<00:02:07.560> being<00:02:07.740> is

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the perk 1 greed and the reason being is

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.650 
the perk 1 greed and the reason being is
because<00:02:08.099> when<00:02:08.610> we<00:02:08.700> get<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.849> perk<00:02:09.090> 1<00:02:09.360> we're<00:02:09.629> going

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
because when we get a perk 1 we're going

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.180 
because when we get a perk 1 we're going
to<00:02:09.810> pick<00:02:10.020> up<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.739> that's<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.069> be

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
to pick up to and that's going to be

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.920 
to pick up to and that's going to be
lightweight<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.540> move<00:02:12.660> around<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
lightweight so you can move around a

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.640 
lightweight so you can move around a
little<00:02:12.989> bit<00:02:13.170> faster

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
little bit faster

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.110 
little bit faster
and<00:02:13.829> just<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.220> know<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.730> able<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.909> get<00:02:15.030> around

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and just you know be able to get around

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.910 
and just you know be able to get around
enemies<00:02:15.659> and<00:02:15.810> objectives<00:02:16.290> as<00:02:16.409> quickly<00:02:16.739> as

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
enemies and objectives as quickly as

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.520 
enemies and objectives as quickly as
possible<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.519> then<00:02:17.579> for<00:02:18.390> /<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.810> go<00:02:19.470> to

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
possible and then for / to go to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.860 
possible and then for / to go to
hardline<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.189> like<00:02:20.970> using<00:02:21.120> hard<00:02:21.450> line<00:02:21.629> on<00:02:21.659> this

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
hardline I like using hard line on this

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.330 
hardline I like using hard line on this
particular<00:02:22.049> class<00:02:22.409> because<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.220> really

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
particular class because you can really

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.250 
particular class because you can really
rack<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:23.849> scorestreaks<00:02:24.510> bigger<00:02:24.900> score

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
rack up scorestreaks bigger score

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.140 
rack up scorestreaks bigger score
streaks<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.890> especially<00:02:26.640> when<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.030> use

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
streaks to especially when you use

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.550 
streaks to especially when you use
hardline<00:02:27.540> because<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.810> makes<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.110> easier<00:02:28.500> to

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
hardline because it makes it easier to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.080 
hardline because it makes it easier to
pick<00:02:28.950> up<00:02:29.099> your<00:02:29.250> score<00:02:29.430> streaks<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:29.970> it

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
pick up your score streaks because it

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.550 
pick up your score streaks because it
takes<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.359> little<00:02:30.540> bit<00:02:30.689> less<00:02:30.900> points<00:02:31.260> to

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
takes a little bit less points to

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.899 
takes a little bit less points to
actually<00:02:31.859> get<00:02:32.010> each<00:02:33.109> 14<00:02:34.109> /<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.560> go<00:02:35.370> toughness

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
actually get each 14 / to go toughness

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.940 
actually get each 14 / to go toughness
so<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:36.959> way<00:02:37.140> when<00:02:37.290> you're<00:02:37.349> aiming<00:02:37.650> down<00:02:37.739> your

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
so this way when you're aiming down your

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.220 
so this way when you're aiming down your
sights<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:39.269> there's<00:02:39.420> an<00:02:39.510> enemy<00:02:39.750> firing<00:02:40.019> you

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
sights and there's an enemy firing you

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.899 
sights and there's an enemy firing you
at<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.409> same<00:02:40.620> time<00:02:40.829> you<00:02:41.340> don't<00:02:41.489> have<00:02:41.609> to<00:02:41.730> worry

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
at the same time you don't have to worry

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.240 
at the same time you don't have to worry
about<00:02:42.000> as<00:02:42.329> much<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.349> bounce<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.010> kick

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
about as much of that bounce and kick

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.000 
about as much of that bounce and kick
because<00:02:45.090> when<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.720> tend<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.079> get<00:02:46.200> usually

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
because when you tend to get usually

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.460 
because when you tend to get usually
when<00:02:47.129> you<00:02:47.190> get<00:02:47.340> hit<00:02:47.549> by<00:02:48.389> enemy<00:02:48.840> bullets<00:02:49.139> while

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
when you get hit by enemy bullets while

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.050 
when you get hit by enemy bullets while
you're<00:02:49.620> aiming<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.099> kind<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.400> tends<00:02:50.609> to<00:02:50.819> drift

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
you're aiming it kind of tends to drift

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.729 
you're aiming it kind of tends to drift
up<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.420> little<00:02:51.629> bit<00:02:51.750> because<00:02:51.900> your<00:02:52.379> players

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
up a little bit because your players

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.520 
up a little bit because your players
reacting<00:02:53.519> as<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.849> getting<00:02:54.150> hit<00:02:54.389> with<00:02:55.109> bullets

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
reacting as in getting hit with bullets

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.589 
reacting as in getting hit with bullets
but<00:02:55.769> toughness<00:02:56.519> kind<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.790> reduces<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.359> so

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
but toughness kind of reduces that so

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.009 
but toughness kind of reduces that so
that's<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.989> good<00:02:58.409> perk<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.739> have<00:02:58.920> on<00:02:59.180> perk<00:03:00.180> 3<00:03:00.599> or

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
that's a good perk to have on perk 3 or

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.619 
that's a good perk to have on perk 3 or
neo<00:03:01.170> dexterity<00:03:01.829> I<00:03:02.069> like<00:03:02.700> using<00:03:02.879> this<00:03:03.180> because

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
neo dexterity I like using this because

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:04.910 
neo dexterity I like using this because
I<00:03:03.930> mean<00:03:04.079> with<00:03:04.200> lightweight<00:03:04.379> you're<00:03:04.739> running

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
I mean with lightweight you're running

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.920 
I mean with lightweight you're running
around<00:03:05.099> really<00:03:05.189> quickly<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.849> sometimes<00:03:06.659> you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
around really quickly and sometimes you

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.330 
around really quickly and sometimes you
can<00:03:07.079> get<00:03:07.290> caught<00:03:07.530> off<00:03:07.680> guard<00:03:07.709> but<00:03:08.189> if<00:03:08.280> you

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
can get caught off guard but if you

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.270 
can get caught off guard but if you
don't<00:03:08.489> have<00:03:08.609> a<00:03:08.639> UAV<00:03:08.939> or<00:03:09.349> an<00:03:10.349> orbital<00:03:10.739> vsat<00:03:10.889> up

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
don't have a UAV or an orbital vsat up

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.190 
don't have a UAV or an orbital vsat up
there<00:03:12.120> might<00:03:12.269> be<00:03:12.299> an<00:03:12.480> enemy<00:03:12.599> coming<00:03:12.959> around<00:03:13.079> a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
there might be an enemy coming around a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.809 
there might be an enemy coming around a
corner<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.650> don't<00:03:13.829> know<00:03:13.980> about<00:03:14.159> it<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.459> they

corner you don't know about it and they

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.280 
corner you don't know about it and they
pop<00:03:15.030> out<00:03:15.239> around<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.599> corner<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.079> don't

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
pop out around the corner and you don't

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.599 
pop out around the corner and you don't
have<00:03:16.409> enough<00:03:16.560> time<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.859> pull<00:03:17.129> up<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.459> your

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
have enough time to pull up to your

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.099 
have enough time to pull up to your
sites<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.150> actually<00:03:18.419> take<00:03:18.599> them<00:03:18.750> take<00:03:19.049> them

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
sites to actually take them take them

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.050 
sites to actually take them take them
out<00:03:19.349> dexterity<00:03:20.190> really<00:03:20.489> helps<00:03:20.760> with<00:03:20.879> that<00:03:20.910> a

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
out dexterity really helps with that a

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.869 
out dexterity really helps with that a
lot<00:03:21.389> when<00:03:22.199> you<00:03:22.290> go<00:03:22.379> from<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.680> full<00:03:22.919> sprint<00:03:23.370> to

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
lot when you go from a full sprint to

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.360 
lot when you go from a full sprint to
going<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.540> d/s<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.290> actually<00:03:25.739> makes<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.129> much

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
going to a d/s it actually makes it much

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.890 
going to a d/s it actually makes it much
faster<00:03:26.609> so<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.120> like<00:03:27.269> using<00:03:27.419> that<00:03:27.660> with<00:03:27.810> this

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
faster so I like using that with this

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.289 
faster so I like using that with this
class<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.949> then<00:03:29.220> finally<00:03:29.699> just<00:03:30.030> for<00:03:30.180> your

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
class and then finally just for your

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.460 
class and then finally just for your
lethal<00:03:30.510> we're<00:03:30.810> going<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:30.989> go<00:03:31.049> with<00:03:31.139> frag

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
lethal we're going to go with frag

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.339 
lethal we're going to go with frag
grenade<00:03:31.829> I<00:03:32.329> usually<00:03:33.329> go<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.659> some<00:03:33.870> text<00:03:34.169> but

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
grenade I usually go to some text but

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.619 
grenade I usually go to some text but
for<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.400> one<00:03:35.459> i<00:03:35.639> like<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.030> use<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.299> for<00:03:36.480> kind

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
for this one i like to use it for kind

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.210 
for this one i like to use it for kind
of<00:03:36.720> objective<00:03:36.840> based<00:03:37.290> games<00:03:37.590> like<00:03:37.829> capture

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
of objective based games like capture

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.909 
of objective based games like capture

flag and domination sometimes Search and

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.319 
flag and domination sometimes Search and
Destroy<00:03:40.949> and<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.579> just<00:03:41.760> like<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.060> be<00:03:42.150> able<00:03:42.209> to

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
Destroy and I just like to be able to

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.899 
Destroy and I just like to be able to
have<00:03:42.599> something<00:03:42.930> like<00:03:43.109> and<00:03:43.470> toss<00:03:43.729> directly<00:03:44.729> on

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
have something like and toss directly on

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.000 
have something like and toss directly on
to<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.479> objective<00:03:46.079> when<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.620> know<00:03:46.709> there's

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
to the objective when I know there's

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.339 
to the objective when I know there's
multiple<00:03:47.430> enemies<00:03:47.760> there<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.959> that's<00:03:49.079> really

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
multiple enemies there so that's really

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.509 
multiple enemies there so that's really
good<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.500> have<00:03:49.680> for<00:03:49.859> that<00:03:49.949> because<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.280> frag

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
good to have for that because the frag

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.610 
good to have for that because the frag
does<00:03:50.699> a<00:03:50.790> good<00:03:50.909> job<00:03:50.970> taking<00:03:51.419> out<00:03:51.720> enemies<00:03:52.139> that

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
does a good job taking out enemies that

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.229 
does a good job taking out enemies that
are<00:03:52.680> sitting<00:03:52.979> on<00:03:53.159> the<00:03:53.459> objective<00:03:53.940> but<00:03:54.150> of

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
are sitting on the objective but of

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.369 
are sitting on the objective but of
course<00:03:54.419> if<00:03:54.599> you're<00:03:54.720> playing<00:03:54.810> objective<00:03:55.229> games

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
course if you're playing objective games

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.229 
course if you're playing objective games
you<00:03:55.530> know<00:03:55.650> most<00:03:55.829> people<00:03:56.190> also<00:03:56.549> run<00:03:56.909> with<00:03:57.209> a

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
you know most people also run with a

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.330 
you know most people also run with a
flak<00:03:57.870> jacket<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.859> doesn't<00:03:59.099> always<00:03:59.250> work

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
flak jacket so it doesn't always work

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.909 
flak jacket so it doesn't always work
but<00:03:59.549> at<00:03:59.790> least<00:04:00.199> takes<00:04:01.199> down<00:04:01.379> their<00:04:01.560> shields

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
but at least takes down their shields

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.140 
but at least takes down their shields
enough<00:04:02.159> to<00:04:02.310> where<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:02.579> can<00:04:02.729> go<00:04:02.819> in<00:04:02.970> with<00:04:03.060> the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
enough to where you can go in with the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.210 
enough to where you can go in with the
Peacekeeper<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.959> mow<00:04:04.530> them<00:04:04.709> down<00:04:04.739> pretty

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
Peacekeeper and mow them down pretty

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.819 
Peacekeeper and mow them down pretty
quickly<00:04:05.599> and<00:04:06.599> that's<00:04:06.780> pretty<00:04:06.959> much<00:04:07.079> it<00:04:07.620> for

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
quickly and that's pretty much it for

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.349 
quickly and that's pretty much it for
this<00:04:07.979> class<00:04:08.280> like<00:04:08.639> I<00:04:08.669> said<00:04:08.970> it's<00:04:09.090> really

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
this class like I said it's really

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.210 
this class like I said it's really
really<00:04:09.959> well-rounded<00:04:10.290> class<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.829> you<00:04:10.919> can<00:04:11.069> use

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
really well-rounded class so you can use

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.449 
really well-rounded class so you can use
it<00:04:11.250> for<00:04:11.989> you<00:04:12.989> know<00:04:13.079> short<00:04:13.440> range<00:04:13.709> medium<00:04:14.159> range

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
it for you know short range medium range

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.819 
it for you know short range medium range
and<00:04:14.790> somewhat<00:04:15.659> long<00:04:15.810> distance<00:04:16.260> not<00:04:16.440> like<00:04:16.650> all

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
and somewhat long distance not like all

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.770 
and somewhat long distance not like all
the<00:04:17.010> way<00:04:17.099> across<00:04:17.220> map<00:04:17.789> distance<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.599> does

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
the way across map distance but it does

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.629 
the way across map distance but it does
shoot<00:04:18.989> pretty<00:04:19.409> well<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.039> have<00:04:20.099> very<00:04:20.459> good

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
shoot pretty well and have very good

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.940 
shoot pretty well and have very good
accuracy<00:04:21.060> at<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.389> distance<00:04:21.889> especially<00:04:22.889> with

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
accuracy at a distance especially with

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.459 
accuracy at a distance especially with
the<00:04:23.039> reflex<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.610> for<00:04:23.820> grip<00:04:24.060> on<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.479> just<00:04:25.260> makes

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
the reflex and for grip on it just makes

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:27.190 
the reflex and for grip on it just makes
it<00:04:25.590> more<00:04:25.740> steady<00:04:26.099> and<00:04:26.340> more<00:04:26.550> capable

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
it more steady and more capable

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.700 
it more steady and more capable
of<00:04:27.370> keeping<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.400> full<00:04:28.790> auto<00:04:29.000> fire<00:04:29.330> going<00:04:29.780> on

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
of keeping that full auto fire going on

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.880 
of keeping that full auto fire going on
in<00:04:30.980> a<00:04:31.040> distance<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:32.120> like<00:04:32.930> I<00:04:33.050> said<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.320> b23r

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
in a distance and like I said the b23r

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.970 
in a distance and like I said the b23r
is<00:04:34.220> great<00:04:34.970> for<00:04:35.240> those<00:04:35.530> when<00:04:36.530> you<00:04:36.620> get<00:04:36.740> up<00:04:36.830> to

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
is great for those when you get up to

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.440 
is great for those when you get up to
like<00:04:37.220> an<00:04:37.370> encounter<00:04:37.580> where<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:38.060> have<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.300> take

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
like an encounter where you have to take

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.000 
like an encounter where you have to take
out<00:04:38.600> two<00:04:38.840> three<00:04:39.140> four<00:04:39.230> enemies<00:04:39.800> with<00:04:39.980> a

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
out two three four enemies with a

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.650 
out two three four enemies with a
peacekeeper<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.760> you<00:04:40.820> run<00:04:40.940> out<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.090> ammo<00:04:41.450> and

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
peacekeeper and you run out of ammo and

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.030 
peacekeeper and you run out of ammo and
there's<00:04:42.080> still<00:04:42.260> another<00:04:42.470> guy<00:04:42.650> coming<00:04:42.890> around

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
there's still another guy coming around

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.440 
there's still another guy coming around
the<00:04:43.250> corner<00:04:43.550> or<00:04:43.700> you<00:04:43.820> just<00:04:43.850> need<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.150> finish<00:04:44.300> a

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
the corner or you just need to finish a
