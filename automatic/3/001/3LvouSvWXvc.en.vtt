00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
you already did it for your target and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.999 
you already did it for your target and
finally<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> cooldown<00:01:56.880> tab<00:01:57.350> this<00:01:58.350> tab<00:01:58.770> I

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
finally the cooldown tab this tab I

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.490 
finally the cooldown tab this tab I
don't<00:01:59.310> use<00:01:59.640> at<00:01:59.880> all<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:00.869> gonna<00:02:01.290> go

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
don't use at all and I'm not gonna go

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
don't use at all and I'm not gonna go
in-depth<00:02:02.009> about<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.390> basically

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
in-depth about it but you can basically

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.440 
in-depth about it but you can basically
set<00:02:04.200> up<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.469> little<00:02:04.680> space<00:02:05.520> where<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
set up a little space where you have a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.740 
set up a little space where you have a
lot<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.960> things<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:08.099> clumped<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.599> can

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
lot of things all clumped up and you can

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.510 
lot of things all clumped up and you can
make<00:02:09.929> them<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.200> big<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:10.560> as<00:02:10.619> small<00:02:10.739> as<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.489> want

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
make them as big or as small as you want

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.559 
make them as big or as small as you want
I<00:02:12.000> don't

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
I don't

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.959 
I don't
because<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.170> find<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.829> be<00:02:13.859> more<00:02:14.249> of<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> newest

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:14.969 
because I find it to be more of a newest

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.520 
because I find it to be more of a newest
on<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.450> than<00:02:15.599> anything<00:02:15.810> else

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
on so than anything else

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.349 
on so than anything else
it's<00:02:16.859> gonna<00:02:17.849> take<00:02:18.689> up<00:02:18.870> some<00:02:19.079> space<00:02:19.409> it's

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
it's gonna take up some space it's

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.550 
it's gonna take up some space it's
unpractical<00:02:21.359> for<00:02:21.749> me<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.170> if<00:02:22.290> you're<00:02:22.409> gonna

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
unpractical for me but if you're gonna

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.199 
unpractical for me but if you're gonna
want<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.950> go<00:02:23.069> ahead<00:02:23.189> and<00:02:23.459> experiment<00:02:23.819> with<00:02:24.150> it

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
want to go ahead and experiment with it

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.599 
want to go ahead and experiment with it
you're<00:02:24.659> free<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.139> do<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.499> now<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:25.859> ghost<00:02:26.189> timer

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
you're free to do it now the ghost timer

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.240 
you're free to do it now the ghost timer
when<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.239> have<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.629> option<00:02:27.989> on<00:02:28.349> after<00:02:29.219> a

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
when you have this option on after a

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.300 
when you have this option on after a

buff or a debuff expires you will have

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.339 
buff or a debuff expires you will have
the<00:02:32.579> same<00:02:32.790> icon<00:02:33.239> there<00:02:33.569> but<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.049> will<00:02:34.139> be<00:02:34.319> a

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
the same icon there but it will be a

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.559 
the same icon there but it will be a
little<00:02:34.530> bit<00:02:34.739> faded<00:02:35.129> out<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.489> don't<00:02:35.639> use<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.209> for

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
will have to go on to the show wall and

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.110 
will have to go on to the show wall and
deselect<00:03:16.019> everything<00:03:16.409> that's<00:03:17.099> there<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:17.819> that

to track and started putting in there so
it<00:05:00.280> took<00:05:00.430> me<00:05:00.490> around<00:05:00.700> an<00:05:01.000> hour<00:05:01.150> to<00:05:01.660> set<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:01.930> up

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080

it took me around an hour to set it up
on<00:05:02.260> my<00:05:02.500> droid<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:03.039> then<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.150> basically

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
on my droid and then I basically

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.080 
on my droid and then I basically
exported<00:05:05.380> it<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:05.530> all<00:05:05.919> my<00:05:05.950> other<00:05:06.370> characters

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
exported it to all my other characters

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.779 
exported it to all my other characters
using<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.690> profile<00:05:08.229> manager<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:09.039> well

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
using the profile manager and well

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.480 
using the profile manager and well
that's<00:05:10.210> it<00:05:10.389> so<00:05:10.990> this<00:05:11.260> is<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.590> only<00:05:11.800> add-on<00:05:12.460> I

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
that's it so this is the only add-on I

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.940 
that's it so this is the only add-on I
use<00:05:12.850> that<00:05:13.120> really<00:05:13.570> needs<00:05:13.780> any<00:05:14.080> configuration

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
use that really needs any configuration

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.400
