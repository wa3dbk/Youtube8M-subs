first and yeah i'm not sure what is up
with<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:52.980> cuz<00:02:53.549> it<00:02:53.700> was<00:02:53.850> kind<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.299> going<00:02:54.390> back

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
with that cuz it was kind of going back

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.820 
with that cuz it was kind of going back
and<00:02:54.810> forth<00:02:55.049> because<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.350> was<00:02:55.470> like<00:02:55.590> that

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
and forth because it was like that

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.009 
and forth because it was like that
before<00:02:55.980> too<00:02:56.370> unless<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.450> wasn't<00:02:57.480> supposed<00:02:57.900> to

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
before too unless it wasn't supposed to

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.900 
before too unless it wasn't supposed to
be<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.319> was<00:02:58.410> like<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.530> translation<00:02:59.280> thing

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
be and that was like a translation thing

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.370 
be and that was like a translation thing
but<00:03:00.120> i<00:03:00.150> don't<00:03:00.390> think<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:00.840> i<00:03:00.989> don't<00:03:01.080> see<00:03:01.290> why

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
but i don't think so i don't see why

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.420 
but i don't think so i don't see why
they<00:03:01.500> would<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.709> translated<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.250> in

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
they would have translated it in

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.340 
they would have translated it in
complete<00:03:03.360> sentences<00:03:03.480> if<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.930> wasn't<00:03:04.230> supposed

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
complete sentences if it wasn't supposed

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.070 
complete sentences if it wasn't supposed
to<00:03:04.620> be<00:03:04.709> but<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:06.209> seems<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.450> be<00:03:06.569> going<00:03:06.660> back<00:03:06.930> and

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
to be but it seems to be going back and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.020 
to be but it seems to be going back and
forth<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:07.620> he's<00:03:07.739> like<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.160> realizing<00:03:08.940> that

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
forth so he's like is it realizing that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.850 
forth so he's like is it realizing that

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
know would be a pain but there might be

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.379 
know would be a pain but there might be
a<00:06:26.539> little<00:06:26.810> bit<00:06:27.080> of<00:06:27.199> caring<00:06:27.919> in<00:06:28.130> there<00:06:28.400> actually

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
a little bit of caring in there actually

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.899 
a little bit of caring in there actually
personally<00:06:29.900> caring<00:06:30.650> for<00:06:30.830> her<00:06:31.370> but<00:06:31.580> he<00:06:31.669> doesn't

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:31.909 
personally caring for her but he doesn't

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:33.309 
personally caring for her but he doesn't
want<00:06:32.030> her<00:06:32.150> to<00:06:32.270> act<00:06:32.419> on<00:06:32.599> her<00:06:32.780> own<00:06:32.960> because<00:06:33.199> he

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
want her to act on her own because he

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.279 
want her to act on her own because he
thinks<00:06:33.560> he<00:06:34.099> knows<00:06:34.280> best<00:06:34.610> so<00:06:34.819> if<00:06:35.210> she<00:06:36.139> does

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
thinks he knows best so if she does

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.629 
thinks he knows best so if she does
something<00:06:36.320> without<00:06:36.800> him<00:06:37.070> telling<00:06:37.190> her<00:06:37.370> to<00:06:37.520> it

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
something without him telling her to it

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:38.920 
something without him telling her to it
could<00:06:37.760> result<00:06:37.880> in<00:06:38.150> her<00:06:38.270> getting<00:06:38.570> killed<00:06:38.750> which

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
could result in her getting killed which

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.320 
could result in her getting killed which
it<00:06:39.020> almost<00:06:39.169> did<00:06:39.529> if<00:06:39.620> he<00:06:39.650> hadn't<00:06:39.919> grabbed

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
it almost did if he hadn't grabbed

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.839 
it almost did if he hadn't grabbed
by<00:06:40.449> the<00:06:40.509> head<00:06:41.199> and<00:06:41.470> toss<00:06:41.710> her<00:06:41.949> out<00:06:41.979> of<00:06:42.250> there<00:06:42.460> he

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849 
by the head and toss her out of there he

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:44.309 
by the head and toss her out of there he
doesn't<00:06:43.090> want<00:06:43.210> to<00:06:43.240> have<00:06:43.330> to<00:06:43.389> waste<00:06:43.960> the<00:06:44.139> time

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 
doesn't want to have to waste the time

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:45.869 
doesn't want to have to waste the time
teaching<00:06:44.650> new<00:06:44.949> one<00:06:45.159> but<00:06:45.280> I<00:06:45.310> think<00:06:45.550> there<00:06:45.729> might

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:45.879 
teaching new one but I think there might

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:48.179 
teaching new one but I think there might
be<00:06:45.939> a<00:06:46.120> little<00:06:46.449> personal<00:06:47.379> care<00:06:47.620> in<00:06:47.800> there<00:06:48.009> I

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:48.189 
be a little personal care in there I

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:51.659 
be a little personal care in there I
still<00:06:48.879> want<00:06:49.090> him<00:06:49.150> to<00:06:49.300> lose<00:06:50.129> because<00:06:51.129> he's<00:06:51.430> just

so weird and creepy and overconfident he

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:56.550
