00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.390
 well let's see how to unclog the pool 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.390
 of the lavatory 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.950
 in the grid 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.920
 we open the water 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.980
 we see that it begins to fill 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.980
 which means that 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.220
 It is completely covered 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.430
 we foresee that the pool is full 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.600
 which simple is very covered 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:02.860
 well let's remove 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:07.440
 the cover in this case you do not have screws 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.440
 and let's proceed to Libya 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.410
 let's start cleaning 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.410
 the pool 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.050
 we see that there is a lot of dirt 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.000
 then liked we look for a cap cable 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.280
 pipes to introduce 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.780
 the pipe and the pool to be able 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.780
 finish this shovel 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.950
 we introduce the tip of the cable 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.270
 in the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.250
 exit 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.250
 of water from the pool that we started 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.250
 Push 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.170
 then 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.170
 we remove the pipe 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.350
 and we opened 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.350
 the quality 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.410
 we know that enough water is coming out 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.710
 the drain has been uncovered 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.349
 no more water goes up 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.350
 we put back 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.880
 the stage 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.970
 of the drain in its place and ready
