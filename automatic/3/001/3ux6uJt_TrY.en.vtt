general would you like to see of it I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.630 
general would you like to see of it I
know<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> lot<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> people<00:01:19.860> say<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.490> could

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
know a lot of people say that it could

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.820 
know a lot of people say that it could
be<00:01:20.759> probably<00:01:21.479> too<00:01:21.780> similar<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.259> ice<00:01:22.470> but

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
be probably too similar to ice but

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.070 
be probably too similar to ice but
that's<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:24.180> me<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> limit<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.900> that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that's just to me a limit of that

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.620 
that's just to me a limit of that
person's<00:01:25.470> imagination<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.450> most

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
person's imagination but for the most

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.410 
person's imagination but for the most
part<00:01:28.460> if<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.579> haven't<00:01:29.850> realized<00:01:30.000> already

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
part if you haven't realized already

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.560 
part if you haven't realized already
it's<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.979> animations<00:01:32.579> or<00:01:32.729> at<00:01:32.820> least<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
it's in the animations or at least the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.740 
it's in the animations or at least the
trial<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> animations<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:34.979> in

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
trial of the animations are in

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.039 
trial of the animations are in
necropolis<00:01:36.860> with<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> shields<00:01:39.150> with

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
necropolis with one of the shields with

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.499 
necropolis with one of the shields with
shadow<00:01:40.350> gravity<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.310> another<00:01:43.070> that's<00:01:44.450> one<00:01:45.450> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
shadow gravity and another that's one of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.060 
shadow gravity and another that's one of
the<00:01:45.570> dregs<00:01:45.840> become<00:01:46.200> larger<00:01:47.960> but<00:01:48.960> um<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:50.040> know

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the dregs become larger but um you know

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.219 
the dregs become larger but um you know
just<00:01:50.340> let<00:01:50.640> me<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.840> guys<00:01:51.930> think

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
but uh I could imagine for this power

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.690 
but uh I could imagine for this power
you<00:02:14.130> know<00:02:14.280> creating<00:02:14.730> walls<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.560> water<00:02:16.700> maybe

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
you know creating walls of water maybe

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.260 
you know creating walls of water maybe
tsunamis<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:20.310> never<00:02:20.550> know<00:02:20.670> maybe<00:02:20.790> having<00:02:21.180> a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
tsunamis you never know maybe having a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
tsunamis you never know maybe having a
pet<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.870> know<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.160> actually<00:02:23.340> go<00:02:23.700> on

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
pet you know that can actually go on

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.930 
pet you know that can actually go on
land<00:02:25.290> maybe<00:02:25.770> like<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> turtle<00:02:26.459> or<00:02:26.580> something<00:02:26.910> I

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
land maybe like a turtle or something I

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.220 
land maybe like a turtle or something I
don't<00:02:27.030> know<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.540> don't<00:02:27.720> know<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.959> pretty

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
don't know but I don't know be pretty

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.960 
don't know but I don't know be pretty
interesting<00:02:30.739> brain<00:02:31.739> effects<00:02:32.100> storm<00:02:32.489> effects

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
interesting brain effects storm effects

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.199 
interesting brain effects storm effects
especially<00:02:34.160> interactions<00:02:35.160> with<00:02:35.400> electricity

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
especially interactions with electricity

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.660 
especially interactions with electricity
powers<00:02:36.600> would<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:36.930> pretty<00:02:37.260> interesting<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
powers would be pretty interesting a

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.520 
powers would be pretty interesting a
couple<00:02:38.760> other<00:02:39.300> powers<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.810> game<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.260> just

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
couple other powers in the game is just
