something I found on the vault glass
ever<00:00:08.670> since<00:00:08.820> bungee<00:00:09.179> said<00:00:09.360> that<00:00:09.510> not

everything has been found I've just been

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.890 
everything has been found I've just been
spending<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> bit<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.389> time<00:00:12.450> looking<00:00:12.719> around

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
spending a bit of time looking around

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.720 
spending a bit of time looking around
see<00:00:13.259> if<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.440> can<00:00:13.590> find<00:00:13.740> anything<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.340> no<00:00:14.610> one

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
see if I can find anything that no one

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.519 
see if I can find anything that no one
else<00:00:14.820> really<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.150> noticed<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:16.350> I've<00:00:16.440> been

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
else really is noticed so I've been

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.689 
else really is noticed so I've been
looking<00:00:16.740> around<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.400> wall<00:00:17.550> glass

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
looking around on the wall glass

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.210 
looking around on the wall glass
obviously<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.480> found<00:00:18.800> what<00:00:19.800> looks<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.100> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
obviously and I found what looks like a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.279 
obviously and I found what looks like a
new<00:00:20.520> room<00:00:20.939> obviously<00:00:21.510> people<00:00:21.539> have<00:00:21.869> got<00:00:22.020> rooms

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
new room obviously people have got rooms

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.590 
new room obviously people have got rooms
where<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.949> like<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.550> small<00:00:23.789> chest<00:00:24.090> room<00:00:24.330> on

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
where that like the small chest room on

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.849 
where that like the small chest room on
the<00:00:24.779> jumping<00:00:25.109> part<00:00:25.320> where<00:00:25.500> they<00:00:25.590> think<00:00:25.800> that

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
the jumping part where they think that

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.929 
the jumping part where they think that
something<00:00:26.189> could<00:00:26.279> spawn<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:26.670> no<00:00:26.820> one's

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
something could spawn but no one's

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.429 
something could spawn but no one's
really<00:00:27.029> found<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.420> theory<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:27.960> like<00:00:28.320> I

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
really found a theory to it like I

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.140 
really found a theory to it like I
haven't<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.800> found<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.580> think<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
haven't I found what I think to be a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.240 
haven't I found what I think to be a
room<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.779> haven't<00:00:31.019> found<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.439> way<00:00:31.529> inside<00:00:31.769> it

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
room but I haven't found a way inside it

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.010 
room but I haven't found a way inside it
yet<00:00:32.430> which<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.000> quite<00:00:33.180> difficult<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.809> explain

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
yet which is quite difficult to explain

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.690 
yet which is quite difficult to explain
but<00:00:34.140> I'll<00:00:34.590> you'll<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.070> able<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> understand

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
but I'll you'll be able to understand

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.490 
but I'll you'll be able to understand
more<00:00:35.790> when<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.940> show<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> second<00:00:36.750> it's

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
more when I show you in a second it's

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.260 
more when I show you in a second it's
above<00:00:37.770> where<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.040> gatekeeper<00:00:38.730> door<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.000> where

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
above where the gatekeeper door is where

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.560 
above where the gatekeeper door is where
a<00:00:39.510> Theon<00:00:39.809> obviously<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.559> spawns<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.370> well<00:00:41.570> now

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
a Theon obviously is spawns as well now

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.410 
a Theon obviously is spawns as well now
the<00:00:42.899> reason<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.370> room<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the reason I think it is a room is a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.940 
the reason I think it is a room is a
obviously<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.050> looks<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:46.649> could<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
obviously it looks like there could be a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.529 
obviously it looks like there could be a
room<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.430> makes<00:00:47.610> sense<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.300> B<00:00:48.510> also

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
room there that makes sense but B also

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.770 
room there that makes sense but B also
it<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> right<00:00:50.399> place<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.570> makes

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
it it's in the right place if that makes

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
it it's in the right place if that makes
sense<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> jumping<00:00:53.489> part

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
sense like this is the jumping part

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.000 
sense like this is the jumping part
where<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> am<00:00:53.969> now<00:00:54.149> okay<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:55.680> where<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
where I am now okay so that's where the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.740 
where I am now okay so that's where the
broken<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.640> export<00:00:57.000> lives<00:00:57.180> over<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
broken of export lives over there and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.270 
broken of export lives over there and
this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.260> Theon<00:00:58.559> door<00:00:58.890> where<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
this is a Theon door where the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.729 
this is a Theon door where the
gatekeeper<00:00:59.789> etc<00:01:00.149> spawns<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.289> thought<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
gatekeeper etc spawns so I thought I

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.750 
gatekeeper etc spawns so I thought I
would<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.340> little<00:01:02.370> look<00:01:02.640> inside

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
would have just a little look inside

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.789 
would have just a little look inside
this<00:01:03.059> room<00:01:03.300> sorry<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.989> blurry<00:01:04.290> loose

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
this room sorry for that blurry loose

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.950 
this room sorry for that blurry loose
I'm<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> turn<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.549> off<00:01:05.580> real<00:01:05.820> quick<00:01:05.960> put

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
I'm going to turn it off real quick put

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.340 
I'm going to turn it off real quick put
this<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:08.220> should<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.490> fine<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.960> thought

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
this on that should be fine so I thought

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.179 
this on that should be fine so I thought
I<00:01:10.409> would<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:10.950> look<00:01:11.130> around

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
I would just have a little look around

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.890 
I would just have a little look around
this<00:01:11.490> room<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> obviously<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.689> door

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
this room and this is obviously the door

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.730 
this room and this is obviously the door
where<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.260> through<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.560> fly<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
where you go through to fly the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.230 
where you go through to fly the
gatekeeper<00:01:14.220> et<00:01:14.310> cetera<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> little<00:01:15.030> room

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
gatekeeper et cetera and the little room

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
gatekeeper et cetera and the little room
that<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.509> think<00:01:15.869> could<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> room<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:17.130> there

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that I think could be a room is up there

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.660 
that I think could be a room is up there
where<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.119> light<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.189> reason<00:01:20.369> I

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
where that light is and the reason I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
where that light is and the reason I
think<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.240> give<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> room<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:21.720> because

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
think that give you room is just because

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.440 
think that give you room is just because
it<00:01:22.200> would<00:01:22.350> make<00:01:22.590> sense<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:23.700> know<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.030> there

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it would make sense you know if there

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.480 
it would make sense you know if there
was<00:01:24.570> another<00:01:24.810> route<00:01:25.140> down<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:26.040> would<00:01:26.220> bring

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
was another route down it would bring

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.219 
was another route down it would bring
you<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.330> would<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> place<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
you here this would be the place you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.630 
you here this would be the place you
would<00:01:28.350> need<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> end<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.040> finish<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> vault

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
would need to end up to finish the vault

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.410 
would need to end up to finish the vault
so<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.890> looks<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> room<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.150> mean<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
so it just looks like a room I mean if I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.850 
so it just looks like a room I mean if I
background<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.710> looks

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
background here you can see it looks

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.920 
background here you can see it looks
like<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.220> goes<00:01:35.340> quite<00:01:35.610> far<00:01:35.790> back<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.750> try

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
like it goes quite far back I can try

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.539 
like it goes quite far back I can try
and<00:01:36.990> throw<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> grenade<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.740> there<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.400> can

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and throw a grenade up there and you can

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.819 
and throw a grenade up there and you can
see<00:01:38.700> how<00:01:38.729> far<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.150> grenade<00:01:39.390> goes<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.680> goes

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
see how far the grenade goes in it goes

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.590 
see how far the grenade goes in it goes
right<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.549> doesn't<00:01:41.790> bounce<00:01:41.939> back<00:01:42.299> it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
right in it doesn't bounce back it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.780 
right in it doesn't bounce back it
doesn't<00:01:42.930> come<00:01:43.290> back<00:01:43.320> at<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.460> looks

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
doesn't come back at all it's it looks

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.030 
doesn't come back at all it's it looks
like<00:01:45.000> there's<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.270> room<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.680> could<00:01:46.770> be

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
like there's a room there so I could be

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.370 
like there's a room there so I could be
completely<00:01:47.220> wrong<00:01:47.610> however<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.020> look<00:01:49.259> at

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
completely wrong however if you look at

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.410 
completely wrong however if you look at
it<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.770> makes<00:01:50.490> sense<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.149> would<00:01:51.180> be

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it it just makes sense that it would be

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.179 
it it just makes sense that it would be
there<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.079> does<00:01:52.320> look<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.619> another<00:01:52.920> route

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
there it does look like another route

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.060 
there it does look like another route
that<00:01:53.820> could<00:01:54.030> come<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.140> only<00:01:55.380> problem<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
that could come here the only problem I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.310 
that could come here the only problem I
have<00:01:56.219> behind<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.090> can't<00:01:57.689> work<00:01:57.869> out<00:01:58.079> where

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
have behind it is I can't work out where

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.320 
have behind it is I can't work out where
you<00:01:58.500> how<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.740> would<00:01:58.950> get

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
you how you would get

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.870 
you how you would get
I<00:01:59.960> mean<00:02:00.440> for<00:02:00.650> you<00:02:01.130> for<00:02:01.370> in<00:02:01.460> order<00:02:01.670> for<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:01.850> to

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
I mean for you for in order for you to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.370 
I mean for you for in order for you to
get<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.180> other<00:02:02.330> chest<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.750> do<00:02:02.930> need<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.290> go

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
get the other chest you do need to go

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.170 
get the other chest you do need to go
into<00:02:03.500> gallant<00:02:03.890> labrum<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.820> would<00:02:04.970> need<00:02:05.150> to

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
into gallant labrum so it would need to

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.940 
into gallant labrum so it would need to
be<00:02:05.330> somewhere<00:02:05.720> between<00:02:05.960> Gorgons<00:02:06.500> labyrinth

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
be somewhere between Gorgons labyrinth

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.160 
be somewhere between Gorgons labyrinth
and<00:02:07.100> here<00:02:07.550> that<00:02:08.210> you<00:02:08.390> would<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.930> would<00:02:09.020> be

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
and here that you would you would be

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.020 
and here that you would you would be
able<00:02:09.320> to<00:02:09.380> get<00:02:09.530> into<00:02:09.680> this<00:02:10.220> area<00:02:10.490> if<00:02:10.790> it<00:02:10.880> does

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
able to get into this area if it does

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.600 
able to get into this area if it does
exist<00:02:11.290> now<00:02:12.290> another<00:02:12.710> interesting<00:02:12.980> thing<00:02:13.370> is

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
exist now another interesting thing is

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.220 
exist now another interesting thing is
if<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.880> look<00:02:14.030> at<00:02:14.150> where<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.330> hole<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:15.110> I

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
if you look at where the hole is if I

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.850 
if you look at where the hole is if I
walk<00:02:15.500> out<00:02:15.740> here<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.750> line<00:02:17.990> it<00:02:18.020> up<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.710> can

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
walk out here and you line it up you can

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.070 
walk out here and you line it up you can
see<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.610> lines<00:02:20.000> up<00:02:20.150> with<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.450> huge<00:02:20.810> part

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
see that it lines up with this huge part

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.230 
see that it lines up with this huge part
of<00:02:21.110> building<00:02:21.380> here<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.640> it's<00:02:22.790> right<00:02:23.060> before

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
of building here and it's right before

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.030 
of building here and it's right before
that's<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.900> doorway<00:02:24.350> effectively<00:02:24.740> lines<00:02:24.920> up

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
that's the doorway effectively lines up

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.220 
that's the doorway effectively lines up
with<00:02:25.130> here<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.520> obviously<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.540> gap<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.930> here

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
with here and obviously the gap is here

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.380 
with here and obviously the gap is here
where<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:28.010> build<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.340> finishes<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.270> would

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
where the build and finishes so it would

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.970 
where the build and finishes so it would
make<00:02:29.420> sense<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.930> not<00:02:30.320> only<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.770> another

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
make sense that not only is it another

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.590 
make sense that not only is it another
route<00:02:31.250> but<00:02:31.460> it's<00:02:31.610> contained<00:02:32.090> somewhere

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
route but it's contained somewhere

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.380 
route but it's contained somewhere
within<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:33.200> block<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.530> building<00:02:34.040> here<00:02:34.390> and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
within this block of building here and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.990 
within this block of building here and
that's<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.380> bit<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.590> gets<00:02:36.950> me<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.310> have<00:02:37.760> no

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
that's the bit that gets me I have no

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.960 
that's the bit that gets me I have no
way<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.390> getting<00:02:38.570> up<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.959> there<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.670> don't<00:02:40.670> know

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
way of getting up to there I don't know

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.670 
way of getting up to there I don't know
how<00:02:41.209> I've<00:02:41.390> tried<00:02:41.690> scaling<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:42.260> wall<00:02:42.470> I've

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
how I've tried scaling this wall I've

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.530 
how I've tried scaling this wall I've
scaled<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.310> wall<00:02:43.580> I'll<00:02:44.120> show<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.330> on<00:02:44.420> this

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
scaled this wall I'll show you on this

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.610 
scaled this wall I'll show you on this
side<00:02:44.720> actually<00:02:44.900> it's<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.170> bit<00:02:45.260> easier<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.530> see

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
side actually it's a bit easier to see

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.470 
side actually it's a bit easier to see
I've<00:02:45.920> scaled<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.730> other<00:02:46.910> side<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:47.420> wall

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
I've scaled the other side of this wall

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.870 
I've scaled the other side of this wall
on<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.230> side<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.740> I've<00:02:49.430> managed<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.790> get

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
on that side and I've managed to get

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.060 
on that side and I've managed to get
right<00:02:50.090> up<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.360> this<00:02:50.480> gap<00:02:50.720> here<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:51.800> can<00:02:51.920> get

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
right up to this gap here and I can get

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.280 
right up to this gap here and I can get
inside<00:02:52.310> there<00:02:52.670> but<00:02:52.970> after<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.390> I'm<00:02:53.840> kind<00:02:54.140> of

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
inside there but after that I'm kind of

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.449 
inside there but after that I'm kind of
lost<00:02:54.530> on<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.070> on<00:02:55.550> this<00:02:55.610> area<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.630> i'll<00:02:57.430> go<00:02:58.430> on

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
lost on this on this area so i'll go on

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.830 
lost on this on this area so i'll go on
the<00:02:58.670> other<00:02:58.790> side<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.120> point<00:02:59.360> out<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.600> you<00:02:59.660> guys

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.980 
how high i've managed to get and like i
said<00:03:01.520> it's<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.940> theory<00:03:02.180> it's<00:03:02.450> not<00:03:02.660> it's

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
said it's just a theory it's not it's

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.229 
said it's just a theory it's not it's
not<00:03:03.170> like<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.470> found<00:03:04.130> something<00:03:04.700> for<00:03:04.820> definite

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
not like I found something for definite

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.970 
not like I found something for definite
and<00:03:05.420> but<00:03:06.080> it's<00:03:06.170> just<00:03:06.350> a<00:03:06.440> little<00:03:06.530> something<00:03:06.709> to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
and but it's just a little something to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.229 
and but it's just a little something to
give<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.220> guys<00:03:07.340> an<00:03:07.489> idea<00:03:07.550> of<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.910> know<00:03:08.000> if<00:03:08.150> you

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
give you guys an idea of you know if you

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.509 
give you guys an idea of you know if you
if<00:03:08.450> people<00:03:08.780> are<00:03:08.870> only<00:03:09.380> going<00:03:09.890> on<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.190> ferries

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
if people are only going on the ferries

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.979 
if people are only going on the ferries
that<00:03:10.550> people<00:03:10.910> have<00:03:11.000> already<00:03:11.090> found<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:11.780> not

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
that people have already found and not

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.330 
that people have already found and not
really<00:03:12.200> find<00:03:12.410> any<00:03:12.560> for<00:03:12.709> now<00:03:12.800> it's<00:03:13.250> just

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
really find any for now it's just

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.770 
really find any for now it's just
another<00:03:13.760> little<00:03:13.910> something<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.480> take<00:03:14.630> your

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
another little something to take your

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.970 
another little something to take your
brain<00:03:14.989> over<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.410> make<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:15.650> think<00:03:15.860> about

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
brain over and make you think about

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.820 
brain over and make you think about
maybe<00:03:16.250> what<00:03:16.640> might<00:03:16.850> be<00:03:17.000> there<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.019> mean<00:03:18.200> how

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830

maybe what might be there so I mean how
I've<00:03:19.220> got<00:03:19.370> on<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.519> wall<00:03:19.670> is<00:03:19.850> basically<00:03:20.480> up

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
I've got on the wall is basically up

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.560 
I've got on the wall is basically up
there<00:03:21.890> at<00:03:22.370> where<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.790> bit<00:03:22.940> sticks<00:03:23.209> out<00:03:23.390> I'm

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.390 
right up the top I've managed to get
right<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.230> wear<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.500> little<00:03:30.650> gap<00:03:30.920> is<00:03:31.130> but<00:03:31.370> I

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
right to wear that little gap is but I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.820
