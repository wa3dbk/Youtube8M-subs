00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.710
 no no 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.290
 hello friends i am who am i gamer 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.180
 welcome to dribbling school 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.880
 where will I teach these 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.850
 that's how they saw that is one of the new 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.080
 exclusive dribbles for fifa 2015 and this 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.700
 once in our school video of 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.599
 dribble of who am I gamer I'm going to 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.599
 show how it's done 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.359
 before continuing, remember that if 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 they want to buy coins they can visit 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.780
 new figures easy the link is the 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.550
 inscription now if you look at this is called 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.559
 side twist four are needed 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.550
 stars in skilled movements to 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.769
 this will teach them how they can 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.690
 you choose your player from in the 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.909
 sand I literally have to move 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.680
 to play skill games throw to the 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.600
 right and until you are select 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.129
 Sand player can now use 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.199
 A player also thousand of 5 stars 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.850
 Soles as Cristiano Ronaldo but since 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.260
 4 onwards you can make this turn 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.149
 side I'm going to use for this to 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.020
 karim benzema who has 4 of you standing 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.579
 weak and 4 stars in working windows 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.420
 but you can also do it with 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:15.039
 those of 5 as I said not now well 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.149
 so they can get on this list and there 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.469
 see just have to pull the trigger 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.450
 right to change the screen and 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.069
 you can see all three of that player now 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.049
 I will explain the difference to the 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.030
 lateral twist and the makin spinel and the 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.890
 berbeis ping in another tutorial I already 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.350
 show how the maki is the verb espn 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.520
 spin I'm going to put link in this 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.920
 moment on the screen because this 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.000
 can see and practice and basically the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.439
 problem that I see in the makin 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.789
 spielberg or if they continue this 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.560
 trajectory if you see the player 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.119
 from above it goes on a trajectory 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.000
 direct and then turn right 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.380
 or to the right and down or to the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.599
 left or left down 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.209
 This helps you when you go running and 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:50.560
 you end the band you run out of the field and 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.239
 you want to stop and run 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.849
 exactly to the left or towards 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:56.979
 the right is not for that the verb serves you 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:58.899
 espinel majid spin because it's different 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.759
 the lateral turn in the trajectory 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.200
 of the lateral turn is different because no 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.450
 follow this trajectory that I am 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.530
 showing on screen non- intrusive to 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.750
 times when you want to arrive and 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.099
 attack the verb espinel majid spin what 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.269
 what they do is that they return instead of 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.400
 keep running forward in a 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.510
 left-right direction turns and 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.620
 a bit is returned back 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.209
 So that 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.640
 to the few problems now the 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.110
 lateral turn trajectory is this 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.409
 as you can see what it does is go 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.239
 running to the right and then gives a 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.220
 turn to the right and up or to 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.269
 the left and up that way if 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.060
 you are entering the small area 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.440
 you can use this well this turn 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.640
 side to keep running towards 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.769
 forward changing direction and 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.090
 moving the ball away from his opponent 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.310
 remember that the point of the dribbling is 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.959
 keep the opponent's ball as close as 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.150
 possible and cover it with the body too 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.260
 if possible then this turn is 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.160
 It is very good now, he explains 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.180
 a little bit the difference 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.829
 trajectories how it is done only 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.470
 they need the right lever of the stick 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.349
 right either playstation or xbox and go 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.739
 to be a touch down and 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.120
 diagonal right and down twice and 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.040
 to make them the left one does it in 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.989
 diagonal to the left and below a touch 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.879
 twice with the lever is very simple and 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.230
 the truth this is taking the perspective 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.459
 as going forward like this 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.310
 they are going to do the green comes towards the other 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.170
 not like I show you on the screen 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.200
 then basically na more are two 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.790
 touches of the right lever diagonally 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.310
 down left or diagonally 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.500
 down and right depending on the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.780
 side to where they want to leave now the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.400
 recommendation that I always give them go 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.620
 to the practice arena like I am 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.300
 show at that moment and practice what 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.489
 in all directions in all the 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.470
 facing backward forward 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.290
 towards all sides that are 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.880
 happen, practice how much this is going to 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.200
 serve remember if you do not practice 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.030
 his dribbling and not because everything arrives 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.640
 that I 'm going to teach you free kicks 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.140
 dribbles etc so this one like that one 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.489
 it rusts not to me happens sometimes I stop 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.260
 play a week for some problem 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.299
 I evaluate and suddenly I want to put 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.130
 haggle and I do not get out of the way 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.330
 the dribbles then you see here 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.470
 is giving you some examples of how 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.540
 You can practice it in the sand of 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.480
 practices since they feel quite 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.730
 confident that they do not know about each 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.380
 ten times that they do that seven or eight 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.450
 Sometimes they can go to practice 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.680
 a match in vigo now that if every time 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.630
 they do it so much better 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.190
 not now that there are some examples see how 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.650
 can serve them in a new one against 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.130
 the goalkeeper 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.540
 this lateral turn basically because it 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.150
 they can do very good things not nothing 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.100
 more have in mind the trajectory that 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.600
 is followed and they will see that it will serve them 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.280
 a lot when they enter the area when 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.410
 they are arriving by the band when they want 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.910
 cut and the defense already threw a 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.220
 Well sweep will help you 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.449
 quite not now you see how 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.830
 I use in a live match friends 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.470
 here are the examples of how 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.270
 you can use I hope you serve them 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.400
