so<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.490> I<00:03:23.790> kind<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.270> I'm<00:03:24.540> keen<00:03:24.900> on<00:03:25.170> it

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
so I like it I kind of I'm keen on it

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.930 
so I like it I kind of I'm keen on it
now<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.190> experiment<00:03:26.970> here<00:03:27.680> with<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.709> few<00:03:29.340> ideas

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
now I experiment here with a few ideas

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.500 
now I experiment here with a few ideas
for<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.750> roof<00:03:31.020> placement<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:33.060> kind<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.360> looks

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
for the roof placement it kind of looks

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.110 
for the roof placement it kind of looks
too<00:03:34.140> crowded<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.800> wasn't<00:03:35.130> keen<00:03:35.280> on<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.090> I

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
too crowded I wasn't keen on that so I

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.000 
too crowded I wasn't keen on that so I
just<00:03:36.270> kind<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.810> scrapped<00:03:37.170> everything<00:03:37.380> and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
just kind of scrapped everything and

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.400 
just kind of scrapped everything and
just<00:03:38.209> change<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.480> roof<00:03:39.690> up<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:40.050> little<00:03:40.200> bit

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
just change the roof up a little bit

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.610 
just change the roof up a little bit
back<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:41.160> simplistic<00:03:42.060> roof<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:43.320> I<00:03:43.380> tried<00:03:43.590> to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
back to a simplistic roof so I tried to

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.840 
back to a simplistic roof so I tried to
splice<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:44.010> off<00:03:44.100> couldn't<00:03:44.430> get<00:03:44.520> anything<00:03:44.700> that

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
splice it off couldn't get anything that

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.250 
splice it off couldn't get anything that
worked<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.209> wanted<00:03:45.600> I'm<00:03:45.720> not<00:03:45.870> too<00:03:45.989> good<00:03:46.200> with

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
worked I wanted I'm not too good with

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.490 
worked I wanted I'm not too good with
the<00:03:46.440> roofs<00:03:46.739> yet<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.310> can<00:03:47.820> never<00:03:47.940> find<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.720> roof<00:03:49.350> I

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
a pink skirting and then we change the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.890 
a pink skirting and then we change the
roof<00:03:55.500> tiles<00:03:55.739> get<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.850> right<00:03:57.030> color<00:03:57.270> what's

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
roof tiles get the right color what's

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.320

like still bright there's a couple of

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.790 
like still bright there's a couple of
options<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.810> was<00:04:00.930> keen<00:04:01.080> on<00:04:01.170> like<00:04:01.320> this<00:04:01.470> one<00:04:01.680> for

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
options I was keen on like this one for

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.130 
options I was keen on like this one for
instance<00:04:01.850> but<00:04:02.850> we<00:04:02.970> settled<00:04:03.330> on<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.540> pink<00:04:03.930> one

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
instance but we settled on a pink one

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.990 
instance but we settled on a pink one
and<00:04:04.320> then<00:04:05.010> we<00:04:05.070> have<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.250> replace<00:04:05.550> everything

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
and then we have to replace everything

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.970 
and then we have to replace everything
and<00:04:06.420> there<00:04:06.660> we<00:04:06.750> go<00:04:06.900> that's<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.590> it's<00:04:07.739> nighttime

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
and there we go that's it it's nighttime

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.640 
and there we go that's it it's nighttime
my<00:04:08.459> norick<00:04:08.820> take<00:04:09.540> forever<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:10.020> get<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.260> daytime

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
my norick take forever to get to daytime

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.330 
my norick take forever to get to daytime
so<00:04:10.770> I<00:04:10.800> can<00:04:10.920> be<00:04:11.010> bothered

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
so I can be bothered

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.760 
so I can be bothered
but<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.570> interior<00:04:13.020> we're<00:04:13.590> more

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770
