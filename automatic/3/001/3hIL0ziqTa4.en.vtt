00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.500
 this video here is for people who have already studied breath holding the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.950
 weight of the glucose that wrote chain 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.999
 and wants to go a little deeper into the operation 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:11.879
 give sitting 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.209
 Wish we started months. Let's take a look here. 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.220
 not all sutures draw here 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.160
 hugo or draft that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.810
 respiratory compliance 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 imagine here that the inner membrane of mitochondria 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.399
 these complexities exporters and food 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.310
 you imagined the letter 1 passing through here by the carriers and arriving 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:33.940
 on here 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.489
 he reacted with water 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.499
 and use brought in flowing through gross domestic space 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.640
 doing a positive side 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.800
 but negative alert here is another 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.179
 the last our famous leader in turkey knows 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.350
 this has other purposes is not ours 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.950
 our idea is that the proposal on this 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.280
 all with pt 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.830
 not beneficial 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.730
 structure that pike in the ability of tcp the cacique 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.400
 before 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.810
 Let's do it all 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.970
 of this molecule 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.320
 the tap is holy and 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.110
 to get a basic idea 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.900
 was composed of plus or minus 20 in nine that rise units 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.420
 and the following view evasion 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.420
 A lot of climb said that in practice they did 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.039
 that peace 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.409
 what peace to be 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.090
 from last night 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.930
 given dia membrane group turner of the mitochondria that the pat is from very sky 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.390
 session right 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.119
 for you it is better 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.910
 the membrane matters here 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.460
 it's too much then 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.460
 this part that the mitochondrial matrix is ​​here 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.300
 the usp seat me live in the foothills this one here 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.810
 it is located that on the inner membrane 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.990
 c it works as channel transmits soft 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.159
 she has many of the data supposedly coming back from day care 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.780
 but I covered the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.990
 I have the complainant here 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.830
 which is very important you understand that you are connected directly from 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:01.600
 this year 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.700
 and that garbage that is important you understand from it and that it is not a shaft 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.220
 it is a totally deformed axis and is not available speaks like this 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.990
 you see very well with unemployment 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.120
 What I did here 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.299
 in this game 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.809
 he insists on title 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:23.229
 by interiors that part of that part that is meager it is composed of 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.569
 six up unit only 6 and she only 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.199
 they alphabet alphabet 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.950
 then these have excess units here 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.099
 they had an axis the shocking one half of them passes in the middle of them 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.220
 so you imagine 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.300
 she quotes the pulpit insisted 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.620
 this way here 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.260
 This is very important for you to compete with the operation and it is here in the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.379
 part that is wire 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.790
 already occurs so what if really atp is here let's say so 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.620
 becky 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.219
 in the part that is the son of tpc taxco have performed 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:01.600
 then it catalyzed the tepco efe borges did because that part that holds up 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.040
 part way have three dtp molecules 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.430
 little I think you've located yourself here 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.259
 Let's provide a lot of it. 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:13.519
 pop you think you have high concentration of your own 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.029
 the years are passing bomb in the protoss sachets attach as mine 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:17.879
 own 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.000
 your own 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.109
 There's time to go back. 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.159
 our neighbor 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.859
 attracted that this negative charge also attracts the 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.069
 come back 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.699
 I imagine we propose here in the Olympic 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.120
 he struggles tomorrow we are ready 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.120
 he tries to khanal aquino has proposed 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:37.849
 and when he enters 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.959
 he beats that in that part that 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.760
 deficit was what makes it attached to his image in 3d with the city 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.990
 but if it generates then here are many projects hour 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.649
 can be here each has its fitting 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:55.419
 so when it comes when the product in coming crash but this apparent 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.229
 that part 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.619
 so when the project occurs through other sites 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:04.569
 He leaves 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.650
 and come back from pop-rock ipad entered 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.429
 of the mitochondrial matrix 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:11.579
 and of course I said that from 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.559
 f 0 is on 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:14.919
 to the axis 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.489
 this when what she turned the elderly also rotates 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.079
 so what about a cat leap 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.680
 1 axis rotates 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.640
 it causes a cost with formations some deformations like say yes 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.210
 in the profile part in the rise says that half-yearly 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.020
 some with formations 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.699
 these colors are in these formations 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:38.620
 that I 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.759
 the formula carpet molecule 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:41.650
 on here 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.000
 in the background in the background 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.969
 I wrote here you have 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.529
 o to dp but phosphate 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:52.289
 and when the pixi ricky chains and provocation the possession of information is 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.759
 The Crow The Color Change Training 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.759
 here the molecule part down that pull-thrust 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.710
 the chicken pox the atp line but the phosphate forming the atp 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:05.889
 It's what I have training. 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.009
 from atp this way 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.269
 so that's why they say that when atp no cache spins 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:14.919
 form the attack more 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:20.360
 she does not take a whole part of the tpc táchira the part that is here near here 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.699
 all of your own is to the boy what is here 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:29.720
 and the crossed that in the membrane nene in the inner membrane mitochondria 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.900
 this part has an axis 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.760
 in photo 2 it has sensitivity if it quantifies the molecules edp but phosphate 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.900
 and when the next past the cbat team 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.470
 go out loot will call 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.770
 they will have been motors proposed the driving force of the own 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.069
 will take the ifif iran realistic some changes and deformations down here 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:54.490
 these deformations cost in hand with 60% soon 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.120
 forming leonildo the mp but the phosphate forming ours the attack 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.980
 I think I did not say more here in the protest channel 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.449
 it hangs here 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.139
 even in the lower part here of the cpt davi presented actually works as 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:12.930
 a height as you can see 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.980
 he is short on the outer axis of the structure 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.580
 the average amount will help 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.090
 anchor really the head that wants the team to head the gaap base is the crowning 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.590
 the mistake was made 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.189
 a son thinking well run up slopes smart is simple 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.129
 It's like a turbine. 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:34.729
 It's how I can always do surgery. 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.800
 I imagine that the hydrogenation of water in a dam 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.770
 etc. atp quote the turbine the water passes through the nodes 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.210
 beat on the turbine 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.970
 does it spin inside a generator and does it generate electric power 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:52.169
 it's the same thing this is chemical energy 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:55.169
 It does arise here everywhere did it 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.589
 as if it were the turbine coming to the generator here and down to the wire 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.460
 that here 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.689
 generate chemical energy let's talk like this 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:07.759
 I produce atp 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.379
 from dpi 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:13.069
 but the fact is that the fall there has a more cute drawing a little bit 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:15.690
 You see the part here. 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.659
 f 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:19.409
 here and they did 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:23.330
 the shaft here removed in here now the shaft you do not know name quoted in 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.639
 on here 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.580
 to part 1 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.830
 profile you can even imagine the surprise the part you 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.639
 from here the interim arrives nor imagines Uíge the turning here and making course of 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.210
 here everything that 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.029
 forming by leaving the molecule 

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:42.080
 in front of tv 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.669
 Good, I hope, Beijing. I hope I have contributed to Beijing. 

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:49.639
 on the operation of atp feel like this 

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:54.789
 I think it worked out better with the cisco branch of this 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:57.199
 by the molecule and even more to all
