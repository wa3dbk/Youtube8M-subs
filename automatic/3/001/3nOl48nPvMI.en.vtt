00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.700
 hi friends for the last months we 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.280
 taken with you a lot of rations 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.009
 strong guys and only one diet fragile 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.109
 girl Victoria and of course for all this 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.590
 time I feel that discontent in 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.000
 the beautiful half of humanity is growing 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.039
 Victoria Yushkevich me permanent pin 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.930
 this says denis let's break it down 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.119
 you diet any fitness girls 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.769
 any fitness champion I decided 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.050
 the time has come but instead 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.530
 choose one representative 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.469
 fitness form I decided to analyze 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.329
 set of rules in nutrition 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.879
 diets and some principles that 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.469
 guided by girls known in 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.870
 so let's say the Internet may not be very 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.930
 known among the world of show business but 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.760
 famous fitness communities for example in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.579
 youtube, that is, I can tell you exactly 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.219
 one girl who led in your time 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.170
 multiple releases on bodyrock tv by 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.710
 Name Suzanne I hope the, that you its 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.239
 I personally saw me she just 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.250
 endless impressed with their releases 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.650
 firstly its charm secondly 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.580
 their physical form in the third its 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.409
 exercise 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.180
 the intensity with which she makes these 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.770
 exercises from which she is able 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.369
 withstand that is she as one of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.229
 samples 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.640
 physical form which I think 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.530
 girls can strive though 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.040
 Naturally all tastes any different 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.610
 case 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.640
 nutrition principles fitness specialists 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.060
 today will be discussed here first 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.390
 principle 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.869
 all products must be fresh no 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.490
 packaged processed 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.640
 recycled refined products 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.869
 and for sure nothing with skim marks 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.420
 or cleverly 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.310
 the second principle you should eat from two 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.820
 up to four small plates of vegetables 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.100
 daily 3 need to drink 34 liters of water 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.590
 almost every day 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.299
 don't drink enough water fourth 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.759
 principle one third of the daily diet 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.880
 should consist of low-fat sources 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.340
 squirrel chicken turkey fish tofu egg 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.210
 protein milk products serving 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.220
 protein must be included in every meal 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.860
 This allows you to stabilize the level 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.630
 blood sugar and helps control 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.330
 the head that is gives a feeling of satiety 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.360
 5 need the correct fats but not in any way 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.480
 case, you can not overdo it 56 nuts to 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.000
 almond and tablespoon avocado plus 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.470
 jerome protein sources will accurately supply 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.310
 our body is sufficient 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.620
 fat 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.989
 sixth exclude from the diet all 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.180
 starchy foods no 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.390
 white rice pasta bread 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.090
 No seventh confectionery 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.620
 alcohol alcohol completely 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.930
 stops fat metabolism 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.470
 in energy quality and slows the exchange 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.989
 substances 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.350
 thereby throwing you back in the fight 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.790
 for super shape 8 you need to eat 5-6 times per 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.910
 a day every two to three hours 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.500
 9 use protein mixtures but without 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.560
 artificial flavorings and 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.690
 sugar substitutes 10 need to be creative 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.610
 in the kitchen not to be tired of eating one and 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.970
 also constantly but with this last 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.620
 point impossible to disagree 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.230
 Generally guys if generally summarize 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.540
 these items are all certainly correct i am from 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.430
 souls can say yes girls 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.360
 really if you can 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.269
 eat 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.640
 we will probably just crawl on 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.519
 earth and already generally will not be 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.260
 look except for you nothing 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.150
 it will be interesting to us in this world too 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.690
 what will be around a lot of beautiful 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.280
 great girls but can you live 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.700
 by such principles this is good 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.220
 question 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.950
 try write about it girls i 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.930
 I urge you whether it is possible to live under Athens 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.190
 on such principles and generally feel 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.049
 yourself a normal person 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.180
 but no less striving for this need 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.130
 do not despair if you fail 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.870
 100 percent follow like this 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.750
 principle in nutrition seems to me that this 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.060
 practically not achievable but 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.040
 for a period of time maybe as 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.959
 landmark this should you have let's 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.910
 remember the last principle of creativity on 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.350
 the kitchen is not tired of eating the same thing 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.620
 that's exactly what i'm trying to do 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.130
 today thanks to the recipe 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.040
 answer 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:11.660
 asparagus zucchini pepper david some pepper 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.760
 sweet peppers and tomatoes 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.370
 but how much do you see it yourself 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.500
 there it was written in the principles of these 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.790
 trained girls not less oil 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.680
 4 plates of vegetables 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.160
 here we have three plates to run but so 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.670
 plus or minus is correct so the temperature 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.410
 high low which put higher 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.610
 maximum 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.430
 Well, let's do the maximum for now 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.840
 Now why close the stew correctly 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.130
 stew know close 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.480
 let's discuss some principles 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.090
 remember there was a prince and about that 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.710
 no bagged processed 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.470
 recycled including khadi 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.460
 semi-finished products are also not recommended we 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.560
 everything is so 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.790
 now we live in stress we have no time 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.130
 cook what we like 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.350
 naturally it is more convenient to grab what is already 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.650
 cooked or half cooked 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.420
 either packed for us comfortable guys but 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.750
 it is here at this table 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.020
 I personally learned to understand what 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.450
 cook stuff from raw foods 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.850
 very quickly that is possible for some 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.330
 the minutes we buy sometimes these 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.250
 finished products but i can say here i am 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.810
 0 in cooking but at least as much as already 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.180
 Greek already experienced from the fact 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.850
 nifiga not so here but nevertheless what 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.440
 I cook guys 10 times better than that 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.420
 what am I going to buy at some hour in 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.610
 this very supermarket is ready for it 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.800
 you do not bring to find there is a 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.690
 the main thing as a century will tell I am not complaining 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.460
 similar discomfort is it really 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.670
 so that the cube is just what they have prepared 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.520
 others then just lies siege stone 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.710
 your face is delicious to prevent centuries you 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.689
 today, the team is still good for me 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:49.039
 like this prevented 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:52.860
 by the way here is my way 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:56.579
 need geology I have been told for centuries 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:59.969
 that fry tomatoes badly you say 

00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:03.419
 our viewers from behind the camera this 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:05.969
 really so these are just the ones for those 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.509
 who is interested in physical education 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:10.469
 Now you have friends who 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.329
 preaching this topic saying that 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:14.099
 tomatoes and so intermediate so 

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:17.129
 what is the name rough or here's above the mountain 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:19.559
 it is a vegetable that causes passion and not 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:21.539
 watched medor using his passion up 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:24.269
 in charge of the passion that with him on 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:24.839
 Germans tomatoes and will chase for 

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:26.999
 gryazovets 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.979
 guys now i'm passionate tomatoes from 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:31.379
 I'll pour the cream shorter here 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.389
 here's the cream as it was written in these 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:34.649
 Principles no both fatty foods 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.349
 just probably by a little bit 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:39.089
 fatty yes or a kind of purpose is cream 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:40.739
 ten percent century and suggested but 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:42.959
 there is a minimum amount 

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:44.279
 to people seventy fifty 

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:46.589
 fifty seventy 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:49.999
 10 percent to heart grams of fat 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:49.999
 it's not scary 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.689
 great keys would prevent included 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:58.889
 cream rumbled 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:05.680
 I murmured and knocked 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:09.189
 take a walk the same age female diet now 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.460
 you will try the first and so 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:16.379
 I am already all against under course of me 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.379
 everyone constantly asks to feed Vika 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.950

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.900
 although 

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:41.480
 naturally better for girls to be victims 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:43.010
 heavy not to lift but all the same 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.460
 still be mobile 

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.810
 it is accurate and strive to reduce 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.220
 percentage composition of adipose tissue in 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.280
 Let us call it so
