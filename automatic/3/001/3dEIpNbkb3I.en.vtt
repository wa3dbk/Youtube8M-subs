to<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> headstand<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.840> then<00:01:55.290> fall<00:01:55.560> over<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
to a headstand and then fall over and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.580 
to a headstand and then fall over and
then<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> end<00:01:56.880> up<00:01:57.030> landing<00:01:57.350> flat<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.560> your

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
then you end up landing flat on your

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.649 
then you end up landing flat on your
back<00:01:58.860> which<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.850> what<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.210> want<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.479> do

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
back which is not what you want to do

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.480 
back which is not what you want to do
it's<00:02:00.960> kind<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.740> kind<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.070> starts<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
it's kind of it kind of starts with the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.950 
it's kind of it kind of starts with the
basic<00:02:02.880> idea<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.299> putting<00:02:03.539> your<00:02:03.600> hands<00:02:03.810> down

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
basic idea of putting your hands down

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.620 
basic idea of putting your hands down
putting<00:02:04.710> your<00:02:04.890> head<00:02:05.070> down<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.579> rolling<00:02:05.820> but

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
putting your head down and rolling but

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.900 
putting your head down and rolling but
if<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.380> don't<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.679> that<00:02:07.829> nice<00:02:08.099> arch<00:02:08.550> back

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
if you don't have that nice arch back

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.240 
if you don't have that nice arch back
you're<00:02:09.450> gonna<00:02:09.539> flop<00:02:09.929> over<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.920> right<00:02:11.009> so

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
you're gonna flop over all right so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.580 
you're gonna flop over all right so
let's<00:02:11.400> try<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.120> hand<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.630> down<00:02:12.840> I'm

sitting up my head goes through and I I
almost<00:02:17.730> have<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.269> it<00:02:18.390> all<00:02:18.599> together<00:02:19.110> I

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
almost have to do it all together I

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.040 
almost have to do it all together I
can't<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:19.890> like<00:02:20.069> do<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:20.849> slow<00:02:21.269> as<00:02:21.660> soon<00:02:21.870> as<00:02:21.959> I

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
can't just like do it slow as soon as I

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.850 
can't just like do it slow as soon as I
go<00:02:22.200> here<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.680> go<00:02:23.069> through<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.450> roll<00:02:24.709> if<00:02:25.709> you

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
go here I go through and I roll if you

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.280 
go here I go through and I roll if you
notice<00:02:26.190> as<00:02:26.760> soon<00:02:26.819> as<00:02:27.239> my<00:02:27.450> head<00:02:27.720> went<00:02:28.080> through

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
notice as soon as my head went through

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.620 
notice as soon as my head went through
it<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.560> just<00:02:28.860> my<00:02:29.430> back<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.940> kind<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.269> rolled

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
it I just my back just kind of rolled

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.199 
it I just my back just kind of rolled
over<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.190> try<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.519> one<00:02:32.610> more<00:02:32.760> time

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
over so try it one more time

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.550 
over so try it one more time
my<00:02:33.510> hands<00:02:33.870> are<00:02:33.989> here<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.760> touch<00:02:35.760> my<00:02:35.940> head<00:02:36.180> under

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
my hands are here I touch my head under

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.220 
my hands are here I touch my head under
and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:38.489> roll<00:02:38.870> all<00:02:39.870> right

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and I roll all right

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.070 
and I roll all right
again<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:41.400> have<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.819> have<00:02:41.849> that<00:02:42.180> rounded<00:02:42.810> back

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
again you have to have that rounded back

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.180 
again you have to have that rounded back
in<00:02:43.349> order<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> roll<00:02:44.060> safely<00:02:45.060> okay<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:46.560> once<00:02:47.099> you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
in order to roll safely okay so once you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.069 
in order to roll safely okay so once you
get<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.370> down<00:02:47.670> we're<00:02:48.269> going<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.450> try<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.720> from

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
get that down we're going to try it from

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.979 
get that down we're going to try it from
standing<00:02:49.829> which<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.130> whole<00:02:50.459> another<00:02:50.640> thing

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
standing which is a whole another thing

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.830 
standing which is a whole another thing
standing<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.730> again<00:02:53.730> another<00:02:54.120> step<00:02:54.510> because

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
standing is again another step because

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.390 
standing is again another step because
it's<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.560> little<00:02:55.799> more<00:02:55.890> dangerous<00:02:56.040> you're

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
it's a little more dangerous you're

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.180 
it's a little more dangerous you're
higher<00:02:56.640> off<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.910> ground<00:02:57.350> so<00:02:58.350> we're<00:02:58.920> start

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
higher off the ground so we're start

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.780 
higher off the ground so we're start
from<00:02:59.310> here

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
from here

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.500 
from here
we're<00:03:00.209> 410<00:03:00.600> we're<00:03:01.200> top<00:03:01.470> rocking<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.359> then<00:03:03.359> we

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
we're 410 we're top rocking and then we

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.190 
we're 410 we're top rocking and then we
go<00:03:03.660> down<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.200> floor<00:03:05.090> again<00:03:06.090> same<00:03:06.900> thing

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
go down to the floor again same thing

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.090 
go down to the floor again same thing
and<00:03:07.670> down<00:03:09.560> head<00:03:10.560> goes<00:03:10.829> through<00:03:11.359> Rome<00:03:12.530> okay<00:03:13.530> so

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
and down head goes through Rome okay so

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.789 
and down head goes through Rome okay so
let's<00:03:14.459> try<00:03:14.639> to<00:03:14.730> go<00:03:14.970> into<00:03:15.329> footwork<00:03:15.840> say<00:03:16.109> we<00:03:16.650> can

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
let's try to go into footwork say we can

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.819 
let's try to go into footwork say we can
do<00:03:16.889> a<00:03:16.920> CC<00:03:17.519> or<00:03:17.910> we<00:03:18.209> can<00:03:18.389> do<00:03:18.510> like<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.810> chicken

I'm going to go jump roll check out all
right<00:03:30.690> seems<00:03:31.500> basic<00:03:31.829> but<00:03:32.430> again<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:32.970> is

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
right seems basic but again this is

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.330 
right seems basic but again this is
