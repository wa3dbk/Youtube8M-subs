once<00:00:09.350> I<00:00:09.650> was<00:00:09.920> a<00:00:09.950> puddle<00:00:10.250> I<00:00:10.640> was<00:00:11.150> liquefied

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
once I was a puddle I was liquefied

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.799 
once I was a puddle I was liquefied
thinking<00:00:13.280> I<00:00:13.400> would<00:00:13.790> stay<00:00:14.030> forever<00:00:14.270> by<00:00:14.750> this

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
thinking I would stay forever by this

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.740 
thinking I would stay forever by this
old<00:00:15.290> roadside<00:00:15.650> and<00:00:16.460> I<00:00:16.970> spent<00:00:17.300> oh<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:17.420> many

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
old roadside and I spent oh so many

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.950 
old roadside and I spent oh so many
nights<00:00:18.250> hoping<00:00:19.250> that<00:00:19.520> the<00:00:19.670> Sun<00:00:19.910> would<00:00:20.060> rise<00:00:20.119> to

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
nights hoping that the Sun would rise to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.530 
nights hoping that the Sun would rise to
give<00:00:21.170> me<00:00:21.380> energy<00:00:21.650> enough<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:22.760> I<00:00:22.790> could<00:00:23.029> head<00:00:23.510> up

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
give me energy enough so I could head up

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.589 
give me energy enough so I could head up
to<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.050> sky<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:24.919> then<00:00:25.220> snap<00:00:26.680> evaporate<00:00:28.599> my

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
to the sky and then snap evaporate my

molecules<00:00:29.930> were<00:00:30.650> spreading<00:00:30.980> out<00:00:31.250> I<00:00:31.279> headed<00:00:32.029> up

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
molecules were spreading out I headed up

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.080 
molecules were spreading out I headed up
to<00:00:32.360> space<00:00:32.689> but<00:00:33.320> it<00:00:33.500> was<00:00:33.710> chilly<00:00:34.130> in<00:00:34.310> the<00:00:34.489> air

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.350 
to space but it was chilly in the air
condensation<00:00:36.079> did<00:00:36.560> occur<00:00:36.829> so<00:00:37.610> I<00:00:37.640> joined<00:00:37.910> this

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
condensation did occur so I joined this

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.600

of<00:00:38.510> other<00:00:38.690> molecules<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:39.920> headed<00:00:40.340> for<00:00:40.370> the
