00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hi guys, in today's video I came 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.839
 Talk about something I really like 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.220
 I do not know if you like but I adore 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.010
 food 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.389
 So here in Brazilians like you 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.150
 You know I had the opportunity to 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.029
 try food from all over the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.210
 also know a little about the slow pizza and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.400
 dundo ishii are good American food 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.590
 know some things that are common 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.590
 here a list of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.990
 things that I noticed are good 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.669
 different are cool to say one 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.410
 little bit you mop but you can not 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.710
 missing is the pizza that comes from any 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.110
 place not super cheap logic type of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.350
 cheap the second is a report 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.260
 the hot dog here it's kind of nothing compared 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.090
 with the end of the Brazilian he is the bread 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.610
 and the sausage and broke people 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.649
 usually with him at the stadium when 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:02.489
 them to a baseball game the game of 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:05.250
 football and with the bun he makes a 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.090
 drawing and people usually 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.299
 with him in the stadium when this game has 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.220
 played and I'm 23 with cinnamon so it 's 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:23.580
 nothing but a loaf is the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:28.560
 the third is what is the burrito that in the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.710
 The truth is Mexican but just as the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.710
 Mexico 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:43.340
 It's so good, it 's just like it. 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:48.899
 what is a clay lay spoken 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.329
 I want to go ready it was very delicious 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.049
 very cool, I really liked it when 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.479
 I arrived now, not so much that it was 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.850
 very different was the coca cola 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.350
 Coca cola that comes to us 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.180
 see United States and either 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.250
 twig anywhere you sell in Brazil 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.369
 has 16 because the fourth thing is 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.620
 the ice scratch card they have here 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.370
 so then these places open it 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.770
 You always have this ice scratch card and 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.150
 the school with the taste I think so bad 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.380
 So bad, I do not know why this does. 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.959
 so much success here 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.970
 the kids love this with so much that I 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.060
 choose in red blue 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.910
 I'm not much of a fan, very clear. 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.560
 that calls attention here in the state - is the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.520
 portion size for example a cup 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.260
 small dollar is kind average size 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.720
 almost big will be the big one in brazil 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.420
 because gigantic things do not 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.700
 has as it is the following here the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.950
 actions are divided into the pizza that is 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.950
 small to medium small child 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.020
 great for me is that here is great 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.090
 really serious because things are 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.230
 very large have no need to 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.910
 study 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.370
 Another interesting thing is also that 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.340
 for example in my college when you define 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.660
 when I ate a side sandwich like 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:14.080
 Sandwich it is natural that it sold and the salad 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.430
 she lived apart and had bread with 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.200
 cheese and I do not know anything like that 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.120
 easy to drink wine in a separate bag 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.350
 for you to throw away then the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:32.560
 society that it is already playing outside 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:38.380
 Like if you want something else too 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.660
 which I met when it was that me in 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.269
 November when I have a chocolate 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.700
 hot where he puts the marshmallow I 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.470
 I do not know the person just needs to be ordinary 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.299
 I've never done it before and it went well 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.400
 cool because the marshmallow it gets 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.840
 melts a hot chocolate is more 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.790
 It's very delicious for me 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.890
 is a very American thing very typical 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.799
 same could not be the 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.930
 time is the apple pie and also has 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.799
 the top that the father that the pumpkin pie 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:14.520
 that they run but in the 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:17.520
 halloween is also very cool are usimec 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.520
 OK 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.710
 they eat even salty snacks to serve 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.660
 people put there the doritos and that's it 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.979
 that they eat during the floods that 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.840
 they make a house and such 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.220
 It is very interesting that the thigh also 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.440
 It was one thing that was very 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.340
 strange to me that is the fact that they 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.889
 put slaughter on everything because so I 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.620
 only consumed avocado with sugar in the mine 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.900
 for such very tasty but here they 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.570
 eat food says fable lipsticks to such 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.949
 so much so that water gets wet stays the dish 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.220
 made with the model I never had 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:57.000
 and when I tried it that way I 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.789
 I only tried because I had a girl. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.550
 that she ate of our very good 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.889
 very good and I thought it can not be is not 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.320
 possible to experiment and it is 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.240
 look at what I did not like when 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.949
 I tried it, I loved it 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.680
 I learned to do with molly now I do 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.690
 always very tasty and now as with 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.560
 Anything is very cool. 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.449
 cool even okay that already has a 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.960
 Chic has avocado but I always found it 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:28.270
 strange but now I with io 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.169
 is recommended last and not least 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:35.110
 important is the language no case 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:38.590
 thinking and pioneering has anywhere and 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.270
 but got used to film for the 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.460
 children when they want to raise money is 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.770
 good and old but nothing is because he 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.930
 really consumes quite excited 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.610
 I took the side is cleaner here nothing 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.800
 in the United States because when you 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.889
 will steal something they offer 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.510
 a queue before a lemonade around the 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.039
 country had a lemonade 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.470
 so it is something that well in culture 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.849
 It's really good, I really liked it. 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.130
 That I said fact that Brazil did not 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:07.090
 They used to drink lots of lemonade. 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.409
 but now I'm going to do it so this is it 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.900
