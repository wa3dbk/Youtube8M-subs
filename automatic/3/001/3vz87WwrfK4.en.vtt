00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
new set of summoner spells almost all of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.670 
new set of summoner spells almost all of
them<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.340> changed<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.030> some<00:00:33.300> way<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:34.020> let's

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
them have changed in some way so let's

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.250 
them have changed in some way so let's
talk<00:00:34.980> about<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.690> before<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> meat

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
talk about it before we get to the meat

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.930 
talk about it before we get to the meat
of<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.440> though<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.829> need<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> mention<00:00:38.370> cooldowns

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
of it though I need to mention cooldowns

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.840 
of it though I need to mention cooldowns
except<00:00:39.930> for<00:00:40.079> flash<00:00:40.410> cooldown<00:00:41.219> reduction<00:00:41.399> has

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
except for flash cooldown reduction has

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.670 
except for flash cooldown reduction has
been<00:00:42.030> completely<00:00:42.480> removed<00:00:42.899> from<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> spell

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
been completely removed from the spell

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.819 
been completely removed from the spell
masteries<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> nerve<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.500> summoner

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
masteries so this is a nerve to summoner

masteries so this is a nerve to summoner

spells in general I'm not really going

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.990 
spells in general I'm not really going
to<00:00:49.200> mention<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.620> when<00:00:49.800> comparing<00:00:50.340> unless<00:00:50.820> it's

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to mention it when comparing unless it's

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.939 
to mention it when comparing unless it's
important<00:00:51.710> so<00:00:52.969> first<00:00:53.969> off<00:00:54.210> clairvoyance<00:00:55.170> with

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
important so first off clairvoyance with

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.760 
important so first off clairvoyance with
its<00:00:56.129> new<00:00:56.460> much<00:00:57.090> less<00:00:57.390> angular<00:00:57.989> art<00:00:58.260> has

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
received a definite nerf not only has

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.380 
received a definite nerf not only has
the<00:01:01.500> cooldown<00:01:01.890> been<00:01:02.160> increased<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.270> the

the cooldown been increased but the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.910 
the cooldown been increased but the
length<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.719> time<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.140> reveals<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
length of time it reveals with the

length of time it reveals with the
mastery<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.519> down<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.970> 8<00:01:06.090> seconds<00:01:06.590> this<00:01:07.590> is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
mastery is down to 8 seconds this is

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.620 
mastery is down to 8 seconds this is
entirely<00:01:08.130> understandable<00:01:08.850> well<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.479> how

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
entirely understandable well with how

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.300 
entirely understandable well with how
often<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.380> how<00:01:10.500> long<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.860> could<00:01:10.979> use<00:01:11.189> it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
often for how long you could use it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.760 
often for how long you could use it
before<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.140> essentially<00:01:13.140> had<00:01:13.290> sight<00:01:13.619> on

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
before you essentially had sight on

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.649 
before you essentially had sight on
whatever<00:01:14.040> area<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> map<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.119> wanted<00:01:15.420> for

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
whatever area of the map you wanted for

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.530 
whatever area of the map you wanted for
most<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> game<00:01:16.759> regardless<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.330> still

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
most of the game regardless it's still

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.539 
most of the game regardless it's still
totally<00:01:18.750> worth<00:01:19.049> taking<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.890> not

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
totally worth taking just not

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.280 
totally worth taking just not
necessarily<00:01:21.299> something<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.780> need<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:21.960> every

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
necessarily something you need in every

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.620 
necessarily something you need in every
single<00:01:22.470> game<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.610> these<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:24.509> we're

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
single game and these that's what we're

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.249 
single game and these that's what we're
at<00:01:24.689> school<00:01:25.080> was<00:01:25.320> we'll<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:26.040> how<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.220> goes

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
at school was we'll see how that goes

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.840 
at school was we'll see how that goes
clarity<00:01:28.259> hasn't<00:01:28.560> changed<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> mastery

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
clarity hasn't changed but the mastery

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.700 
clarity hasn't changed but the mastery
has<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:31.079> mentioned<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.770> previous<00:01:32.369> video

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
has as I mentioned in the previous video

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.410 
has as I mentioned in the previous video
more<00:01:34.710> mana<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.700> less<00:01:35.850> mana<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.329> your

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
more mana for you but less mana for your

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.870 
more mana for you but less mana for your
allies<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.950> needed<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.250> mana<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.759> is

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
allies so if you needed the mana this is

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.270 
allies so if you needed the mana this is
great<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.920> got<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
great for you but if you got it

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.370 
great for you but if you got it
partially<00:01:41.549> as<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> support<00:01:42.390> spell<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:42.960> much

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
partially as a support spell it's much

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.600 
partially as a support spell it's much
worse<00:01:44.720> now<00:01:45.720> cleanse<00:01:46.110> can't<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.920> used<00:01:47.100> nearly

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
worse now cleanse can't be used nearly

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.950 
worse now cleanse can't be used nearly
as<00:01:47.820> often<00:01:48.140> but<00:01:49.140> when<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.460> badass<00:01:50.960> it

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
as often but when you do it's badass it

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.510 
as often but when you do it's badass it
cleanses<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> damage<00:01:52.829> over<00:01:53.100> time<00:01:53.130> from

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
cleanses the damage over time from

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.719 
cleanses the damage over time from
ignite<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.479> worthy<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.380> note<00:01:55.590> not<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.520> mark

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
ignite but worthy of note not the mark

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.179 
ignite but worthy of note not the mark
that<00:01:56.939> reduces<00:01:57.420> healing<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.040> it<00:01:59.040> also

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
that reduces healing and it also

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.940 
that reduces healing and it also
cleanses<00:01:59.729> exhaust<00:02:00.119> off<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
cleanses exhaust off and if you have the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.730 
cleanses exhaust off and if you have the
mastery<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.729> lasts<00:02:03.210> longer<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.350> maybe<00:02:04.530> you

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
mastery it lasts longer so maybe you

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.560 
mastery it lasts longer so maybe you
can't<00:02:05.009> use<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.460> often<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:06.000> you'd<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.149> but

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
can't use it as often as you'd like but

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.419 
can't use it as often as you'd like but
it<00:02:07.079> will<00:02:07.170> help<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> team<00:02:07.799> fights<00:02:08.129> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
it will help in the team fights and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.010 
it will help in the team fights and
hopefully<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> won't<00:02:09.270> get<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.599> trouble<00:02:09.629> in

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
hopefully you won't get in trouble in

like we just mentioned but if you're

flash<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.590> can<00:02:30.010> see<00:02:30.430> why<00:02:30.580> they<00:02:30.730> did<00:02:30.790> this

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
flash so I can see why they did this

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.050 
flash so I can see why they did this
perfectly<00:02:31.720> understandable<00:02:32.970> speaking<00:02:33.970> of

spell whose mastery increase is cool it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.940

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
increases cooldowns now but honestly

ghost<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.970> talked<00:02:55.210> about<00:02:55.300> in<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.630> last<00:02:55.660> video

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
ghost I talked about in the last video

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.720 
ghost I talked about in the last video
and<00:02:56.530> there's<00:02:56.650> honestly<00:02:56.830> not<00:02:57.220> much<00:02:57.280> else<00:02:57.610> to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
and there's honestly not much else to

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.120 
and there's honestly not much else to
say<00:02:58.030> about<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:59.170> move<00:02:59.350> faster<00:02:59.800> but<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.040> a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
say about it you move faster but in a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.650 
say about it you move faster but in a
shorter<00:03:00.400> time<00:03:00.430> frame<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.240> mastery

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
shorter time frame with the mastery

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.590 
shorter time frame with the mastery
shrug<00:03:02.590> as<00:03:03.250> some<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.820> mentioned<00:03:04.240> though<00:03:04.420> in

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
shrug as some of you mentioned though in

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.480 
shrug as some of you mentioned though in
the<00:03:04.690> comments<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.350> so<00:03:05.830> probably<00:03:06.220> make<00:03:06.460> it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
the comments and so probably make it

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.520 
the comments and so probably make it
more<00:03:06.850> useful<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.480> early<00:03:07.750> game<00:03:07.930> due<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.320> the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
more useful in the early game due to the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.610 
more useful in the early game due to the
diminishing<00:03:09.010> returns<00:03:09.760> on<00:03:10.180> speed<00:03:10.720> in<00:03:11.290> other

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
diminishing returns on speed in other

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.200 
diminishing returns on speed in other
words<00:03:11.890> you'll<00:03:12.280> get<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.460> bigger<00:03:12.700> boost<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
words you'll get a bigger boost in the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.420 
words you'll get a bigger boost in the
early<00:03:13.510> game<00:03:13.690> by<00:03:14.320> virtue<00:03:14.530> of<00:03:14.740> not<00:03:15.070> being

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
early game by virtue of not being

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.930 
early game by virtue of not being
particularly<00:03:15.970> fast<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.480> start<00:03:16.750> with<00:03:17.940> he'll

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
particularly fast to start with he'll

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.640 
particularly fast to start with he'll
has<00:03:19.090> been<00:03:19.270> buffed<00:03:19.480> considerably<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.380> time

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
has been buffed considerably this time

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.949 
has been buffed considerably this time
so<00:03:21.100> maybe<00:03:21.490> people<00:03:21.880> will<00:03:21.970> start<00:03:22.240> using<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.690> an

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
so maybe people will start using it an

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.230 
so maybe people will start using it an
extra<00:03:23.740> five<00:03:23.920> health<00:03:24.220> per<00:03:24.459> level<00:03:24.490> may<00:03:24.880> sound

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
extra five health per level may sound

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.270 
extra five health per level may sound
small<00:03:25.660> but<00:03:25.930> trust<00:03:26.230> me<00:03:26.320> it'll<00:03:26.709> stack<00:03:27.070> up

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
small but trust me it'll stack up

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.980 
small but trust me it'll stack up
especially<00:03:28.000> when<00:03:28.480> you're<00:03:28.630> buffing<00:03:28.930> your

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
especially when you're buffing your

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.650 
especially when you're buffing your
allies<00:03:29.440> in<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.709> teamfight<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.730> when<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.480> new

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
mastery makes it even more awesome and

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.750 
mastery makes it even more awesome and

the mighty I of doom now originally the

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.170 
the mighty I of doom now originally the
plan<00:06:08.320> was<00:06:08.440> for<00:06:08.620> this<00:06:08.980> to<00:06:09.160> give<00:06:09.280> an<00:06:09.430> AoE<00:06:09.670> effect

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
plan was for this to give an AoE effect

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.590 
plan was for this to give an AoE effect
sort<00:06:10.960> of<00:06:11.050> like<00:06:11.200> a<00:06:11.230> mobile<00:06:11.530> rally<00:06:11.890> but<00:06:12.820> riot

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
sort of like a mobile rally but riot

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.210 
sort of like a mobile rally but riot
says<00:06:13.900> testing<00:06:14.440> showed<00:06:14.680> that<00:06:14.920> was<00:06:15.040> too

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
says testing showed that was too

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.370 
says testing showed that was too
powerful<00:06:15.400> and<00:06:15.970> made<00:06:16.150> teamfights<00:06:16.810> basically

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
powerful and made teamfights basically

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.140 
powerful and made teamfights basically
depending<00:06:17.710> on<00:06:17.830> who<00:06:18.010> had<00:06:18.160> surged<00:06:18.490> available<00:06:19.030> at

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
depending on who had surged available at

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.870 
depending on who had surged available at
the<00:06:19.240> time<00:06:19.680> now<00:06:20.680> I'm<00:06:20.830> not<00:06:20.980> sure<00:06:21.010> how<00:06:21.400> great<00:06:21.700> this

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
the time now I'm not sure how great this

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.020 
the time now I'm not sure how great this
is<00:06:21.940> it's<00:06:22.630> definitely<00:06:23.200> a<00:06:23.500> powerful<00:06:23.980> effect<00:06:24.070> but

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
is it's definitely a powerful effect but

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.670 
is it's definitely a powerful effect but
I<00:06:25.090> generally<00:06:25.690> saved<00:06:25.900> my<00:06:26.050> summoner<00:06:26.440> spell

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
I generally saved my summoner spell

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.470 
I generally saved my summoner spell
slots<00:06:26.950> for<00:06:27.160> utility<00:06:27.700> things<00:06:27.940> you<00:06:28.360> know

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
slots for utility things you know

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.770 
slots for utility things you know
getting<00:06:28.840> around<00:06:29.170> faster<00:06:29.710> making<00:06:30.580> enemies

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780

stop moving exhaust quote unquote so I

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.080

suppose<00:06:35.350> this<00:06:35.590> fills<00:06:35.860> a<00:06:35.980> role<00:06:36.430> similar<00:06:36.730> to

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
suppose this fills a role similar to

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.399 
suppose this fills a role similar to
ignite<00:06:37.420> on<00:06:37.570> certain<00:06:37.900> character

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
ignite on certain character

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.619 
ignite on certain character
but<00:06:38.949> we'll<00:06:39.099> see<00:06:39.369> maybe<00:06:39.819> the<00:06:40.149> sports<00:06:40.449> we'll

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:40.629 
but we'll see maybe the sports we'll

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:42.540 
but we'll see maybe the sports we'll
take<00:06:40.809> it<00:06:40.959> to<00:06:40.989> get<00:06:41.439> a<00:06:41.469> sudden<00:06:41.800> burst<00:06:42.159> of<00:06:42.339> power

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
take it to get a sudden burst of power

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.139 
take it to get a sudden burst of power
in<00:06:42.909> their<00:06:43.059> healing<00:06:43.499> maybe<00:06:44.499> well<00:06:45.129> the<00:06:45.849> attack

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.149 
in their healing maybe well the attack

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:47.579 
in their healing maybe well the attack
