00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
middle actually a little closer to the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.669 
middle actually a little closer to the
neck<00:02:04.880> in<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.119> way<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:05.869> it's<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.110> cool<00:02:06.289> sound<00:02:06.560> you

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
neck in a way but it's a cool sound you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.859 
neck in a way but it's a cool sound you
don't<00:02:06.770> often<00:02:07.009> see<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.340> p90<00:02:07.940> in<00:02:08.569> that<00:02:08.690> middle

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
don't often see a p90 in that middle

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.380 
don't often see a p90 in that middle
position<00:02:09.350> quite<00:02:10.009> often<00:02:10.190> if<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.490> single<00:02:11.270> one

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
position quite often if this single one

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.850 
position quite often if this single one
it's<00:02:11.540> here<00:02:11.900> if<00:02:12.080> there's<00:02:12.260> two<00:02:12.440> it's<00:02:12.650> these

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
it's here if there's two it's these

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.040 
it's here if there's two it's these
positions<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:14.150> it's<00:02:14.330> kind<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.720> different

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
positions so it's kind of a different

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.470 
positions so it's kind of a different
tone<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.500> got<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.160> dig<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.490> took<00:02:17.240> a<00:02:17.330> little

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
tone and I got to dig it took a little

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.020 
tone and I got to dig it took a little
bit<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.690> tweaking<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.530> sounds<00:02:18.920> great<00:02:19.220> so

will give you a worse hangover than

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.449 
will give you a worse hangover than
other<00:02:46.670> beers<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.630> anyway<00:02:48.530> enough<00:02:49.099> about<00:02:49.190> the

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
other beers so anyway enough about the

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.220 
other beers so anyway enough about the
beer<00:02:49.670> although<00:02:50.300> it's<00:02:50.480> one<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.780> my<00:02:50.870> favorite

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
beer although it's one of my favorite

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.380 
beer although it's one of my favorite
subjects<00:02:51.620> we're<00:02:51.770> going<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.950> move<00:02:52.099> on<00:02:52.250> to

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
subjects we're going to move on to

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.050 
subjects we're going to move on to
hearing<00:02:53.390> this<00:02:53.480> guitar<00:02:53.870> now<00:02:54.730> through<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.790> clean

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
hearing this guitar now through a clean

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.120 
hearing this guitar now through a clean
amplifier<00:02:56.569> so<00:02:56.750> we<00:02:56.840> can<00:02:56.959> hear<00:02:57.110> how<00:02:57.500> this<00:02:57.650> p90

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
amplifier so we can hear how this p90

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:20.080 
amplifier so we can hear how this p90
really<00:02:58.400> sounds

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:35.619 

you

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.910 

so<00:03:36.629> this<00:03:36.750> P<00:03:36.959> nineties<00:03:37.230> got<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.409> lot<00:03:37.530> of<00:03:37.560> output

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
so this P nineties got a lot of output

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.440 
so this P nineties got a lot of output
gary<00:03:38.189> told<00:03:38.370> me<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.670> it's<00:03:38.790> actually<00:03:38.939> a<00:03:39.120> pretty

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
gary told me that it's actually a pretty

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.509 
gary told me that it's actually a pretty
inexpensive<00:03:40.140> one<00:03:40.379> I<00:03:40.560> forget<00:03:41.159> exactly<00:03:41.250> what

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
inexpensive one I forget exactly what

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.000 
inexpensive one I forget exactly what
the<00:03:41.609> model<00:03:41.909> was<00:03:42.030> but<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.689> p90<00:03:43.469> just<00:03:43.709> seem<00:03:43.980> to

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
the model was but the p90 just seem to

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.880 
the model was but the p90 just seem to
always<00:03:44.640> have<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.120> cool<00:03:45.359> mojo<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:46.650> one

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
always have that cool mojo this one

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.369 
always have that cool mojo this one
being<00:03:47.640> in<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.879> middle<00:03:48.150> there<00:03:48.329> doesn't<00:03:49.290> have

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
being in the middle there doesn't have

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.849 
being in the middle there doesn't have
quite<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.709> sort<00:03:50.549> of<00:03:50.640> spank<00:03:51.390> and<00:03:51.599> twang<00:03:51.959> if<00:03:52.709> you

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
quite the sort of spank and twang if you

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.280 
quite the sort of spank and twang if you
will<00:03:53.069> of<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.549> bridge<00:03:53.970> position<00:03:54.180> but<00:03:55.079> it<00:03:55.170> does

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
will of the bridge position but it does

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.750 
will of the bridge position but it does
have<00:03:55.439> the<00:03:55.560> versatility<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.159> kind<00:03:56.670> of

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
have the versatility of kind of

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.910 
have the versatility of kind of
responding<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.329> where<00:03:57.450> you're<00:03:57.629> picking<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.109> lot

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
responding to where you're picking a lot

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.640 
responding to where you're picking a lot
more<00:03:59.129> than<00:03:59.370> then<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.180> would<00:04:00.389> in<00:04:00.540> either<00:04:00.959> neck

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
more than then it would in either neck

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.289 
more than then it would in either neck
or<00:04:01.859> bridge<00:04:02.069> position<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.819> know<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.150> get

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
or bridge position so you know you get

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:11.340 
or bridge position so you know you get
your<00:04:03.889> real<00:04:05.389> jangly<00:04:06.389> sound<00:04:06.689> here

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.960 

and<00:04:11.440> then<00:04:12.070> if<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.280> want<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.490> get<00:04:12.610> warmer

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
and then if you want to get warmer

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:34.080 
and then if you want to get warmer
you're<00:04:13.210> right<00:04:13.390> up<00:04:13.510> here

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.390 

so<00:04:34.750> it's<00:04:35.020> very<00:04:35.139> responsive<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.860> where<00:04:36.250> your

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
so it's very responsive to where your

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.800 
so it's very responsive to where your
pic<00:04:36.550> is<00:04:36.699> that<00:04:36.910> seems<00:04:37.090> to<00:04:37.210> be<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.360> bonus<00:04:37.660> of

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
pic is that seems to be the bonus of

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.260 
pic is that seems to be the bonus of
this<00:04:38.070> middle<00:04:39.070> position<00:04:39.460> here<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.940> course<00:04:40.150> you

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
this middle position here of course you

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.610 
this middle position here of course you
know<00:04:40.389> it<00:04:40.449> was<00:04:40.570> all<00:04:40.690> about<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.990> optics<00:04:41.350> on<00:04:41.500> this

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
know it was all about the optics on this

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.740 
know it was all about the optics on this
one<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.919> way<00:04:42.010> Gary<00:04:42.280> did<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.580> it's<00:04:43.389> not<00:04:43.510> a<00:04:43.570> lot

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
one the way Gary did it it's not a lot

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.920 
one the way Gary did it it's not a lot
of<00:04:43.780> pick<00:04:44.229> up<00:04:44.350> selection<00:04:45.340> etc<00:04:46.120> want<00:04:46.510> it<00:04:46.630> louder

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
of pick up selection etc want it louder

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.370 
of pick up selection etc want it louder
turn<00:04:47.650> this<00:04:47.830> up<00:04:48.070> softer<00:04:48.760> turn<00:04:48.970> that<00:04:49.120> down

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
turn this up softer turn that down

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.680 
turn this up softer turn that down
simple<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:50.530> Stan<00:04:50.860> Berg<00:04:51.070> beer<00:04:51.310> open<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.389> drink

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
simple like Stan Berg beer open it drink

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:02.420 
simple like Stan Berg beer open it drink
it<00:04:52.780> and<00:04:52.990> shut<00:04:53.380> up

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.220 

alright<00:05:03.150> no<00:05:03.300> doubt<00:05:03.480> about<00:05:03.600> it<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.900> guitar

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
alright no doubt about it the guitar

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.770 
alright no doubt about it the guitar
sounds<00:05:04.560> very<00:05:04.740> cool<00:05:04.920> clean<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.520> like<00:05:06.030> my<00:05:06.180> p90s

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
sounds very cool clean I like my p90s

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.450 
sounds very cool clean I like my p90s
with<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:07.020> little<00:05:07.260> sauce<00:05:07.470> on<00:05:07.710> top<00:05:07.920> a<00:05:07.980> little<00:05:08.190> dirt

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.700 
with a little sauce on top a little dirt
I<00:05:08.700> switched<00:05:09.120> back<00:05:09.300> to<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.570> stanchion<00:05:10.200> one

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
I switched back to the stanchion one

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.280 
I switched back to the stanchion one
watt<00:05:11.340> amplifier<00:05:11.670> that<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.120> designed<00:05:12.510> and

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
watt amplifier that I designed and

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.080 
watt amplifier that I designed and
that's<00:05:14.720> very<00:05:15.720> touch<00:05:16.050> sensitive<00:05:16.880> but<00:05:17.880> rather

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
that's very touch sensitive but rather

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.260 
that's very touch sensitive but rather
small<00:05:19.020> sounding<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:20.430> Bush<00:05:20.610> kind<00:05:20.880> of<00:05:20.970> sound<00:05:21.120> to

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
small sounding to Bush kind of sound to

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:45.760 
small sounding to Bush kind of sound to
it

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.629 

so<00:05:46.770> anyway<00:05:47.009> you<00:05:47.099> can<00:05:47.189> hear<00:05:47.310> that<00:05:47.400> it's<00:05:47.490> got<00:05:47.610> a

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
so anyway you can hear that it's got a

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.540 
so anyway you can hear that it's got a
very<00:05:47.789> cool<00:05:48.120> response<00:05:48.900> to<00:05:49.229> it<00:05:49.379> very<00:05:49.800> warm<00:05:50.219> sound

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
very cool response to it very warm sound

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.959 
very cool response to it very warm sound
surprising<00:05:51.240> for<00:05:51.539> a<00:05:51.599> little<00:05:52.039> chip<00:05:53.039> power<00:05:53.669> amp

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
surprising for a little chip power amp

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:55.850 
surprising for a little chip power amp
kind<00:05:54.300> of<00:05:54.389> thing<00:05:54.569> it's<00:05:54.750> that<00:05:54.870> Jay<00:05:55.349> fed<00:05:55.530> preamp

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
kind of thing it's that Jay fed preamp

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.959 
kind of thing it's that Jay fed preamp
that<00:05:55.979> really<00:05:56.189> does<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.340> cool<00:05:56.550> thing<00:05:56.729> with<00:05:56.759> it

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969 
that really does a cool thing with it

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:58.909 
that really does a cool thing with it
I'm<00:05:57.240> going<00:05:57.449> to<00:05:57.509> start<00:05:57.750> making<00:05:58.229> these<00:05:58.530> and

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
I'm going to start making these and

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.140 
I'm going to start making these and
you'll<00:05:59.189> be<00:05:59.310> able<00:05:59.400> to<00:05:59.490> order<00:05:59.699> them<00:05:59.879> if<00:05:59.939> you<00:06:00.030> want

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
you'll be able to order them if you want
