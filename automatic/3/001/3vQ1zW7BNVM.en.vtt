the inventors and engineers really are

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.270 
the inventors and engineers really are
not<00:00:09.570> good<00:00:09.900> with<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.230> strategic<00:00:10.769> part<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.099> this

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
not good with the strategic part of this

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.310 
not good with the strategic part of this
and<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> other<00:00:12.450> hand<00:00:12.630> could<00:00:13.170> an

and I on the other hand could an

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.490 
and I on the other hand could an
engineer<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> toaster<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.599> I'm<00:00:16.139> very<00:00:16.289> good

at<00:00:16.650> strategic<00:00:17.160> leadership<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.090> that's

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
at strategic leadership and so that's

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.450 
at strategic leadership and so that's
what<00:00:18.960> our<00:00:19.140> team<00:00:19.199> would<00:00:19.710> do<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:20.130> do<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
we would do it now of course that has to

and I mean with a width of the you know
I<00:02:56.840> dissonant<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:57.900> 400<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.650> proof<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.160> we're

I dissonant and 400 the proof is we're

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.730 
I dissonant and 400 the proof is we're

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
coal-fired power plants because this

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.160 
coal-fired power plants because this
technology<00:03:04.830> has<00:03:05.760> been<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.240> some<00:03:06.480> stage<00:03:06.930> of

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
part of a hundred years certainly 75

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.390 
part of a hundred years certainly 75
years<00:03:11.520> we<00:03:11.790> can<00:03:11.940> prove<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.750> we're<00:03:13.560> still<00:03:13.920> using

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
years we can prove and we're still using

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.000 
years we can prove and we're still using
gasoline<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.450> we're<00:03:15.600> still<00:03:15.959> using<00:03:16.230> coal<00:03:16.680> and

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
gasoline and we're still using coal and

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.030 
gasoline and we're still using coal and
this<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.790> completely<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:19.620> if<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:19.860> was

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
this is a completely and so if this was

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.070 
this is a completely and so if this was
so<00:03:20.190> simple<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.700> do<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.390> been<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.690> fettle

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
so simple to do it been a fettle

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.600 
so simple to do it been a fettle
completely<00:03:22.560> long<00:03:22.769> time<00:03:23.010> ago<00:03:27.800> yeah<00:03:28.830> good<00:03:29.370> next

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
completely long time ago yeah good next

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.630 
completely long time ago yeah good next
look<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:31.470> that's<00:03:31.620> why<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:31.980> know<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.310> mean<00:03:32.580> I

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
line in DC to do this and so I said this

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.780 
line in DC to do this and so I said this
is<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.930> tough<00:04:13.380> nut<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.709> crack<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.459> better

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
is a tough nut to crack so you better

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.430 
is a tough nut to crack so you better
have<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.060> network<00:04:15.450> bill<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.870> that's<00:04:16.109> what<00:04:16.350> I've

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
have a network bill and that's what I've

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.930 
have a network bill and that's what I've
been<00:04:16.470> doing<00:04:16.650> for<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.160> last<00:04:17.310> decade<00:04:17.489> or<00:04:17.820> so

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
been doing for the last decade or so

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.849 
been doing for the last decade or so
it's<00:04:18.180> building<00:04:18.540> this<00:04:18.630> network<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.739> there

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
it's building this network so that there

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.320 
it's building this network so that there
are<00:04:19.950> millions<00:04:20.070> of<00:04:20.400> people<00:04:20.580> literally<00:04:21.090> who

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
know the secrecy is their game we own

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.839 
know the secrecy is their game we own
the<00:04:45.720> light<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.229> disclosure<00:04:46.710> they<00:04:47.370> own<00:04:47.610> the

out this is one of these

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.129 
out this is one of these

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
counterintuitive things because if you

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.080 
counterintuitive things because if you
do<00:04:55.379> what<00:04:55.560> you're<00:04:55.740> doing<00:04:55.770> very<00:04:56.340> publicly<00:04:56.849> and

survives the launch because and really
you<00:07:28.380> think<00:07:28.530> about<00:07:28.860> it<00:07:30.560> 99.999999%<00:07:31.560> of<00:07:31.920> the
