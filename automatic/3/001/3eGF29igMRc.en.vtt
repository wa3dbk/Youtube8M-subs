line<00:01:17.800> up<00:01:18.010> with<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.310> middle<00:01:18.430> like<00:01:19.090> I<00:01:19.270> just<00:01:19.330> did

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
line up with the middle like I just did

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.680 
line up with the middle like I just did
here<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.250> you<00:01:21.520> got<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.790> do<00:01:21.910> it<00:01:22.000> with<00:01:22.090> each<00:01:22.390> of

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
here and you got to do it with each of

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:41.080 
here and you got to do it with each of
the<00:01:22.810> four<00:01:23.020> corners

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:49.690 

doesn't<00:01:41.869> have<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.079> be<00:01:42.200> perfect

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.550 

okay<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:51.479> you're<00:01:51.900> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> fold<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
okay then you're going to fold the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:03.969 
okay then you're going to fold the
corners<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.070> again<00:01:54.860> like<00:01:55.860> this

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.459 

fold<00:02:04.640> each<00:02:04.939> of<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.240> four<00:02:05.450> corners<00:02:05.750> in<00:02:06.020> again

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
fold each of the four corners in again

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:33.260 
fold each of the four corners in again
like<00:02:07.369> this

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.300 

okay<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:33.930> you've<00:02:34.470> got<00:02:34.500> something<00:02:35.010> looks<00:02:35.250> a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
okay so you've got something looks a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.500 
okay so you've got something looks a
little<00:02:35.400> bit<00:02:35.580> like<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:35.940> there<00:02:36.210> may<00:02:36.360> be<00:02:36.390> a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
little bit like this there may be a

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.880 
little bit like this there may be a
little<00:02:36.690> bit<00:02:36.840> more<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.170> an<00:02:37.290> opening<00:02:37.680> here<00:02:37.830> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
little bit more of an opening here and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.470 
little bit more of an opening here and
maybe<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.160> little<00:02:38.280> bit<00:02:38.460> less<00:02:38.640> all<00:02:39.060> depends<00:02:39.420> on

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
maybe a little bit less all depends on

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.960 
maybe a little bit less all depends on
how<00:02:39.630> well<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.870> fold<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.730> what<00:02:41.730> you're<00:02:41.850> going

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
how well you fold it what you're going

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.460 
how well you fold it what you're going
to<00:02:42.030> do<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.150> are<00:02:42.210> gonna<00:02:42.330> take<00:02:42.570> these<00:02:42.960> middle

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
to do is are gonna take these middle

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.980 
to do is are gonna take these middle
pieces<00:02:43.710> you're<00:02:44.010> gonna<00:02:44.130> fold<00:02:44.430> them<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.900> it

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
pieces you're gonna fold them up so it

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.240 
pieces you're gonna fold them up so it
comes<00:02:46.230> out<00:02:46.350> right<00:02:46.470> like<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:46.950> gotta<00:02:47.100> take

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
comes out right like this you gotta take

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.730 
comes out right like this you gotta take
these<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.550> just<00:02:47.700> fold<00:02:48.000> them<00:02:48.210> up<00:02:48.390> until<00:02:48.740> they

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
these that just fold them up until they

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.350 
these that just fold them up until they
meet<00:02:50.010> up<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.670> middle<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.060> your<00:02:51.210> boat<00:02:55.280> and

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
meet up with the middle of your boat and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.200 
meet up with the middle of your boat and
this<00:02:57.360> side<00:02:57.750> folds<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.730> until<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.880> meets<00:03:00.000> with

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
this side folds in until it meets with

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.970 
this side folds in until it meets with
the<00:03:00.300> middle<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.530> should<00:03:07.680> have<00:03:07.800> something

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the middle so you should have something

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.290 
the middle so you should have something
that<00:03:08.070> looks<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.370> little<00:03:08.490> bit<00:03:08.640> like<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:09.060> right

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
that looks a little bit like this right

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.170 
that looks a little bit like this right
now<00:03:10.340> what<00:03:11.340> you're<00:03:11.490> going<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.730> do<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:12.030> you're

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
now what you're going to do is you're

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.790 
now what you're going to do is you're
