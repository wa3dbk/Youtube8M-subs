were available then so that's kind of
what<00:01:41.620> the<00:01:41.910> theme<00:01:42.910> of<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.240> whole<00:01:43.360> thing<00:01:43.630> is

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
what the theme of the whole thing is

all chrome and as far as the tank is
concerned<00:01:51.220> I<00:01:51.460> think<00:01:51.580> I'm<00:01:51.940> gonna<00:01:52.060> go<00:01:52.360> with

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
concerned I think I'm gonna go with

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.560 
concerned I think I'm gonna go with
matching<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.400> tires<00:01:54.730> as<00:01:55.090> best<00:01:55.360> as<00:01:55.510> possible

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
matching the tires as best as possible

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.850 
matching the tires as best as possible
for<00:01:56.110> color<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.860> that'll<00:01:57.580> kind<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.540> tie<00:01:58.750> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
for color and that'll kind of tie the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.540 
for color and that'll kind of tie the
the<00:01:59.860> center<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:01.140> frame<00:02:02.370> center<00:02:03.370> of<00:02:03.490> the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
the center of the frame center of the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.340 
the center of the frame center of the
bike<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.150> wheel<00:02:04.330> so<00:02:04.720> basically<00:02:05.050> you<00:02:05.229> have

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
bike to the wheel so basically you have

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.650 
bike to the wheel so basically you have
those<00:02:05.530> three<00:02:05.740> free<00:02:06.520> prominent<00:02:07.060> actually<00:02:07.450> four

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
those three free prominent actually four

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.620 
those three free prominent actually four
prominent<00:02:07.990> colors<00:02:08.350> being<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.630> that

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
prominent colors being the that

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.570 
prominent colors being the that
blood-red<00:02:11.230> color<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.920> lighting<00:02:12.220> pen

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
blood-red color this lighting pen

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.220 
blood-red color this lighting pen
doesn't<00:02:12.730> show<00:02:13.000> up<00:02:13.120> well<00:02:13.510> actually<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:14.050> looks<00:02:14.170> a

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
doesn't show up well actually it looks a

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.450 
doesn't show up well actually it looks a
little<00:02:14.850> darker<00:02:15.850> than<00:02:15.880> what<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.180> really<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:17.460> the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
little darker than what it really is the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.980 
little darker than what it really is the
black<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.840> white<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.380> then<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.710> metals<00:02:21.990> and

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
black the white and then the metals and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.940 
black the white and then the metals and
I<00:02:24.060> did<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.180> exhaust<00:02:25.930> just<00:02:26.080> we<00:02:26.320> heat<00:02:26.530> paint<00:02:26.770> for

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
I did the exhaust just we heat paint for

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.350 
I did the exhaust just we heat paint for
now<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.250> may<00:02:27.489> do<00:02:27.550> something<00:02:27.880> different<00:02:28.300> with

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
now I may do something different with

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.090 
now I may do something different with
that<00:02:28.420> because<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:29.530> kind<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.830> gets<00:02:30.010> lost

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
that because it just kind of gets lost

oil let it get hot and it'll probably

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.460 
oil let it get hot and it'll probably
keep<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.120> from<00:02:46.300> rusting<00:02:46.510> not<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.200> thing's

a<00:03:59.360> wire<00:03:59.750> going<00:04:00.080> to<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.380> coil<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.890> coil<00:04:01.070> just

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
a wire going to the coil the coil just

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.590 
a wire going to the coil the coil just
comes<00:04:01.460> right<00:04:01.550> off<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.090> motor<00:04:02.270> I'm<00:04:02.450> not

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
comes right off of the motor I'm not

comes right off of the motor I'm not
sure<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:04.160> I'm<00:04:04.250> probably<00:04:04.370> gonna<00:04:04.610> go<00:04:04.820> old<00:04:05.120> school

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240

sure so I'm probably gonna go old school
with<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:06.920> piece<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.280> spring<00:04:07.670> steel<00:04:07.880> coming<00:04:08.510> up

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690

with a piece of spring steel coming up
and<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:08.990> just<00:04:09.200> short<00:04:09.410> it<00:04:09.500> out<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.710> the<00:04:09.800> plug<00:04:10.040> to

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
and you just short it out to the plug to

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.130 
and you just short it out to the plug to
shut<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.550> motor<00:04:10.700> off<00:04:11.140> so<00:04:14.260> in<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.410> throttle

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
shut the motor off so in the throttle

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.170 
shut the motor off so in the throttle
I'm<00:04:18.140> gonna<00:04:18.380> try<00:04:18.830> something<00:04:19.250> whether<00:04:20.000> it's

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
I'm gonna try something whether it's

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.580 
I'm gonna try something whether it's
gonna<00:04:20.299> work<00:04:20.510> on<00:04:20.690> I'm<00:04:20.930> not<00:04:21.049> sure<00:04:21.320> I'm<00:04:21.470> actually

I had this rim hanging on a wire the
wire<00:05:02.090> undid<00:05:02.630> itself<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:04.000> somewhere<00:05:05.000> on<00:05:05.180> it

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
wire undid itself and somewhere on it

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.120 
wire undid itself and somewhere on it
put<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.740> big<00:05:06.950> old<00:05:06.980> dent<00:05:07.460> in<00:05:07.670> it<00:05:08.860> kind<00:05:09.860> of<00:05:09.890> tweaked

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
put a big old dent in it kind of tweaked

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.620 
put a big old dent in it kind of tweaked
the<00:05:10.280> rim<00:05:10.430> a<00:05:10.460> little<00:05:10.760> bit<00:05:10.880> not<00:05:11.090> bad<00:05:11.120> it's<00:05:11.540> still

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
the rim a little bit not bad it's still

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.350 
the rim a little bit not bad it's still
still<00:05:12.080> moves<00:05:12.320> fine<00:05:12.620> but<00:05:13.430> my<00:05:13.670> thinking<00:05:14.060> is<00:05:14.180> this

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
still moves fine but my thinking is this

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.860 
still moves fine but my thinking is this
I<00:05:14.510> have<00:05:14.690> a<00:05:14.720> feeling<00:05:14.840> that<00:05:15.530> it's<00:05:15.800> gonna<00:05:16.010> be

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
I have a feeling that it's gonna be

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.230 
I have a feeling that it's gonna be
geared<00:05:17.870> a<00:05:18.110> little<00:05:18.590> too

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
geared a little too

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.290 
geared a little too
oh<00:05:19.270> I<00:05:19.770> can<00:05:20.770> change<00:05:21.130> with<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.639> pulleys<00:05:22.000> here

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
oh I can change with the pulleys here

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.360 
oh I can change with the pulleys here
and<00:05:22.479> get<00:05:22.630> some<00:05:22.900> but<00:05:23.650> I'd<00:05:23.800> actually<00:05:23.949> like<00:05:24.310> to

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
and get some but I'd actually like to

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.730 
and get some but I'd actually like to
take<00:05:25.300> another<00:05:25.569> shot<00:05:25.840> at<00:05:25.900> making<00:05:26.229> that<00:05:26.500> rear

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
take another shot at making that rear

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.850 
take another shot at making that rear
rim<00:05:26.979> and<00:05:27.250> what<00:05:27.430> I<00:05:27.460> might<00:05:27.849> do<00:05:28.120> this<00:05:29.050> is<00:05:29.289> a<00:05:29.319> 26

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
rim and what I might do this is a 26

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.100 
rim and what I might do this is a 26
inch<00:05:30.039> rim<00:05:30.280> this<00:05:30.430> is<00:05:30.490> a<00:05:30.669> 24<00:05:31.120> inch<00:05:31.300> rim<00:05:31.479> I<00:05:31.690> may

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
inch rim this is a 24 inch rim I may

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.680 
inch rim this is a 24 inch rim I may
take<00:05:32.259> the<00:05:32.410> 26<00:05:32.949> or<00:05:33.099> inch<00:05:33.460> rim<00:05:33.699> and<00:05:33.910> a<00:05:34.060> 20<00:05:34.509> inch

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
take the 26 or inch rim and a 20 inch

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.999 
take the 26 or inch rim and a 20 inch
rim<00:05:34.930> which<00:05:35.080> will<00:05:35.199> probably<00:05:35.380> knock<00:05:35.650> it<00:05:35.830> down<00:05:35.860> to

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009 
rim which will probably knock it down to

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.200 
rim which will probably knock it down to
about<00:05:36.280> right<00:05:36.340> here<00:05:38.460> knock<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.610> Giri<00:05:39.849> she'll

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
about right here knock the Giri she'll

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.900 
about right here knock the Giri she'll
probably<00:05:40.389> up<00:05:40.720> another<00:05:40.960> third<00:05:41.580> so<00:05:42.580> say<00:05:42.729> if<00:05:42.819> it

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
probably up another third so say if it

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.999 
probably up another third so say if it
does<00:05:43.060> 20<00:05:43.419> it'll<00:05:43.630> do<00:05:43.750> 30<00:05:44.110> if<00:05:44.199> it<00:05:44.289> does<00:05:44.410> 15<00:05:44.800> it'll

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
does 20 it'll do 30 if it does 15 it'll

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.710 
does 20 it'll do 30 if it does 15 it'll
