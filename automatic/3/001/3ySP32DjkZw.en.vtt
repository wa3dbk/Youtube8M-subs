00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
paid on the show so here is the fairness

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.780 
paid on the show so here is the fairness
of<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.380> Sara<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:15.790> not<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.620> gender<00:02:17.620> gap

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
of it Sara it's not a gender gap

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.150 
of it Sara it's not a gender gap
although<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.820> think<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.390> noble<00:02:19.570> cause<00:02:20.160> but

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
although I think it's a noble cause but

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.820 
although I think it's a noble cause but
at<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> time<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.850> was<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.000> talent<00:02:22.540> gap<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:23.650> were

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
at the time it was a talent gap you were

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.850 
at the time it was a talent gap you were
not<00:02:24.100> on<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:25.060> show<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.570> night<00:02:25.840> but<00:02:26.560> Todd

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
not on that show that night but Todd

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.990 
not on that show that night but Todd
Barry<00:02:27.280> was<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.959> let's<00:02:29.920> get<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.340> cause<00:02:30.580> right

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
Barry was so let's get the cause right

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.270
