00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.410 
there to say hmm I really think it would
add<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.810> certain<00:02:24.110> touch<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.150> I'll<00:02:26.150> give<00:02:26.330> her

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
add a certain touch so I'll give her

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.850 
add a certain touch so I'll give her
that<00:02:26.450> opportunity<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:27.200> try<00:02:27.740> that<00:02:27.920> out

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
that opportunity to try that out

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.470 
that opportunity to try that out
other<00:02:29.860> than<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.310> she<00:02:30.670> really<00:02:30.940> does<00:02:31.180> like

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
other than that she really does like

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.230 
other than that she really does like
this<00:02:31.750> style<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.440> shoe<00:02:32.710> this<00:02:33.370> dunk<00:02:33.760> high<00:02:33.970> with

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
this style of a shoe this dunk high with

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.020 
this style of a shoe this dunk high with
the<00:02:34.270> wedge<00:02:34.510> in<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:35.760> gives<00:02:36.760> us<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.970> different

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
the wedge in it gives us a different
