00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
boost so that's why I like having my

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.140 
boost so that's why I like having my

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
dollars more but I just decided to go

to need to be overclocking 27 80s all
that<00:04:59.650> much<00:04:59.890> so<00:05:00.400> I'm<00:05:00.760> pretty<00:05:01.480> sure<00:05:01.600> this<00:05:01.900> will

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
that much so I'm pretty sure this will

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.870 
that much so I'm pretty sure this will
do<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.230> trick<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.800> I'm<00:05:02.980> sure<00:05:03.190> I<00:05:03.220> can<00:05:03.340> get<00:05:03.550> the

do the trick and I'm sure I can get the

on<00:05:05.440> this<00:05:05.560> card<00:05:05.830> anyway<00:05:06.130> if<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.340> really<00:05:06.610> wanted

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
on this card anyway if I really wanted

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.750 
on this card anyway if I really wanted

to the cooling on it is more than

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.270 
to the cooling on it is more than
efficient<00:05:09.760> enough<00:05:10.530> alright<00:05:11.530> as<00:05:11.800> you<00:05:11.860> can<00:05:12.070> see

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
efficient enough alright as you can see
