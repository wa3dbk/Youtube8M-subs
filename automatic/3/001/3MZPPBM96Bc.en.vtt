dealership and i will return with
sourcing<00:02:22.049> is<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.319> great<00:02:22.799> or<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.329> possible<00:02:24.329> method

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
sourcing is a great or a possible method

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.619 
sourcing is a great or a possible method
but<00:02:25.349> is<00:02:25.500> nowhere<00:02:26.099> near<00:02:26.459> foolproof<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.480> to

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
but is nowhere near foolproof and to

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.119 
but is nowhere near foolproof and to
give<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.810> an<00:02:27.900> example<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.530> i'll<00:02:28.799> tell<00:02:29.010> you

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
give you an example that i'll tell you

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.740 
give you an example that i'll tell you
that<00:02:29.159> a<00:02:29.340> lot<00:02:29.579> of<00:02:29.670> sales<00:02:29.879> people<00:02:30.239> might<00:02:30.480> shock

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
that a lot of sales people might shock

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.360 
that a lot of sales people might shock
you<00:02:30.780> will<00:02:31.439> take<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.890> path<00:02:32.099> of<00:02:32.310> least

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
you will take the path of least

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.199 
you will take the path of least
resistance<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:35.010> what<00:02:35.549> you'll<00:02:35.700> find<00:02:35.879> is<00:02:36.180> that

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
resistance so what you'll find is that

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.050 
resistance so what you'll find is that
they'll<00:02:36.629> often<00:02:36.870> source<00:02:37.530> things<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.370> newspaper

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
they'll often source things to newspaper

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.059 
they'll often source things to newspaper
came<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.720> newspaper<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> reason<00:02:40.769> they<00:02:41.010> do

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
came in newspaper and the reason they do

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.949 
came in newspaper and the reason they do
that<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.459> because<00:02:41.700> they<00:02:42.030> know<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:42.510> if<00:02:42.870> they

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
that is because they know that if they

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.809 
that is because they know that if they
were<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.200> not<00:02:43.590> hold<00:02:43.829> their<00:02:44.069> gross<00:02:44.400> on<00:02:44.730> a

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.030 
were to not hold their gross on a
consumer<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.450> they<00:02:45.569> sourced<00:02:45.930> newspaper<00:02:46.379> you

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
consumer that they sourced newspaper you

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.470 
consumer that they sourced newspaper you
would<00:02:47.159> have<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.340> tough<00:02:47.400> argument<00:02:47.879> with<00:02:48.299> them

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
would have a tough argument with them

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.879 
would have a tough argument with them
because<00:02:48.870> they<00:02:49.019> can<00:02:49.200> tell<00:02:49.379> you<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.739> that

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
because they can tell you that that

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.440 
because they can tell you that that
consumer<00:02:50.370> came<00:02:50.579> in<00:02:50.760> off<00:02:50.879> a<00:02:50.909> loss<00:02:51.209> leader
