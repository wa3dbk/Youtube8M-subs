00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
of tool improve so let's look at the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.350 
of tool improve so let's look at the
fine<00:00:32.369> detail<00:00:32.880> first<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.260> layers<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
fine detail first the layers of it the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.400 
fine detail first the layers of it the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
color of the three pedals should be a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.459 
color of the three pedals should be a
little<00:00:40.860> bit<00:00:41.010> more<00:00:41.520> different<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.989> example

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
little bit more different for example

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.639 
little bit more different for example
this<00:00:43.680> one<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.879> better<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.600> put<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
this one it's better to put here a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.080 
this one it's better to put here a
little<00:00:46.980> bit<00:00:47.280> darker<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:49.039> here<00:00:50.039> even<00:00:50.730> brighter

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
little bit darker and here even brighter

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.979 
little bit darker and here even brighter
or<00:00:51.539> less<00:00:52.469> yellow<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:54.059> more<00:00:54.420> yellow<00:00:54.809> or

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
or less yellow here with more yellow or

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.110 
or less yellow here with more yellow or

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
make it darker so you can see the shape

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
make it darker so you can see the shape
of<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.649> limit<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.430> Chinese<00:01:00.710> painting

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
