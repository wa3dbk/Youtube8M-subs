00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
seam near there's not a seam you go to

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.220 
seam near there's not a seam you go to
your<00:00:27.190> closest<00:00:27.940> your<00:00:28.270> narrowest<00:00:28.630> point<00:00:28.990> and

your closest your narrowest point and

your closest your narrowest point and
you<00:00:29.289> go<00:00:29.440> from<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:29.980> collar<00:00:30.190> right<00:00:30.760> to<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.029> edge

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
you go from the collar right to the edge

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.259 
you go from the collar right to the edge
of<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.480> edge<00:00:31.900> of<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.230> seam<00:00:32.439> we<00:00:33.309> sleeve<00:00:33.999> meets

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
of the edge of the seam we sleeve meets

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.619 
of the edge of the seam we sleeve meets
your<00:00:34.920> yoke<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:37.030> one<00:00:37.149> there<00:00:37.300> measures

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
your yoke that one there measures

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.239 
your yoke that one there measures
through<00:00:37.809> at<00:00:37.899> 13<00:00:38.260> so<00:00:38.499> that's<00:00:38.649> a<00:00:38.890> measurement

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:39.249 
through at 13 so that's a measurement

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:41.219 
through at 13 so that's a measurement
that<00:00:39.489> you<00:00:39.579> give<00:00:39.999> passed<00:00:40.300> through<00:00:40.569> when<00:00:41.079> you're

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
that you give passed through when you're

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.319 
that you give passed through when you're
doing<00:00:41.409> your<00:00:41.440> sleeve<00:00:41.829> your<00:00:42.699> measure<00:00:42.909> once

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
doing your sleeve your measure once

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.209 
doing your sleeve your measure once
again<00:00:43.539> from<00:00:43.719> that<00:00:43.870> seam<00:00:44.140> of<00:00:44.379> your<00:00:44.620> of<00:00:44.890> your

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
again from that seam of your of your

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.689 
again from that seam of your of your
shoulder<00:00:45.699> and<00:00:45.899> you've<00:00:46.899> put<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.489> tape<00:00:48.489> measure

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
shoulder and you've put the tape measure

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.579 
shoulder and you've put the tape measure
right<00:00:48.999> on<00:00:49.329> there<00:00:49.510> on<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.989> edge<00:00:50.079> there<00:00:50.350> where

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
right on there on the edge there where

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.559 
right on there on the edge there where
your<00:00:50.769> sleeve<00:00:51.039> meets<00:00:51.339> your<00:00:51.519> shoulder<00:00:51.850> on<00:00:52.030> that

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
your sleeve meets your shoulder on that

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.209 
your sleeve meets your shoulder on that
tip<00:00:52.809> and<00:00:53.019> then<00:00:53.139> you<00:00:53.260> run<00:00:53.440> it<00:00:53.559> down<00:00:53.710> your<00:00:53.949> sleeve

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
tip and then you run it down your sleeve

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.369 
tip and then you run it down your sleeve
and<00:00:54.429> run<00:00:54.969> it<00:00:55.089> down<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.479> bottom<00:00:55.780> that

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
and run it down to the bottom that

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.139 
and run it down to the bottom that
meters<00:00:56.739> through<00:00:57.010> at<00:00:57.280> 61

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
meters through at 61

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.029 
meters through at 61
now<00:00:58.569> with<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:58.839> sleeve<00:00:59.079> it<00:00:59.260> always<00:00:59.440> pays<00:00:59.829> to<00:00:59.859> be

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
now with the sleeve it always pays to be

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.829 
now with the sleeve it always pays to be
a<00:01:00.100> little<00:01:00.399> bit<00:01:00.519> generous<00:01:00.760> don't<00:01:01.239> be<00:01:01.420> too<00:01:01.569> tight

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
a little bit generous don't be too tight

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.509 
a little bit generous don't be too tight
on<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.170> sleeve<00:01:02.409> because<00:01:02.859> it's<00:01:03.039> easier<00:01:03.459> to

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
on the sleeve because it's easier to

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.700 
on the sleeve because it's easier to
shorten<00:01:03.999> your<00:01:04.089> sleep<00:01:04.330> and<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.659> is<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:05.019> make<00:01:05.530> it

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
shorten your sleep and it is to make it

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.459 
shorten your sleep and it is to make it
longer<00:01:05.920> so<00:01:06.579> with<00:01:06.850> it<00:01:07.000> measured<00:01:07.299> at<00:01:07.420> 61<00:01:07.990> I<00:01:08.170> would

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
longer so with it measured at 61 I would

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.800 
longer so with it measured at 61 I would
seem<00:01:08.740> through<00:01:09.189> probably<00:01:09.820> at<00:01:09.939> 62<00:01:10.450> centimeters

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
seem through probably at 62 centimeters

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.749 
seem through probably at 62 centimeters
maybe<00:01:11.289> give<00:01:11.500> yourself<00:01:11.799> a<00:01:11.920> centimeter<00:01:12.369> leeway

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
maybe give yourself a centimeter leeway

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.600 
maybe give yourself a centimeter leeway
as<00:01:13.000> I<00:01:13.390> say<00:01:13.659> you<00:01:13.719> do<00:01:13.990> find<00:01:14.229> another<00:01:14.610> that's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
as I say you do find another that's

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.010 
as I say you do find another that's
crease<00:01:15.939> a<00:01:15.969> little<00:01:16.119> bit<00:01:16.450> through<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.780> sleeve

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
crease a little bit through the sleeve

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.109 
crease a little bit through the sleeve
so<00:01:17.289> you<00:01:17.380> can<00:01:17.619> find<00:01:17.920> over<00:01:18.070> time<00:01:18.369> it'll<00:01:18.609> ride<00:01:18.880> up

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
so you can find over time it'll ride up

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.620 
so you can find over time it'll ride up
half<00:01:19.719> a<00:01:19.869> centimeter<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.409> a<00:01:20.560> centimeter<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.299> as

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
half a centimeter to a centimeter and as

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.109 
half a centimeter to a centimeter and as
I<00:01:22.659> say<00:01:22.960> if<00:01:23.259> it's<00:01:23.469> a<00:01:23.829> wee<00:01:24.250> bit<00:01:24.399> too<00:01:24.549> long<00:01:24.759> it<00:01:25.000> can

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
I say if it's a wee bit too long it can

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.550 
I say if it's a wee bit too long it can
always<00:01:25.240> be<00:01:25.329> shortened<00:01:25.810> quite<00:01:26.020> easily<00:01:26.170> the

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
always be shortened quite easily the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.740 
always be shortened quite easily the
next<00:01:27.460> measurement<00:01:27.729> would<00:01:27.939> be<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.180> bust<00:01:28.420> and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
next measurement would be the bust and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.139 
next measurement would be the bust and
with<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.259> bust<00:01:29.469> you<00:01:29.710> just<00:01:29.920> go<00:01:30.039> right<00:01:30.149> take

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
with the bust you just go right take

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.029 
with the bust you just go right take
them<00:01:31.329> take<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.780> tape<00:01:31.960> measure<00:01:32.170> under<00:01:32.859> both

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
them take the tape measure under both

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.160 
them take the tape measure under both
arms<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:34.210> you<00:01:34.299> pull<00:01:34.509> that<00:01:34.630> up<00:01:34.689> just<00:01:34.990> so

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
arms and so you pull that up just so

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.990 
arms and so you pull that up just so
that<00:01:35.200> it's<00:01:35.409> under<00:01:35.679> the<00:01:36.159> scene<00:01:36.399> with<00:01:36.549> both<00:01:36.729> arms

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
that it's under the scene with both arms

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.209 
that it's under the scene with both arms
and<00:01:37.359> just<00:01:38.049> across<00:01:38.259> the<00:01:38.500> bust<00:01:38.770> oops<00:01:39.670> here<00:01:40.539> we<00:01:40.600> go

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
and just across the bust oops here we go

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.219 
and just across the bust oops here we go
just<00:01:42.219> across<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.579> bust<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.210> then<00:01:43.659> we<00:01:43.780> measure

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
just across the bust and then we measure

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.020 
just across the bust and then we measure
through<00:01:44.619> so<00:01:45.130> that's<00:01:45.310> measuring<00:01:45.700> your<00:01:45.820> bust

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
through so that's measuring your bust

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.630 
through so that's measuring your bust
just<00:01:46.600> across<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.079> widest<00:01:47.799> part<00:01:48.009> through<00:01:48.340> and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
just across the widest part through and

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.889 
just across the widest part through and
then<00:01:49.450> what<00:01:49.869> we<00:01:50.020> also<00:01:50.170> need<00:01:50.499> is<00:01:50.679> your<00:01:50.859> hips<00:01:51.899> if

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
then what we also need is your hips if

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.480 
then what we also need is your hips if
you're<00:01:53.109> wearing<00:01:53.289> something<00:01:53.409> and<00:01:54.039> it's<00:01:54.310> got

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
you're wearing something and it's got

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.219 
you're wearing something and it's got
buckles<00:01:54.820> through<00:01:54.969> the<00:01:55.060> side<00:01:55.270> take<00:01:55.929> it<00:01:55.960> off

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
buckles through the side take it off

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.630 
buckles through the side take it off
because<00:01:56.649> that's<00:01:56.950> going<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.159> give<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.399> a<00:01:57.429> false

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
because that's going to give you a false

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.499 
because that's going to give you a false
reading<00:01:58.210> so<00:01:58.539> with<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.670> with<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.759> waist<00:02:00.999> it's

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
reading so with the with the waist it's

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.480 
reading so with the with the waist it's
just<00:02:01.749> that<00:02:01.869> your<00:02:01.990> widest<00:02:02.380> part<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.950> you'll

need<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:32.860> runs<00:02:33.040> through<00:02:33.220> at<00:02:33.310> 59<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.569> those

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
need so that runs through at 59 so those

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.750 
need so that runs through at 59 so those
are<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.230> measurements<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.739> we<00:02:35.860> need<00:02:36.160> to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
are the measurements that we need to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.009 
are the measurements that we need to
custom<00:02:37.300> make<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.510> jacket<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.810> something
