00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
sometimes one of the tricks that I use I

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.480 
sometimes one of the tricks that I use I
always<00:01:18.630> imagined<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.350> fish<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.070> looking<00:01:20.310> at<00:01:20.400> my

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.830 
always imagined a fish is looking at my
bait<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.299> when<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> cite

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840

fit<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> fish<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.700> mean<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> fish<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
fit if you see a fish I mean you fish a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.810 
fit if you see a fish I mean you fish a
lot<00:01:24.900> more<00:01:25.110> effectively<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> start

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
lot more effectively when I start

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.340 
lot more effectively when I start
feeling<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.270> bottom<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.720> don't<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> use

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
feeling that bottom I don't have to use

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.870 
feeling that bottom I don't have to use
that<00:01:28.380> trick<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.729> believe

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
that trick because I really do believe

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.590 
that trick because I really do believe
that<00:01:30.060> means<00:01:30.390> our<00:01:30.540> fish<00:01:30.750> down<00:01:30.990> there<00:01:31.020> right<00:01:32.009> now
