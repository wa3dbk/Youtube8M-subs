00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.810
 the entry-level nikon the d3100 outlet 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.430
 in September 2000 this case has for 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.369
 main goal of making you forget 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.449
 the compact in favor of a reflex in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.460
 effect it is simple

 of use and allows just like a 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.820
 Compact to make photos and videos hd 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.770

 megapixels manage and owns a 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.710

 12800 iso setting 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.340
 the main innovation of the case and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.629
 the arrival of a full hd video mode with 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.570
 permanent autofocus

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.079
 to film while keeping the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.609
 point on the subject it is besides this 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.520
 device that we use to 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.960
 make videos of our podcast the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.850
 presence of a user guide 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.860
 integrated makes it easy to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.510
 learning the case and modes 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.299
 shooting that then become 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.920
 more accessible the recourse to the menu will be 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.140
 however less frequent thanks to a 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.420
 Mode selector arranged on top 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.740
 of the case on the back side a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.630
 key combination allowing 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.759
 to access the gallery or edit 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.590
 just the key settings 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.180
 besides quite judiciously placed 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.670
 will allow you to quickly switch 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.740
 framing live view that corresponds to the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.390
 aimed on the back screen and to pass 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.869
 in video mode by pressing the button 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.700
 red 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.869
 the d3100 accepts sd and sdhc cards 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.329
 and allows you to take pictures in 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.259

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.560
 both level connectivity output hdmi 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.780
 is mini usb jack are to be noticed 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.490
 all in all the d3100 is a very good 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.560
 entry-level sensor cmos 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.899
 to make good pictures 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.450
 but mostly 1080p full HD movies 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.850
 for a price of around 500 euros on the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.040
 web for amateurs this is a way to 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.140
 set aside his digital compact and 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.479
 finally switch to SLR without going through 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.300
 the bridge card in a future video 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.550
