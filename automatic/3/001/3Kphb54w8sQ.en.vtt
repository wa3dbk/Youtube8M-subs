00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.670
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.800
 Welcome to the 5 x 1 answer of this 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.900
 week throughout this afternoon we are going to 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.460
 answer several questions already as what 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.590
 we did in the first entry of this 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.840
 new format to which I hope you continue 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.180
 supporting as you did in the first 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.189
 week let's go with the first question of 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.439
 The afternoon is made by AndrÃ© Bonilla 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.359
 says guys there is some way to record 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.929
 the iphone screen without jailbreak and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.570
 without mac well then I'll answer you 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.329
 see legally there is no way to power 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.860
 record the screen without jailbreak and without 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.280
 mac but I'm going to give you several 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.950
 alternatives according to what you see 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.850
 you say you can do it but usually to 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.190
 hair usually escapes 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.110
 there are some applications agree that 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.969
 install certificates that allow you 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.920
 run applications that are outside of 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.960
 the app store in agreement there is a 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.170
 application his name is ay reik that the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.910
 I met in a video of a channel 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.070
 foreign channel will stop 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.289
 continue here but I have to try 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.180
 install it my iphone does not work I do not know 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.979
 if it's my thing isolated or not 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.810
 it will work, I will leave it 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.759
 down here and if it works for you hey 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.340
 I am glad your name there is rec of agreement 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.440
 answer the video here then there are several 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.780
 alternatives to be able to record also 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.399
 your grandfather screen I already take advantage of 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.860
 yagual complete kit and a little bit all the 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.840
 options there are programs like for example 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.810
 reflector if you for example have a 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.070
 windows a windows or mac computer 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.590
 reflector also work with windows 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.429
 and mac you could use this application 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.490
 to be able to reflect what you have in your 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.409
 screen on your monitor according to that 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.110
 form your logo within the application in 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.420
 windows in this case you can record the 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.220
 screen which is a very simple way 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.009
 of 2 megabytes we also did a tutorial 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.569
 I'm going to leave you here below 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.580
 so I also treat him one more and 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.350
 reflector tutorial then if you have 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.049
 quick time is to say if you have a mac 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.890
 then nothing plug in through the connector 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.689
 line and mac the iphone and nothing with quick 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.189
 time record the screen you record the sound 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.439
 and perfect and that's how we do it 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.969
 us and then if you have to carry 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.440
 then it removes is logically already 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.890
 there are applications like display 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.660
 remember and so on, so these are not 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.519
 the options you have to record the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.859
 iphone as I say data of interest 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.859
 you have down here so throw them a 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:23.600
 eye and good if I find also some 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.130
 other pages that are alternatives the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.109
 reflector also answers us here 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.579
 so nothing guys we see each other inside the 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.260
 I'm here with another video here in the app 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.109
 five for one because you already know that if 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.489
 fernando to leave the questions leave 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.769
 questions for next week that 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.239
 there were little the previous week that 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.980
 see you in a next video because 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.030
 these to seal by one and misinforming 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.030
 and I promise to do it
