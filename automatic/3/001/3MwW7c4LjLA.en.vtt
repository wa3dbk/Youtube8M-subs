finding them to be just not very sort of
ergonomic<00:02:46.760> really<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:47.780> they<00:02:47.989> stick<00:02:48.379> out

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
ergonomic really that they stick out

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
a comparison in short while but it's

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.890 
a comparison in short while but it's
hard<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.430> explain<00:02:52.849> it<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.269> seems<00:02:53.540> like<00:02:53.720> on

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
hard to explain it it seems like on

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.440 
hard to explain it it seems like on
these<00:02:54.109> buttons<00:02:54.530> here<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.519> have<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.940> really

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
these buttons here you have to really

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.900 
these buttons here you have to really
hit<00:02:56.690> them<00:02:56.959> quite<00:02:57.590> precisely<00:02:58.069> whereas<00:02:58.670> on<00:02:58.819> the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
hit them quite precisely whereas on the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.970 
hit them quite precisely whereas on the
previous<00:02:59.359> one<00:02:59.390> the<00:03:00.079> whole<00:03:00.290> button<00:03:00.620> seemed<00:03:00.890> to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
previous one the whole button seemed to

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.849 
previous one the whole button seemed to
be<00:03:01.099> a<00:03:01.129> lot<00:03:01.310> more<00:03:01.340> sensitive<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.269> touch<00:03:02.859> the

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
be a lot more sensitive to touch the

be a lot more sensitive to touch the
actual<00:03:04.010> sort<00:03:04.819> of<00:03:04.879> feel<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.269> controller<00:03:05.629> in

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
actual sort of feel of the controller in

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.170 
actual sort of feel of the controller in
my<00:03:05.930> hand<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.379> do<00:03:06.440> like<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:07.160> actual<00:03:07.579> sort

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
my hand I do like the actual sort

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.880 
my hand I do like the actual sort
comfort<00:03:08.629> level<00:03:08.900> offered<00:03:09.260> by<00:03:09.379> this<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.590> little

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
comfort level offered by this a little

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.949 
comfort level offered by this a little
bit<00:03:09.980> more<00:03:10.220> though<00:03:10.400> so<00:03:11.269> let's<00:03:11.390> have<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.629> look<00:03:11.810> at

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
bit more though so let's have a look at

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.130 
bit more though so let's have a look at
this<00:03:12.200> compared<00:03:12.829> to<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.340> day<00:03:13.489> one<00:03:13.760> edition<00:03:14.209> so

this compared to the day one edition so
you'll<00:03:15.290> see<00:03:15.470> here<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:16.430> day<00:03:16.640> one<00:03:16.849> edition

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.890 
the day one edition says day one 2013 on
it<00:03:24.859> and<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.489> regular<00:03:25.849> controller<00:03:26.269> does<00:03:26.599> not

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
it and the regular controller does not

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.199 
it and the regular controller does not
that<00:03:27.560> is<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:28.040> only<00:03:28.250> differences<00:03:28.970> there<00:03:29.180> are

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
that is the only differences there are

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.030 
that is the only differences there are
no<00:03:29.510> other<00:03:29.780> differences<00:03:30.349> between<00:03:30.560> these<00:03:30.980> two

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
no other differences between these two

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.670 
no other differences between these two
controllers<00:03:31.700> yes<00:03:32.599> of<00:03:32.870> course<00:03:33.169> it's<00:03:33.380> nice<00:03:33.500> to

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
controllers yes of course it's nice to

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.589 
controllers yes of course it's nice to
have<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.889> day<00:03:34.010> one<00:03:34.220> edition<00:03:34.340> but<00:03:35.150> this<00:03:35.329> works

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
have the day one edition but this works

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.530 
have the day one edition but this works
exactly<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.709> same<00:03:37.000> now<00:03:38.000> let's<00:03:38.180> have<00:03:38.299> a<00:03:38.359> look

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
exactly the same now let's have a look

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.530 
exactly the same now let's have a look
at<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.959> previous<00:03:39.440> generations<00:03:40.069> is<00:03:40.340> the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
at the previous generations is the

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.620 
at the previous generations is the
xbox360<00:03:41.540> controller<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:43.730> one<00:03:43.970> if<00:03:44.510> I

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
xbox360 controller and this one if I

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.110 
xbox360 controller and this one if I
just<00:03:44.840> placed<00:03:45.139> them<00:03:45.410> sort<00:03:46.099> of<00:03:46.160> in<00:03:46.280> shot<00:03:46.549> like<00:03:46.760> so

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
just placed them sort of in shot like so

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.440 
just placed them sort of in shot like so
you<00:03:47.690> can<00:03:47.870> see<00:03:48.109> is<00:03:48.819> more<00:03:49.819> or<00:03:49.940> less<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.239> same

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
you can see is more or less the same

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.940 
you can see is more or less the same
shape<00:03:51.190> but<00:03:52.190> this<00:03:53.120> one<00:03:53.389> just<00:03:53.419> feels<00:03:53.989> slightly

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
shape but this one just feels slightly

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.129 
shape but this one just feels slightly
larger<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:55.639> it's<00:03:56.359> got<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.540> slightly<00:03:56.900> different

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
larger and it's got a slightly different

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.250 
larger and it's got a slightly different
shape<00:03:57.650> along<00:03:58.519> this<00:03:58.849> bottom<00:03:59.180> edge<00:03:59.540> here<00:03:59.569> so

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
shape along this bottom edge here so

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.809 
shape along this bottom edge here so
this<00:04:00.410> bottom<00:04:00.889> edge<00:04:01.040> is<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.280> slightly<00:04:01.639> different

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
this bottom edge is a slightly different

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.099 
this bottom edge is a slightly different
shape<00:04:02.269> and<00:04:02.480> also<00:04:03.079> if<00:04:03.290> we<00:04:03.379> turn<00:04:03.590> them<00:04:03.739> over<00:04:05.109> the

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
shape and also if we turn them over the

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.159 
shape and also if we turn them over the
sort<00:04:06.590> of<00:04:06.620> depth<00:04:06.980> inside<00:04:07.730> these<00:04:08.209> parts<00:04:08.750> here

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
sort of depth inside these parts here

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.770 
sort of depth inside these parts here
this<00:04:09.859> one's<00:04:10.099> a<00:04:10.220> lot<00:04:10.310> deeper<00:04:10.639> and<00:04:11.030> this<00:04:11.540> one's

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
this one's a lot deeper and this one's

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.300 
this one's a lot deeper and this one's
obviously<00:04:12.139> a<00:04:12.199> lot<00:04:12.349> smoother<00:04:12.859> the<00:04:12.980> battery

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
obviously a lot smoother the battery

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.640 
obviously a lot smoother the battery
packs<00:04:13.519> integrated<00:04:14.329> in<00:04:14.480> here<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.199> on<00:04:15.319> here<00:04:15.530> the

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
packs integrated in here and on here the

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
battery pack sort of stuck out and it

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.620 
battery pack sort of stuck out and it
just<00:04:18.260> makes<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:18.919> for<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.190> much<00:04:19.549> nicer<00:04:19.880> sort<00:04:20.539> of

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
just makes it for a much nicer sort of

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.890 
just makes it for a much nicer sort of

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
sit in the hand

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.860

now<00:04:22.620> when<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.830> mentioned<00:04:23.220> about<00:04:23.370> these<00:04:23.870> top

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
now when I mentioned about these top

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.750 
now when I mentioned about these top
bands<00:04:25.229> here<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.770> mentioned<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.400> this<00:04:26.550> one

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
bands here I mentioned that this one

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.659 
bands here I mentioned that this one
wasn't<00:04:27.030> quite<00:04:27.180> as<00:04:27.330> good<00:04:27.389> you<00:04:28.290> can<00:04:28.410> see<00:04:28.620> on<00:04:28.860> the

middle on the Xbox one controller you
can't<00:04:42.000> hit<00:04:42.210> them<00:04:42.330> on<00:04:42.479> this<00:04:42.630> edge<00:04:42.840> you<00:04:43.800> can<00:04:43.949> hit

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
going to miss some triggers on here so

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.469 
going to miss some triggers on here so
not<00:04:52.110> as<00:04:52.320> good<00:04:53.250> in<00:04:53.460> my<00:04:53.699> opinion<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:54.210> would<00:04:54.360> have

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
not as good in my opinion I would have

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.420 
not as good in my opinion I would have
liked<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.870> have<00:04:55.050> traveled<00:04:55.530> all<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.310> way

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
liked it to have traveled all the way

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.610 
liked it to have traveled all the way
down<00:04:56.699> from<00:04:57.000> this<00:04:57.150> section<00:04:57.630> here<00:04:58.050> rather<00:04:58.410> than

down from this section here rather than

down from this section here rather than
just<00:04:58.830> from<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.130> middle<00:04:59.370> section<00:04:59.610> downwards

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
just from the middle section downwards

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.379 
just from the middle section downwards
it's<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.900> small<00:05:01.169> thing<00:05:01.410> but<00:05:01.470> I<00:05:02.070> just<00:05:02.340> prefer<00:05:02.520> the

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
it's a small thing but I just prefer the

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.600 
it's a small thing but I just prefer the
way<00:05:03.539> this<00:05:03.750> one<00:05:03.990> works<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:04.620> actual<00:05:05.400> trigger

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
way this one works the actual trigger

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.580 
way this one works the actual trigger
buttons<00:05:05.910> at<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.060> back<00:05:06.300> these<00:05:06.930> ones<00:05:07.229> are<00:05:07.410> a<00:05:07.440> lot

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
buttons at the back these ones are a lot

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.010 
buttons at the back these ones are a lot
sort<00:05:07.830> of<00:05:07.919> flimsier<00:05:08.400> not<00:05:08.669> sort<00:05:09.210> of<00:05:09.270> firm<00:05:09.570> not<00:05:09.900> as

sort of flimsier not sort of firm not as

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.770 
sort of flimsier not sort of firm not as
responsive<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.830> this<00:05:11.550> one<00:05:11.760> here<00:05:12.120> does<00:05:12.479> feel

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
responsive and this one here does feel

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.050 
responsive and this one here does feel
quite<00:05:13.199> a<00:05:13.320> lot<00:05:13.500> better<00:05:13.710> I<00:05:13.830> do<00:05:13.889> like<00:05:14.340> these<00:05:14.850> a<00:05:14.910> lot

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
quite a lot better I do like these a lot

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.090 
quite a lot better I do like these a lot
better<00:05:15.419> than<00:05:15.690> on<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.020> previous<00:05:16.169> generation

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
better than on the previous generation

the rest of the buttons the thumb sticks

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.620 
the rest of the buttons the thumb sticks
pretty<00:05:19.680> much<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:20.010> same<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:20.370> d-pad<00:05:20.910> feels

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
pretty much the same the d-pad feels

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.000 
pretty much the same the d-pad feels
pretty<00:05:21.900> much<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.229> same<00:05:22.410> this<00:05:22.620> one<00:05:22.830> was

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
pretty much the same this one was

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.439 
pretty much the same this one was
probably<00:05:23.220> a<00:05:23.400> little<00:05:23.580> bit<00:05:23.699> more<00:05:23.789> spongy

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
probably a little bit more spongy

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.600 
probably a little bit more spongy
feeling<00:05:24.690> and<00:05:25.020> this<00:05:25.620> one<00:05:25.830> seems<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.310> little<00:05:26.400> bit

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
feeling and this one seems a little bit

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.800 
feeling and this one seems a little bit
more<00:05:26.639> accurate<00:05:26.970> and<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.389> little<00:05:27.570> bit<00:05:27.690> more

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
more accurate and a little bit more
