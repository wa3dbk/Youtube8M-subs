if<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.329> tap<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.689> fast<00:01:33.960> enough<00:01:34.430> it<00:01:35.430> will

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
if you tap it fast enough it will

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.950 
if you tap it fast enough it will
actually<00:01:37.159> freeze<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.400> animation<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.810> where

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
actually freeze that animation to where

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.920 
actually freeze that animation to where
it<00:01:40.049> seems<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.299> you're<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> corpse
