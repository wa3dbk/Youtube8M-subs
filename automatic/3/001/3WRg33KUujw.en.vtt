00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.410
 in that way 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.410
 without ceasing 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.080
 the pulsar of the Japanese brand nissan 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.880
 compete in the monitoring also 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.000
 known as the compact 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.000
 today 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.800
 designed and developed in Spain 'is 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.180
 manufactures in the plant that the brand has 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.820
 in Barcelona he uses the platform 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.680
 modular of qashqai and shares with this 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.340
 model some technical elements like 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.340
 the address 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.940
 yes 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.750
 the length is 439 meters and the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.040
 wheelbase is 270 meters 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.810
 that allows the best space 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.210
 longitudinal for the legs of the 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.090
 rear passengers of the segment of fact 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.250
 with 69.2 centimeters it is clearly by 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.070
 above the measure of segment c that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.170
 are 50 and 62 and also exceeds the average 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.600
 of segment d which is the superior in 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.600
 size and it is 50 and 89 centimeters 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.109
 the width is 177 meters 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.109
 and the height of 152 meters 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.570
 only the finished tekna tested which is the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.610
 Superior has daily departures 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.510
 of the air conditioner for the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.700
 rear seats 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.150
 although the rear windows do not go down 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.150
 altogether 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.850
 the trunk offers 385 liters of 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.860
 capacity so that is also fine 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.300
 located in front of the competition and it 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.510
 can expand by folding the seats 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.510
 rear up to two thousand 385 liters 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.980
 aesthetically follow the steps of the new 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.110
 qashqai both in the exterior design with 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.270
 a robust and athletic image as in the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.340
 cabin with some adjustments and materials 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.470
 good looking leather upholstery 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.420
 perforated as standard and a remarkable 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.420
 acoustic insulation of the interior 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.120
 the test unit mounted in position 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.299
 front in transverse an engine 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.600
 turbodiésel 1.5 dci that provides a 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.580
 maximum power of 110 horses 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.320
 has four cylinders in line 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.510
 turbo with variable geometry staff 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.220
 and an intercooler to cool the air 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.350
 compressed by the turbo before the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.560
 admission provides a good pair of 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.210
 push that already offers its maximum value to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.770
 1750 revolutions per minute and it 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.770
 Keep until 2500 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.650
 It is true 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.800
 the available driving force is 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.540
 move to the front wheels to see 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.250
 a manual gear change of six 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.810
 relationships and you have the system 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.700
 Stop and start stop and start 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.950
 automatic in detentions 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.450
 the lever is well placed and offers a 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.450
 smooth and precise drive 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.620
 the benefits are correct for the 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.330
 approach of this version with a 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.580
 Acceleration from 0 to 100 kilometers per 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.680
 time in 11 5 seconds and a speed 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.680
 190 kilometers per hour maximum 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.629
 everything is a means homologated by mass is 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.060
 of 36 liters per 100 km and in our 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.019
 test we have measured 6.2 liters per 100 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.489
 kilometer 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.920
 it is not difficult to get consumed in 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.269
 around 55 liters but we are always 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.380
 in figures well above the 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.210
 homologated 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.130
 in the place 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.230
 Ghana 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.420
 the pulsar incorporates a series of 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.950
 advanced technology elements among 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.320
 which include the so-called 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.390
 smart protection shield the 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.850
 360 ° vision camera 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.680
 Bird's eye view tracing control 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.170
 active the braking system of 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.120
 emergency or the latest generation of 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.480
 nissan infotainment system 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.480
 connect 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.860
 the motion detector uses the 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.650
 360 vision camera possibilities 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.930
 degrees to improve the traditional 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.030
 parking aids that are limited to 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.700
 warn the driver if they detect objects 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.010
 in the trajectory of the vehicle 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.230
 this detector provides an alert 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.910
 sound and visual if someone or something is 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.010
 moves towards the car when it goes to 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.870
 retreat for example a child who 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.230
 approach walking perpendicular to 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.230
 car 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.500
 the pulsar offers an accomplished commitment 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.560
 between efficiency and running comfort and a 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.780
 remarkable smoothness of operation pisa 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.199
 well on the asphalt and it's easy to 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.199
 drive 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.310
 to the favorable feeling of agility 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.230
 contributes the control system of 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.670
 active plot that analyzes the 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.980
 behavior of the trajectory of 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.140
 car and performs a selective braking to 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.370
 the wheels to emulate the 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.370
 action of a differential of 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.620
 limited slip 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.510
 the result is a greater softness in the 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.580
 tracing of the curves and a remarkable 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.360
 pulling capacity when accelerating to the 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.360
 exit from them 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.720
 what we liked the most is the broad 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.370
 longitudinal space in the squares 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.690
 backs and the good compromise between 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.690
 efficiency and ride comfort 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.569
 What we liked the least was the 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.340
 system touch stop &amp; start especially 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:45.930
 with the cold engine and how low the 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.259
 front skirt as it rubs on the 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.259
 ramps 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.810
 it's my life 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.810
 yes 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.400
 all right 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.319
 It is true
