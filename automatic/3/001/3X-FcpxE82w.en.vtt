00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
grinding process there could be my

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.690 
grinding process there could be my
grinding<00:01:05.400> material<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.000> there<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
grinding material in there so if you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
there on each one of these we got to

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.120 
there on each one of these we got to
make<00:01:20.670> sure<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:20.970> get<00:01:21.090> rid<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:22.979> got

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
come in and scrubbed on the poles and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.830 
come in and scrubbed on the poles and
takes<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> better<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.970> tiling<00:01:33.420> scrub<00:01:33.689> these

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
takes the better of tiling scrub these

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.020 
takes the better of tiling scrub these
holes<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:36.950> for<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.040> matter<00:01:38.250> cannot<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.670> too

is<00:02:04.210> if<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.480> look<00:02:04.690> at<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.900> oil<00:02:04.930> holes<00:02:05.440> after

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
is if you look at the oil holes after

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.330 
is if you look at the oil holes after
the<00:02:06.850> machine<00:02:07.030> shop<00:02:07.860> grinds<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.979> crankshaft

they're<00:02:09.850> going<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.060> deburr<00:02:10.570> this<00:02:10.990> oil<00:02:11.290> oil<00:02:11.620> him

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
they're going to deburr this oil oil him

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.270 
they're going to deburr this oil oil him
hopefully<00:02:13.740> they're<00:02:14.740> going<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.920> do<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.010> good<00:02:15.220> job

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280

then what you have is you have a bird on
that<00:02:40.959> oil<00:02:41.230> hole<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.920> don't<00:02:42.100> have<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.280> get

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
that oil hole and you don't have to get

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.100 
that oil hole and you don't have to get
in<00:02:42.490> there<00:02:42.640> with<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.820> file<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.570> fix<00:02:43.930> that

in there with a file and fix that
somehow<00:02:44.459> if<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.670> skip<00:02:46.030> doing<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.660> if<00:02:47.140> you

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
somehow if you skip doing this if you

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.370 
somehow if you skip doing this if you
skip<00:02:47.650> checking<00:02:48.420> those<00:02:49.420> little<00:02:49.780> holes<00:02:49.930> or<00:02:50.230> any

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
kind of a burner and you put the motor

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.050 
kind of a burner and you put the motor
together<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.920> could<00:02:54.160> take<00:02:54.400> out<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.730> bearing

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
together it could take out the bearing

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.940 
together it could take out the bearing
and<00:02:55.150> wipe<00:02:55.330> out<00:02:55.540> your<00:02:55.750> mother<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.650> need<00:02:56.860> to

the efforts been reground and just put
it<00:04:22.600> in<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.780> motor<00:04:23.160> there's<00:04:24.160> some<00:04:24.370> cleaning

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
it in the motor there's some cleaning

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.200 
it in the motor there's some cleaning
some<00:04:26.200> checks<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.650> got<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.950> do<00:04:27.100> size<00:04:27.580> checking

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
some checks you got to do size checking

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.840 
some checks you got to do size checking
oil<00:04:28.750> hole<00:04:29.440> deeper<00:04:29.889> and<00:04:29.919> all<00:04:30.130> that<00:04:30.340> stuff<00:04:30.610> it's

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.560 
lose your motor or a customer motor so
hopefully<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:35.950> helped<00:04:36.250> you<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:37.000> remember
