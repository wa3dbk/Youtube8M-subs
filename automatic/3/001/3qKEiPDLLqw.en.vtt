going to show you a really easy way to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.609 
going to show you a really easy way to
do<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.759> what<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.540> here<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> piece

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
do this so what I have here is a piece

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.660 
do this so what I have here is a piece
of<00:01:45.229> this<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.439> palette<00:01:46.890> paper<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.460> can

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
of this is palette paper which you can

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
of this is palette paper which you can
mix<00:01:47.880> paints<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.810> got<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> nice<00:01:49.170> slick

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
mix paints on so it's got a nice slick

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.850 
mix paints on so it's got a nice slick
surface<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.729> think<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.090> could<00:01:51.240> also<00:01:51.270> use

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
surface but I think you could also use

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.270 
surface but I think you could also use
probably<00:01:52.860> wax<00:01:53.189> paper<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.619> something

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
probably wax paper it's just something

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.639 
probably wax paper it's just something
that<00:01:56.310> your<00:01:56.759> tape<00:01:57.060> will<00:01:57.750> stick<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.469> we'll

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that your tape will stick to but we'll

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.950 
that your tape will stick to but we'll
pull<00:01:58.890> back<00:01:59.310> off<00:01:59.549> those<00:01:59.759> eventually<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.810> what

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
pull back off those eventually so what

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.330 
pull back off those eventually so what
I'm<00:02:01.049> going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.259> do<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> think<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.040> fit<00:02:02.250> about

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
I'm going to do I think I can fit about

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.100 
I'm going to do I think I can fit about
4<00:02:02.909> pieces<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.689> my<00:02:04.560> homemade<00:02:04.950> tape<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.520> here

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
4 pieces of my homemade tape on here

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.859 
4 pieces of my homemade tape on here
so<00:02:06.190> I'm<00:02:07.190> going<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.400> just<00:02:07.550> apply<00:02:07.910> some<00:02:08.300> masking

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
so I'm going to just apply some masking

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.600 
so I'm going to just apply some masking
tape<00:02:08.900> strips<00:02:09.970> right<00:02:10.970> across<00:02:11.300> here<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:12.610> you

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
tape strips right across here and you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.970 
tape strips right across here and you
want<00:02:13.790> them<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:13.970> be<00:02:14.180> pretty<00:02:14.360> flat<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:14.930> try<00:02:15.920> to

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
want them to be pretty flat so try to

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.510 
want them to be pretty flat so try to
get<00:02:16.220> out<00:02:16.370> all<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.180> wrinkles<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:18.260> I'm<00:02:19.100> using<00:02:19.340> a

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
get out all the wrinkles and I'm using a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.540 
get out all the wrinkles and I'm using a
scotch<00:02:20.320> scotch<00:02:21.320> masking<00:02:21.920> tape<00:02:22.100> because<00:02:22.370> it's

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
scotch scotch masking tape because it's

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.150 
scotch scotch masking tape because it's
really<00:02:23.090> nice<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.630> sticky<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.800> when<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.070> go

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
really nice and sticky and when you go

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.680 
really nice and sticky and when you go
to<00:02:25.220> put<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.460> on<00:02:25.580> your<00:02:25.700> pages<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.360> not<00:02:26.510> going

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
to put it on your pages it's not going

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.770 
to put it on your pages it's not going
to<00:02:26.750> pull<00:02:26.990> off<00:02:27.640> some<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.850> cheaper<00:02:29.180> brands<00:02:29.570> I

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
to pull off some of the cheaper brands I

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.950 
to pull off some of the cheaper brands I
don't<00:02:30.710> recommend<00:02:31.040> because<00:02:31.660> they're<00:02:32.660> just<00:02:32.840> not

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
don't recommend because they're just not

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.160 
don't recommend because they're just not
tacky<00:02:33.350> enough<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.480> I'm<00:02:35.690> going<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.900> apply<00:02:35.990> a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
tacky enough so I'm going to apply a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.610 
tacky enough so I'm going to apply a
wolf<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.960> I'm<00:02:38.960> going<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.200> get<00:02:39.320> some<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.530> these

wolf and I'm going to get some of these
wrinkles<00:02:40.280> out<00:02:41.710> all<00:02:42.710> right<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.070> one<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.250> my

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.100 
wrinkles out all right and one of my
favorite<00:02:43.820> tools<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.510> think<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.810> showed<00:02:44.930> you

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
favorite tools I think I showed you

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.230 
favorite tools I think I showed you
before<00:02:45.370> little<00:02:46.370> piece<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:48.760> counter<00:02:49.760> tops<00:02:50.030> a

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
before little piece of counter tops a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.810 
before little piece of counter tops a
sample<00:02:50.900> from<00:02:51.050> Lowe's<00:02:51.410> really<00:02:52.400> good<00:02:52.580> for

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
sample from Lowe's really good for

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.730 
sample from Lowe's really good for
scraping<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:53.930> would<00:02:54.170> just<00:02:54.260> try<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.500> get<00:02:54.680> out

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
scraping so I would just try to get out

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.020 
scraping so I would just try to get out
as<00:02:55.040> many<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.459> wrinkles<00:02:55.790> as<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.030> can<00:02:56.860> and

as many of the wrinkles as you can and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.460 
as many of the wrinkles as you can and
then<00:02:59.030> what<00:02:59.360> you're<00:02:59.510> going<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.660> do<00:02:59.870> is<00:03:00.170> you're

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
then what you're going to do is you're

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
then what you're going to do is you're
going<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.740> need<00:03:01.120> some<00:03:02.170> permanent<00:03:03.170> ink<00:03:03.560> so

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
on 8 - kind of addicting probably kills

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.450 
on 8 - kind of addicting probably kills
brain<00:04:04.100> cells<00:04:04.160> but<00:04:04.870> that's<00:04:05.870> okay<00:04:06.170> all<00:04:07.130> right

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
brain cells but that's okay all right

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.520 
brain cells but that's okay all right
and<00:04:07.610> so<00:04:07.850> maybe<00:04:08.180> for<00:04:08.480> my<00:04:08.600> next<00:04:08.870> one<00:04:09.080> I<00:04:09.110> like<00:04:09.350> this

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
and so maybe for my next one I like this

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.490 
and so maybe for my next one I like this
long<00:04:09.800> number<00:04:10.070> stamps<00:04:10.730> so<00:04:11.350> usually<00:04:12.350> when<00:04:12.470> I

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
long number stamps so usually when I

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
have big stamps like this I I turn them

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.410 
have big stamps like this I I turn them
over<00:04:14.360> and<00:04:14.630> I<00:04:14.660> ink<00:04:14.840> them<00:04:14.960> up<00:04:15.110> this<00:04:15.830> way<00:04:16.269> works<00:04:17.269> a

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
over and I ink them up this way works a

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.420 
over and I ink them up this way works a
little<00:04:17.570> bit<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:20.269> might<00:04:20.420> want<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:20.690> do<00:04:20.870> one

right-side up

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.910 
right-side up
maybe<00:04:25.520> upside<00:04:26.060> down

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
maybe upside down

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.350 
maybe upside down
what<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.040> heck<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:31.550> could<00:04:31.730> use<00:04:31.880> any<00:04:32.120> color

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
what the heck you could use any color

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.090 
what the heck you could use any color
doesn't<00:04:32.930> have<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.170> be<00:04:33.260> black<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:33.530> I've<00:04:33.920> got

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
doesn't have to be black you I've got

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.310 
doesn't have to be black you I've got
red<00:04:34.310> here<00:04:34.610> I've<00:04:34.790> got<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.000> brown<00:04:35.330> stays<00:04:35.810> on

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
red here I've got a brown stays on

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.830 
red here I've got a brown stays on
they<00:04:37.070> make<00:04:37.220> all<00:04:37.370> different<00:04:37.730> colors<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.270> feel

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
they make all different colors so feel

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.150 
they make all different colors so feel
free<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:39.140> use<00:04:39.350> whatever<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.770> want<00:04:39.920> but<00:04:40.100> the

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
free to use whatever you want but the

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.370 
free to use whatever you want but the
reason<00:04:40.460> we're<00:04:40.580> using<00:04:40.630> stays<00:04:41.630> on<00:04:41.870> is<00:04:42.110> because

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
reason we're using stays on is because

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.290 
reason we're using stays on is because
we're<00:04:42.560> going<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.740> be<00:04:42.920> adding<00:04:43.760> another<00:04:44.000> ink

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
we're going to be adding another ink

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.810 
we're going to be adding another ink
color<00:04:44.570> on<00:04:44.810> top<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:46.040> I<00:04:46.070> think<00:04:46.250> I'll<00:04:46.490> just<00:04:46.610> do

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
color on top so I think I'll just do

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.000 
color on top so I think I'll just do
these<00:04:46.970> two<00:04:47.240> but<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:47.540> can<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:48.170> know<00:04:48.230> you<00:04:48.320> I'm

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
these two but you can you know you I'm

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.070 
these two but you can you know you I'm
going<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.430> continue<00:04:49.850> with<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.120> other<00:04:50.150> the

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
going to continue with the other the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.170 
going to continue with the other the
other<00:04:51.200> two<00:04:51.440> eventually<00:04:51.740> so<00:04:52.700> I<00:04:52.730> would<00:04:53.060> just

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
other two eventually so I would just

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.060 
other two eventually so I would just
give<00:04:53.360> that<00:04:53.510> a<00:04:53.540> moment<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:54.020> dry<00:04:54.230> if<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:54.620> really

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
give that a moment to dry if you really

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
give that a moment to dry if you really
want<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.400> set<00:04:55.580> it<00:04:55.730> in

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.420 

you<00:04:58.600> know<00:04:58.720> run<00:04:58.960> your<00:04:59.110> heat<00:04:59.290> gun<00:04:59.320> over<00:04:59.830> it<00:04:59.919> just

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
you know run your heat gun over it just

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.189 
you know run your heat gun over it just
to<00:05:00.520> make<00:05:00.639> sure<00:05:00.699> the<00:05:00.940> color<00:05:01.150> set<00:05:01.510> but<00:05:01.750> stays<00:05:02.020> on

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
to make sure the color set but stays on

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.540 
to make sure the color set but stays on
ink<00:05:02.440> dries<00:05:02.680> really<00:05:03.070> really<00:05:03.310> fast<00:05:03.550> so<00:05:04.139> next<00:05:05.550> get

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
ink dries really really fast so next get

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.969 
ink dries really really fast so next get
some<00:05:06.880> of<00:05:07.360> your<00:05:07.930> colored<00:05:08.350> ink<00:05:08.530> pads<00:05:08.770> out

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
some of your colored ink pads out

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.510 
some of your colored ink pads out
whatever<00:05:09.729> colors<00:05:10.090> you<00:05:10.210> want<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:11.010> very<00:05:12.010> simply

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
either dab or rub and because we you

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.290 
either dab or rub and because we you
stays<00:05:20.110> on<00:05:20.320> it's<00:05:20.590> not<00:05:20.740> going<00:05:20.919> to<00:05:21.040> the<00:05:21.070> black<00:05:22.030> ink

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300

stays on it's not going to the black ink
is<00:05:22.449> not<00:05:22.630> going<00:05:22.780> to<00:05:22.840> come<00:05:23.020> off<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.530> think<00:05:23.800> I'll

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
is not going to come off I think I'll

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.560 
is not going to come off I think I'll
use<00:05:23.919> two<00:05:24.310> different<00:05:24.430> colors<00:05:24.669> here<00:05:25.270> and<00:05:25.419> maybe

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
use two different colors here and maybe

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:34.260 
use two different colors here and maybe
blend<00:05:26.560> some<00:05:26.830> green<00:05:27.100> and<00:05:27.340> blue<00:05:27.850> together<00:05:33.270> all
