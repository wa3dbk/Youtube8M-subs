00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
sure clients and you don't really have

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.039 
sure clients and you don't really have
to<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.520> guess<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.210> easiest<00:01:18.420> ways<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.630> upload

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
to I guess the easiest ways to upload

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.830 
to I guess the easiest ways to upload
them<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> YouTube<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:21.030> mean<00:01:21.540> if<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> have

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
them to YouTube but I mean if you have

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.789 
them to YouTube but I mean if you have
connections<00:01:22.229> that's<00:01:22.380> pretty<00:01:22.530> much<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> only

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
connections that's pretty much the only

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.770 
connections that's pretty much the only
other<00:01:23.070> way<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.909> upload<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.390> line<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
other way but if you upload your line to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.149 
other way but if you upload your line to
youtube<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.380> record<00:01:25.799> that's<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
youtube if you can record that's a

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.520 
youtube if you can record that's a
really<00:01:26.460> big<00:01:26.670> thing<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:28.229> you're<00:01:28.350> just

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
another way I can gear not guarantee but

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.200 
another way I can gear not guarantee but
