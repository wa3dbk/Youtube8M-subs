you<00:06:03.650> up<00:06:03.740> and<00:06:03.979> then<00:06:04.580> if<00:06:04.880> you<00:06:05.030> do<00:06:05.150> be<00:06:05.270> calling<00:06:05.570> our

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
previous tasting you had us you know

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:11.050 
previous tasting you had us you know
change<00:06:09.289> a<00:06:09.560> little<00:06:09.680> bit<00:06:09.830> the<00:06:10.130> blend<00:06:10.460> which<00:06:10.880> I

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
change a little bit the blend which I

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.850 
change a little bit the blend which I
think<00:06:11.330> you<00:06:11.720> really<00:06:11.990> helped<00:06:12.229> because<00:06:12.470> we

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
think you really helped because we

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.430 
think you really helped because we
really<00:06:13.100> soft<00:06:13.400> in<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:13.699> wine<00:06:13.880> and<00:06:14.240> still<00:06:14.900> kept<00:06:15.289> a

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
really soft in the wine and still kept a

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.330 
really soft in the wine and still kept a
lot<00:06:15.710> of<00:06:16.070> meat<00:06:16.789> and<00:06:17.180> bones<00:06:17.479> and<00:06:17.960> really<00:06:18.710> a<00:06:18.919> lot

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
lot of meat and bones and really a lot

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.040 
lot of meat and bones and really a lot
of<00:06:19.490> structure<00:06:19.940> to<00:06:20.090> it<00:06:20.240> now<00:06:20.479> so<00:06:20.750> that<00:06:20.870> was<00:06:21.020> a

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
of structure to it now so that was a

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.480 
of structure to it now so that was a
very<00:06:21.139> good<00:06:21.470> exercise<00:06:21.919> we've<00:06:22.130> done<00:06:22.280> it<00:06:22.400> a<00:06:22.430> few

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490
