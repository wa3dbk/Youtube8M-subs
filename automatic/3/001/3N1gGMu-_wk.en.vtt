the<00:00:07.259> last<00:00:07.350> couple<00:00:08.189> years<00:00:08.400> with<00:00:08.910> doTERRA<00:00:09.800> we

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
the last couple years with doTERRA we

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.970 
the last couple years with doTERRA we
started<00:00:11.250> out<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.670> position<00:00:12.000> where<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:13.139> were

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
started out in a position where we were

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.160 
started out in a position where we were
probably<00:00:14.250> at<00:00:14.519> about<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.940> hardest<00:00:15.269> point<00:00:15.570> that

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
probably at about the hardest point that

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.400 
probably at about the hardest point that
we<00:00:16.710> had<00:00:16.920> been<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.340> our<00:00:17.460> 11<00:00:18.119> years<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:18.960> were<00:00:19.170> just

we had been in our 11 years we were just
struggling<00:00:20.369> kind<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.090> trying<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.420> figure<00:00:21.750> out

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
struggling kind of trying to figure out

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.250 
struggling kind of trying to figure out
what<00:00:23.369> we<00:00:23.910> wanted<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.269> do<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.779> what<00:00:24.900> we<00:00:24.930> wanted

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
to create and weren't really getting to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.500 
to create and weren't really getting to
the<00:00:27.359> answers<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.519> what<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.730> would<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the answers of what that would be and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.229 
the answers of what that would be and
and<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.410> path<00:00:31.650> was<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.759> came<00:00:33.059> to

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
we started questioning the 925 work

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.390 
we started questioning the 925 work
layout<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:07.350> didn't<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.680> him<00:01:07.950> being<00:01:08.189> gone<00:01:08.340> so

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
layout we didn't like him being gone so

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.460 
layout we didn't like him being gone so
much<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.880> married<00:01:09.150> him<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.600> him<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.990> he

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
much I married him to be with him and he

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.899 
much I married him to be with him and he
was<00:01:10.619> gone<00:01:10.830> when<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.250> raising<00:01:11.460> these<00:01:11.640> five

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
was gone when I was raising these five

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.730 
was gone when I was raising these five
little<00:01:12.119> kids<00:01:12.360> by<00:01:12.600> myself<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.560> just

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
little kids by myself and we just

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.510 
little kids by myself and we just
weren't<00:01:13.950> being<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.700> family<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.680> I<00:01:16.680> missed<00:01:17.340> him

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
weren't being a family and I missed him

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.010 
weren't being a family and I missed him
and<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.000> started<00:01:18.060> questioning<00:01:18.600> how<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.960> we

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and so we started questioning how can we

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.330 
and so we started questioning how can we
find<00:01:19.200> something<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:19.920> create<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
find something that would create a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.429 
find something that would create a
different<00:01:20.610> reality<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.479> our<00:01:22.020> home<00:01:22.229> life

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
different reality in our home life

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.770 
different reality in our home life
ultimately<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:24.299> through<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
ultimately it was through that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.960 
ultimately it was through that
questioning<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.830> started<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.460> say<00:01:26.909> you

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
questioning that we started to say you

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
questioning that we started to say you
know<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> possible<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.619> what<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.189> we

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
know what is possible what what can we

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.300 
know what is possible what what can we
do<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:30.259> that<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> could<00:01:31.500> actually<00:01:31.650> work<00:01:32.040> from

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
do that that I could actually work from

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.640 
do that that I could actually work from
home<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.729> could<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.780> actually<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:34.290> something

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
home and could it actually be something

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.649 
home and could it actually be something
that<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.799> loved<00:01:35.159> doing<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.299> really

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
that I loved doing that I that I really

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.330 
that I loved doing that I that I really
enjoyed<00:01:37.049> doing<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.950> through<00:01:38.189> that

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
enjoyed doing it was through that

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.120 
enjoyed doing it was through that
questioning<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.150> ultimately<00:01:39.750> doTERRA<00:01:40.560> was

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
questioning that ultimately doTERRA was

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.719 
questioning that ultimately doTERRA was
introduced<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> us<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.409> we<00:01:43.409> were<00:01:43.710> blown<00:01:44.670> away
