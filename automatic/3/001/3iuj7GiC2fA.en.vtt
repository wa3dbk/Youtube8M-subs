functionality<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.440> want<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.650> show

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
functionality and I just want to show

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.610 
functionality and I just want to show
exactly<00:00:11.190> which<00:00:11.849> way<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.389> correct<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.080> do<00:00:13.440> not

first up a lot of people think that

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.670 
first up a lot of people think that

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
shooting the Ritz decoy well destroy and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.490 
shooting the Ritz decoy well destroy and
or<00:00:20.130> reduce<00:00:20.730> s<00:00:20.939> duration<00:00:21.570> I've<00:00:21.900> put<00:00:22.080> two<00:00:22.230> clubs

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
or reduce s duration I've put two clubs

or reduce s duration I've put two clubs
here<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> first<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:23.279> showing<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.699> normal

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
here the first one showing the normal

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.700 
here the first one showing the normal
duration<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> race<00:00:24.930> decoy<00:00:25.380> without

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710

shooting<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.189> run<00:00:26.609> about<00:00:26.849> eight<00:00:27.029> seconds

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
shooting it run about eight seconds

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.210 
shooting it run about eight seconds
maxed<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.439> second<00:00:28.830> showing<00:00:29.099> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
maxed out and the second showing that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.800 
maxed out and the second showing that
doing<00:00:29.460> massive<00:00:29.730> damage<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.510> decoy

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
doing massive damage to the decoy

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.990 
doing massive damage to the decoy
actually<00:00:31.349> has<00:00:31.500> no<00:00:31.710> effect<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.579> only<00:00:32.730> way

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
actually has no effect and the only way

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.389 
actually has no effect and the only way
the<00:00:33.360> decoy<00:00:33.780> well<00:00:34.110> disappear<00:00:34.620> as<00:00:34.800> after<00:00:35.100> its

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
the decoy well disappear as after its

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
the decoy well disappear as after its
duration<00:00:35.670> ends<00:00:36.180> or<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> monster<00:00:36.989> player

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
duration ends or if the monster player

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.860 
duration ends or if the monster player
cancels<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.800> himself<00:00:38.550> also<00:00:39.030> doing<00:00:39.660> damage

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
cancels that himself also doing damage

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.420 
cancels that himself also doing damage
to<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.170> real<00:00:40.320> monster<00:00:40.530> here<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.190> see<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
to the real monster here you can see the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.340 
to the real monster here you can see the
players<00:00:41.730> attacking<00:00:42.300> me<00:00:42.390> does<00:00:42.690> not<00:00:42.899> cancel<00:00:43.140> out

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
players attacking me does not cancel out

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.350 
players attacking me does not cancel out
the<00:00:43.469> decoy<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> decoy<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.460> still<00:00:44.730> there<00:00:44.910> going

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the decoy the decoy is still there going

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.850 
the decoy the decoy is still there going
crazy<00:00:45.629> doing<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> lot<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.289> damage<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.649> those

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
crazy doing a lot of damage to those

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.709 
crazy doing a lot of damage to those
players<00:00:47.190> don't<00:00:47.640> shoot<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.940> risk<00:00:48.239> decoyed

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
players don't shoot the risk decoyed

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.470 
players don't shoot the risk decoyed
just<00:00:49.050> try<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.469> get<00:00:49.680> away<00:00:49.829> from<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.250> instead

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
just try and get away from it instead

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.670 
just try and get away from it instead
another<00:00:51.480> method<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.230> lot<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> people

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
another method is that a lot of people

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.350 
another method is that a lot of people
have<00:00:53.070> been<00:00:53.100> seen<00:00:53.520> including<00:00:53.969> myself<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
have been seen including myself that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.209 
have been seen including myself that
hunters<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:55.079> different<00:00:55.620> movement<00:00:56.010> speeds

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
hunters have different movement speeds

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.220 
hunters have different movement speeds
to<00:00:56.550> me<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.820> looks<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> trapper<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
to me it looks as if the trapper was the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
to me it looks as if the trapper was the
fastest<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.800> salt<00:00:59.340> was<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> slowest<00:01:00.059> but

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
fastest and the salt was a slowest but

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.490 
fastest and the salt was a slowest but
I've<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.329> went<00:01:00.899> into<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> private<00:01:01.410> match

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
I've actually went into a private match

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.139 
I've actually went into a private match
you<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.980> test<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> movement<00:01:02.789> speeds<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
you to test out the movement speeds and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.149 
you to test out the movement speeds and
it<00:01:03.210> turns<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:04.140> players<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.890> all

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
it turns out that all players and all

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.280 
it turns out that all players and all
classes<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> game<00:01:06.090> actually<00:01:06.360> run<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
classes and the game actually run at the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.840 
classes and the game actually run at the
same<00:01:07.470> speed<00:01:07.920> obviously<00:01:08.250> when<00:01:08.729> you're

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
same speed obviously when you're

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.520 
same speed obviously when you're
shooting<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.390> gun<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:09.750> using<00:01:10.320> another

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
shooting your gun or using another

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.230 
shooting your gun or using another
ability<00:01:10.830> sort<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.400> thing<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.909> medics

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
ability sort of thing like the medics

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.330 
ability sort of thing like the medics
med<00:01:12.510> gun<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:12.960> move<00:01:13.229> slower<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.070> just

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
med gun you will move slower but just

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.130 
med gun you will move slower but just
default<00:01:14.790> running<00:01:15.119> speed<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> same<00:01:15.840> across

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
default running speed is the same across

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.960 
default running speed is the same across
all<00:01:16.470> classes<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.670> from<00:01:17.790> our

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
all classes as you can see from our

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.550 
all classes as you can see from our
little<00:01:18.240> racier<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.140> busted

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
little racier so that one is busted

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.070 
little racier so that one is busted
again<00:01:19.950> guys<00:01:20.340> another<00:01:21.150> method<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.570> regarding

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
again guys another method is regarding

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.899 
again guys another method is regarding
the<00:01:22.170> Krakens<00:01:22.590> ability<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.159> fly<00:01:23.430> or<00:01:23.460> hover

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the Krakens ability to fly or hover

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.850 
the Krakens ability to fly or hover
while<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.509> say<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> dome<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.229> outside<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
while and say the dome so outside of a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 
while and say the dome so outside of a
dome<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.369> Kraken<00:01:26.850> f<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> flies<00:01:27.479> will<00:01:27.780> slowly

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
dome the Kraken f it flies will slowly

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.499 
dome the Kraken f it flies will slowly
float<00:01:28.500> back<00:01:28.799> towards<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.490> ground<00:01:29.729> well<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
float back towards the ground well and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690 
float back towards the ground well and
say<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> dome<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.380> actually<00:01:31.920> happens<00:01:32.490> as

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
say the dome this actually happens as

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700 
say the dome this actually happens as
well<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.540> reason<00:01:33.689> people<00:01:33.960> think<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
well the reason people think that the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.080 
well the reason people think that the
Kraken<00:01:35.100> seems<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.640> some<00:01:35.850> sort<00:01:36.030> of

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
Kraken seems to have some sort of

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.420 
Kraken seems to have some sort of
magnetic<00:01:36.420> field<00:01:37.110> attracted<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> dorm<00:01:38.250> is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
magnetic field attracted to the dorm is

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
magnetic field attracted to the dorm is
keeping<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.850> afloat<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.329> actually<00:01:39.930> because

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
keeping it afloat is actually because

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.109 
keeping it afloat is actually because
when<00:01:40.710> players<00:01:41.070> are<00:01:41.280> shooting<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
when players are shooting at the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.850 
when players are shooting at the
cracking<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.840> cracking<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.439> stay<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
cracking the cracking can stay in the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.010 
cracking the cracking can stay in the
air<00:01:44.040> forever<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:44.970> long<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:45.689> actually

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
air forever as long as it's actually

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.289 
air forever as long as it's actually
being<00:01:46.229> shot<00:01:46.560> at<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.610> want<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> Kraken

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
being shot at so if you want the Kraken

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.420 
being shot at so if you want the Kraken
to<00:01:48.420> fall<00:01:48.630> back<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.049> ground<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.500> not<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.280> it

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
to fall back to ground or not have it

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.130 
to fall back to ground or not have it
constantly<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.119> flying<00:01:51.420> around<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> dorm<00:01:52.020> all

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
constantly be flying around the dorm all

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
constantly be flying around the dorm all
the<00:01:52.259> time<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:52.590> stop<00:01:52.799> shooting<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.399> course

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the time then stop shooting it of course

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.980 
the time then stop shooting it of course
that's<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> help<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.750> kill

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
that's not really going to help you kill

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.630 
that's not really going to help you kill
a<00:01:55.020> crack<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.740> instead<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.280> might<00:01:56.399> want<00:01:56.579> to

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
a crack and so instead you might want to

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.249 
a crack and so instead you might want to
use<00:01:56.700> some<00:01:56.880> harpoons<00:01:57.270> or<00:01:57.479> cranks<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.960> try<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
use some harpoons or cranks to try and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.109 
use some harpoons or cranks to try and
bring<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> back<00:01:58.560> down<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.130> air<00:01:59.280> another<00:01:59.909> method

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
bring it back down to air another method

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.819 
bring it back down to air another method
