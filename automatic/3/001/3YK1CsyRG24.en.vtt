will<00:00:17.970> tell<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.449> much<00:00:18.660> RAM<00:00:18.990> yet<00:00:19.590> that

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
will tell you how much RAM yet that

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.460 
will tell you how much RAM yet that
particular<00:00:20.640> application<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.330> using<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
particular application is using and it

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.170 
particular application is using and it

will give you the option to either kill

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.320 
will give you the option to either kill
the<00:00:24.359> app<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:24.750> cancel<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:26.760> open<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the app or cancel it so if we open up a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.759 
the app or cancel it so if we open up a
few<00:00:27.539> applications<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:28.289> we'll<00:00:28.470> start<00:00:28.590> with

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
few applications here we'll start with

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.640 
few applications here we'll start with
the<00:00:28.890> app<00:00:29.010> store<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.260> go<00:00:31.260> back<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the app store and go back to the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.530 
the app store and go back to the
springboard<00:00:32.070> open<00:00:32.399> up<00:00:32.489> iTunes<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:36.180> clock

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
springboard open up iTunes and the clock

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.310 
springboard open up iTunes and the clock
here<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.760> you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.910> see<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.450> red<00:00:39.780> bar<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
here so you can see this red bar in the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.229 
here so you can see this red bar in the
background<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.579> title<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
background of the title of the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.270 
background of the title of the
application<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.079> means<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
application that means that the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.889 
application that means that the
application<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:45.000> open<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.480> app<00:00:45.660> switcher

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
application is open in the app switcher

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
application is open in the app switcher
so<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.410> open<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> app<00:00:46.980> switcher<00:00:47.340> here

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
so if we open up the app switcher here

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.090 
so if we open up the app switcher here
you<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.420> clogged<00:00:48.780> iTunes<00:00:49.289> Appstore<00:00:49.530> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
you can see clogged iTunes Appstore and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.369 
you can see clogged iTunes Appstore and
if<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.090> swipe<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.840> these<00:00:52.050> particular

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
if you swipe up on these particular

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.840 
if you swipe up on these particular
applications<00:00:53.160> you're<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> get<00:00:53.820> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
applications you're going to get a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.880 
applications you're going to get a
pop-up<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.510> tells<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.899> how<00:00:55.110> much<00:00:55.320> megabytes

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
pop-up that tells you how much megabytes

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.310 
pop-up that tells you how much megabytes
of<00:00:56.039> RAM<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.699> actually<00:00:57.030> using<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:58.140> gives

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
of RAM it's actually using and it gives

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
of RAM it's actually using and it gives
you<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> option<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.100> kill<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.730> cancel<00:01:00.059> it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you the option to kill it or cancel it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
you the option to kill it or cancel it
so<00:01:00.449> we'll<00:01:00.629> kill<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.140> that's<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
so we'll kill it and that's going to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.600 
so we'll kill it and that's going to
free<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.600> 10.8<00:01:03.600> megabytes<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.409> your<00:01:05.010> RAM<00:01:05.280> so

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
free up 10.8 megabytes of your RAM so

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.800 
free up 10.8 megabytes of your RAM so
it's<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> make<00:01:06.060> your<00:01:06.180> phone<00:01:06.420> work<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
little bit smoother so we'll go ahead

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.250 
little bit smoother so we'll go ahead
and<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.299> these<00:01:09.450> two<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.869> well<00:01:10.049> this

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and do that for these two as well this

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.130 
and do that for these two as well this
one's<00:01:10.439> using<00:01:10.619> 26<00:01:11.310> megabytes<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.960> one

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
one's using 26 megabytes and this one

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.649 
one's using 26 megabytes and this one
usually<00:01:13.290> uses<00:01:13.830> around<00:01:13.920> yeah<00:01:14.430> 46<00:01:15.060> megabytes<00:01:15.540> of

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
usually uses around yeah 46 megabytes of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.170 
usually uses around yeah 46 megabytes of
RAM<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.740> let's<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.400> into<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.729> settings<00:01:18.060> of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
RAM so let's go into the settings of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.090 
RAM so let's go into the settings of
this<00:01:18.270> application<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> we'll<00:01:19.409> go<00:01:19.619> into<00:01:19.799> app

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
this application and we'll go into app

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.130 
this application and we'll go into app
Swiper<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> settings<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:22.110> you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140

turn on or off this is just the pop-up

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.039 
turn on or off this is just the pop-up
that's<00:01:26.520> telling<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.060> how<00:01:27.330> much<00:01:27.540> RAM<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
that's telling you how much RAM the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.260 
that's telling you how much RAM the
application<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.799> using<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.820> ability<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
application is using and the ability to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.780 
application is using and the ability to
just<00:01:30.570> kill<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> app<00:01:31.110> from<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.619> pop-up<00:01:31.890> now

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
just kill the app from that pop-up now

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.190 
just kill the app from that pop-up now
you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.090> choose<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> color<00:01:33.630> bar<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.990> saw

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you can choose the color bar you saw

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
you can choose the color bar you saw
that<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.530> color<00:01:34.770> bar<00:01:35.009> was<00:01:35.159> red<00:01:35.400> earlier<00:01:35.820> so

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that my color bar was red earlier so

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.020 
that my color bar was red earlier so
we'll<00:01:36.689> change<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:38.090> light<00:01:39.090> blue<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:41.030> you

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
we'll change it to a light blue and you

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
we'll change it to a light blue and you
can<00:01:42.180> change<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> opacity<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.439> color<00:01:43.710> bar

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
can change the opacity of the color bar

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.440 
can change the opacity of the color bar
as<00:01:44.009> well<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.670> wanted<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> change<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
as well so if we wanted to change that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.520 
blue it's kind of hard to see let's try
this<00:02:19.170> one<00:02:20.660> that's<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.810> little<00:02:21.960> easier<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.500> see

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
this one that's a little easier to see

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.290 
this one that's a little easier to see
we'll<00:02:22.830> try<00:02:23.010> we'll<00:02:23.370> try<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.580> video<00:02:23.940> since

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
we'll try we'll try the video since

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.940 
we'll try we'll try the video since
that's<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.660> white<00:02:24.990> portion<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.890> the

that's on a white portion of the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.950 
that's on a white portion of the
background<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.730> see<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.060> light<00:02:27.750> blue

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.480 
background so you can see the light blue
right<00:02:28.260> there<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.650> if<00:02:28.740> we<00:02:28.830> swipe<00:02:29.040> up<00:02:29.250> on<00:02:29.370> the

and clock close it app it close it so

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.800 
and clock close it app it close it so
you're<00:02:35.610> not<00:02:35.670> getting<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.030> pop-up<00:02:36.300> because<00:02:36.720> I

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
you're not getting that pop-up because I

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.890 
you're not getting that pop-up because I
turn<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.170> off<00:02:37.230> now<00:02:38.100> if<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:38.370> open<00:02:38.550> up<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.660> app

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
turn that off now if we open up the app

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.480 
turn that off now if we open up the app
switcher<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.770> we<00:02:40.830> want<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.130> close<00:02:41.280> an

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
switcher here and we want to close an

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.160 
switcher here and we want to close an
app<00:02:41.640> we'll<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.120> swipe<00:02:42.300> up<00:02:42.330> on<00:02:42.660> by<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.900> font

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
app we'll just swipe up on by the font

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.010 
app we'll just swipe up on by the font
and<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.350> closes<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.800> out<00:02:43.970> winterboard

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
and it closes it out winterboard

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.960 
and it closes it out winterboard
settings<00:02:46.020> Cydia<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.520> works<00:02:47.670> just<00:02:47.910> like

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
settings Cydia and it works just like

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.350 
settings Cydia and it works just like
that

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
that

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.750 
that
so<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.320> actually<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.650> pretty<00:02:49.950> cool<00:02:50.160> tweak<00:02:50.490> and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.090 
so it's actually a pretty cool tweak and
it<00:02:51.270> comes<00:02:51.480> recommended<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.320> always<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.070> to
