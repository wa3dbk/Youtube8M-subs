so<00:00:01.949> keeping<00:00:02.280> in<00:00:02.429> mind<00:00:02.610> how<00:00:02.790> much<00:00:03.149> salt<00:00:03.510> you

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
so keeping in mind how much salt you

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.240 
so keeping in mind how much salt you
should<00:00:04.110> be<00:00:04.230> taking<00:00:04.680> in<00:00:04.799> if<00:00:04.950> you're<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.220> a

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
should be taking in if you're on a

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.460 
should be taking in if you're on a
low-sodium<00:00:05.609> diet<00:00:06.150> now<00:00:06.660> I'm<00:00:06.930> just<00:00:07.170> gonna<00:00:07.259> write

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
low-sodium diet now I'm just gonna write

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.549 
low-sodium diet now I'm just gonna write
that<00:00:07.500> here<00:00:07.830> low-sodium<00:00:08.429> diet<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:09.210> was<00:00:10.110> thinking

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
that here low-sodium diet I was thinking

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.530 
that here low-sodium diet I was thinking
you<00:00:10.740> know<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:11.309> all<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.639> foods<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.420> I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
you know of all the foods that I

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.900 
you know of all the foods that I
typically<00:00:13.200> like<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.559> consume<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.670> where

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
typically like to consume and and where

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.849 
typically like to consume and and where
that<00:00:15.120> fits<00:00:15.330> into<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.020> amount<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.710> I'm

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
that fits into the amount that I'm

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.800 
that fits into the amount that I'm
allowed<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.820> given<00:00:18.119> day<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.270> if<00:00:18.539> I'm<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.779> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
allowed in a given day so if I'm on a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.859 
allowed in a given day so if I'm on a
low-sodium<00:00:19.020> diet<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:20.279> amount<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:21.270> said<00:00:21.600> was

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
low-sodium diet the amount we said was

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.980 
low-sodium diet the amount we said was
about<00:00:22.340> 1,500<00:00:23.539> milligrams<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:25.230> sodium<00:00:25.670> per<00:00:26.670> day

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
about 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.370 
about 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day
and<00:00:28.490> this<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.670> sodium<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:30.269> salt<00:00:30.750> remember<00:00:31.550> and

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
and this is sodium not salt remember and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.080 
and this is sodium not salt remember and
if<00:00:34.380> if<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.130> go<00:00:35.280> through<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> few<00:00:35.700> foods<00:00:35.910> out

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
if if I go through a few foods out

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.389 
if if I go through a few foods out
that'd<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.420> fun<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:37.110> kind<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.590> figure<00:00:38.040> out<00:00:38.070> how

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
that'd be fun to kind of figure out how

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
that'd be fun to kind of figure out how
much<00:00:38.610> sodium<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.360> these<00:00:39.690> foods<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.290> let's

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
much sodium is in these foods so let's

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.310 
much sodium is in these foods so let's
start<00:00:41.070> out<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.190> something<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.180> had<00:00:42.420> not<00:00:43.110> too

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.530 
another item I thought would be good to
look<00:01:48.090> at<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:50.340> next<00:01:50.880> item<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> last

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
look at and the next item of the last

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.929 
look at and the next item of the last
item<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.049> actually<00:01:52.560> similar<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> company

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
item is actually similar to the company

item is actually similar to the company
rolls<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.509> actually<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.990> cup<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.380> noodles

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
with packets of ketchup five packets is

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.830 
with packets of ketchup five packets is
about<00:02:45.450> 900<00:02:46.200> milligrams<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.830> sodium<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:48.420> cup

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
about 900 milligrams of sodium the cup

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.250 
about 900 milligrams of sodium the cup
of<00:02:49.020> noodles<00:02:49.350> is<00:02:49.590> about<00:02:50.360> 1200<00:02:51.360> milligrams<00:02:51.720> of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
of noodles is about 1200 milligrams of

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.770 
of noodles is about 1200 milligrams of
sodium<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.850> can<00:02:53.970> see<00:02:54.120> I'm<00:02:54.210> going<00:02:54.450> up<00:02:54.630> up

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
sodium and you can see I'm going up up

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.810 
sodium and you can see I'm going up up
up<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.410> my<00:02:55.560> block<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.280> noodles<00:02:56.640> is

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
up and so my block of noodles is

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.770 
up and so my block of noodles is
actually<00:02:57.500> 1600<00:02:58.500> milligrams<00:02:58.850> of<00:02:59.850> sodium<00:03:00.390> so

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
actually 1600 milligrams of sodium so

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.050 
actually 1600 milligrams of sodium so
actually<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.650> one<00:03:01.890> puts<00:03:02.190> me<00:03:02.370> over<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
actually this one puts me over the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.820 
actually this one puts me over the
amount<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.450> I'm<00:03:03.570> allowed<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:04.050> whole<00:03:04.380> day

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
amount that I'm allowed in a whole day

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.680 
amount that I'm allowed in a whole day
and<00:03:05.190> that's<00:03:05.250> actually<00:03:05.520> usually<00:03:05.760> what<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.510> would

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
and that's actually usually what I would

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.900 
and that's actually usually what I would
have<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:07.140> for<00:03:07.380> lunch<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.040> it's<00:03:08.760> an

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
have just for lunch and so it's an

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.420 
have just for lunch and so it's an
immense<00:03:09.390> amount<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:10.200> sodium<00:03:10.530> tons<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.190> sodium

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
immense amount of sodium tons of sodium

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.110 
immense amount of sodium tons of sodium
and<00:03:12.380> so<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.590> got<00:03:13.710> me<00:03:13.770> thinking<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.430> know<00:03:14.580> how

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
and so it got me thinking you know how

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.880 
and so it got me thinking you know how
in<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.450> world<00:03:15.480> I'm<00:03:16.140> not<00:03:16.200> actually<00:03:16.560> on<00:03:16.860> a

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
in the world I'm not actually on a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.960 
in the world I'm not actually on a
low-sodium<00:03:17.310> diet<00:03:18.530> but<00:03:19.530> if<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.800> was<00:03:20.040> how<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:20.850> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
low-sodium diet but if I was how in the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.240 
low-sodium diet but if I was how in the
world<00:03:21.000> would<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.420> be<00:03:21.660> able<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.990> do<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.220> I

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
world would I be able to do it and so I

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.100 
world would I be able to do it and so I
was<00:03:23.430> browsing<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.300> internet<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.990> came

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
was browsing the internet and I came

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.920 
was browsing the internet and I came
across<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:26.010> website<00:03:26.700> which<00:03:26.910> I'm<00:03:27.090> gonna<00:03:27.600> share

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
across a website which I'm gonna share

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.990 
across a website which I'm gonna share
with<00:03:28.080> you<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.280> basically<00:03:29.610> from<00:03:29.850> the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
with you and it's basically from the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.270 
with you and it's basically from the
Mayo<00:03:30.240> Clinic<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.290> actually<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.830> don't<00:03:31.950> want<00:03:32.190> to

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
Mayo Clinic and actually I don't want to

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.800 
Mayo Clinic and actually I don't want to
say<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.550> this<00:03:32.670> is<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.940> only<00:03:33.090> website<00:03:33.360> there

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
say that this is the only website there

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.410 
say that this is the only website there
tons<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:35.070> great<00:03:35.310> websites<00:03:35.790> out<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.210> but

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
tons of great websites out there but

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.240 
tons of great websites out there but
this<00:03:36.840> one<00:03:36.900> website<00:03:37.590> actually<00:03:37.770> got<00:03:38.100> me

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
this one website actually got me

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.670 
this one website actually got me
thinking<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.820> so<00:03:39.000> what<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:39.930> thought<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.380> why

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
thinking and so what I thought is why

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.290 
thinking and so what I thought is why
don't<00:03:40.740> I<00:03:40.920> figure<00:03:41.280> out<00:03:41.400> what<00:03:41.670> kind<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.000> food<00:03:42.060> I

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
don't I figure out what kind of food I

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.750 
don't I figure out what kind of food I
could<00:03:42.510> actually<00:03:42.690> get<00:03:43.110> if<00:03:43.740> I<00:03:43.980> was<00:03:44.190> on<00:03:44.700> a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
could actually get if I was on a

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.610 
could actually get if I was on a
low-sodium<00:03:45.180> diet<00:03:45.570> what<00:03:46.050> would<00:03:46.200> make<00:03:46.380> sense

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
low-sodium diet what would make sense

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.500 
low-sodium diet what would make sense
and<00:03:46.920> so<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.100> picked<00:03:47.460> out<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.700> few<00:03:48.030> things<00:03:48.300> from

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
and so I picked out a few things from

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.450 
and so I picked out a few things from
their<00:03:48.750> website<00:03:49.740> that<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:49.950> thought<00:03:50.220> would<00:03:50.340> be

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
their website that I thought would be

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.170 
their website that I thought would be
tasty<00:03:50.700> they<00:03:51.630> have<00:03:51.840> one<00:03:52.140> thing<00:03:52.380> that's<00:03:52.620> a

Salmons great but I like my vegetables
and<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:38.790> what<00:04:38.970> if<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.150> get<00:04:39.300> some<00:04:39.480> asparagus<00:04:40.350> in

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
and so what if I get some asparagus in

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.280 
and so what if I get some asparagus in
there<00:04:40.830> so<00:04:41.250> some<00:04:41.880> roasted<00:04:42.450> asparagus<00:04:42.540> and

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
there so some roasted asparagus and

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.830 
there so some roasted asparagus and
there's<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.160> recipe<00:04:44.580> for<00:04:44.820> some<00:04:44.970> mushrooms<00:04:45.540> with

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
there's a recipe for some mushrooms with

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.810 
there's a recipe for some mushrooms with
the<00:04:45.930> roasted<00:04:46.230> asparagus<00:04:46.350> this<00:04:47.280> meal<00:04:47.640> is

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
the roasted asparagus this meal is

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.420 
the roasted asparagus this meal is
looking<00:04:48.120> better<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.410> better<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:50.010> so<00:04:50.190> if<00:04:50.340> I

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
looking better and better and so if I

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
looking better and better and so if I
get<00:04:50.490> some<00:04:50.700> asparagus<00:04:52.700> with<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.940> mushrooms

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
get some asparagus with the mushrooms

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.120 
get some asparagus with the mushrooms
that's<00:04:55.410> an<00:04:55.710> additional<00:04:56.960> 11<00:04:57.960> milligrams<00:04:58.860> of

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
that's an additional 11 milligrams of

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.260 
that's an additional 11 milligrams of
sodium<00:04:59.340> so<00:04:59.550> it's<00:04:59.670> actually<00:04:59.820> pretty

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
sodium so it's actually pretty

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.510 
sodium so it's actually pretty
reasonable<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:01.140> in<00:05:01.290> fact<00:05:01.500> since<00:05:02.070> I'm<00:05:02.280> doing

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
reasonable and in fact since I'm doing

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.030 
reasonable and in fact since I'm doing
so<00:05:02.760> well<00:05:02.970> I<00:05:03.000> actually<00:05:03.270> was<00:05:03.740> tempted<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.770> go<00:05:04.980> to

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
so well I actually was tempted to go to

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.220 
so well I actually was tempted to go to
their<00:05:05.220> dessert<00:05:05.669> menu<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:07.080> actually

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
their dessert menu and I actually

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.909 
their dessert menu and I actually
grabbed<00:05:08.060> one<00:05:09.060> of<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.240> recipes<00:05:09.720> for<00:05:09.750> apple<00:05:10.710> pie

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
grabbed one of the recipes for apple pie

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.270 
grabbed one of the recipes for apple pie
and<00:05:11.190> apple<00:05:11.490> pie<00:05:12.169> is<00:05:13.169> an<00:05:13.320> American<00:05:13.800> favorite

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
and apple pie is an American favorite

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.830 
and apple pie is an American favorite
it's<00:05:14.400> certainly<00:05:14.700> one<00:05:14.850> of<00:05:14.880> my<00:05:15.090> favorites<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:15.750> I

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
it's certainly one of my favorites and I

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.470 
it's certainly one of my favorites and I
love<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.230> make<00:05:16.410> apple<00:05:16.650> pie<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:17.220> that<00:05:17.970> gets<00:05:18.270> me

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
love to make apple pie and that gets me

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.610 
love to make apple pie and that gets me
about<00:05:18.600> 16<00:05:19.410> milligrams<00:05:20.130> of<00:05:20.669> sodium<00:05:21.450> so<00:05:22.350> if<00:05:22.470> I'm

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
about 16 milligrams of sodium so if I'm

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.680 
about 16 milligrams of sodium so if I'm
totaling<00:05:23.190> all<00:05:23.340> of<00:05:23.460> this<00:05:23.550> up<00:05:23.760> I<00:05:23.910> have<00:05:23.940> I'll<00:05:24.450> do

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
totaling all of this up I have I'll do

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.930 
totaling all of this up I have I'll do
it<00:05:24.780> in<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:24.960> corner<00:05:25.320> here<00:05:25.500> I've<00:05:25.620> got<00:05:25.830> um<00:05:26.130> let's

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
it in the corner here I've got um let's

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:35.060 
it in the corner here I've got um let's
say<00:05:27.150> 60<00:05:28.310> plus<00:05:29.540> seven<00:05:30.540> plus<00:05:31.370> 11<00:05:32.370> plus<00:05:33.440> 16<00:05:34.440> and

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
say 60 plus seven plus 11 plus 16 and

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.300 
say 60 plus seven plus 11 plus 16 and
that<00:05:35.700> total<00:05:36.180> comes<00:05:36.510> to<00:05:36.630> be<00:05:37.320> 71<00:05:37.740> 78<00:05:38.430> 88

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
that total comes to be 71 78 88

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.570 
that total comes to be 71 78 88
94<00:05:41.840> milligrams<00:05:42.840> of<00:05:43.340> sodium

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
94 milligrams of sodium

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.860 
94 milligrams of sodium
and<00:05:44.790> so<00:05:45.479> 94<00:05:46.050> milligrams<00:05:46.470> of<00:05:46.620> sodium<00:05:46.830> is<00:05:47.870> well

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
and so 94 milligrams of sodium is well

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.469 
and so 94 milligrams of sodium is well
within<00:05:49.500> my<00:05:49.860> limit<00:05:50.190> of<00:05:50.250> 1500<00:05:50.880> milligrams<00:05:51.210> of

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
within my limit of 1500 milligrams of

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.719 
within my limit of 1500 milligrams of
sodium<00:05:51.810> per<00:05:52.020> day<00:05:52.380> so<00:05:52.440> this<00:05:52.710> is<00:05:52.770> one<00:05:53.220> place<00:05:53.520> you

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
sodium per day so this is one place you

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.490 
sodium per day so this is one place you
can<00:05:53.850> go<00:05:53.880> to<00:05:54.270> get<00:05:54.900> some<00:05:55.080> good<00:05:55.290> food

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
can go to get some good food

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.380 
can go to get some good food
recommendations<00:05:56.220> as<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:56.850> said<00:05:57.060> there<00:05:57.270> are<00:05:57.300> many
