a<00:00:00.210> hundred<00:00:00.810> years<00:00:00.960> ago<00:00:01.050> we<00:00:01.380> started<00:00:01.589> putting

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
a hundred years ago we started putting

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.860 
a hundred years ago we started putting
batteries<00:00:02.129> on<00:00:02.610> cars<00:00:02.909> but<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.540> basic

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
batteries on cars but the basic

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.019 
batteries on cars but the basic
structure<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.710> battery<00:00:05.040> hasn't<00:00:05.850> really

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
structure of the battery hasn't really

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.089 
structure of the battery hasn't really
changed<00:00:06.089> much<00:00:06.540> in<00:00:06.600> 30<00:00:07.020> years<00:00:07.230> we're<00:00:07.740> trying<00:00:07.980> to

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
changed much in 30 years we're trying to

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.060 
changed much in 30 years we're trying to
add<00:00:08.220> some<00:00:08.519> intelligence<00:00:08.849> through<00:00:09.769> control<00:00:10.769> of

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
add some intelligence through control of

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.459 
add some intelligence through control of
how<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.340> use<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:11.820> battery<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:13.139> try<00:00:13.320> and

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
how you use that battery you try and

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.829 
how you use that battery you try and
come<00:00:13.620> up<00:00:13.650> with<00:00:13.920> physics<00:00:14.849> based<00:00:15.000> models<00:00:15.509> so

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
come up with physics based models so

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.320 
come up with physics based models so
understanding<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.619> material<00:00:16.770> properties

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
understanding the material properties

understanding the material properties
where<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.510> heats<00:00:18.690> being<00:00:18.960> generated<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.890> then

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
where the heats being generated and then

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.740 
where the heats being generated and then
how<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.430> heat<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.939> being<00:00:21.060> taken<00:00:21.359> out<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
how that heat is being taken out of the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.380 
how that heat is being taken out of the
battery<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.859> ability<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.390> connect

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
sensors to put in these battery packs so

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.109 
sensors to put in these battery packs so
this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.470> three-year<00:01:05.070> project<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.970> develop

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
this is a three-year project to develop

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.359 
this is a three-year project to develop
very<00:01:06.720> thin<00:01:07.020> film<00:01:07.320> temperature<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.130> strain

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
very thin film temperature and strain

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.550 
very thin film temperature and strain
sensors<00:01:08.850> they<00:01:09.450> could<00:01:09.600> actually<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:10.049> put<00:01:10.350> into

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
sensors they could actually be put into

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.490 
sensors they could actually be put into
the<00:01:11.220> battery<00:01:11.490> pack<00:01:11.689> at<00:01:12.689> different<00:01:13.020> locations

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the battery pack at different locations

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.740 
the battery pack at different locations
to<00:01:13.710> monitor<00:01:14.159> at<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.880> raid<00:01:15.150> all<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> cells

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
to monitor at what raid all the cells

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.230 
to monitor at what raid all the cells
are<00:01:15.930> degrading<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.710> understand<00:01:17.189> actions<00:01:18.060> we

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
are degrading and understand actions we

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.880 
are degrading and understand actions we
can<00:01:18.270> take<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.750> prolong<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> life<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> pack

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
can take to prolong the life of the pack

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.760 
can take to prolong the life of the pack
so<00:01:20.400> we've<00:01:20.549> got<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> couple<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.299> these

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
so we've got a couple of these

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.749 
so we've got a couple of these
temperature<00:01:22.770> sensors<00:01:23.159> here<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.670> are

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
temperature sensors here that are

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:24.890 
temperature sensors here that are
actually<00:01:23.850> measuring<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.630> battery

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
actually measuring the battery

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.020 
actually measuring the battery
temperature<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> when<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> battery

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
temperature so in the when the battery

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.870 
temperature so in the when the battery
here<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.390> actually<00:01:27.570> placed<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.400> bus<00:01:29.610> bar

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
here is actually placed in this bus bar

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.760 
here is actually placed in this bus bar
so<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.869> see<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> battery

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
so you can see here the battery

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.230 
so you can see here the battery
temperature<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.460> actually<00:01:32.850> measured<00:01:33.210> just

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
temperature is actually measured just

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.240 
temperature is actually measured just
right<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> top<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
right here on the top this is the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.249 
right here on the top this is the
temperature<00:01:36.180> sensor<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.140> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
temperature sensor and it's just in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.310 
temperature sensor and it's just in
contact<00:01:38.240> with<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.420> point<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> top<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
contact with one point on the top of the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.249 
contact with one point on the top of the
battery<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.820> single<00:01:42.540> measurement

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
battery so this single measurement

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.260 
battery so this single measurement
location<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.490> only<00:01:44.579> give<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.119> much

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
location it can only give you so much

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.670 
location it can only give you so much
information<00:01:45.810> about<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.110> battery<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.470> in

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
information about the battery and in
