00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.600 
and just worryin to ourselves the tissue
that's<00:02:49.370> within<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.580> band<00:02:50.760> itself<00:02:51.210> is<00:02:51.600> the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
that's within the band itself is the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.790 
that's within the band itself is the
distal<00:02:53.610> esophagus<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.480> stomach<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:55.590> with

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
distal esophagus and the stomach so with

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.710 
distal esophagus and the stomach so with
the<00:02:55.950> scissors<00:02:56.400> now<00:02:56.430> we're<00:02:56.850> going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.240> cut<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
the scissors now we're going to cut the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.000 
the scissors now we're going to cut the
band<00:02:58.220> vocal<00:02:59.220> essentially<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.150> allow<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:01.680> be

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
band vocal essentially to allow it to be

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.190 
band vocal essentially to allow it to be
opened<00:03:02.400> up<00:03:04.970> with<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.120> connecting<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.930> being

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
opened up with the connecting to being

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.770 
opened up with the connecting to being
divided<00:03:08.960> we<00:03:09.960> pull<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.440> band<00:03:10.680> true<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.630> we're

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
divided we pull the band true and we're

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.660 
divided we pull the band true and we're
gonna<00:03:12.900> continue<00:03:13.170> taking<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.860> scar<00:03:14.250> tissue

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
gonna continue taking the scar tissue

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.060 
gonna continue taking the scar tissue
down<00:03:14.820> that<00:03:15.120> has<00:03:15.300> now<00:03:15.510> formed<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.320> top

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
down that has now formed on the top

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.780 
down that has now formed on the top
aspect<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.150> band<00:03:18.330> in<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.110> middle<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.820 
aspect of the band in the middle of the
image<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.180> see<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.630> heart<00:03:21.870> that's

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
image you can see the heart that's

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.810 
image you can see the heart that's
beating<00:03:23.690> on<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:26.040> other<00:03:26.220> side<00:03:26.550> of<00:03:26.700> the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
diaphragm this is all the scar tissue

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:49.600 
diaphragm this is all the scar tissue
that<00:03:32.670> has<00:03:32.850> formed<00:03:34.040> around<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.220> band<00:03:35.490> itself

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.210 

we<00:03:50.150> continue<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:50.960> take<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.350> scar<00:03:51.620> tissue<00:03:51.890> down

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
we continue to take the scar tissue down

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.520 
we continue to take the scar tissue down
there<00:03:52.610> should<00:03:52.820> be<00:03:52.940> minimal<00:03:53.390> bleeding<00:03:53.600> unless

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
there should be minimal bleeding unless

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.170 
there should be minimal bleeding unless
there's<00:03:54.800> some<00:03:55.040> small<00:03:55.340> vessels<00:03:55.820> that<00:03:56.000> we

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
there's some small vessels that we

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.600 
there's some small vessels that we
encounter<00:03:56.830> these<00:03:57.830> are<00:03:58.070> controlled<00:03:58.520> with

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
encounter these are controlled with

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.020 
encounter these are controlled with
cautery<00:03:59.710> other<00:04:00.710> than<00:04:01.010> that<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.460> rest<00:04:01.610> of<00:04:01.880> the

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
cautery other than that the rest of the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.350 
cautery other than that the rest of the
dissection<00:04:02.720> is<00:04:04.180> relatively<00:04:07.360> straightforward

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
dissection is relatively straightforward

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.230 
dissection is relatively straightforward
in<00:04:09.050> an<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.320> vascular<00:04:09.860> plane<00:04:10.490> that<00:04:10.880> means<00:04:11.090> that

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
in an a vascular plane that means that

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.900 
in an a vascular plane that means that
there<00:04:11.420> are<00:04:11.450> no<00:04:11.720> real<00:04:12.470> large<00:04:13.040> blood<00:04:13.430> vessels

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
there are no real large blood vessels

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.880 
there are no real large blood vessels
that<00:04:14.180> are<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.670> plane<00:04:17.030> of<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.890> dissection

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
that are in the plane of the dissection

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.699 
that are in the plane of the dissection
so<00:04:19.750> with<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.870> scissors<00:04:21.260> were<00:04:21.410> able<00:04:21.680> to

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
so with the scissors were able to

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.490 
so with the scissors were able to
continue<00:04:22.160> cut<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.700> scar<00:04:23.000> tissue<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.810> what

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
continue cut the scar tissue and what

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.320 
continue cut the scar tissue and what
we're<00:04:24.680> seeing<00:04:24.950> right<00:04:25.190> now<00:04:25.250> is<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:25.880> junction

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
we're seeing right now is the junction

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.100 
we're seeing right now is the junction
of<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.510> esophagus<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:29.240> fold<00:04:29.720> of<00:04:29.930> the

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
of the esophagus and the fold of the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.260 
of the esophagus and the fold of the
stomach<00:04:30.530> that<00:04:30.560> was<00:04:30.800> brought<00:04:31.370> up<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.790> sutured

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
stomach that was brought up and sutured

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.390 
stomach that was brought up and sutured
over<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.840> band<00:04:33.640> to<00:04:34.640> secure<00:04:34.910> it<00:04:35.210> in<00:04:35.330> place<00:04:36.400> some

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
over the band to secure it in place some

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.980 
over the band to secure it in place some
of<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.640> scar<00:04:37.940> tissue<00:04:38.150> is<00:04:38.330> actually<00:04:38.540> very

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
of the scar tissue is actually very

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.140 
of the scar tissue is actually very
thick<00:04:39.320> in<00:04:39.530> character<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:40.490> can<00:04:40.700> see<00:04:40.880> takes

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
thick in character and you can see takes

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.000 
thick in character and you can see takes
a<00:04:41.270> little<00:04:41.420> force<00:04:41.780> with<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.170> scissors<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.800> cut

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
a little force with the scissors to cut

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.050 
a little force with the scissors to cut
it

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.260 

a<00:04:48.120> few<00:04:48.930> more<00:04:49.169> bands<00:04:49.980> of<00:04:50.250> scar<00:04:50.610> tissue<00:04:50.639> that

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
a few more bands of scar tissue that

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.659 
a few more bands of scar tissue that
needs<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.690> be<00:04:51.810> taken<00:04:52.200> down<00:04:52.230> and<00:04:52.770> then<00:04:53.550> now

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
needs to be taken down and then now

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.030 
needs to be taken down and then now
we're<00:04:53.880> getting<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.900> junction<00:04:55.410> where<00:04:55.650> the

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
we're getting to the junction where the

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.490 
we're getting to the junction where the
esophagus<00:04:56.990> comes<00:04:57.990> down<00:04:58.230> through<00:04:58.410> the

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
esophagus comes down through the

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.260 
esophagus comes down through the
diaphragm

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.890 

once<00:05:04.840> all<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.199> these<00:05:05.380> bands<00:05:06.160> are<00:05:06.490> divided<00:05:07.270> we

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
once all of these bands are divided we

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.290 
once all of these bands are divided we
should<00:05:08.169> be<00:05:08.289> able<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.560> completely<00:05:09.130> unfold<00:05:09.789> the

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
should be able to completely unfold the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.320 
should be able to completely unfold the
stomach<00:05:10.840> down<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.770> its<00:05:12.090> anatomically<00:05:13.090> correct

stomach down to its anatomically correct
place<00:05:14.160> as<00:05:15.960> I<00:05:16.960> said<00:05:17.199> earlier<00:05:17.590> this<00:05:18.250> fold<00:05:18.550> of<00:05:18.729> the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
place as I said earlier this fold of the

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.210 
place as I said earlier this fold of the
stomach<00:05:19.270> is<00:05:19.479> brought<00:05:20.050> up<00:05:20.259> and<00:05:20.500> placed<00:05:20.800> on<00:05:21.009> top

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
stomach is brought up and placed on top

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.180 
stomach is brought up and placed on top
of<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.580> pan<00:05:21.819> and<00:05:22.229> secured<00:05:23.229> in<00:05:23.380> place<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.889> stay

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.670 
of the pan and secured in place to stay
there<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.699> the<00:05:25.569> theory<00:05:25.870> is<00:05:26.050> that<00:05:26.110> if<00:05:26.530> it

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
there and the theory is that if it

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.659 
there and the theory is that if it
stabilizes<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.610> band<00:05:27.819> to<00:05:28.030> prevent<00:05:28.449> any

stabilizes the band to prevent any
slippage<00:05:30.669> anguish<00:05:31.319> doesn't<00:05:32.319> work<00:05:32.410> all<00:05:32.620> the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
slippage anguish doesn't work all the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.920 
slippage anguish doesn't work all the
time<00:05:34.289> and<00:05:35.460> you<00:05:36.460> can<00:05:36.669> see<00:05:36.910> the<00:05:37.210> hue<00:05:37.509> of<00:05:37.690> that

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
time and you can see the hue of that

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
located right there that brain I was

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:51.300
