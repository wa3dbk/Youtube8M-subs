00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
thing you want to think about is does

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.100 
thing you want to think about is does
the<00:02:08.520> fat<00:02:08.759> you're<00:02:09.000> eating<00:02:09.360> taste<00:02:09.690> really<00:02:09.959> good

the fat you're eating taste really good

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.920 
the fat you're eating taste really good
and<00:02:10.640> this<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.819> where<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.720> think

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
and this is where I think you can think

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.490 
and this is where I think you can think
about

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
about

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.660 
about
corn<00:02:13.680> oil<00:02:13.860> canola<00:02:14.580> oil<00:02:14.970> soybean<00:02:15.480> oil<00:02:16.370> all<00:02:17.370> of

corn oil canola oil soybean oil all of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.440 
corn oil canola oil soybean oil all of
those<00:02:17.880> have<00:02:18.570> virtually<00:02:19.290> no<00:02:19.320> taste<00:02:19.800> at<00:02:20.010> all

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
those have virtually no taste at all

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.480 
those have virtually no taste at all
they<00:02:21.450> are<00:02:21.630> bleached<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.680> deodorized<00:02:22.800> in

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
they are bleached and deodorized in

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.040 
they are bleached and deodorized in
factories<00:02:24.030> heated<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.630> very<00:02:24.840> high

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
factories heated to very high

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.600 
factories heated to very high
temperatures<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.830> when<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:26.070> get<00:02:26.370> them

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
temperatures so that when we get them

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.080 
temperatures so that when we get them
they're<00:02:27.300> already<00:02:27.710> oxidized<00:02:28.710> so<00:02:29.370> they're

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
they're already oxidized so they're

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.900 
they're already oxidized so they're
already<00:02:30.450> going<00:02:31.080> bad<00:02:31.410> as<00:02:32.130> soon<00:02:32.370> as<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.550> open

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
already going bad as soon as you open

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.360 
already going bad as soon as you open
them<00:02:33.060> there<00:02:33.270> already<00:02:33.570> bad<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.500> they<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.190> to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
them there already bad so they have to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.460 
them there already bad so they have to
bleach<00:02:35.640> them<00:02:35.910> deodorize<00:02:36.660> them<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.110> make<00:02:37.260> them

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
bleach them deodorize them to make them

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.710 
bleach them deodorize them to make them
smell<00:02:37.860> good<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.550> they<00:02:38.730> put<00:02:38.970> colors<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.540> them

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
smell good and they put colors in them

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.380 
smell good and they put colors in them
to<00:02:39.930> make<00:02:39.959> them<00:02:40.290> look<00:02:40.320> good<00:02:40.640> otherwise<00:02:41.640> when<00:02:42.240> we

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
to make them look good otherwise when we

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.840 
to make them look good otherwise when we
open<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.990> would<00:02:43.110> stink<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.740> they<00:02:44.250> may<00:02:44.580> turn

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
open it it would stink and they may turn

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.170 
open it it would stink and they may turn
colors<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.430> that's<00:02:47.430> not<00:02:47.610> what<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.820> want<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.090> be

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
colors so that's not what I want to be

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.520 
colors so that's not what I want to be
eating<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.720> know<00:02:48.750> they<00:02:49.170> cause<00:02:49.410> skin<00:02:49.860> aging

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
eating you know they cause skin aging

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.830 
eating you know they cause skin aging
they<00:02:52.530> can<00:02:52.830> break<00:02:53.310> down<00:02:53.340> our<00:02:53.610> gut<00:02:54.060> lining<00:02:54.300> and

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
they can break down our gut lining and

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.900 
they can break down our gut lining and
increase<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.800> risk<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.100> autoimmune<00:02:56.580> disease

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
increase the risk of autoimmune disease

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.670 
increase the risk of autoimmune disease
so<00:02:58.070> they<00:02:59.360> disrupt<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.510> roid<00:03:00.750> function<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.560> it's

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
so they disrupt I roid function so it's

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.590 
so they disrupt I roid function so it's
really<00:03:01.860> important<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.430> get<00:03:02.640> away<00:03:02.790> from<00:03:02.970> the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
really important to get away from the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.300 
really important to get away from the
plastic<00:03:04.350> bottled<00:03:05.160> fats<00:03:05.750> like<00:03:06.980> canola<00:03:07.980> oil

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.830 
have a factory to make that may think
about<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.329> cottonseed<00:04:09.750> oil<00:04:10.079> or<00:04:10.440> canola<00:04:10.860> seed

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
about a cottonseed oil or canola seed

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.130 
about a cottonseed oil or canola seed
you<00:04:12.840> can't<00:04:13.170> make<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:15.269> in<00:04:15.690> your<00:04:16.019> own

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
you can't make a that in your own

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.569 
you can't make a that in your own
kitchen<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.709> mean<00:04:16.859> they<00:04:16.950> don't<00:04:17.130> even<00:04:17.220> have<00:04:17.459> any

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
kitchen I mean they don't even have any

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.150 
kitchen I mean they don't even have any
fat<00:04:17.850> in<00:04:18.060> them<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:18.510> they<00:04:18.959> have<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.200> use<00:04:19.320> extreme

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
fat in them so they have to use extreme

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.680 
fat in them so they have to use extreme
methods<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.910> even<00:04:21.120> get<00:04:21.380> fat<00:04:22.380> out<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:23.690> those

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
methods to even get fat out of those

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.379 
methods to even get fat out of those
those<00:04:25.260> types<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.680> seeds<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:26.190> lot<00:04:26.640> another<00:04:26.940> thing

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
those types of seeds a lot another thing

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.869 
those types of seeds a lot another thing
about<00:04:27.509> that<00:04:27.689> is<00:04:27.900> their<00:04:28.110> most<00:04:28.639> seeds<00:04:29.639> are

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
about that is their most seeds are

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:33.469 
about that is their most seeds are
genetically<00:04:30.240> modified<00:04:31.009> like<00:04:32.009> canola<00:04:32.479> corn

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
genetically modified like canola corn

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.779 
genetically modified like canola corn
oil<00:04:34.009> corn<00:04:35.009> seeds<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:36.409> soybean<00:04:37.409> oil<00:04:37.620> those<00:04:38.580> are

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
oil corn seeds and soybean oil those are

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.059 
oil corn seeds and soybean oil those are
all<00:04:38.999> genetically<00:04:39.479> modified<00:04:39.870> crops<00:04:40.139> so<00:04:40.800> we

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
all genetically modified crops so we

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.989 
all genetically modified crops so we
really<00:04:41.310> don't<00:04:41.460> know<00:04:41.639> what<00:04:41.969> those<00:04:43.400> seeds<00:04:44.400> do<00:04:44.789> to

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:44.999 
really don't know what those seeds do to

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:46.820 
really don't know what those seeds do to
us<00:04:45.150> what<00:04:45.419> those<00:04:45.719> crops<00:04:45.990> due<00:04:46.169> to<00:04:46.349> us<00:04:46.469> over<00:04:46.740> the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
us what those crops due to us over the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.619 
us what those crops due to us over the
long<00:04:46.979> term<00:04:47.009> because<00:04:47.580> they<00:04:47.729> were<00:04:47.789> just

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
long term because they were just

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.350 
long term because they were just
introduced<00:04:49.259> in<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.680> last<00:04:49.889> 15<00:04:50.370> or<00:04:50.400> 20<00:04:50.819> years<00:04:51.060> so

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
introduced in the last 15 or 20 years so

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.629 
introduced in the last 15 or 20 years so
we're<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.020> first<00:04:52.199> generation<00:04:52.379> to<00:04:53.159> really<00:04:53.430> see

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
we're the first generation to really see

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.279 
we're the first generation to really see
the<00:04:53.789> effects<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.330> genetically<00:04:54.900> modified

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
the effects of genetically modified

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.170 
the effects of genetically modified
foods<00:04:55.529> they've<00:04:55.770> never<00:04:55.949> been<00:04:56.069> tested<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:57.120> you

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
foods they've never been tested so you

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.969 
foods they've never been tested so you
really<00:04:57.659> want<00:04:57.840> to<00:04:57.900> avoid<00:04:57.990> genetically

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
really want to avoid genetically

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.700 
really want to avoid genetically
modified<00:04:59.370> foods<00:04:59.699> and<00:05:00.120> most<00:05:00.599> soybean<00:05:01.110> oil<00:05:01.349> corn

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
modified foods and most soybean oil corn

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.320 
modified foods and most soybean oil corn
oil<00:05:01.800> canola<00:05:02.159> oil<00:05:02.460> or<00:05:02.699> all<00:05:02.879> genetically

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
oil canola oil or all genetically

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.830 
oil canola oil or all genetically
modified<00:05:03.750> so<00:05:04.699> so<00:05:05.699> go<00:05:05.879> over<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.270> again<00:05:06.330> think

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
modified so so go over it again think

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.379 
modified so so go over it again think
about<00:05:06.930> did<00:05:07.650> my<00:05:07.740> grandmother<00:05:08.009> make<00:05:08.490> this<00:05:08.729> did

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
about did my grandmother make this did

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.070 
about did my grandmother make this did
she<00:05:09.569> eat<00:05:09.719> this<00:05:11.060> can<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.090> make<00:05:12.389> it<00:05:12.599> in<00:05:12.810> my<00:05:12.840> own

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
she eat this can I make it in my own

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.519 
she eat this can I make it in my own
kitchen<00:05:13.289> and<00:05:14.389> also<00:05:15.389> does<00:05:16.080> it<00:05:16.229> taste<00:05:16.409> really

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:16.529 
kitchen and also does it taste really

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.709 
kitchen and also does it taste really
good<00:05:16.740> and<00:05:17.099> those<00:05:17.610> three<00:05:18.000> things<00:05:18.270> you<00:05:18.479> can

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
good and those three things you can

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.309 
good and those three things you can
probably<00:05:18.960> use<00:05:19.199> to<00:05:20.159> figure<00:05:20.729> out<00:05:20.879> if<00:05:21.089> a<00:05:21.689> fat<00:05:21.960> is<00:05:22.259> a

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
probably use to figure out if a fat is a

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.540 
probably use to figure out if a fat is a
good<00:05:23.159> choice<00:05:23.430> um<00:05:24.589> so<00:05:25.589> thank<00:05:25.919> you<00:05:26.009> so<00:05:26.159> much<00:05:26.339> for

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
good choice um so thank you so much for

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.529 
good choice um so thank you so much for
watching<00:05:26.749> grass-fed<00:05:27.749> girl<00:05:28.139> calm
