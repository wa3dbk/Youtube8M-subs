you are going to leave this on for about
20<00:02:38.100> minutes<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.300> really<00:02:39.510> depends<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.080> what

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
20 minutes but it really depends on what

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.290 
20 minutes but it really depends on what
nail<00:02:40.440> polish<00:02:40.740> remover<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:41.160> have<00:02:41.400> um<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.030> have

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
nail polish remover you have um I have

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.330 
nail polish remover you have um I have
known<00:02:42.510> acetone<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.500> takes<00:02:43.650> me<00:02:43.860> about<00:02:43.980> 20

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
known acetone so it takes me about 20

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.730 
known acetone so it takes me about 20
minutes<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:45.270> if<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.510> have<00:02:45.720> regular<00:02:46.140> acetone

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
minutes but if you have regular acetone

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.510 
minutes but if you have regular acetone
um<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.580> think<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.480> would<00:02:48.570> take<00:02:48.750> about<00:02:48.900> maybe

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
um I think that would take about maybe

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.820 
um I think that would take about maybe
like<00:02:50.520> eight<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:51.150> ten<00:02:51.420> minutes<00:02:51.810> something<00:02:52.650> like

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
like eight to ten minutes something like

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.490 
like eight to ten minutes something like
that<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.459> don't<00:02:53.700> know<00:02:53.790> i<00:02:54.000> think<00:02:54.060> not<00:02:54.600> acetone<00:02:55.200> is

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
that I don't know i think not acetone is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.990 
that I don't know i think not acetone is
healthier<00:02:55.950> for<00:02:56.310> my<00:02:56.940> nails<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:58.430> that's<00:02:59.430> just

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
healthier for my nails and that's just

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.970 
healthier for my nails and that's just
what<00:03:00.780> i<00:03:00.990> think<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:01.830> i<00:03:02.070> will<00:03:02.459> come<00:03:02.940> back<00:03:03.180> one<00:03:03.750> day

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
what i think so i will come back one day

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.890 
what i think so i will come back one day
so<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.190> has<00:03:05.220> been<00:03:05.520> 20<00:03:05.970> minutes<00:03:06.120> later<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:06.720> now

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
so it has been 20 minutes later so now

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.060 
so it has been 20 minutes later so now
it's<00:03:07.080> time<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.650> take<00:03:08.100> off<00:03:08.310> heat<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.090> foil<00:03:09.360> so

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
it's time to take off heat in foil so

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.290 
it's time to take off heat in foil so
you<00:03:11.070> just<00:03:11.370> want<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.810> gently<00:03:13.430> take<00:03:14.430> off<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.970> tin
