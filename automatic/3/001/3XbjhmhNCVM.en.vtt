00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.340
 hello welcome to jauja mexican cuisine 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.799
 my name is janet today we are going to 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.020
 make a delicious fish to the 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.939
 veracruzana the fish that I am 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.220
 using is the red snapper that is the 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.589
 which is normally used in Veracruz but 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.259
 can also be substituted with sea â€‹â€‹bass 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.749
 with grouper with snapper which is a bump 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.390
 in something a little bigger or in some 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.609
 here in the us can you 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.100
 get a fish called boxes 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.649
 and it comes out a little cheaper than the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.560
 renaper that is the red snapper now 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.970
 let's move on to salt the 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.330
 I will do fish fillets in 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:48.740
 steaks because the salt is going to give 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.930
 firmness to fish meat right now 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.630
 I have nothing here but two steaks 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.240
 they are already in the refrigerator we are going to 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.050
 put so much salt 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.590
 we're going to put the refrigerator 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.729
 at least not be a half hour in what 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.180
 that we are also doing part of the 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.180
 recipe 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.090
 I just listed the ingredients 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.890
 Now what I want to explain to you is that 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.289
 the sauce that I make I make it with 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.560
 raw tomato and with cooked tomato 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.500
 this gives much more texture to the sauce 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.189
 let's start with the raw tomato what 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.899
 peel and cut it into squares right now 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.270
 let's move on to the stove and let's 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.119
 start frying what I have olive oil 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.590
 hot and I put my first the garlic 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:02.829
 to season with this garlic to impregnate 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.319
 rather with the taste of garlic to the oil 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:08.110
 of olive as soon as they are golden brown 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.810
 let's throw and we'll start with 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.750
 onions in the garlic are ready and the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.269
 I'm going to take out the house smells delicious garlic 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.950
 the oil is already impregnated with the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.130
 flavor of garlic let's start with the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.700
 Onion the onion has already changed color 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.360
 so now let's put the two 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.850
 minced acts 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.430
 and we're not going to let them get brown 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.710
 because if they make us bitter as soon as they start 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.460
 to change also color we are going to put 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.460
 tomato 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.900
 very good that smells 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.530
 let's add the capers the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.530
 olives 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.910
 and the bay leaves the thyme and the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.750
 marjoram 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.240
 and we're going to let it be seasoned 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.300
 a long time this is the part of the 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.330
 sauce with the tomatoes cooked with their 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.970
 onion and with their garlic we are going to grind what 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.250
 let's strain it and we'll add it to 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.810
 what we have on the stove 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.230
 this is the sauce we have left to 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.780
 boil for a while let's put the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.220
 that we liquefy and colamos 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.220
 with garlic and onion 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.519
 and we 're going to let it boil all together 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.079
 we will leave that season and then 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.120
 let's put a little broth 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.629
 fish so he starts taking that 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.490
 delicious flavor while cooking this 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.640
 fish soup 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.580
 let's strain it directly on the 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.970
 sauce 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.640
 and this is going to give you another little bit more 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.540
 flavor let's start like this let's see 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.210
 how much we will also need 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.610
 put jalapeÃ±o peppers and chilies 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.620
 eggs I always put them whole but 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.370
 I make an incision, I give birth as 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.590
 half to release their flavor and let's 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.750
 to also take a little bit of juice 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.630
 Pickled from the juices of chilli 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.000
 jalapeÃ±os 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.950
 and let's let these discomforts 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.470
 let's go try salt remember 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.690
 that capers and olives all 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.980
 It has a lot of salt, we do not want it to be 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.430
 our guise comes out in this capital and 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.580
 boiled and gives it to you we have to fry it 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.780
 and then we're going to put them with the 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.120
 caldillo 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.730
 the sauce was already cooking by 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.730
 little bit more than an hour ago I started 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.650
 put the first of my steaks and I'm going 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:51.030
 to dip well well in the sauce 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.860
 and we 're going to leave it for 5 to 7 minutes 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.050
 remember to buy thick steaks 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.509
 what the fishmonger does them chubby 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.690
 so they do not get ruined in so much 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:04.479
 the sauce and it's going to cook as if 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.120
 was supporting we are going to put the 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.280
 second 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.940
 and then we're going to take them out and we're going to 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.930
 put the rest 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:18.390
