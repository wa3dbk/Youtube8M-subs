know how you well well you can see in
this<00:02:04.590> particular<00:02:04.740> video<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.399> as<00:02:05.490> far<00:02:05.610> as

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
this particular video but as far as

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.520 
this particular video but as far as

squashes certain things the pixels don't
look<00:02:07.879> quite<00:02:08.879> as<00:02:09.119> good<00:02:09.239> as<00:02:09.390> they<00:02:09.509> could<00:02:09.649> it's

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
look quite as good as they could it's

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.600 
look quite as good as they could it's
not<00:02:10.770> something<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.190> would<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.550> want

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
not something that I would really want

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.270 
not something that I would really want
to<00:02:11.879> do<00:02:12.420> all<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
to do all the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.490 
to do all the
for<00:02:13.700> regular<00:02:14.180> use<00:02:14.209> on<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> computer<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.410> the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
for regular use on a computer but the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.110 
for regular use on a computer but the
advantage<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.040> sort<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.550> get<00:02:16.700> extra

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
advantage is you sort of get extra

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.580 
advantage is you sort of get extra

heard of this chromeless design meaning

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.509 
heard of this chromeless design meaning
basically<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:50.080> buttons<00:02:51.280> disappear<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:52.400> have

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
basically the buttons disappear you have

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.470 
basically the buttons disappear you have
a<00:02:52.610> couple<00:02:52.820> of<00:02:52.880> buttons<00:02:53.030> down<00:02:53.209> here<00:02:53.269> at<00:02:53.450> the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
a couple of buttons down here at the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.370 
a couple of buttons down here at the
bottom<00:02:53.540> but<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:53.959> don't<00:02:54.080> have<00:02:54.200> all<00:02:54.290> the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
bottom but you don't have all the

bottom but you don't have all the
toolbars<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:54.980> everything<00:02:55.310> else<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:55.550> you

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
toolbars and everything else that you

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.180 
toolbars and everything else that you
normally<00:02:56.420> get<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.019> even<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.830> buttons<00:02:58.069> at<00:02:58.160> the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
normally get and even the buttons at the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.770 
normally get and even the buttons at the
bottom<00:02:58.519> disappear<00:02:59.060> when<00:02:59.300> you're<00:02:59.420> not<00:02:59.510> using

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
bottom disappear when you're not using

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.800 
bottom disappear when you're not using
them<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.650> in<00:03:01.370> some<00:03:01.610> ways<00:03:01.640> this<00:03:02.000> actually<00:03:02.390> it

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
them so in some ways this actually it

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.680 
them so in some ways this actually it
seems<00:03:03.019> like<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> shame<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.680> isn't

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
seems like a shame that this isn't

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.780 
seems like a shame that this isn't

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
with 1024 x 600 pixel displays because

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.160 
with 1024 x 600 pixel displays because
in<00:03:10.940> some<00:03:11.120> ways<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.390> really<00:03:11.569> works<00:03:11.720> better<00:03:12.080> on

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
in some ways it really works better on

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.720 
in some ways it really works better on
low<00:03:12.500> resolution<00:03:12.980> screens<00:03:13.280> because<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.580> don't

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
low resolution screens because you don't

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.150 
low resolution screens because you don't
have<00:03:13.819> all<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.030> extra<00:03:14.540> stuff<00:03:15.040> eating<00:03:16.040> up

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
have all that extra stuff eating up

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.590 
have all that extra stuff eating up

this<00:03:45.189> this<00:03:45.489> device<00:03:45.790> doesn't<00:03:46.000> have<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.209> very

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
this this device doesn't have a very

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.759 
this this device doesn't have a very
fast<00:03:46.659> processor<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.349> it<00:03:47.409> doesn't<00:03:47.620> have<00:03:47.709> a

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
fast processor and it doesn't have a

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.369

very<00:03:48.299> fast<00:03:49.299> internet<00:03:49.720> connection<00:03:50.110> right<00:03:50.200> now

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
very fast internet connection right now

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.780 
very fast internet connection right now
actually<00:03:51.069> have<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.430> high-speed<00:03:51.760> internet

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
actually have a high-speed internet

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.309 
actually have a high-speed internet
connection<00:03:52.120> at<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.540> house<00:03:52.750> but<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.140> think

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
connection at the house but I think

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.160 
connection at the house but I think
there's<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.530> couple<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:53.980> issues<00:03:54.189> with<00:03:54.430> the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
there's a couple of issues with the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.899 
there's a couple of issues with the
support<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.349> wireless<00:03:56.709> hardware<00:03:57.040> in<00:03:57.189> here<00:03:57.370> so

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
support the wireless hardware in here so

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.140
