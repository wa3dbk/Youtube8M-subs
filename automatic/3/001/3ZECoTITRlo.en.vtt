00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
at the time I had always known that I

at around five years of work experience

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.790 
at around five years of work experience
I<00:00:59.850> decided<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:00.480> Now<00:01:00.690> or<00:01:00.719> Never<00:01:00.929> so<00:01:01.769> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
I decided that it was Now or Never so I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500 
I decided that it was Now or Never so I
decided<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.460> start<00:01:02.609> looking<00:01:02.760> around<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.239> wanted

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
decided to start looking around I wanted

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.050 
decided to start looking around I wanted
to<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.780> an<00:01:04.170> Operations<00:01:04.710> heavy<00:01:05.070> program<00:01:05.730> but

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
to do an Operations heavy program but

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.120 
to do an Operations heavy program but
still<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.390> some<00:01:06.510> exposure<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.800> business

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
still get some exposure to to business

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.270 
still get some exposure to to business
acumen<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.940> financial<00:01:09.420> strategy<00:01:10.200> type<00:01:11.100> work

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
acumen and financial strategy type work

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.040 
acumen and financial strategy type work
because<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.550> was<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.820> weak<00:01:11.970> there<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.690> I

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
because I was very weak there so I

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.270 
because I was very weak there so I
started<00:01:13.350> looking<00:01:13.410> around<00:01:13.620> I<00:01:13.770> looked<00:01:13.800> at<00:01:14.040> MIT

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
started looking around I looked at MIT

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830 
started looking around I looked at MIT
Sloan<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:14.940> I<00:01:15.030> knew<00:01:15.150> am<00:01:15.300> I<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.660> a<00:01:15.690> very

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
Sloan because I knew am I to is a very

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.230 
Sloan because I knew am I to is a very
quantitative<00:01:16.230> program<00:01:16.800> and<00:01:17.160> Sloan<00:01:17.760> I<00:01:18.030> thought

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
quantitative program and Sloan I thought

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.720 
quantitative program and Sloan I thought
would<00:01:18.390> give<00:01:18.570> me<00:01:18.720> exactly<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> toolkit<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.610> I

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
would give me exactly the toolkit that I

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.340 
would give me exactly the toolkit that I
would<00:01:20.880> want<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.900> was<00:01:22.020> researching

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
would want when I was researching

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.340 
would want when I was researching
operations<00:01:23.220> at<00:01:23.340> MIT<00:01:23.610> i<00:01:24.060> came<00:01:24.690> across<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.080> lgo

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
operations at MIT i came across the lgo

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.150 
operations at MIT i came across the lgo
program<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:26.010> one<00:01:26.820> spin<00:01:27.240> around<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
program and one spin around the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.080 
program and one spin around the
literature<00:01:29.160> surrounding<00:01:29.730> what<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.910> program

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
literature surrounding what the program

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.820 
literature surrounding what the program
brings<00:01:30.480> to<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> table<00:01:30.870> and<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> things<00:01:31.740> that

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
brings to the table and the things that

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.590 
brings to the table and the things that
it<00:01:31.980> can<00:01:32.010> teach<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.370> about<00:01:32.850> operations<00:01:33.450> and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
it can teach you about operations and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.420 
it can teach you about operations and
management<00:01:33.660> together<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.440> was<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.160> hooked

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
management together I was I was hooked

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.670 
management together I was I was hooked
so<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> applied<00:01:36.510> immediately<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.290> haven't

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
internship at Nike I think they've been

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.970 
internship at Nike I think they've been
really<00:02:58.390> surprised<00:02:58.720> at<00:02:59.019> how<00:02:59.170> sort<00:02:59.739> of<00:02:59.799> out<00:02:59.950> of

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
really surprised at how sort of out of

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.280 
really surprised at how sort of out of
the<00:03:00.099> box<00:03:00.310> you're<00:03:00.880> ready<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.900> get<00:03:02.049> started

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the box you're ready to to get started

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.620 
the box you're ready to to get started
and<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.709> really<00:03:02.920> understand<00:03:03.540> some<00:03:04.540> more

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
and to really understand some more

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.199 
and to really understand some more
elegant<00:03:04.989> aspects<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.590> their<00:03:05.680> supply<00:03:05.950> chain<00:03:06.209> so

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
elegant aspects of their supply chain so

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.270 
elegant aspects of their supply chain so
I've<00:03:07.540> never<00:03:07.660> been<00:03:07.810> able<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.140> use<00:03:08.739> those<00:03:08.980> tools

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
I've never been able to use those tools

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.339 
I've never been able to use those tools
so<00:03:09.849> explicitly<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.870> that's<00:03:11.019> been<00:03:11.170> really

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
so explicitly in that that's been really

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.680 
so explicitly in that that's been really
helpful<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.769> think<00:03:11.970> another<00:03:12.970> element<00:03:13.510> of

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
helpful and I think another element of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.110 
helpful and I think another element of
that<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.680> lgo<00:03:14.980> brings<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.670> table<00:03:15.790> that's

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
that that lgo brings to the table that's

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.360 
that that lgo brings to the table that's
different<00:03:16.840> than<00:03:16.989> other<00:03:17.110> places<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.890> the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
different than other places is that the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.530 
different than other places is that the
exposure<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.970> faculty<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.480> the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
exposure to the faculty and the

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.060 
exposure to the faculty and the
connection<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.140> faculty<00:03:20.320> throughout<00:03:20.859> the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
connection to the faculty throughout the

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.430 
connection to the faculty throughout the
internship<00:03:21.790> process<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:22.570> really<00:03:22.989> special

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
internship process is really special

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.460 
internship process is really special
because<00:03:24.060> reality<00:03:25.060> does<00:03:25.510> not<00:03:25.660> unfold

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
because reality does not unfold

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.229 
because reality does not unfold
necessarily<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.340> way<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:27.760> does<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:27.970> a

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
necessarily the way it does in a

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.490 
necessarily the way it does in a
logistic<00:03:29.170> systems<00:03:29.319> problem<00:03:29.950> set<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.480> the

logistic systems problem set and the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.720 
logistic systems problem set and the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
application of the tools can sometimes

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.270 
application of the tools can sometimes
not<00:03:33.880> be<00:03:34.000> explicitly<00:03:34.510> obvious<00:03:35.019> so<00:03:35.650> being<00:03:36.130> able

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
not be explicitly obvious so being able

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.920 
not be explicitly obvious so being able
to<00:03:36.519> just<00:03:36.549> pick<00:03:36.850> up<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.000> phone<00:03:37.120> or<00:03:37.299> draft<00:03:37.810> an

to just pick up the phone or draft an

to just pick up the phone or draft an

I'd<00:03:43.420> like<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.630> talk<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.810> little<00:03:43.959> bit<00:03:44.170> about<00:03:44.440> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
I'd like to talk a little bit about the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.220 
I'd like to talk a little bit about the
leadership<00:03:45.700> connection<00:03:45.880> I<00:03:46.180> think<00:03:46.359> lgo<00:03:46.720> really

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
leadership connection I think lgo really

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.140 
leadership connection I think lgo really
has<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.440> commitment<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.190> L<00:03:48.310> portion<00:03:49.060> of

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
has a commitment to the L portion of

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.610 
has a commitment to the L portion of
leaders<00:03:49.359> for<00:03:49.540> global<00:03:49.810> operations<00:03:50.290> because

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
leaders for global operations because

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.080 
leaders for global operations because
some<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.400> tools<00:03:51.609> that<00:03:51.790> we've<00:03:51.970> learned

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
some of the tools that we've learned

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.400 
some of the tools that we've learned
around<00:03:52.420> leadership<00:03:52.600> I<00:03:52.930> think<00:03:52.959> really<00:03:53.230> help

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
around leadership I think really help

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.440 
around leadership I think really help
