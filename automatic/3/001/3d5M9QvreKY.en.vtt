World<00:02:36.900> Cup<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.140> end<00:02:37.320> because<00:02:37.650> she<00:02:37.800> destroys

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
World Cup to end because she destroys

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.040 
World Cup to end because she destroys
the<00:02:38.430> world<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.090> if<00:02:39.150> we<00:02:39.270> can<00:02:39.390> kill<00:02:39.630> her<00:02:39.780> we

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
the world and so if we can kill her we

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.990 
the world and so if we can kill her we
can<00:02:40.170> prevent<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.460> inertia<00:02:41.760> like

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
can prevent that and the inertia like

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.250 
can prevent that and the inertia like
about<00:02:42.210> half<00:02:42.420> be<00:02:42.600> another<00:02:42.810> way<00:02:42.930> around<00:02:42.990> this

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
about half be another way around this

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.200 
about half be another way around this
thing<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.530> was<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.860> nope<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.760> that's<00:02:44.940> why<00:02:45.030> we

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
thing I was like nope and that's why we

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.600 
thing I was like nope and that's why we
can't<00:02:45.450> work<00:02:45.630> together<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.320> then<00:02:47.010> Hotaru<00:02:47.400> just

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
can't work together and then Hotaru just

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.770 
can't work together and then Hotaru just
teleports<00:02:48.240> away<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.710> lost<00:02:49.890> your<00:02:50.010> chance

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780
