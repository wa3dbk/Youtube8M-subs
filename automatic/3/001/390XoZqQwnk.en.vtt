actual workout no the most difficult

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.570 
actual workout no the most difficult
thing<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> never<00:00:37.830> know<00:00:38.010> what<00:00:38.550> people

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
thing is just to never know what people

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.479 
thing is just to never know what people
are<00:00:38.940> thinking<00:00:38.970> but<00:00:39.510> uh<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:40.410> know<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.949> busy

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.460 
are thinking but uh you know in busy
being<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> draft<00:00:42.269> is<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.629> far<00:00:42.900> away<00:00:43.019> or<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
being that the draft is so far away or a

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.990 
being that the draft is so far away or a
few<00:00:43.860> weeks<00:00:43.980> away<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.699> don't<00:00:44.850> know

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
few weeks away you just don't know

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.910 
few weeks away you just don't know
what's<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.390> happen<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.320> that's<00:00:46.830> just

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
what's going to happen so that's just

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.259 
what's going to happen so that's just
the<00:00:47.100> thing<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.670> never<00:00:47.790> know<00:00:48.030> what's

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
the thing you just never know what's

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:49.700 
the thing you just never know what's
going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.479> happen<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.960> that's<00:00:49.140> that's

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
going to happen and that's that's

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.350 
going to happen and that's that's
probably<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.370> most<00:00:50.580> difficult<00:00:50.820> thing<00:00:51.150> to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
probably the most difficult thing to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.590
