 and two status lights then we have 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.809
 below the output tray 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.580
 with a pier of trazodone paper underneath 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.129
 not fail as those on the verge of 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.720
 A closet or desk stands like we do this 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.500
 We open it here 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.000
 scan surface and then have it below 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.309
 we here the paper 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.040
 walk and the cartridges are on the right 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.750
 hidden under this little plastic 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.610
 thingy and there is also the little finger on it 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.920
 of course all the top of the printer 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.620
 we have the input tray here 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.480
 this valve goes up and then 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.890
 that you will find these behind and like that 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.030
 for this pirin 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.650
 on the back of the printer 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.690
 even sit-ups here 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.110
 and here on the right is the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.110
 USB port 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.410
 installation is very easy via the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.110
 supplied software and I now have it 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.400
 also connected via the Wi-Fi network 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.409
 anyone who is now on the network can 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.659
 also use this printer 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.920
 great advantage of this printer and unique 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.600
 in this price range 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.520
 is the fact that those four cartridges 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.050
 so she doesn't throw away any int and 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.570
 it also saves a lot in the end 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.310
 in the usage costs as you see it 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.260
 it is also very compact and therefore fits 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.580
 actually on everyone's bio 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.320
 like i said i got him on it 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.700
 WiFi network connected so I can here 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.560
 wirelessly from my laptop 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.979
 I have the quick start here 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.140
 guide 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.940
 of the printer and I want that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.000

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.840
 and then we see here the result of the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.970
 printed click side out 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.610
 first page I would like to go in 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.220
 Scanning do not just copy case 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.590
 to that end, I put it here on the scan 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.260
 surface 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.390
 valve shut and then I can here on it 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.930
 Panel I can choose between black or white 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.850
 colour 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:48.530
 in this case want to give 'black and white copy 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:50.840
 so i press this button and then have it 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.800

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.090

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.280

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.350
 XP-205 and I would also like very 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.820

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.770
 come true

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.740
 the xp-205 unfortunately does not have one 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.740
 lcd display 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.470

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.570
