has two souls and there's two guys so

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.649 
has two souls and there's two guys so
we're<00:01:10.740> gonna<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.369> famous<00:01:11.880> technique<00:01:12.330> here

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
we're gonna do a famous technique here

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.320 
we're gonna do a famous technique here
where<00:01:13.320> he<00:01:13.860> runs<00:01:14.100> from<00:01:14.310> them<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.970> kind<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
where he runs from them and I kind of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.929 
where he runs from them and I kind of
run<00:01:15.509> distraction<00:01:16.140> okay<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.070> one<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
run distraction okay so one of the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.730 
run distraction okay so one of the
problems<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> meal<00:01:19.560> can

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
problems with this is that a meal can

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.380 
problems with this is that a meal can
run<00:01:19.920> full<00:01:20.159> speed<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:20.880> everyone<00:01:21.210> else

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
run full speed just like everyone else

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
run full speed just like everyone else
and<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:22.320> basically<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.860> run<00:01:23.070> away<00:01:23.189> at<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and just basically we run away at the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.060 
and just basically we run away at the
entire<00:01:23.939> time<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.540> can't<00:01:24.810> catch<00:01:25.020> him<00:01:25.290> as

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
entire time and you can't catch him as

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.590 
entire time and you can't catch him as
long<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.340> he's<00:01:26.430> platforming<00:01:27.000> properly<00:01:27.450> you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
long as he's platforming properly you

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.359 
long as he's platforming properly you
cannot<00:01:27.900> catch<00:01:28.140> him<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.829> were<00:01:29.220> thinking

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
cannot catch him so we were thinking

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.280 
cannot catch him so we were thinking
about<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.450> maybe<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.869> should<00:01:31.049> slow

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
about you know maybe we should slow

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
about you know maybe we should slow
people<00:01:31.530> down<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.159> bit<00:01:32.460> if<00:01:33.030> they

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
people down just a little bit if they

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.609 
people down just a little bit if they
have<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> whole<00:01:33.570> bunch<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.930> souls<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.439> that

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
have a whole bunch of souls and that

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.749 
have a whole bunch of souls and that
would<00:01:34.890> keep<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.130> maybe<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.430> little<00:01:35.640> more

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
would keep it maybe a little more

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.069 
would keep it maybe a little more
balanced<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.240> fair<00:01:36.479> for<00:01:36.540> everyone<00:01:42.049> one<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
balanced and fair for everyone one of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.210 
balanced and fair for everyone one of
the<00:01:43.170> block<00:01:43.320> types<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.799> see<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.100> an

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the block types you can see is an

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.530 
the block types you can see is an
exploding<00:01:44.549> block<00:01:44.880> down<00:01:45.119> there<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.450> you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
exploding block down there and if you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.870 
exploding block down there and if you
touch<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.960> explodes<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.490> doesn't<00:01:47.759> kill

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
touch it it explodes but it doesn't kill

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.420 
touch it it explodes but it doesn't kill

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.430 
issues that we were talking about
earlier<00:03:37.550> but<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:39.660> all<00:03:39.810> sorta<00:03:40.080> just<00:03:40.260> gets

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
earlier but that all sorta just gets

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:53.970 
earlier but that all sorta just gets
balanced<00:03:40.800> out<00:03:40.920> as<00:03:41.100> we<00:03:41.340> continue<00:03:42.000> development

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.229 

[Music]

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.970 

and<00:03:58.239> look<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.319> would<00:03:59.439> be<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.680> end<00:03:59.799> of<00:03:59.890> the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
and look that would be the end of the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.770 
and look that would be the end of the
level<00:04:00.159> and<00:04:00.400> then<00:04:00.519> so<00:04:00.760> what<00:04:01.030> happens<00:04:01.390> here<00:04:01.569> is

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
level and then so what happens here is

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.600 
level and then so what happens here is
we're<00:04:01.959> gonna<00:04:02.049> see<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.379> score<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:03.220> score<00:04:03.459> is

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
we're gonna see the score the score is

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.240 
we're gonna see the score the score is
represented<00:04:04.269> by<00:04:04.299> how<00:04:05.079> far<00:04:05.680> our<00:04:05.799> legs<00:04:05.980> go<00:04:06.220> up

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
represented by how far our legs go up

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.949 
represented by how far our legs go up
and<00:04:06.640> Emil<00:04:06.849> had<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.060> lot<00:04:07.269> of<00:04:07.299> souls<00:04:07.599> for<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.810> long

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
and Emil had a lot of souls for a long

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.429 
and Emil had a lot of souls for a long
time<00:04:08.230> so<00:04:08.500> he<00:04:08.530> is<00:04:09.159> the<00:04:09.400> MVP<00:04:09.879> and<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:11.079> enemies

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
time so he is the MVP and the enemies

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.990 
time so he is the MVP and the enemies
didn't<00:04:11.769> really<00:04:11.950> have<00:04:12.129> any<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:12.579> they're<00:04:12.819> just

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
didn't really have any so they're just

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.599 
didn't really have any so they're just
kind<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.299> down<00:04:13.480> there<00:04:14.099> that's<00:04:15.099> the<00:04:15.310> end<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.489> our

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
kind of down there that's the end of our

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.520
