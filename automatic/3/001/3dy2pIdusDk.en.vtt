really do is drag the resources in
so<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:16.080> can<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:16.410> do<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:18.230> just<00:02:19.230> drag<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.470> in

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
so you can just do this just drag it in

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.610 
so you can just do this just drag it in
and<00:02:20.360> into<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> main<00:02:21.660> dot<00:02:21.840> minecraft<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.440> just
