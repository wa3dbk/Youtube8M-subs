get all my other Strike Packages early

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.840 
get all my other Strike Packages early
and<00:01:09.750> went<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.040> biggest<00:01:11.460> reason<00:01:11.760> for

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
and went in the biggest reason for

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.670 
and went in the biggest reason for
having<00:01:11.909> hard<00:01:12.180> line<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.140> get<00:01:13.260> assists

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
having hard line is I can get assists

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.550 
having hard line is I can get assists
counts<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.159> kills<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.939> every<00:01:15.299> two<00:01:16.170> assists

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
counts as kills so for every two assists

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.679 
counts as kills so for every two assists
it<00:01:16.710> counts<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.220> kill<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.640> my<00:01:17.820> streak<00:01:18.210> so

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
it counts as one kill on my streak so

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.910 
it counts as one kill on my streak so
that<00:01:18.900> definitely<00:01:19.110> helps<00:01:19.590> because<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.860> think

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that definitely helps because I think

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.609 
that definitely helps because I think
one<00:01:20.220> time<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> got<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:21.030> head<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> total<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.080> 17

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
one time I got my head a total of 17

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.390

basically<00:02:00.990> stopping<00:02:01.380> power<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:03.060> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
basically stopping power but you know it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
basically stopping power but you know it
has<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.719> same<00:02:03.899> damage<00:02:04.140> multiplier<00:02:04.439> as

forty<00:02:06.329> percent<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:07.229> Egypt<00:02:07.619> bullet<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.459> it

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
forty percent to Egypt bullet but it

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.690 
forty percent to Egypt bullet but it
there's<00:02:10.140> only<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.440> certain<00:02:10.649> chance<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.580> it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
there's only a certain chance that it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.670 
there's only a certain chance that it
the<00:02:12.239> bullet<00:02:12.629> will<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:13.080> that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the bullet will have that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.050 
the bullet will have that
when<00:02:13.829> you're<00:02:13.950> below<00:02:14.219> three<00:02:14.519> kills<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.879> think

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
when you're below three kills I think

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.970 
when you're below three kills I think
it's<00:02:15.150> like<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.299> one-in-nine<00:02:15.719> shot<00:02:15.870> then<00:02:16.500> your

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
it's like a one-in-nine shot then your

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.920 
it's like a one-in-nine shot then your
bullets<00:02:17.340> are<00:02:17.400> going<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.579> do<00:02:17.700> one<00:02:17.909> in<00:02:18.030> there<00:02:18.780> are

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
bullets are going to do one in there are

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.110 
bullets are going to do one in there are
forty<00:02:19.290> percent<00:02:19.500> more<00:02:19.680> damage<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.099> then<00:02:20.579> above

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
forty percent more damage and then above

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.479 
forty percent more damage and then above
a<00:02:21.269> five<00:02:21.480> killstreak<00:02:22.049> it's<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.349> one<00:02:23.219> in<00:02:23.370> every

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
a five killstreak it's like one in every

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.009 
a five killstreak it's like one in every
two<00:02:23.879> bullets<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.299> do<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.569> forty<00:02:24.810> percent

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
two bullets to do that forty percent

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.289 
two bullets to do that forty percent
damage<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.739> it's<00:02:25.950> definitely<00:02:26.370> pretty<00:02:26.760> much<00:02:27.030> no

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299

single perk that I have here is pretty

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.749 
single perk that I have here is pretty
much<00:03:42.540> necessary<00:03:43.259> in<00:03:43.530> my<00:03:43.739> eyes<00:03:43.979> for<00:03:44.430> building<00:03:44.699> a

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:44.759 
much necessary in my eyes for building a

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.360 
much necessary in my eyes for building a
big<00:03:44.970> class<00:03:45.209> but<00:03:45.959> I'm<00:03:46.169> like<00:03:46.799> if<00:03:46.979> you<00:03:47.069> don't<00:03:47.220> have

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
big class but I'm like if you don't have

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.039 
big class but I'm like if you don't have
a<00:03:47.400> good<00:03:47.579> headset<00:03:47.909> like<00:03:48.090> 8<00:03:48.269> 40<00:03:48.659> s<00:03:48.720> or<00:03:48.810> something

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
a good headset like 8 40 s or something

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.509 
a good headset like 8 40 s or something
like<00:03:49.169> that<00:03:49.229> then<00:03:49.739> there<00:03:49.979> really<00:03:50.129> is<00:03:50.370> no<00:03:50.489> point

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
like that then there really is no point

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.369 
like that then there really is no point
in<00:03:50.849> having<00:03:50.939> amplify<00:03:51.540> on<00:03:51.689> unless<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.109> really

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
in having amplify on unless you really

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.830 
in having amplify on unless you really
like<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.739> crank<00:03:52.949> that<00:03:53.040> bad<00:03:53.310> boy<00:03:53.489> up<00:03:53.669> and
