Windows 8 pro on the weekend previously

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.359 
Windows 8 pro on the weekend previously
had<00:00:14.849> Windows<00:00:15.299> 7<00:00:15.809> home<00:00:16.289> edition<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.510> raided

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
had Windows 7 home edition so it raided

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.070 
had Windows 7 home edition so it raided
back<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.520> my<00:00:20.640> hard<00:00:20.760> drive<00:00:20.850> first<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.660> did<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
back to my hard drive first and did a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.259 
back to my hard drive first and did a
straightforward<00:00:22.380> upgrade<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.250> Windows<00:00:23.550> 8<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
straightforward upgrade to Windows 8 and

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.080 
straightforward upgrade to Windows 8 and
say<00:00:24.420> too<00:00:24.480> long<00:00:25.460> then<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.550> was<00:00:26.699> doing<00:00:26.910> some

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
say too long then I was doing some

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.880 
say too long then I was doing some
reading<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> internet<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.170> found<00:00:28.680> thee

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
reading on the internet and found thee

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.389 
reading on the internet and found thee
because<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.580> had<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.150> 7-7<00:00:30.779> board<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.260> could<00:00:32.160> be

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
because I had is at 7-7 board I could be

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.880 
because I had is at 7-7 board I could be
using<00:00:33.329> UEFI<00:00:33.960> instead<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> traditional

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
using UEFI instead of the traditional

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.299 
using UEFI instead of the traditional
BIOS<00:00:35.430> boot<00:00:35.790> method<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:37.920> I've<00:00:38.040> done

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
BIOS boot method and so what I've done

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.190 
BIOS boot method and so what I've done
is<00:00:38.579> followed<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> guide<00:00:39.329> which<00:00:39.809> I'm<00:00:39.989> going<00:00:40.110> to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
is followed a guide which I'm going to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.470 
is followed a guide which I'm going to

below on how to convert an already
running<00:00:46.770> system<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.700> use<00:00:47.940> UEFI<00:00:48.600> boot<00:00:48.989> in

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
running system to use UEFI boot in

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.850 
running system to use UEFI boot in
Windows<00:00:49.739> 8<00:00:51.140> basically<00:00:52.140> some<00:00:52.289> videos<00:00:52.620> I've

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
Windows 8 basically some videos I've

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.729 
Windows 8 basically some videos I've
seen<00:00:53.239> suggest<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.870> very<00:00:55.170> quick<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
seen suggest that this is very quick and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.389 
seen suggest that this is very quick and
also<00:00:56.670> enables<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.320> turn<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.770> Windows

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
also enables you to turn on the Windows

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.020 
also enables you to turn on the Windows
8<00:00:59.579> secure<00:01:00.090> boot<00:01:00.300> feature<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.230> wish<00:01:02.030> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
8 secure boot feature if you so wish the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.649 
8 secure boot feature if you so wish the
windows<00:01:03.300> 8<00:01:03.480> secure<00:01:03.899> boot<00:01:04.140> basically<00:01:05.659> protects

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
windows 8 secure boot basically protects

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.510 
windows 8 secure boot basically protects
you<00:01:06.780> from<00:01:07.430> malicious<00:01:08.570> viruses<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.810> Trojans

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
you from malicious viruses or Trojans

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.070 
you from malicious viruses or Trojans
anything<00:01:11.520> trying<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.939> attack<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.659> computer

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
anything trying to attack your computer

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.950 
anything trying to attack your computer
join<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> boot<00:01:13.530> phase<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.570> what<00:01:15.750> we're<00:01:15.869> going

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
join the boot phase so what we're going

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.929 
join the boot phase so what we're going
to<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.200> now<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.650> our<00:01:16.770> build<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.159> between<00:01:17.400> doze<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
to do now is our build up between doze a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.510 
to do now is our build up between doze a
efforts<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.080> abled<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.070> I'm<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
efforts in abled so I'm going to do is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.899 
efforts in abled so I'm going to do is
just<00:01:20.729> shut<00:01:20.939> down<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> power<00:01:22.590> off<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.820> if

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
just shut down to a power off so know if

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.280 
just shut down to a power off so know if
you<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.119> how<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.689> Windows<00:01:25.080> 8

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
you know how to do that Windows 8

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.230 
you know how to do that Windows 8
basically<00:01:25.890> move<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> cursor<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
basically move the cursor to one of the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.380 
basically move the cursor to one of the
corners<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.930> get<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.700> menu<00:01:29.970> that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
corners and you get the little menu that

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.410 
corners and you get the little menu that
pops<00:01:30.420> outside<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.500> click<00:01:31.710> settings<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
pops outside you click settings and the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.030 
pops outside you click settings and the
power<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:35.030> shutdown<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:37.290> basically<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> PC

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
power and shutdown and basically the PC

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.719 
power and shutdown and basically the PC
shuts<00:01:38.280> down<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:41.159> I'm<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.490> give<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> about

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
shuts down so I'm going to give it about

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.719 
shuts down so I'm going to give it about
10<00:01:42.090> seconds<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.079> from<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> old<00:01:43.590> school<00:01:43.829> we

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
10 seconds and from the old school we

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.719 
10 seconds and from the old school we
used<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.180> big<00:01:45.360> Winchester<00:01:46.079> hard<00:01:46.229> drives

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
used to have big Winchester hard drives

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.740 
used to have big Winchester hard drives
so<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.210> make<00:01:48.329> sure<00:01:48.540> anything

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
so just like to make sure anything

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.469 
so just like to make sure anything
mechanical<00:01:48.960> stop<00:01:49.619> worrying<00:01:50.159> away<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:51.210> when<00:01:51.390> we

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
mechanical stop worrying away so when we

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.760 
mechanical stop worrying away so when we
turn<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> power<00:01:51.930> back<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.439> don't<00:01:52.530> break

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
turn the power back on we don't break

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.429 
turn the power back on we don't break
anything<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.899> was<00:01:54.930> probably<00:01:55.290> long<00:01:55.409> enough

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
anything so it was probably long enough

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.940 
anything so it was probably long enough
about<00:01:55.829> 10<00:01:56.100> seconds<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:58.100> turn<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> power<00:01:59.399> on

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
about 10 seconds there turn the power on

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.620 
about 10 seconds there turn the power on
basically<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.009> get<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> little<00:02:02.549> bit<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.030> post

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
basically I get a little bit of a post

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.100 
basically I get a little bit of a post
just<00:02:04.590> because<00:02:04.829> I've<00:02:04.920> got<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.070> raid<00:02:05.369> 0

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
just because I've got a raid 0

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.160 
just because I've got a raid 0
configured<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.680> my<00:02:07.860> disks<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.849> my<00:02:08.940> games

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
configured on to my disks for my games

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.450 
configured on to my disks for my games
so<00:02:10.170> we<00:02:10.259> still<00:02:10.500> see<00:02:10.530> that

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
so we still see that

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.680 
so we still see that
probably<00:02:11.850> slows<00:02:12.030> down<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.330> boot<00:02:12.480> phase<00:02:12.660> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
probably slows down the boot phase a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.480 
probably slows down the boot phase a
little<00:02:12.990> bit<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.980> we<00:02:14.040> get<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:14.310> knows

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
little bit and we get that we knows

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.630 
little bit and we get that we knows
eight<00:02:14.670> boot<00:02:14.850> screen<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:16.340> straight<00:02:17.340> into<00:02:17.490> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
eight boot screen and straight into the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.860 
eight boot screen and straight into the
launch<00:02:17.820> screen<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:20.240> not<00:02:21.240> very<00:02:21.360> long<00:02:21.570> at<00:02:21.720> all

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
launch screen and not very long at all

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.140 
launch screen and not very long at all
so<00:02:23.720> if<00:02:24.720> we<00:02:24.780> do<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> log<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.350> there<00:02:25.560> I'll<00:02:26.460> show<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
so if we do a log on there I'll show you

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:43.060 
so if we do a log on there I'll show you
some<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.510> settings<00:02:27.810> if<00:02:28.710> we've<00:02:28.890> got<00:02:29.040> time

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.060 

so<00:02:44.070> basically<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.850> get<00:02:45.420> into<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.780> bias

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
so basically and to get into the bias

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.440 
so basically and to get into the bias
because<00:02:47.070> it's<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.370> quick<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:47.940> hard<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.270> press

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
because it's so quick it's hard to press

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.780 
because it's so quick it's hard to press
the<00:02:48.600> keys<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.200> get<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> boot<00:02:50.490> screen

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
the keys and get in on the boot screen

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.340 
the keys and get in on the boot screen
so<00:02:51.360> what<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.510> do<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.690> go<00:02:51.840> back<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.200> your

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
so what you do is go back to your

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.840 
so what you do is go back to your
settings<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> left<00:02:53.480> right<00:02:54.480> even<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:56.220> couple

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
settings on the left right even a couple

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.360 
settings on the left right even a couple
of<00:02:56.940> photos<00:02:57.240> I've<00:02:57.360> noticed<00:02:57.780> booting<00:02:58.470> from<00:02:58.500> UEFI

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
of photos I've noticed booting from UEFI

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.310 
of photos I've noticed booting from UEFI
or<00:03:00.060> using<00:03:00.540> fast<00:03:00.780> boot

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
or using fast boot

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.930 
or using fast boot
sometimes<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.220> network<00:03:02.460> card<00:03:02.640> doesn't

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
sometimes a network card doesn't

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.480 
sometimes a network card doesn't
initialize<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:04.500> that's<00:03:04.620> quite<00:03:04.830> easy<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:05.130> sort

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
initialize but that's quite easy to sort

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.830 
initialize but that's quite easy to sort
if<00:03:05.640> you're<00:03:05.730> going<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.030> vice<00:03:06.180> manager<00:03:06.420> and

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
if you're going to vice manager and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.980 
if you're going to vice manager and
enter<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.200> hardware<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.250> reappears<00:03:08.990> so

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
enter that hardware it just reappears so

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.790 
enter that hardware it just reappears so
forget<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.290> change<00:03:10.470> PC<00:03:10.980> settings<00:03:12.560> there<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.650> go

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
forget to change PC settings there we go

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.060 
forget to change PC settings there we go
into<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.430> general<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:16.050> scroll<00:03:16.470> down<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:17.010> can

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
into a general and scroll down you can

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.870 
into a general and scroll down you can

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.990 

it's<00:03:28.050> basically<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.440> want<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.650> select

that if I do or create a video and

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.510 
that if I do or create a video and
that's<00:04:32.940> basically<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:34.039> what<00:04:35.039> you<00:04:35.100> do<00:04:35.280> then<00:04:35.490> is

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
that's basically it what you do then is

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:51.269 
that's basically it what you do then is
you<00:04:35.870> should<00:04:36.870> 90<00:04:37.139> PC<00:04:37.590> those<00:04:38.550> so<00:04:38.789> in<00:04:38.850> selected

what<00:04:51.849> I<00:04:51.879> have<00:04:52.029> noticed<00:04:52.239> is<00:04:52.629> once<00:04:52.839> you've<00:04:53.079> been

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
what I have noticed is once you've been

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.039 
what I have noticed is once you've been
into<00:04:53.619> the<00:04:53.819> settings<00:04:54.819> and<00:04:55.089> you<00:04:55.269> reboot<00:04:55.689> it's

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:56.049 
into the settings and you reboot it's

00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:57.839 
into the settings and you reboot it's
the<00:04:56.379> first<00:04:56.799> people<00:04:57.069> have<00:04:57.219> to<00:04:57.339> go<00:04:57.699> in<00:04:57.759> it

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
the first people have to go in it
