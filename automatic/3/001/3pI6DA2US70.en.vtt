00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
first round started we had we had him we

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.970 
first round started we had we had him we
had<00:03:36.420> more<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.810> feeling-out<00:03:37.140> process<00:03:37.200> than<00:03:37.890> I

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
had more of a feeling-out process than I

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.559 
had more of a feeling-out process than I
thought<00:03:38.190> as<00:03:38.400> we<00:03:38.519> were<00:03:38.640> circling<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.180> saw<00:03:39.359> he<00:03:39.480> was

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
thought as we were circling I saw he was

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.910 
thought as we were circling I saw he was
developing<00:03:39.959> some<00:03:40.200> sort<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.530> thought<00:03:40.739> process

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
developing some sort of thought process

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.069 
developing some sort of thought process
so<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.790> threw<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.060> karate<00:03:42.510> kick<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.870> didn't

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
so I threw that karate kick I didn't

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.539 
so I threw that karate kick I didn't
plan<00:03:43.260> on<00:03:43.410> doing<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.980> certainly<00:03:44.100> didn't

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
plan on doing that and certainly didn't

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.430 
plan on doing that and certainly didn't
expect<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.030> land<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.510> just<00:03:46.019> wanted<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.290> give
