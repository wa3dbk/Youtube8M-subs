00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.770
 gone and we have a fun again 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.940
 Conceived in spas exactly at the last 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.889
 times that is so good with these 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.259
 pound labels somehow everyone 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.460
 Fashion blogger reportedly knew this 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.970
 but did not exist as for example 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.680
 fukushima and so we thought try 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.439
 Let's do it a bit different now 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.260
 That was exactly what we took from 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.730
 labels picked out like ours 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.460
 market research did not reveal people 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.280
 and we can test that 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.570
 this time 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.570
 the moderation 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.019

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.019
 over 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.879
 the youtube grad 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.370
 I brought today's news 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.380

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.890
 I probably have it and 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:34.140
 every time I can do it myself 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:46.200
 prefers to school that cola 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:46.200
 bronze school by phone cara la vie 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.200

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:21.840
 nike nike creativity in things 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.510
 Fashion very clear on the great body bags 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.010
 yes very creative and the rule yes 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.530
 not creative because normally 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.920
 therefore only some uncreative things 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.599
 in there are in the moment asks what has something 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.849
 you can make it anyway 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.130
 So that was very creative to me 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.930
 but there are eight and the theme and 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.450
 also does not offer much to pick 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.560

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.810

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.920
