00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.580
 the exchange folks sound back here 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.109
 I'm in the pix, and this time I'm 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.820
 texture because I forgot to install the 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.430
 forever player texture then it will be 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.710
 with same vanilla pixel art texture and is 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.470
 the following you asked for a lot in these 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.150
 comments were more than 180 you will 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.920
 see on the screen because you can not 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.750
 put the comments on the screen as I did 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.460
 in other episodes that were many 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.530
 So you can see the way I did there. 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.890
 to be able to show everyone who asked for it 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.890
 there o 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.850
 Botafogo 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.110
 Exactly, you asked Mario 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.210
 supermarine then as a pixote lady 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.189
 very simple I thought a way to 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.229
 do something really cool and a little bit more 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.720
 developed for you like it there 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.909
 so short is our pixel art ours 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.899
 time lapse and I come back when 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.899
 I'm done 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.980
 the young man 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.520
 boy george mitchell 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.319
 of 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.310
 It hurts 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.200
 the pj and mp 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.340

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.150

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.530
 white evolution of the sea I really liked it 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.050
 taking out a fourth Marília was half 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.970
 vehicle because I think I missed the 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.680
 count he got snoopy I would not go 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.540
 destroying it whole then leaves a 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.490
 a little bit but all the others in 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.560
 my opinion were very beasts 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.570
 you have found the seas from 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.810
 the first ally of that of 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.490
 arcade of whatever think it was 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.860
 understood the first one that came out not now 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.870

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.510

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.900
 episodes because I'm needing day 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.840

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.730
 new on the channel that will arrive and the crew 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.620
 It was a little bit like that, I 'm still going 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.540

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.930

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.040
 henrique type novelty comes in the channel and 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.110
