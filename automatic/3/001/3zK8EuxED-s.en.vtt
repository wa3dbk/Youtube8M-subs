00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.170
 the voice data and the tan logo 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.820
 the day and let's see how to use 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.949
 the new facebook chat feature 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.269
 what are the basic tools and functions that it has 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.839
 has changed things like national active atxaga let's see 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:19.609
 which are 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.369
 good instead of day or inside right 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.369
 we say to paris and chad 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.899
 and we're going to be able to actually see the 20n contact however fischer completeness 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.920
 in the previous lucescu wall are a formula for the burning in deraa as 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.770
 just connect in the chat ' 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.200
 now for example if I love you next actor with someone 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 no substitute at his feet 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.270
 in contact 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.620
 and while I take with the pressure 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.740
 why does it happen that that vote to minimize in exists and while this 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.010
 button b 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.690
 close 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.010
 olaetxea could not tell if the way of minimizing ares has seemed 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.200
 petrobras work begins the windows 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.020
 per cent that nissan is intuitive 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.800
 but if this one put it to shot for example 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.860
 so believe the same name of the window and throw 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 not only does it count that that advantage is going to be reduced 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.810
 as for example several relevant concrete persons demonstrate that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.460
 I walk for example 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.050
 the immigrants do not remove 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.710
 the santa monome 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.830
 the markets seem to take 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.910
 astonishment that comes the name of the same name the part above 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.180
 they say it is not reduced 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.130
 so he was moving away they claim to have 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.729
 then we say vote to minimize best 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.890
 they thought it was a casino crime 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.040
 name 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.220
 automatically that window is maximized rossi minis 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.200
 now if we want percent for example previous others we have the list cast 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.779
 that gap one of the hairs that are connected we sit down to chat 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.810
 and I assume that the name and the no less led to the profile appeared now 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.109
 I simply brought third person I have to do 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:09.829

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.669
 Inside the sale of Chad 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.569
 16th 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 I can not get to the profile of the person 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.319
 as they are at this moment 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.129
 however, if we do what 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.569
 he wanted to do it before he was clicking on the man the person 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.749
 I assume that for example the name of people 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.090
 it's not new because it's personal but it kept trying to do the military 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.089
 accumulate done previously 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.169
 he also promised to take into account that this has changed 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.639
 can he connect the airport 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.639
 cultural that others can still see that produces see 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.089

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:01.999
