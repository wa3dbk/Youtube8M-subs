captain<00:01:16.350> after<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.189> series<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:18.150> been<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
captain after this series it's been a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.120 
captain after this series it's been a
really<00:01:18.630> tough<00:01:18.750> tour<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.500> Alistair<00:01:19.890> Cooke

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
really tough tour for Alistair Cooke

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.120 
really tough tour for Alistair Cooke
Test<00:01:20.820> series<00:01:21.000> obviously<00:01:21.360> 5-nil<00:01:22.170> against<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
Test series obviously 5-nil against and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.320 
Test series obviously 5-nil against and
he's<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.180> lost<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.530> ODI<00:01:25.799> series<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.030> don't

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
he's now lost the ODI series so I don't

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.670 
he's now lost the ODI series so I don't
think<00:01:27.570> he's<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> continue<00:01:28.020> as<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.500> DI

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
think he's going to continue as a DI

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.149 
think he's going to continue as a DI
captain<00:01:29.310> he'll<00:01:29.640> replace<00:01:30.090> him<00:01:30.860> is<00:01:31.860> another

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
captain he'll replace him is another

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:32.719 
captain he'll replace him is another
matter

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
matter

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.190 
matter
Owen<00:01:33.060> Morgan<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> bookmakers<00:01:33.990> favourite

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
Owen Morgan the bookmakers favourite

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.620 
Owen Morgan the bookmakers favourite
Stuart<00:01:34.710> Broad<00:01:34.890> possibly<00:01:35.520> another<00:01:35.850> option<00:01:36.420> I

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
Stuart Broad possibly another option I

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.649 
Stuart Broad possibly another option I
think<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.549> will<00:01:38.729> come<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.509> light

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
think that's one that will come to light

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.270 
think that's one that will come to light
probably<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.350> end<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.680> series<00:01:40.920> but

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
probably at the end of this series but

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.340 
probably at the end of this series but
he's<00:01:41.640> had<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> tough<00:01:42.060> time<00:01:42.119> he's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:43.079> nice<00:01:43.320> guy

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
he's had a tough time he's a nice guy

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.330 
he's had a tough time he's a nice guy
he's<00:01:43.950> had<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.399> bad<00:01:44.729> run<00:01:45.409> with<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:47.040> ashes

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
he's had a really bad run with the ashes

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.730 
he's had a really bad run with the ashes
test<00:01:47.579> series<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.090> think<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:49.020> ODI<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.530> top

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
test series and I think the ODI on top

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.620 
test series and I think the ODI on top
of<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> all<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.610> know<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.210> too

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
of it all was you know really just too

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.929 
of it all was you know really just too

some<00:02:04.950> close<00:02:05.189> games<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.670> New<00:02:05.790> Zealand<00:02:06.030> winning

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
some close games a New Zealand winning

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.330 
some close games a New Zealand winning
the<00:02:06.360> first<00:02:06.540> game<00:02:06.689> by<00:02:06.960> 24<00:02:07.530> runs<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.009> second

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the first game by 24 runs and the second

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.910 
the first game by 24 runs and the second
by<00:02:08.429> 15<00:02:08.879> well<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> think<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.660> predicted<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.619> very

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
by 15 well I think we predicted a very

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.830 
by 15 well I think we predicted a very
tight<00:02:11.220> series<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.910> probably<00:02:12.360> as

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
tight series that probably as

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.170 
tight series that probably as
tight<00:02:13.110> as<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.590> previous<00:02:14.069> one<00:02:14.640> New<00:02:14.849> Zealand

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
tight as the previous one New Zealand

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.030 
tight as the previous one New Zealand
against<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> West<00:02:15.959> Indies<00:02:16.349> which<00:02:16.560> ended<00:02:16.890> to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
against the West Indies which ended to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.610 
against the West Indies which ended to
all<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.330> mean<00:02:18.450> New<00:02:18.690> Zealand<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.230> to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
all and I think I mean New Zealand a to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.369 
all and I think I mean New Zealand a to
nil<00:02:19.830> up<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.519> it's<00:02:20.760> it's<00:02:21.150> been<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.629> clay<00:02:22.019> sand

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
nil up but it's it's been that clay sand

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.430 
nil up but it's it's been that clay sand

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
with Duckworth Lewis in in the last game

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.650 
with Duckworth Lewis in in the last game
coming<00:02:26.040> into<00:02:26.190> play<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:27.120> was<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.300> tricky<00:02:27.629> one

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
coming into play it was a tricky one

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.600 
coming into play it was a tricky one
with<00:02:28.140> India<00:02:28.410> scoring<00:02:28.769> more<00:02:28.920> runs<00:02:29.190> in<00:02:29.430> their

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.710 
allotted overs and yet still losing so
that<00:02:32.129> would<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.310> debated<00:02:32.819> for<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.030> while<00:02:33.209> always

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
that would be debated for a while always

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.759 
Zealand
I<00:02:56.400> think<00:02:57.030> they've<00:02:57.180> they've<00:02:57.810> got<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.260> momentum

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
I think they've they've got the momentum

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.860 
I think they've they've got the momentum
now<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.310> they<00:02:59.459> know<00:02:59.640> how<00:02:59.879> to<00:02:59.910> win<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.750> they

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
now and they know how to win and they

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.819 
now and they know how to win and they
are<00:03:01.019> winning<00:03:01.319> well<00:03:01.500> albeit<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.540> tight

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829
