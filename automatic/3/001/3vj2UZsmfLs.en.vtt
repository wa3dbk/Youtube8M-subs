for<00:02:39.549> some<00:02:39.579> sort<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:40.000> resonance<00:02:42.690> optimization

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
for some sort of resonance optimization

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.069 
for some sort of resonance optimization
as<00:02:43.900> well<00:02:44.200> as<00:02:44.500> weight<00:02:45.069> optimization<00:02:45.879> so<00:02:46.629> that's

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
as well as weight optimization so that's

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.259 
as well as weight optimization so that's
kind<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.319> nice<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.829> headphone<00:02:48.269> this

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
kind of nice this headphone this

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.390 
kind of nice this headphone this
headband<00:02:49.599> right<00:02:49.780> here<00:02:50.019> pretty<00:02:50.349> light<00:02:50.650> looks

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
headband right here pretty light looks

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.470 
headband right here pretty light looks
like<00:02:51.549> there's<00:02:51.700> some<00:02:51.790> padding<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.269> bottom

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
like there's some padding on the bottom

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.250 
like there's some padding on the bottom
so<00:02:52.989> that's<00:02:53.079> nice<00:02:53.730> let's<00:02:54.730> see<00:02:54.970> we've<00:02:55.180> got<00:02:55.359> 360

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
so that's nice let's see we've got 360

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.849 
so that's nice let's see we've got 360
rotation<00:02:56.829> on<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.609> ear<00:02:57.970> pads<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.660> like<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.739> as

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
rotation on the ear pads I like that as

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.910 
rotation on the ear pads I like that as
well<00:03:01.109> not<00:03:02.109> necessary

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
well not necessary

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.920 
well not necessary
see<00:03:03.489> as<00:03:03.609> I'm<00:03:03.760> only<00:03:03.970> going<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.299> be<00:03:04.420> using<00:03:04.660> them

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
see as I'm only going to be using them

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.319 
see as I'm only going to be using them
in<00:03:04.959> one<00:03:05.230> configuration<00:03:05.549> but<00:03:06.549> hey<00:03:06.849> more

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
in one configuration but hey more

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.370 
in one configuration but hey more
rotation<00:03:08.019> can't<00:03:08.470> be<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.680> bad<00:03:08.920> thing<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.340> suppose

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
rotation can't be a bad thing I suppose

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.860 
rotation can't be a bad thing I suppose
you<00:03:11.380> got<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.650> cord<00:03:12.040> which<00:03:12.250> is<00:03:12.280> actually

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
you got this cord which is actually

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.970 
you got this cord which is actually
heavier<00:03:13.870> than<00:03:14.079> you<00:03:14.200> would<00:03:14.319> think<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:14.859> not

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
heavier than you would think it's not

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.699 
heavier than you would think it's not
bad<00:03:15.569> it's<00:03:16.569> cord<00:03:16.900> weighs<00:03:17.200> more<00:03:17.470> than<00:03:17.530> the

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
bad it's cord weighs more than the

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.440 
bad it's cord weighs more than the
headphones<00:03:18.099> themselves<00:03:19.410> maybe<00:03:20.410> not<00:03:21.299> but<00:03:22.299> it's

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
headphones themselves maybe not but it's

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.569 
headphones themselves maybe not but it's
it's<00:03:22.750> definitely<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:23.200> thick<00:03:23.410> cord<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:24.340> doesn't

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
it's definitely a thick cord it doesn't

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.190 
it's definitely a thick cord it doesn't
look<00:03:24.669> like<00:03:24.730> it's<00:03:24.940> very<00:03:25.120> long<00:03:25.359> I<00:03:25.660> may<00:03:25.810> be<00:03:25.870> buying

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
look like it's very long I may be buying

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.550 
look like it's very long I may be buying

at the moment these are just headphones

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.199 
at the moment these are just headphones
I'll<00:03:31.750> be<00:03:31.870> using<00:03:32.109> on<00:03:32.200> my<00:03:32.290> desk<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:33.489> combination

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
Maadi Magne amplifier DAC combo and I'll

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.559 
Maadi Magne amplifier DAC combo and I'll
be<00:03:42.040> doing<00:03:42.250> an<00:03:42.340> unboxing<00:03:42.430> for<00:03:43.060> those<00:03:43.180> as<00:03:43.329> well

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
be doing an unboxing for those as well

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.289 
be doing an unboxing for those as well
so<00:03:43.680> keep<00:03:44.680> tuned<00:03:44.889> for<00:03:45.099> that

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.530 

see<00:03:49.299> there's<00:03:49.510> nice<00:03:49.780> leather<00:03:52.290> this

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
see there's nice leather this

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.780 
see there's nice leather this
looks<00:03:55.170> like<00:03:55.440> it'll<00:03:55.739> be<00:03:55.769> comfortable<00:03:56.519> for<00:03:56.760> long

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
looks like it'll be comfortable for long

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.839 
looks like it'll be comfortable for long
periods<00:03:57.330> of<00:03:57.420> time<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:58.110> made<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.159> a<00:03:59.190> folio<00:03:59.640> a

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
periods of time I made you a folio a

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.000 
periods of time I made you a folio a
follow-up<00:04:00.299> video<00:04:00.830> where<00:04:01.830> I<00:04:02.370> comment<00:04:03.239> on<00:04:03.450> these

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010

first<00:04:05.060> my<00:04:06.060> first<00:04:06.269> impressions<00:04:06.750> on<00:04:06.900> these

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
first my first impressions on these

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.699 
first my first impressions on these
maybe<00:04:08.250> now<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:08.489> just<00:04:08.790> add<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.390> in<00:04:09.709> the

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
maybe now I just add it in the

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.159 
maybe now I just add it in the
description<00:04:11.450> at<00:04:12.450> some<00:04:12.660> point<00:04:12.900> later<00:04:14.690> but<00:04:15.690> so

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
description at some point later but so

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.520 
description at some point later but so
far<00:04:16.410> these<00:04:16.650> look<00:04:16.799> pretty<00:04:17.070> good<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:18.290> have<00:04:19.290> yet<00:04:19.500> to

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
far these look pretty good I have yet to

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.099 
far these look pretty good I have yet to
hear<00:04:20.070> them<00:04:20.250> but<00:04:20.519> I<00:04:20.549> imagine<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.150> these

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
hear them but I imagine that these

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.730 
hear them but I imagine that these
should<00:04:22.970> be<00:04:24.110> pretty<00:04:25.110> satisfactory<00:04:25.530> for<00:04:25.979> my<00:04:26.100> use

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
should be pretty satisfactory for my use

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.170 
should be pretty satisfactory for my use

and cheaper in most cases I did find the

he4s for cheaper but you know I had to

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.100 
he4s for cheaper but you know I had to
take<00:04:49.979> getting<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:50.400> just<00:04:51.389> because<00:04:51.630> I<00:04:51.690> do<00:04:51.750> like

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.040 
but one of my main influences on buying
these<00:05:01.560> was<00:05:02.490> definitely<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.479> way<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:03.900> these
