heart baits and in hard baits I included

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.380 
heart baits and in hard baits I included
spinnerbait<00:02:35.220> abuzz<00:02:35.519> because<00:02:35.910> they<00:02:36.030> have<00:02:36.120> hard

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
spinnerbait abuzz because they have hard

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.170

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
blades and a lot of hard parts then I

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.729 
blades and a lot of hard parts then I
broke<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.480> down<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.900> top<00:02:40.230> water<00:02:40.470> for

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
broke it down to top water for

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.259 
broke it down to top water for

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.710 
so there you go that's a little bit of a

nine<00:03:17.910> top<00:03:18.900> five<00:03:19.110> lures<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:21.090> guess<00:03:21.269> if<00:03:21.450> you

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
nine top five lures so I guess if you

nine top five lures so I guess if you
break<00:03:21.870> down<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.079> data<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.560> look<00:03:22.709> at<00:03:22.860> it

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
break down the data and you look at it

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.839
