00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.170
 I got 2.0 but it could be that 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.250
 exchange 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.649
 according to the versions and to put 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.700
 macro so you're fine everything 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.739
 just in my big not very 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.879
 difficult does the little extra to create 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.350

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.469
 goldman the macro you can change 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.109
 when you want to do 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.230

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.750
