 videos of the game also go to 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.010
 information and so on to download anything 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.969
 more we go down and here state says 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.370
 downloads 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.960
 the options packages we have for 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.149
 to download 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.290
 the first two options are the game 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.880
 in a compressed format a total recipe 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:53.160
 who can install it 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:55.650
 62 and 64 sorry as in 32 bits 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.280
 compiling either the third option that 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.640
 It is a 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.440
 a packet format that point because 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.500
 it is the easiest to install if you 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.420
 they have a distribution based on debian 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.220
 as ubuntu other distros like in my 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.259
 case or sorin ok this courtesy of 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.380
 luciano javier not the house thank you for 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.049
 this contribution and they are also going to have a 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.060
 option for windows meanwhile what 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.830
 can play as in linux any 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.430
 instruction they have as well as in 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.380
 windows and they will be able to download a 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.530
 once downloaded for example if they decide 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.170
 lower the point that you can install og 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.970
 weak or simply with double click 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.929
 and they will be opened in the center of 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.509
 software and I'm going to show it I'm going to 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.270
 go to the games I'll show you how 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.310
 I say it's called string pack 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.329
 we have spent in covenant is not a game of 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.329
 pac man and 3d 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.940
 that now looks pretty good is a 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.940
 classic 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.170
 we all know 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.140
 but in this game version 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.580
 with improved graphics good here are 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.440
 the controls that we're going to be able to go to 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.959
 change the controls or we go in the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.959
 game that is star game 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.310
 the game starts to load 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.930
 and I will wait for you to show them to 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.620
 see how it looks 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.120
 it's quite simple, nothing more with the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.490
 keys of our hand of direction we 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.380
 we move 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.630
 is a 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.420
 a labyrinth is exactly the same 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.200
 idea of the original game the difference is 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.670
 that here when we move from the screen 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.670
 move with our movements 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.250
 I'm playing 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.850
 but no 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.870
 now I have lost 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.019
 but nothing else I wanted then 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.780
 show them but do not like me 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.780
 Viktor I say goodbye until later
