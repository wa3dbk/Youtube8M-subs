so we can have duplicate at the same
time<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.770> we<00:04:22.950> can<00:04:23.100> just<00:04:23.250> switch<00:04:23.340> between<00:04:23.640> them

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
time and we can just switch between them

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.530 
time and we can just switch between them
