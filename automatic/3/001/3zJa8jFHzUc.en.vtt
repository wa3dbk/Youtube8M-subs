00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
negative to it we're still here

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.950 
negative to it we're still here
few<00:00:50.789> people<00:00:51.000> sometimes<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.539> think<00:00:51.570> there's

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
few people sometimes to think there's

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
few people sometimes to think there's
something<00:00:52.350> wrong<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:53.100> ABS<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.520> there

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
something wrong with ABS and there

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.500 
something wrong with ABS and there
really<00:00:54.000> isn't

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
really isn't

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.529 
really isn't
you<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.780> full<00:00:55.770> braking<00:00:56.100> only<00:00:57.090> difference<00:00:57.420> is

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
you have full braking only difference is

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.880 
you have full braking only difference is
you're<00:00:57.840> not<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> lock<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> tires

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
you're not going to lock up the tires

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.520 
you're not going to lock up the tires
which<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.760> really<00:01:00.059> good<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.270> panic<00:01:00.809> situations

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
which is really good on panic situations

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.670 
which is really good on panic situations
so<00:01:01.800> ABS<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> good<00:01:03.210> thing<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.750> bike<00:01:03.960> has<00:01:04.140> abs

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
so ABS is a good thing this bike has abs

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.770 
so ABS is a good thing this bike has abs
and<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> would<00:01:05.549> recommend<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.270> any<00:01:06.570> new

rotors<00:02:29.970> which<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.420> means<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.720> you've<00:02:30.930> got

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
rotors which just means that you've got

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.470 
rotors which just means that you've got
these<00:02:31.230> cuts<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.549> rotor<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.000> those<00:02:33.180> cuts

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
these cuts in the rotor so those cuts

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.080 
these cuts in the rotor so those cuts
the<00:02:33.810> holes<00:02:34.079> all<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.769> stuff<00:02:35.069> not<00:02:36.030> only

the holes all this stuff not only

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.210 
the holes all this stuff not only
reduces<00:02:36.780> some<00:02:36.930> weight<00:02:37.079> but<00:02:37.319> it<00:02:37.440> also<00:02:37.560> provides

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
reduces some weight but it also provides

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.660 
reduces some weight but it also provides

really easy clutch these have the new

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.970 
really easy clutch these have the new
clutch<00:03:21.780> from<00:03:22.080> FCC<00:03:22.819> FCC<00:03:23.819> is<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> company<00:03:24.450> that

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
clutch from FCC FCC is the company that

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.309 
clutch from FCC FCC is the company that
patented<00:03:25.980> or<00:03:26.099> designed<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.550> clutch<00:03:26.790> but<00:03:27.420> it

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
patented or designed the clutch but it

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.290 
patented or designed the clutch but it
only<00:03:28.860> has<00:03:29.099> three<00:03:29.370> clutch<00:03:29.580> springs<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.150> it's<00:03:30.239> a

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
only has three clutch springs and it's a

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.420 
only has three clutch springs and it's a
slipper<00:03:30.660> clutch<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.950> basically<00:03:32.250> has<00:03:32.400> a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
slipper clutch and so basically has a

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.090 
slipper clutch and so basically has a
cam<00:03:32.700> system<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:33.930> acceleration<00:03:34.799> it

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
cam system that on acceleration it

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.590 
cam system that on acceleration it
pushes<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.580> plates<00:03:35.819> together<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.450> don't

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
pushes the plates together so you don't

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.570 
pushes the plates together so you don't
need<00:03:36.690> as<00:03:36.810> many<00:03:36.930> Springs<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.069> clutch<00:03:38.310> pool

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
need as many Springs so this clutch pool

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.020 
need as many Springs so this clutch pool
is<00:03:38.730> very<00:03:39.019> very<00:03:40.019> light<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.650> extremely<00:03:41.489> light

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
is very very light and extremely light

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.930 
is very very light and extremely light
you'll<00:03:42.269> be<00:03:42.360> amazed<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.959> then<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.340> then<00:03:44.790> that

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
you'll be amazed and then and then that

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.520 
you'll be amazed and then and then that
same<00:03:45.150> cam<00:03:45.420> system<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:45.989> draws<00:03:46.170> two<00:03:46.319> pushes

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
same cam system that draws two pushes

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.800 
same cam system that draws two pushes
together<00:03:46.950> on<00:03:47.250> acceleration<00:03:47.910> makes<00:03:48.630> them

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
together on acceleration makes them

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.990 
together on acceleration makes them
spread<00:03:49.170> on<00:03:49.410> deceleration<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.340> give<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.819> a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
spread on deceleration to give you a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.390 
spread on deceleration to give you a
slipper<00:03:51.690> clutch<00:03:51.780> hard<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.799> sell<00:03:53.069> I<00:03:53.099> should
