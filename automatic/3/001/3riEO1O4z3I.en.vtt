00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.320
 everyone indeed starts at 0 in the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.420
 bene league a for ajax there is one 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.309
 away match against lierse sk on it 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.020
 program as the first competition 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.119
 but the question is whether that duel is 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.430
 continues with this weather and for my son 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.500
 at 100% sure because they have leeway 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.720
 the stadium 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.400
 field heating and then and no excuse 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.050
 not to play 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.430
 even though it's probably awful 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.470
 cold 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.239
 So you feel like starting again I 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.390
 if I want to get around 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.020
 start and the man no you can now 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.940
 down to that I wanted that 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.739
 so is a kind of liberation the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.140
 feeling to miss I have felt in it 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.719
 it in the team and well everyone is watching 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.520
 I'm really looking forward to it so no 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.960
 winter break are therefore definitely over 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.489
 for the ajax women it was 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.050
 Break does come to a heavy one 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.820
 first half year 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.620
 I think everyone is very calm and comfortable 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.430
 a real 5 enjoyed those two 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.710
 weeks 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.449
 yes without training actually and they 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.149
 enjoy being with family 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.580
 Christmas celebrate Christmas and New Year to 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.280
 again yes with trisha have to start with 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.630
 the new ali I say 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.270
 last week we had it tough 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.220
 yes we trained right steps 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.930
 towards new competitions 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.610
 the qualifying round was exciting though 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.600
 now the tension only increases then 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.280
 for the women 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.170
 you had to be one of the best four 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.180
 by continuing and 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.910
 yes now you have to do everything 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.080
 win and that is that is that is that is 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.080
 a different way of playing 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.330
 and yes I think we are now half a 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.850
 years later and we are already pretty 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.500
 We have made mistakes as a team 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.210
 made in the past of which we 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.000
 only to have been able to learn 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.130
 and I think that's what happened 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.710
 no I think we can play more freely 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.280
 and focused toward focused just 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.440
 upwards 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.260
 ajax has to deal in the competition 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.600
 with 4 unknown Belgian teams 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.950
 yes boredom of the plugs i know i 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.090
 'm not very well informed 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.430
 of teams in belgium but you 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.040
 believe that corpse indeed really the best 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.660
 team is a yes know some girls who 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.600
 have played Belgian in the Netherlands 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.100
 Players like you don't get the cooks 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.450
 flattened now at our opponent's 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.740
 Friday but no idea how 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.030
 realistically you to expect 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.030
 the team that they are champion 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.000
 yeah that's one that's pretty i think 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.730
 that it's not doors not realistic 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.690
 is when I look at a team our like 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.769
 Twente how much longer together a 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.200
 I hunt I consider my FC Twente 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.670
 perhaps more likely to have the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.620
 more to do with the origin in the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.269
 time to another side year wise 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.910
 we are just good and me too 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.590
 have complete faith in us alone 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.820
 again we shouldn't make those mistakes 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.470
 what we have in the first half 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.440
 it was made if we remain 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.989
 keep doing then yes then make them are 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.160
 we do that ourselves very hard 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.200
 not 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.709
 then maybe we can do something beautiful 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.709
 put down
