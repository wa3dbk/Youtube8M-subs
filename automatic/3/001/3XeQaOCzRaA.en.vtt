00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.680
 ok bye all guys well found in 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.140
 this new of today we are here on a ye 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.099
 I bring you the epc yes but struggle of the race 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.750
 beta against a Japanese who unfortunately 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.340
 I don't know what it's called 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.900
 if anyone knows what it's called medical 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.000
 as they are called otherwise it will be called 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.590
 a Japanese race in the beta category 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.149
 the beta category of the beta race 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.980
 master category is now I already have you 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.780
 explained everything we did also 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.370
 struggles online for those who haven't seen it 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.130
 frappe box some part for 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.110
 the three cases where as usual and as you can 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.930
 to note is a rather strange struggle 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.440
 because I have my few 4 monclers 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.640
 chi dragon knight kanga and roto while 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.710
 he she at 4 finger 44 finger indeed in 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.800
 this race there was no species excluded 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.600
 use what you wanted that 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.610
 this is precisely the epic nature of this 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.820
 struggle was a very tough fight 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.939
 guys because we say I couldn't 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.770
 use the fundamental strategy in 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.859
 which my team consists of and then in 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.569
 output something quite intriguing 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:16.340
 a good fight a good fight 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:20.159
 I liked it and then we start immediately 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.829
 ok had four then said mine 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.060
 choice is not that it could be difficult 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.490
 on what he had to wait for me 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.740
 in front therefore having no problems of 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.840
 pokémon that I could find myself in front of 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.600
 all chosen to start with kletzky e 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.749
 change pokémon than of with seated and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.359
 use always he sends to this one 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.869
 right a right that they transform the 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.189
 my kletzky and a finger without a double that 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.520
 probably had transformation into 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.619
 this way he could just copy the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.999
 my evolution may have been 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.520
 his own choice 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:55.799
 a team with four said then starts 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.749
 immediately to be quite competitive 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.270
 if not competitive at all why not 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:02.490
 I immediately point out because not 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.709
 I wanted to let him transform 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.200
 in my mega va safeguard and 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:10.410
 I also use safeguard in this 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.020
 so he immediately protected me from his own from 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.880
 bully from the bully on clerc i kang and that 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.880
 however, despite my increase 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.870
 attack with confusion could 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.480
 to be quite boring therefore he 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.720
 now he replaces his finger without 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.840
 lookalike and retract this saying 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.760
 instead it possesses the ability to double me 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.860
 I make the reflection because the only one 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.230
 pokémon he had in his team 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.060
 my dog could be offensive e 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.020
 so we are in a situation altogether 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.850
 speculate where if he had a pokémon 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.680
 I had it too and vice versa 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.850
 so we both reflect makes me 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.470
 point blank on khan gun and unfortunately me it 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.930
 I can take it I have to take it 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.260
 because we are not ways of blocking him and him 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.810
 start copying mine now 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.820
 offensive ie using my bully 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.760
 strategy ie use bully on his 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.000
 hot and increases his attack that 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.580
 protected from which it is protected by 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.190
 safeguard does not confuse it and therefore me 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.090
 makes a double zbig attack I use 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:22.340
 bully use bully on my kang also 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.050
 he, however, avoids secular pro and use 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.150
 return the decision to use the 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.270
 return against his kanga who does it 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.460
 a lot of ko sends this first saying 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.920
 watch out for the boys because now I 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.780
 I commented, but there is one 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.550
 particularity it seems to me now not 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.970
 let's see why he puts his own back into play 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.370
 ugly finger without money without knowing if it is 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.340
 so I go quietly 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.320
 of bully because I had calculated that 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.270
 he had finished edict with double because 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.000
 I think it has two consortia and two without 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.520
 therefore I go quietly with bully and 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.950
 I go back to full force for 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.340
 get out of the way as easily i 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.620
 his few so I will suffice for the return 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.020
 I also send this other finger off without it 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.920
 double ends the samb due safeguard 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.540
 sides and now sends another one a4 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.270
 therefore having said that they told me 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.810
 only that he also had this double 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.090
 boys and finger finger with double have 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.389
 a peculiarity that they succeed in 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.819
 copy pokémon 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.349
 the pokémon as well as copying them completely 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:30.159
 also copy the changes of the 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:34.580
 statistics and so now he had a 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:37.490
 tanga one finger kanga mega kanga a più 4 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.999
 which is practically almost infeasible since 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.349
 my team 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:43.729
 therefore I am going to safeguard so much for 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.909
 do something 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.379
 and here it seems to me I don't remember that 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:51.169
 what I do is true I can't do anything 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:54.020
 because it made me flinch from the day 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.240
 in which replaced dog has seasoned and 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.860
 referral back into the field 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.300
 change with all these said sto 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.699
 saying of anywhere 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.240
 now expecting a return on rotor 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:07.490
 I protect him he makes vadi 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.409
 had so much to do something he had 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.789
 half clef who has to do the job that 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.680
 clash who then if among the 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.599
 screens makes you back on the bottom like 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.210
 I waited and nothing 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.860
 I'm going to point-blank range on his kanga 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.490
 it was the only thing I could do for 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.120
 at least partially block his 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.360
 change 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.939
 initially nice word game I have 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:36.110
 done 3 4 riina guys i could do the 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:38.629
 rapper i'm ok let's go hydro pump on 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.000
 his singing and anyway protected by that 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.830
 however protected by what it was called 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.050
 to the light screen so it doesn't 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.710
 very much now I need to deal with the attack 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.110
 on kanga I could not avoid it and now me 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.139
 I find him kapò unfortunately I go 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:58.129
 again of hydro pomp and its pokémon 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:00.020
 his transformed finger avoids the negro 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:03.139
 pump and now they were in a situation 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.729
 fabullo is really critical on rotor 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.129
 because now he couldn't do anything 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.719
 obviously to the attack so much for he knew 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:11.000
 that I was predicted by safeguard though 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:13.639
 could not do anything using me 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.830
 return a nasty blow on dragons 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:20.419
 then dragonetti low to hit for 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:22.490
 go head and I go nothing like this 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:25.099
 with roll and I go to hydro pump 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.399
 fortunately I manage to send it to me 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:30.439
 his candia boss and then the fight in 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:33.019
 practice is over guys because he has 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:35.060
 finished in it had as many as four is said 

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:36.330
 his kletzky remained just that though a 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.849
 long going would be 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.159
 then touches then decides to retire is 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.900
 it really was a beautiful fight anymore 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:44.849
 that beautiful was very strange 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.949
 because I never happened to play 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:49.379
 against such a team obviously in 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:52.349
 we can't half normal game 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:54.599
 face people with these four little ones 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.280
 because why there is the speeches klose 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:58.199
 therefore the double pokemon cannot be 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.900
 keep team while in this race 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.939
 beta was more or less granted altogether 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.669
 a little to see the fantasy of the players 

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:07.680
 which we say this in a sense 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.270
 it has had a lot but I liked it 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.610
 how he managed to make homework is 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.460
 succeeded in making this competitive 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.659
 team with four companies ie knew and 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.240
 play good because normally 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:20.370
 one would have gone more directly 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.289
 offensive and most likely 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.909
 would have made a much worse result 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:26.250
 it was this so congratulations to mine 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:29.699
 opponent we will call Japanese 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:32.069
 because I don't know what it's called and therefore 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:34.139
 guys thanks for the visualization I'm in 

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:36.270
 selecting still beautiful fights of the 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:37.919
 beta race so we'll see them soon 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.719
 we feel on the facebook page 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.719
 in the davis bar books hello everybody
