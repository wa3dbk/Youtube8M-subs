to remove DeLorean on these motors it's
very<00:00:10.769> simple<00:00:11.160> I'm<00:00:11.250> just<00:00:11.309> going<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.610> do<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.730> this

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
very simple I'm just going to do it this

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.660 
very simple I'm just going to do it this
way<00:00:12.349> you<00:00:13.349> got<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.559> four<00:00:13.769> bolts<00:00:14.070> then<00:00:14.400> hold<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
way you got the four bolts then hold the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.400 
way you got the four bolts then hold the
car<00:00:14.849> keys<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:17.480> you<00:00:18.480> take<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.750> four<00:00:19.050> bolts<00:00:19.170> out

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
car keys on you take the four bolts out

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.590 
car keys on you take the four bolts out
drop<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.039> down<00:00:20.189> then<00:00:20.670> remove<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.029> two<00:00:21.150> two

off quite simple
then<00:00:25.740> you'd<00:00:25.859> remove<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.460> bolts<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:26.880> hold

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
then you'd remove the bolts that hold

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.310 
then you'd remove the bolts that hold

motor from the 60s here this impeller

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.569 
motor from the 60s here this impeller
and<00:00:59.030> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> bell<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.579> it's

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and you can see this a bell here it's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.640 
and you can see this a bell here it's
still<00:01:02.789> pliable<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.660> there's<00:01:03.809> no<00:01:03.960> cracks<00:01:04.409> in

it<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:07.049> wouldn't<00:01:07.229> be

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
it that I can see so there wouldn't be

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.260 
it that I can see so there wouldn't be

the new ones that they sell will be a

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.600 
the new ones that they sell will be a
six<00:01:22.390> vane<00:01:22.890> trying<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:23.950> get<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.130> older<00:01:24.400> ones

the six bit of the ten vanes they work a

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.500 
the six bit of the ten vanes they work a
lot<00:01:27.370> better<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.220> in<00:01:30.400> order<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.670> reinstall<00:01:31.300> the

impeller there's a drive pin on the
drive<00:01:34.060> shaft<00:01:36.030> take<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.180> impeller<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.720> slide

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
drive shaft take the impeller you slide

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:46.999 
drive shaft take the impeller you slide
it<00:01:38.230> down<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.560> drive<00:01:38.770> shaft

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.700 

my<00:01:47.490> pen<00:01:47.729> moved

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.420 

until<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.370> impeller<00:01:52.640> locks<00:01:52.940> down<00:01:53.180> on<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.540> pin

until the impeller locks down on the pin

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.560 
until the impeller locks down on the pin
then<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.670> would<00:01:55.760> take<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.120> housing<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:59.390> one

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
then you would take the housing this one

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.660 
then you would take the housing this one
