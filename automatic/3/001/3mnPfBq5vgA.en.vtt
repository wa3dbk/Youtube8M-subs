00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.990
 sustainable construction by transforming 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.130
 home rejects 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.549
 [Music] 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.080
 the steel industry not only surgery but several 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.170
 other national industries we will 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.000
 focus then surgery problem is for 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.369
 each ton of steel produced is 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.800
 produced as many tons of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.779
 waste that only solid waste 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.650
 liquid effluents as a function of the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.040
 process 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.840
 one of our visits but surgery 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.550
 discovering this material in the passive 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.040
 environment that did not have 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.140
 destination we proposed to the company 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.520
 brought the material to university 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.950
 brought the cefet so that we could 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.750
 so it's to see what we can 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.610
 make this project with this material 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.899
 emerged with the manufacture of concrete 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.640
 recycled 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.460
 we had several materials ranges 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.280
 metrix sand pebble gravel and knots 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.170
 we started producing concrete says 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.910
 Thus, the demand for 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.010
 company we started to manufacture gas 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.589
 we manufacture floors for the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 paving these very blocks that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.760
 are blocks that have properties 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.220
 very mechanical and it's cool are blocks 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.409
 which are used for consumption 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 concrete block buildings and board is 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.970
 consisting of raw material equivalent to 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.810
 water and destinations in the case of 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.549
 raw material that some cases people 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.490
 used the steel slag 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.560
 she comes in a bucket truck a cement 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.310
 in 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.770
 in silos is more serious 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.350
 there the raw material is judged not 12 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.340
 pain is an equipment that underneath has a 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.039
 balance 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.619
 there the material is heavy and cement is 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.729
 heavy separately send to a 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.159
 rapist 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.090
 In this mixer he mixed matter 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.270
 press the old cement and water 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.479
 after the appropriate drive point 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.350
 this mass is transferred to a 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:05.330
 vibrating machine which is a press 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.090
 then the material is folded the compacted leaves 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.510
 of the machine goes to the healing camera 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.380
 are around 48 hours turn 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.599
 again are palletized after the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.980
 blocks go to the patio and soon in 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.110
 followed by charging 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.260
 forklifts are loaded with 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.510
 trucks for the consulting companies 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.940
 an end supplier we can say 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.310
 that both physical and 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.870
 mechanical and even the quantity 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.150
 they are similar to the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.519
 conventional concretes were performed 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.680
 uniformity compression tests 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:46.160
 more specific absorption liability 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.109
 and all you people is is to meet the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.269
 requirements the idea of ​​this technology 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.459
 society and meet growing demand 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.310
 that there is a holy spirit basically 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.500
 in the municipality of the mountain where it is located 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.569
 to steelmakers and st that ceded material 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.579
 that the studies do not exist a demand 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.370
 housing our project 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.500
 in the sense of producing not only 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.299
 housing but also the whole 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.040
 infrastructure for these condominiums 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.170
 homes or neighborhoods 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.720
 from the point of view of the 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.209
 urban equipments asphalts half wires 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.160
 sidewalks nor the dwellings themselves. 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.569
 said the own infrastructure 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.040
 of sanitation 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.630
 the idea of this project arose with the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.430
 need to recycle waste 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.250
 solids generated by surgery 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.300
 so with this we make blocks 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.820
 what do you consume 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.580
 there are 12 kilograms of waste material 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.440
 generated and applying these blocks in the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.430
 manufacture of residential houses 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.790
 social 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.520
 on average, every social dwelling consumes and 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.920
 60 tons of slag that the generation 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.690
 of a sawmill the blocks 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.310
 built with the steel slag they 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.890
 as constituent materials to people 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.080
 can say that the price weight would be 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.700
 only growth because school 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.430
 Comes to the community for people to enjoy 0 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.780
 already conventional products is beyond 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.690
 cement price 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.110
 you have the price of the natural aggregates 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.970
 are used that I will eat it all 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.010
 this work that is developed today 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.049
 with the choice within cefet is a 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.209
 public domain work 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.400
 so until a public work cefet 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.570
 while a public institution works 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.390
 for the public good 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.490
 then all results except some 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.350
 patents and the industrial process that are 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.960
 all results 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.790
 reapplication application can be 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.669
 found on own page 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.000
 cefet travel mug with middle support 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.550
 with business support and this 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.560
 all this all the results that we 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.320
 we have pointed to this solution I 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.180
 I think we can do it on 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.460
 using this residue 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.680
 steel industry by reducing the impact 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.110
 provisions the conditions areas of the 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.990
 contamination of groundwater 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:04.150
 even from the periphery itself where 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.150
 were the steelmakers in Brazil 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:30.550
