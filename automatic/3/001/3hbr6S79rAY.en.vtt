00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.509
 in the previous lessons we learned the first is fundamental 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.650
 exercise 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.409
 % to understand how to perform weight shifting 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:22.940
 by a finger 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.509
 has another 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.189
 events this fundamental exercise exercise of fundamental importance 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.390
 as already stated so many times precisely for 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.550
 if to start ars develop the correct one 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.110
 piano technique we say that it constitutes the very foundations 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.090
 of the piano technique and therefore for this reason I insist a lot 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.750
 atac and this exercise may be repeated 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.860
 as much hotel as possible 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.670
 and with a certain consistency it is also an important center that 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.680
 this exercise is done correctly without it 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.550
 mistakes 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.560
 now of course the main problem with this is how brilliant they are 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.350
 structure these video lessons 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.900
 given by the fact that but I can't see how it is 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.300
 you 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.630
 let's say you do this exercise 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.350
 and therefore I am not able to see 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.009
 if it's 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:28.850
 you do it 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.280
 correctly placed there are some telline of the errors we say 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.859
 that should eventually be corrected in a way just to carry it 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.000
 run in the best possible world 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.799
 exactly for this reason 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.840
 I wanted to dedicate an entire collection to today's lesson 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.539
 iron 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:50.890
 listed 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.229
 those who are 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.570
 rt of let's say the 9 main errors the main renewals defects 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.670
 which people do tend to have people and 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.979
 in the moment in which they begin precisely a 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.989
 so playing the piano they start this business right 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.830
 in this way vercellio listing ebay tv making you understand 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:25.120
 what are these 9 potential errors that maybe you too 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.249
 not all evils some of these 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.249
 your 100 miles. 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.239
 you can have 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.709
 here I want to help you so that you can critically 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.029
 evaluate how you do this 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.339
 exercise 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:47.179
 eventually recognize see heree you are saying in one of these 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:51.259
 for these errors that I love you too much. to list 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:56.169
 and c'est let's say if one of these errors is part of yours too 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.549
 therefore of your approach or in your technical approach 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:05.929
 so now I have you in this way I really want to suggest you all these 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:08.739
 schiaroli e 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.449
 I will also suggest you 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:16.739
 how to edit just these mistakes in such a way that you in 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.069
 moment in which 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.640
 you recognize i'm 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.389
 1 December of these of these defects 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.709
 saie also like 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.730
 This was the flaw in correcting this 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.329
 and therefore knowing how to correct it is very likely that you then later 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.959
 I do not do it anymore 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.459
 so in this way, thanks to this lesson, we will succeed 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:49.669
 audi are just the problem that I can't control how I do 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.819
 wool lang these exercises 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:00.239
 and but a. it will be you that knowing those who are the principal no viaroli 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.150
 you 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.599
 % correct yourself and in this way you will see that 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.289
 you will be able to improve more and more 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.289
 your approach to piano technique 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:17.799
 let's start right away with the very first mistake the absolute error plus com
