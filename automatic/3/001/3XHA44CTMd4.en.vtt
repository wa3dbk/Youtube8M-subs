and<00:03:39.760> then<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:39.970> next<00:03:40.000> thing<00:03:40.330> that<00:03:40.480> we're<00:03:40.750> going

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
and then the next thing that we're going

to do is fold in the egg whites and

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.680 
to do is fold in the egg whites and
we're<00:03:44.379> almost<00:03:44.530> there<00:03:44.769> so<00:03:45.400> low<00:03:46.300> you<00:03:46.360> think

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
we're almost there so low you think

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.100 
we're almost there so low you think
souffles<00:03:47.200> are<00:03:47.410> quite<00:03:47.620> complex<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.459> difficult

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
souffles are quite complex and difficult

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.369 
souffles are quite complex and difficult
they're<00:03:50.110> surprisingly<00:03:50.709> easily<00:03:51.250> easy<00:03:51.550> to<00:03:51.879> do

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
they're surprisingly easily easy to do

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.710

we<00:04:24.820> need<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.090> try<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.479> retain<00:04:25.780> as<00:04:26.020> much<00:04:26.050> air<00:04:26.500> as

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
we need to try and retain as much air as

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.969 
we need to try and retain as much air as

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:18.749 
just place a souffle onto a baking tray

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:23.260 
just place a souffle onto a baking tray
and<00:05:19.729> I've<00:05:20.729> already<00:05:20.909> preheated<00:05:21.509> the<00:05:21.960> oven<00:05:22.110> to

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
and I've already preheated the oven to

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.739 
and I've already preheated the oven to
gas<00:05:24.270> mark<00:05:24.599> 5<00:05:24.990> or<00:05:25.729> 190<00:05:27.199> degrees<00:05:28.199> centigrade

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:29.749 
gas mark 5 or 190 degrees centigrade

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:33.439 
gas mark 5 or 190 degrees centigrade
push<00:05:30.749> that<00:05:30.960> in<00:05:31.139> there<00:05:31.879> and<00:05:32.879> that<00:05:33.029> needed<00:05:33.360> to

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
push that in there and that needed to

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.260 
push that in there and that needed to
cook<00:05:33.659> for<00:05:33.900> about<00:05:33.960> 35<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:34.830> 40<00:05:35.490> minutes<00:05:35.520> until

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
cook for about 35 to 40 minutes until

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.790 
cook for about 35 to 40 minutes until
well<00:05:36.539> risen<00:05:37.639> okay<00:05:38.639> so<00:05:38.699> this<00:05:38.969> is<00:05:39.150> had<00:05:39.800> 35

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
well risen okay so this is had 35

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.049 
well risen okay so this is had 35
minutes<00:05:41.249> in<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.580> oven<00:05:41.699> so<00:05:42.169> you<00:05:43.169> can<00:05:43.499> see

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:44.059 
minutes in the oven so you can see

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:48.709 
minutes in the oven so you can see
should<00:05:45.059> be<00:05:45.210> golden<00:05:45.449> brown<00:05:46.879> well<00:05:47.879> risen<00:05:48.210> and

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
should be golden brown well risen and

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:52.040 
should be golden brown well risen and
just<00:05:49.969> springy<00:05:50.969> to<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.330> touch<00:05:51.449> so<00:05:51.659> it's

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
just springy to the touch so it's

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.980 
just springy to the touch so it's
bouncing<00:05:52.589> back<00:05:52.830> when<00:05:53.399> I<00:05:53.550> touch<00:05:53.789> it<00:05:53.990> laughing
