00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
and for some reason like I just always

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.990 
and for some reason like I just always
go<00:01:34.439> back<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.830> one<00:01:35.010> it<00:01:35.250> may<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.670> because

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
go back to this one it may be because

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.060 
go back to this one it may be because
it's<00:01:36.330> only<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.689> dollar<00:01:37.140> or<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.890> could<00:01:38.040> be

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
it's only a dollar or it could be

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.350 
it's only a dollar or it could be
because<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.640> actually<00:01:38.760> really<00:01:39.210> good

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
because it's actually really good

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.270 
because it's actually really good
quality<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.290> these<00:01:40.680> are<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.950> ones<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.189> i

with the voluminous mascara it's just

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.700 
with the voluminous mascara it's just
that<00:03:34.490> with<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.180> certain<00:03:35.540> mascara<00:03:36.020> my

that with that certain mascara my

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.860 
that with that certain mascara my
eyelashes<00:03:37.610> stick<00:03:37.910> out<00:03:38.030> straight<00:03:38.600> because

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
eyelashes stick out straight because

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.440 
eyelashes stick out straight because
it's<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:39.500> thick<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.100> it's<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:40.550> clumping<00:03:41.330> you

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
it's so thick and it's so clumping you

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.000 
it's so thick and it's so clumping you
know<00:03:41.570> but<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:41.780> like<00:03:42.050> it<00:03:42.080> when<00:03:42.380> it's<00:03:42.500> like<00:03:42.680> clumpy

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
know but I like it when it's like clumpy

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.980 
know but I like it when it's like clumpy
I<00:03:43.040> just<00:03:43.250> don't<00:03:43.460> like<00:03:43.550> it<00:03:43.730> when<00:03:43.820> my<00:03:43.990> eyelashes

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.430 
I just don't like it when my eyelashes
go<00:03:45.140> straight<00:03:45.470> but<00:03:45.740> I<00:03:45.980> saw<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.910> picture<00:03:46.940> i<00:03:47.840> think

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440

it<00:03:48.530> was<00:03:48.560> Allison<00:03:49.190> loves<00:03:49.400> JP<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.210> think<00:03:50.450> she

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
it was Allison loves JP and I think she

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.300

someone<00:03:52.610> else<00:03:52.820> i'm<00:03:52.970> not<00:03:53.090> too<00:03:53.240> sure<00:03:53.270> but<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.080> is

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
someone else i'm not too sure but it is

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.650 
someone else i'm not too sure but it is
