hi

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.570 
hi
I'm<00:00:40.449> Jeremy<00:00:40.900> Reed<00:00:41.199> this<00:00:42.070> is<00:00:42.129> my<00:00:42.339> backyard

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
I'm Jeremy Reed this is my backyard

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.340 
I'm Jeremy Reed this is my backyard
rollercoaster<00:00:43.360> that<00:00:43.600> I<00:00:43.629> designed<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.170> built

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
rollercoaster that I designed to built

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.009 
rollercoaster that I designed to built
myself<00:00:44.879> actually<00:00:45.879> it<00:00:46.180> turns<00:00:46.360> out<00:00:46.540> there's<00:00:46.780> not

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
myself actually it turns out there's not

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.340 
myself actually it turns out there's not
a<00:00:47.050> lot<00:00:47.350> of<00:00:47.379> available<00:00:48.280> data<00:00:48.489> on<00:00:49.350> rollercoaster

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
a lot of available data on rollercoaster

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.250 
a lot of available data on rollercoaster
design<00:00:50.680> so<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:52.420> really<00:00:52.690> took<00:00:52.930> a<00:00:52.989> lot<00:00:53.230> of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
design so it really took a lot of

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.680 
design so it really took a lot of
research<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.940> exactly<00:00:55.329> on<00:00:55.510> how

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
research not exactly on how

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.479 
research not exactly on how
rollercoasters<00:00:56.379> were<00:00:56.559> built<00:00:56.829> but<00:00:57.100> more<00:00:57.370> about

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
rollercoasters were built but more about

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.510 
rollercoasters were built but more about
you<00:00:58.420> know<00:00:58.539> just<00:00:58.840> just<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.530> engineering<00:00:59.949> about

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
you know just just the engineering about

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.029 
you know just just the engineering about
what's<00:01:00.730> going<00:01:01.059> on<00:01:01.350> well<00:01:02.350> I'd<00:01:02.500> always<00:01:02.649> had<00:01:03.010> a

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
what's going on well I'd always had a

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.160 
what's going on well I'd always had a
great<00:01:03.309> interest<00:01:03.640> in<00:01:03.820> roller<00:01:04.269> coasters<00:01:04.780> and

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
great interest in roller coasters and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.139 
great interest in roller coasters and
it's<00:01:05.890> about<00:01:06.039> the<00:01:06.190> time<00:01:06.220> that<00:01:06.550> I<00:01:06.610> had<00:01:06.759> taken<00:01:06.880> a

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
it's about the time that I had taken a

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.060 
it's about the time that I had taken a
few<00:01:07.360> college<00:01:07.840> courses<00:01:08.350> specifically<00:01:09.039> a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
few college courses specifically a

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.249 
few college courses specifically a
physics<00:01:09.580> course<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.270> I<00:01:10.390> strengthened

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
physics course and I strengthened

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.889 
physics course and I strengthened
materials<00:01:11.770> course<00:01:12.160> and<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:13.149> realized<00:01:13.570> that

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
materials course and I realized that

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.450 
materials course and I realized that
this<00:01:14.229> is<00:01:14.320> something<00:01:14.440> I<00:01:14.800> could<00:01:14.979> actually<00:01:15.009> make

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
this is something I could actually make

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.660 
this is something I could actually make
on<00:01:15.700> my<00:01:15.729> own<00:01:15.970> using<00:01:16.390> lumber<00:01:17.399> well<00:01:18.399> one

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
on my own using lumber well one

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.800 
on my own using lumber well one
afternoon<00:01:19.000> when<00:01:19.330> Jeremy<00:01:19.840> was<00:01:20.020> about<00:01:21.810> probably

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
afternoon when Jeremy was about probably

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.469 
afternoon when Jeremy was about probably
18<00:01:23.380> or<00:01:23.619> 19<00:01:23.649> he<00:01:24.399> said<00:01:24.729> dad<00:01:25.030> what<00:01:25.240> would<00:01:25.360> you

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
18 or 19 he said dad what would you

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.240 
18 or 19 he said dad what would you
think<00:01:25.660> about<00:01:25.780> me<00:01:25.960> building<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.710> roller<00:01:27.160> coaster

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
think about me building a roller coaster

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.109 
think about me building a roller coaster
in<00:01:27.880> our<00:01:28.149> backyard<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:30.040> my<00:01:30.549> very<00:01:30.850> first

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
in our backyard and and my very first

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.170 
in our backyard and and my very first
response<00:01:31.600> was<00:01:31.869> have<00:01:32.380> at<00:01:32.619> it<00:01:32.770> Jeremy<00:01:33.280> Jeremy's

very first time I got in the coaster you

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.050 
very first time I got in the coaster you
know<00:01:48.399> I<00:01:48.790> was<00:01:49.149> quite<00:01:49.479> nervous<00:01:49.509> it's<00:01:50.320> it's<00:01:51.130> it's

checked<00:02:00.159> everything<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:01.329> it<00:02:01.659> was<00:02:01.750> quite<00:02:01.990> a

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
checked everything so it was quite a

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.800 
checked everything so it was quite a
thrill<00:02:02.640> even<00:02:03.640> though<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:03.850> know<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.630> write

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
thrill even though you know the write

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.030 
thrill even though you know the write
itself<00:02:05.200> shouldn't<00:02:05.740> have<00:02:05.890> been<00:02:06.009> that

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
itself shouldn't have been that

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.490 
itself shouldn't have been that
thrilling<00:02:06.610> but<00:02:06.790> just<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.869> fact<00:02:08.019> that<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.289> had

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
thrilling but just the fact that I had

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.380 
thrilling but just the fact that I had
put<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.860> thing<00:02:09.039> together<00:02:09.190> made<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:10.030> little

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
put the thing together made it a little

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:45.910 
put the thing together made it a little
bit<00:02:10.539> more<00:02:10.750> exciting
