00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:27.550
 Complexity of the organism by the power of the mammalian genome and the ability to obtain much genetic information 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:27.550
 Structure and function can be understood based on gene expression 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:40.480
 If you pass on mammalian organs and tissues such as the brain as a whole 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.480
 It is estimated that more than 25,000 genes are expressed 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.829
 This structure is very complicated and strongly connected with its function 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:01:06.080
 One-minute genes are expressed cell-specifically or region-specifically to control brain structure and function 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.080
 In order to know the expression distribution of genes in a three-dimensional space by geology 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:19.860
 We have a new gene expression mapping method 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.860
 Transcriptome tomography has been developed 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:30.090
 The experiment is performed using at least three samples 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.460
 By slicing a three specimens either chopped Pau three directions 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.640
 Make a leather 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:41.000
 Gene expression density of these culture Kyoto 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.000
 Measure in an exhaustive manner such as 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:52.380
 And reconfigure the remarks map from the gene density of Yunhe on a more three-dimensional space in the high-speed calculation 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:04.920
 Actually, RIKEN developed its own 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.920
 Created using a live structure microscope 3 d 6 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:16.070
 This technique combines the white snow and the surface image obtaining continuous analyte 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:21.220
 Collect all thin sections as a humanoid 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.220
 It is used to exhaustive measurement of gene expression density 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:35.200
 It is assumed that the image of the snow surface shows the actual anatomical position information 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.200
 Used when reconstructing a cartoon image 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:51.760
 For example, in the case of white snow in the horizontal method 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.760
 One more sample of Baus can be transformed in this way in one hour 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:05.000
 Snow white each sample in the orthogonal way 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:12.670
 Align three sample shapes in one three-dimensional space 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.670
 Use the reconstruction of expression data obtained by this image information comprehensive measurement 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:22.650
 In fact, first of all the expression density of each gene 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:28.400
 Enter to balk cell of the corresponding Cultural Revolution of the image information 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.400
 Three of the density information to one of the voxel is entered 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.970
 The statement map is made by averaging every three density information cells. 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.379
 To view the site with a strong remarks with a fashion tofu fill par 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:57.880
 The resulting three-dimensional remarks map on the web for collection the international standard Bejitaru atlas of copper 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:04:00.840
 Analyze together with various biological information including mri in wax- form space 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.840
 can do 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.450
 Within the method of measuring all genes 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:16.889
 Transcriptome tomography is 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:17.970
 resolution of xyz Te article performance smell compared to how july is to standardize ability to speak in equally 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:23.230
 Excellent 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:27.820
 The cost of measurement time is also much less 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:34.990
 Therefore, researchers set their own experimental conditions 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:37.560
 Create a map in a bola-like manner and compare them with each other in the same three-dimensional space 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.560
 It is possible 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:47.630
 In addition, using this information about human diseases 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.630
 We can advance research in model animals 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:59.800
 Transcriptome tomography is aura-like statement information 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:03.909
 Can be integrated into 3D space and left 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:07.330
 We have this method of preemptive drug discovery etc. 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:12.030
 Widely applied to the search for Huh target molecule 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.030
 We aim to be able to contribute to innovation
