00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
rewarding as working a sport you get

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.900 
rewarding as working a sport you get
emotions<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.459> get<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.670> experience

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
emotions and you get the experience

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.690 
emotions and you get the experience
things<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.570> passion<00:02:59.080> which<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.160> hard<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.610> find

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
things and passion which is hard to find

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.600 
things and passion which is hard to find
in<00:03:01.060> other<00:03:01.300> areas<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.230> reckon<00:03:02.610> Therese
