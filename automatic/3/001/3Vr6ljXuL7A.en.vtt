 for all welcome one more day says 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.540
 alexandra and today I bring you a 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.730
 Little do they already know that I am addicted to 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.450
 buy books so the truth is no longer 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.940
 I care that they buy many books and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.609
 people criticize me for that so I would 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.590
 I'm going to show the purchases that I made 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.390
 The first book I got this month was 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.430
 from javi by a jr tolkien this book is 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.650
 in Spanish since I feel like that the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.449
 language is going to be a little more natural of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.390
 read and my mother also wanted to read it 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.950
 so I picked it up in Spanish for both the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.480
 next topic that I have is to write network 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.710
 that this and this 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 if this one I think it was like German or something 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.390
 some of that other language and it was translated 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.699
 I like the plot for people have read it 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.980
 lately there have been several reviews of 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.309
 these books are tests that I took only 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.250

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.680

 asia if you want to measure the opportunity of 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.229
 catch this there is a second part that 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.020
 I think I also saw it in the mouth of pro no 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.630

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.479

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.640
 ecology expansion set in eggs 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.020
 this was a recommendation from my cousin 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.390
 who told me I had to read it because 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.920
 It was great and I told him ok and he 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.679
 listen very well to the plot so what 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.560
 I took it has two bad parts it has two 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.569
 parts another part has another part not 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.579
 I know if it's going to be third I'm not very 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.750

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.099
 story and I'll be reading it now 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.450
 for dystopian March so if the 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.920
 next book I took you I 'm also going 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.549
 to be reading for March dystopian 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.579
 choosing is the universe for once riffs 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.410
 I picked up this book in the bookshop and 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.140
 you know it was free or I came to a 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.519
 point where I take the books for free 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.110
 I was in the donation area and I saw it 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.750
 and I said that book is the one that I had the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.640
 another day not or this one of css is what 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.349
 confused because the door that had 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.599
 seen was super cute as well as with 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.459
 stars and rose the galaxy and I said oh 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.440
 wow is beautiful is the book but 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.230
 when I saw this I said that is not the same 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.630
 and what I want I know that it brings 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.110
 that if it's so I'm very happy I do not 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.570
 cost nothing and the next book that 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.870
 let 's see is a book that I wanted to 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.780
 I wanted and it's beastly of alex klein already by 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.760
 end I have faith and will be the cover of the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.610
 who spoke to them in the last video of 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.170
 rap from the hall that had not bought the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.240
 have always I wanted this that was the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.130
 I had the indie diary then 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.920
 Now it's mine and it's game with the 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.240
 rest of my covers 26 the following 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.220
 books that we tell them that I got them 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.640
 in looking for them they were there when I saw them 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.640
 it was with what 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:22.230
 and a pandemonium in hard pasta from the oven 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.090
 level you already know that our trilogy 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.879
 especially the jong language was my 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.299
 favorite book or is it then me too 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.980
 and when I saw it there I could not believe it they were 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.409
 599 because he has spent hours at 6 dollars 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.489
 for the book and in amazon was in 13 and 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.900
 15 17 with 39 for six dollars just for 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.340
 the line there for this easy line 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.560
 it costs without wages 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.420
 so if it was talk it's new and 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.879

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.450
 a lot the next book that I picked is 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:54.540
 Peter Pan by Jake Berry you know that I 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.220
 I read this book in a long time I did not read it 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.099
 I heard it in ario book in audiobook 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.079
 when I was with my group of friends from 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.840
 Colombia with the group wave and so 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.760
 we read stanzas of a long time and I 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.310
 I dressed like this all weird like Indian and so 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.910

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.230
 when I saw this cover 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.310
 It's beautiful, it 's like plating here in the 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.310
 sides you also want to draw 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.010

 they are the continuation of a book I read 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:11.869
 in January and the second class is the 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:14.719
 third part the perfect symmetry this 

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:16.339

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.689
 third part and I also bought the 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.279
 second but my sister already has it 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.839
 because I wanted to read it and I could not wait 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.849
 so he took it and he has it and 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.469

 those two books also the last two 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.489
 books that I bought are 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.020
 divergent insurgent 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.190
 because I took it when it came out then 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.330
 they needed the first two we know that 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.950
 now that it's going to be the movie I wanted 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.200
 reread the book I still do not know if I want it 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.160
 reread before or after the movie 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.390
 but I want to read them and I bought them in 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.150
 hard paste we buy nothing else I do not 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.940
 they liked 19 dollars were the boxset of 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.470
 both 19 dollars or gave pear trees for 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.260

 in case you want to go look at them because 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.670
 I recommend them if you have not read them 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.610
 they have to read them before the 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.770
