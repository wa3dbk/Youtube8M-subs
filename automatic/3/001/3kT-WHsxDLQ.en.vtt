00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.840
 we 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.260
 second world war 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.540
 favorite topic of domestic developers 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.970
 and trace and countless 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.250
 historical materials are you creating by 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.070
 clumps of model engineering combat plans 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.820
 operations two of the limit to collect with 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.670
 event description developers best 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.210
 case do not forget to pay attention 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.190
 graphic part 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.079
 for the rest, with rare exception trouble 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.860
 standard practices 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.570
 errors problems with optimizing a lot 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.210
 companies are not always interested in a number and not 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.460
 always well thought out and original in 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.240
 rear of the enemy to the roots cut down formed 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.090
 stereotype 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.670
 offer vadim unique eyes of all 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.720
 sides an attractive tactical masterpiece 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 national strategies then the enemy has 2 foxes 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.880
 desert to it's pretty good 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.700
 addition in which unfortunately not so 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.920
 many missions as the players would like 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.490
 but physics has changed a lot 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.499
 the booklet games my look is very comfortable and 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.749
 work interface compared to 

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:25.450
 past parts to the enemy's rear 

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.130
 our graphics were like mechanics 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.560
 significantly different from having 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.329
 supplement or with thick 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.490
 in this add-on cheat patches you 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.259
 somewhere in Africa of course across the desert in 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.109
 looking for masters to run for them but 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.299
 developers promise from hot days and 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:42.009
 nights 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.229
 drive go there is also good and not 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.659
 let's forget about the legendary mode 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.399
 direct control through which 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.060
 the game looks different 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.130
 as if you are sitting and playing battles from 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.279
 third person 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.529
 I personally have been behind enemy lines for 2 days 

00:01:56.279 --> 00:02:03.030
 like as I do not understand until the end 

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:06.810
 game mechanics but not punch and technology 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.500
 There are other additions two fraga brothers 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.979
 in arms 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.069
 there is also used mechanics pierce 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.160
 from just the second part therefore in the game have 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.770
 we have two choices to either play for 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.830
 allies for is played disc company 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.680
 haber different level of difficulty for 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.440
 ally is represented only 4 ve ceza 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.850
 bask in someone like the mixture 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.970
 companies to distinguish the world think them 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.540
 it is a German company very much 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.540
 suitable for players who are 5 5 to 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.900
 more shootings give more tank 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.209
 techniques and more bomber 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.140
 intently quieter and cif which 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.630
 what to be able to 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.110
 quiet and topical poet of the brain problem of 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:56.040
 tom as for the title of iv of the enemy and give 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.450
 weapons that is ahead of the enemy 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.330
 whole few steps 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.400
 in all series behind enemy lines 2 will introduce 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.530
 already updated game engine 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.799
 but that's practically no different from 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.950
 previous additions behind enemy lines 2 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.170
 developers don't forget about networking 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.329
 mode drink mode can hit 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.290
 these slides and there already have to think 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:21.060
 and think through every step very carefully 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.100
 All in the mode of the glasses are fighting which you 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.769
 get for the kill no destruction 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.840
 enemy unit maximum quantity 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.859
 players that can play need Sisi 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.230
 these are 16 people 16 brave fighters 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.540
 who can fight you 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.480
 network mode presented pretty 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.660
 a lot of technology which is behind enemy lines 2 and 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.310
 more interesting maps I want to add that 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.019
 if you do not have a license behind enemy lines 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.530
 then you have to play 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.110
 either through additional programs or 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.140
 through the stone 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.140
 but if you have a license 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.540
 versions of the game then going into the menu and 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.880
 choosing razil internet you can lead 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.860
 your given 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.800
 I mean the whole theme of your key and 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.320
 then he will open the whole world and players but 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.200
 for those who do not have a license there and 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.060
 I invite you to the server working that he 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.790
 hangs you how to play through the date 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.680
 program you can just write in 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.690
 comments your skype or threw off 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.220
