00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.530
 hello and welcome here or 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.090
 little buddy I present today 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.550
 at dead space 3 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:23.380
 My favorite women throw them the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.520
 june 2009 little darling I'll show you 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.560
 here's the little difference 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.520
 between normal weapons like that 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.039
 most benefit and my favorite weapon 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.680
 here first the normal weapon one 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:58.949
 Thanks a little in the meantime that I am theirs 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:01:02.829
 could use video material for it well 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.780
 When many come, you have to do a lot 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.100
 aim to shoot 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.020
 I have something with my weapon 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.990
 made easier and you can see that now 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.579
 joh 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.579
 as you see same place same 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:19.740
 Scenario with the same features only 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.740
 Somewhat headless transmitter city 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.920
 so i would be about the same 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:37.340
 time as the cutout 100 server cat 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.180
 actually only all gone is nice and funny 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.510
 now why and if you now 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.290
 Oh, think of little creatures and is 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.190
 that's a thing 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.260
 Well then a second comparison yet 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.490
 with a video of our cat 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.570
 I hope you do not know me for it 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.750
 that I took two pieces from her 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.100
 have 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.550
 as he always eat here now 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.550
 boss fight 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.989
 as you see the weapon is what yes 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:43.970
 also very effective 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:48.049
 but well it takes nice and beautiful 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:52.040
 gameplay like that and we jump that too 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.810
 same time to me again about course 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.500
 with my weapon of course I still have 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.700
 a second schmankerl and said you 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.120
 sees it in my boxing match then 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:08.840
 currently out of that, of course that is 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.340
 small toys and bran nue of course 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.440
 This cattle are also very fast sour 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.780
 and also slightly faster the weapon 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.160
 In this situation I still believe 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:25.190
 am not quite 180 to 200 shot 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.489
 I certainly but the weapon itself 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.250
 at this time already with 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.540
 something to the robot at least 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.569
 further interesting 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.970
 the fir is also flattened a bit faster 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.579
 but we can also to you because the 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.769
 version that the guys are massive 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.440
 almost the same weapon blood something different 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.049
 update has even 200 shots and had 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.430
 a super stone effect so that almost 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.739
 every opponent we have just seen 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.030
 So again for you 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.090
 as I said the shots are actually 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.750
 the same bleus stop adversary 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.480
 done and captain on his 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.830
 of course I should say to the dirt 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.930
 sit because it will not happen again 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.360
 you see, i do not use any street 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.080
 which one presses but simply one 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.330
 weapon in the morning as you can see I have there 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.549
 that opponent just as fast away and 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.829
 not even close to the bosses 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.540
 to get me right ran 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.940
 such a pity for the opponent but nice for 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.090
 i was interested in that foreign 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.840
 miserable of the enemy 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.030
 I'd say why can gladly times to 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.730
 give your opinions what he was from there 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.580
 Obsolete is just as cool as me 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.190
 or if he says needed for better 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:45.470
 I know a lot about your shotgun 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.169
 but at least it does not matter here 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.510
 again a small test on the 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.010
 difficulty impossible who that 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.010
 swords know that's these weapons 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.090
 arena where you can get his big out of the 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.750
 I can say here again 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.600
 princes and my normal weapon shoot 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.890
 with quite normal weapon the clubs not 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:10.100
 The only way to do it is to save the opponent 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.720
 formally low and round stand and how 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.240
 said we play impossible and you 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.570
 See, that's the question for whom 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.910
 impossible for me or for the opponent 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.740
 I would say for the opponent then 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.510
 we go, here are the weapon we 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.640
 I've got extra for this 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:30.260
 Video made again for the second time 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.490
 and this time with the function that you 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:37.700
 the opponent location is funny because 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.080
 You can not see any opponent of the year 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.430
 the sharp is synonymous without the functions 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.919
 not directly to me but never mind 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.070
 rented away and completely flat rolled 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.780
 and now we're going in 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.880
 This game play to another in minutes 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.270
 to get it 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:59.129
 a third round of course with once 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:04.020
 because of our weapons sections 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:09.569
 here you see off the ear two 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:11.519
 but do not survive as you see here 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.719
 I see that happens wrong buttons 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:15.119
 I really only want to change weapons 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:17.489
 do it and that happens then 

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:21.119
 if you have the weapon too close to yourself then 

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:23.249
 towering high then one is with it 

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:24.899
 I actually wanted to be in that 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:27.119
 next example, the nuk function 

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:27.569
 show so speak out almost yourself 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:29.279
 the race 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.309
 unfortunately it did not jan arena 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.360
 actually works a pity 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:35.089
 at least that's what it looks like when you look at yourself 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.919
 himself stood 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:40.080
 until then I wish one more time 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:42.619
 Have a nice day and write your comments 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.800
 one of my weapon down into the box 

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:45.800
 little buddy
