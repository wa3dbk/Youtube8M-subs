00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:11.820
 yes, good day dear and dearer youtube 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.799
 audience last word he offers this 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.450
 I'll forget about it for a while 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.050
 how many coins so now I have to 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.130
 to walk because of course I have 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.840
 again nothing noticed and can 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.060
 not cool before this call 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.630
 Well, this is how it sells this time 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.010
 last word for 23 coins but should 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 No, thank you, I do not want any now 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.890
 party you should buy this weapon 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.630
 or not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.950
 The thing is open and as I have 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.520
 this last word is relatively long 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.910
 played 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.010
 I could also upgrade that again and 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.230
 It is a very good weapon 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.070
 I'll be in roses today too 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.530
 I use them 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.460
 In any case, this evening of the animal 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.450
 recording with me 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.770
 I will definitely take them with me 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.860
 the thing is always there when I enter 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.420
 pvp so I'll just start 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.910
 first the thing shoots fully automatically 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.320
 what advantages and disadvantages has so 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.180
 recoil reservists not without 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.559
 and if you do not control them 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.239
 then you can do the fully automatic 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.979
 forget mode anyway but directly 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.049
 will be able to control with misawa for 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.150
 So, who cares 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.799
 This was a pity for you to control 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.390
 is in the advantage 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.979
 I'll tell you what kind of bothering 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.479
 Meets help and aggressive ballistics 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.670
 I personally use the aggressive 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.369
 ballistics before this weapon additional 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.960
 Precision when firing from the hip can 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.189
 you always use but use 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.830
 I honestly do not 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.420
 I really celebrate a lot of pvp then 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.340
 Here the RÃ¼ckersdorfer extremely low 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.990
 because the luxury has already not without 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.020
 really without the thing here he is 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.400
 really horrible high then we have 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.140
 last word bonus harm and more 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.369
 stability is the precision damage 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.290
 when celebrating from the hip 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.299
 that is when you actually go out 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.159
 the hip with the thing here in the head 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.409
 you make over 110 already 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.299
 In general, one can say that harm sometimes 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.320
 really have this week 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.729
 even if you ran 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.520
 then we have the last four 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.719
 damage upgrades we come to the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.860
 sketch fire rate is just looks low 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.899
 but that high by that the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.450
 Fully automatic impact is often 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.149
 just great reach the thing 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.530
 really is not a sniper but that 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.429
 The range is ok 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.780
 if you are 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.150
 you can tolerate a bit too 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.709
 Stability meets at long distances 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.719
 is thus relatively high 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.640
 otherwise it is relatively low 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.569
 loading is normal so you will not 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.310
 especially ultra-fast 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.750
 News magazine is only 8 and 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.700
 Magazines also go away relatively quickly 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.920
 you should get that thing right now 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.989
 now sell so I would say to 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.269
 In any case, it really buys you 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.170
 in any case the thing is the absolute 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.760
 Madness in the pvp and in the pvp and mpv he 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.719
 I do not know who maybe should 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.980
 I can not look no I can not 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.750
 really the thing buys you if you 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.150
 pvp plays that you can always 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.669
 use the last word and I want 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.260
 Just say until the next video 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:03:04.080
 home one 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:04.080
