00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello new girls and twins what 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.279
 it would be a comparison between the ipad mini 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.859
 2 and the ipad 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.540
 nails I will give you some advice if 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.010
 some have thought to take one of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.090
 these two remote that are the most 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.559
 affordable there are right now in the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 market and the ipad 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.480
 there are two is not worth it so I 'm going 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.029
 to tell a little bit what the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.310
 opinion on these two products since 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.510
 both carry the same inside so 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.490
 well let's see if I'm going to do the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.220
 three more so you can see a little and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.800
 I'll go with both posts both the ipad 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.540
 is what we have on the right and the ipad 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.430
 mini two of that is not left both 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.020
 they bring screen retina I said that the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.120
 specifications are absolutely 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.440
 same let's see if the size of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.219
 screen influences at the time of 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.500
 performance 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.149
 we are passing a test that is the antón 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.520
 tour in the slow 5 point 2.0 both of 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.540
 they go with the same although in the video there 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.390
 it can be appreciated 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.960
 and we see the ipad mini 2 more clearly by 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.060
 the lighting rise but the two 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.010
 have the same quality we have finished the 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.070
 and to know when to buy almost the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.450
 same score 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.350
 there we have the ipad mini 2 with 35,000 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.910
 258 and the ipad ice with 36 1978 that is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.290
 basically they have the same score 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.770
 there is not much difference between ones and 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.140
 others both have the chipset to 7 of 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.150
 apple both have a camera 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.740
 12 megapixel front and one rear 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.750
 of 5 megapixels both record at 720 and 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.430
 there and basically, basically, it's the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.990
 same specifications among others 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.729
 leave the specifications in the box 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.800
 description if someone wants to see them 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.230
 more carefully 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.170
 what will be the decision we make 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.020
 now choose one or the other obviously the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.730
 the ipad there so I would recommend it to all 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.570
 that you are going to use it in a multimedia way 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.540
 videos watch movies play more 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.659
 multimedia and such the ipad mini os what 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.460
 I recommend more to people who 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.960
 to the people that you are going to be able to much what 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.140
 that is to elevate around you need that 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.430
 occupy little space and basically the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.979
 people that doors eject in a way 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.580
 multimedia but is more oriented then 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.959
 to mobility is worth both tablets 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.940
 of apple are heaven very well as 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.690
 you know the ipad are going very well they give very 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.850
 few problems 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.610
 and I do not recommend at all to ipad air 2 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.470
 because basically he has chivas 7 but 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.390
 I forgot it is a little four 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.790
 little things more than we do not have to change 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.470
 now tell us one of the two is also going 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.090
 to be the price since one that the ipad 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.520
 aníbal in one hundred euros more than the ipad 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.200
 mini is worth us both also have the 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.490
 retina screen 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.750
 now let's put some game so that 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.820
 see their operation at the same time play 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.620
 try it with some toy to some 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.750
 graphic news and you will see your 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.850
 performance basically 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.090
 and here we have the gesture on the ipad mini 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.090
 two 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.550
 so you can see what goes perfectly 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.970
 Without any problem, focus them 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.970
 the camera 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.270
 as you can see it does not give any kind of 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.550
 super fluid problems super good 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.550
 would be the overrun from there 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.590
 and there you have it perfectly 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.270
 that is to play games like 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.310
 gesture of whatever is not going to give any 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.730
 type of problem 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.620
 on the ipad air we are testing the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.080
 tablet you download and this is mine 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.340
 ok we are rolling the new magic that 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.340
 it's completely free 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.390
 could be 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.390
 Guided Worlds of the Multiverse 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.299
 you see that it goes completely well 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.959
 also until castellar or some game very 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.650
 I recommend that you can 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.510
 go down if you want 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.160
 but you can see nothing either type of 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.590
 problem of playing 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.530
 that goes without any of the works 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.390
 perfectly and does not give any kind of 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.980
 problem since they are a great tablet and the 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.920
 true that I have had the samsung 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.810
 galaxy tab and such and sincerely deserves 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.360
 it's worth investing in an ipad because it's going 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.950
 very very fluid and it goes very well and the 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.560
 price does not quite resemble the 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.450
 samsung tablets the back of the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.430
 ipad mini 2 as you can see is 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.320
 completely equal to the back 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.870
 of the ipad from the back 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.040
 it does not make any difference anymore 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.040
 that one bigger than another 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.990
 the ipad mini has a resolution by 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.690
 inch of 326 pixels per inch 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.580
 instead the and pagai has 264 this is 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.360
 due to the change and screen size 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.580
 so it will find itself better 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.160
 visual so to say not in the mini ipad 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.890
 2 which is the biggest difference we're going to 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.800
 find between the two the pair that and the 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.810
 screen size honestly like 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.790
 I said the lesson is in what we 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.460
 you want to spend and in the size that 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.380
 you want to choose 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.460
 and little more than talking about this tablet 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.889
 I hope that you have served 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.990
 comparative in case one had doubts already 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.870
 that was one of my questions at the time 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.789
 of acquiring an ipad and not knowing which one 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.990
 is very lost and I hope that this 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.810
 is the information that I got 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.580
 sonsacar has helped you so much 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.470
 good guys do not forget to jump like 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.060
 favorites and see you soon by the way 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.830
 be attentive to twitter because you 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.840
 ask what you want next 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.840
 video chau chau chau shot
