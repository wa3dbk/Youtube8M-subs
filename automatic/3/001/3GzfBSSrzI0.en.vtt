00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello good evening apparently many 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:08.300
 users who updated their price 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:12.580
 version 6.61 and is so laid the 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.930
 I proceed alone I 2.3 realized that 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.939
 I automatically stop reading your 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.839
 post loader that is to delay the 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:24.199
 playstation 12 as its games are called 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:26.449
 of play 1 so here I am going to leave the 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.179
 already modified version that no more many 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.999
 pages were responsible for uploading the post 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.070
 loader but without loading the files 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.140
 that it is necessary between him me 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.180
 occupies those that start 81 megabytes that are 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:44.430
 each sprint word from 3.02 to 660 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.110
 so the description is let's common 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.170
 I want more pass the file of their 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.430
 plug-in folders and envelope write the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.460
 text 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.840
 pops point text and it was enough that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.840
 I leave you a test of how it works 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.360
 a minute like this I have it checked 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.970
 since this event will affect the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.530
 trigger r 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:14.750
 a detail when you want to put 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:19.540
 an example I have a 4.0.1 I want it 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.540
 put from newly level 2 in the 352 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.159
 and automatically the psp 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.100
 sends me for the churro is not to say that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.500
 it is impossible to start it 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.260
 why because maybe this game was 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.060
 taken in another framework above that 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.950
 not the 3 and not the 4 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.260
 that's why he detected it perfectly in 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.940
 the 4 instead of 3 then you 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.400
 wrong and want to put a game that 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.869
 came out for firmware 4 and they want it and 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.330
 moral with a firmware 3 is not going to 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.750
 work for nothing so it equals 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.909
 example in money I had it down to 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.100
 3.52 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:04.450
 sorry for my resolution we 're going to 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.450
 put in 4.1 in the 4.0 a post 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.420
 put air back automatically to 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.430
 being first will react the different 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.050
 way so everything they have 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.560
 problems with your playstation games 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:23.120
 1 well is solved be the version 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.989
 proceed m3 2.3 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.989

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.959
