00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.500
 how to walk for a very long time here 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.519
 about the fields he sees behind me 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.900
 and I thought I'll show you now 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.849
 times my stroller at the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.180
 opportunity 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:20.580
 I'll turn you around and that's it 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.560
 our stroller part one quasi me 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.820
 will someday be again 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.609
 another tower also need to show 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.230
 So we have the baby with krimis 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.870
 drifting tower or like oneself 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:40.530
 that's what it's called from here 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.030
 and from here, there is simply 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.260
 yet another essay to which one 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.520
 then use if the children 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.050
 a little older and you need it 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.120
 logically not yet 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.160
 I show you first so you can see whether 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.579
 first of all the basic frame we have three 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.579
 bikes 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.539
 I was asking a lot if I'm not scared 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.219
 I have because of the stability is 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.789
 actually no problem at all 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.440
 opinion 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.610
 it 's actually pretty awesome 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.950
 they are pneumatic tires 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.580
 pumped up really nice and then fell 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.130
 Accordingly, then quite well then 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.650
 there is our brake is just something 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.650
 dirty from the field but does not matter 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.290
 if you step down then he stands 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.650
 really rock hard and then we have 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.110
 then the little basket and that's it 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.420
 in principle already from rod the part 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.630
 Here is for the jogger later 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.400
 actually only interesting is now 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.640
 that's what bothers you, you can do that too 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.880
 do not turn off then what else 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.590
 worth mentioning is the house has 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:51.000
 the adapters where the maxi cosi 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:55.590
 fits and here 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.930
 you can handle the length of the handle 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.610
 set how far should the look 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.470
 or not to make it nice and pleasant 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.000
 and if you fold the 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.940
 I want to show it again later 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.700
 car then you just press here dares 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.560
 when the two clamps are open 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.770
 and then you can already do that together 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.650
 So the shell looks like this 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.820
 have as a little window can 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.350
 to do it too but I have it 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.500
 Mostly we have a bit open there 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.660
 can watch a big spacious 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.810
 interior we have then schaffeld 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:40.670
 drinliegen far as one can recognize the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:45.239
 so that it was nice from below you can 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.580
 So if you want to make it down from 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.280
 The rod must be on both sides 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:57.709
 then you can press these buttons 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:03:02.850
 because talk down and if you are here 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.260
 pushes or other side i believe there 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.760
 you have to be on both sides at the same time 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.680
 press I can do this now not so 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.019
 good but you can also the dings 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.019
 a little further back took max appreciated 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.209
 the cliq because now has the tick 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.390
 heard and then it goes completely 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.650
 to drive down 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:32.310
 yes the weather is here with 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.840
 snaps fastened to the sides and 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.390
 then has here again 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.950
 it was kept to it and is too 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.269
 nicely lined from the inside and the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.010
 we still have such a blanket 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.950
 So that she will not get much in there 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:49.470
 fast again 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:52.580
 that shows up just so we first pack 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.580
 even a small car 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.850
 he comes in his maxi cosi so that looks 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.860
 By the way, from the inside we have here 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.740
 a lambskin and the number of such a book 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.780
 over it spits 40 or runs out 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:19.150
 or so it is not equal to the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.150
 sheepskin is ok who looks in there already 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:26.200
 there you can just hook the carabiner 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:30.010
 and there had to be a short break 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.700
 that is quite simply appreciated 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.120
 squeeze and down a bit 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.120
 to lift 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.410
 then you press on the buttons can 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.410
 just fold that in 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.910
 we have big trunk space therefore 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.479
 the effort is making the big one together 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.450
 close 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.979
 and if you work it all together 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:07.340
 you want to make the things pushes on 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:08.979
 as pure as possible pushes there you 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.550
 because 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.550
 and then it goes together 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.389
 and what is interesting for you 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.460
 all with not as big trunk as 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.850
 our 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:28.919
 you did not see that you can 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:32.110
 make tires off others press side 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:35.979
 Just press it and then 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.030
 it goes off and then you also with 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.160
 small trunk not so a problem 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.039
 had in front of the car here in small polo 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.570
 and he was paying attention 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.570
 That was our stroller
