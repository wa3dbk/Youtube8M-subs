 continuing as they may already have to 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.920
 corner studies 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.009
 this is why to update the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.619

 1.5 point 2 and I as updated or 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.679
 I remembered that I ran out of corners ladies 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:26.959
 map and without billboard we will not return 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:30.229
 everything but point because to arrive here this 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:34.550
 door turn to the left comes through this 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:37.280
 always around here too 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.770
 this video in two parts because I already 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.810
 I recorded from showing the sneakers 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.800
 layoffs because the field will show 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.810
 within dispensations and this part I am 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.170
 recording now because it has not started yet 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.700
 the game and we'll show you how it is 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.479
 a deck where the grave site is and another 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.539
 part 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.560
 first because it is difficult to stay here and 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:06.190
 things do not dispense because 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.220
 You know how the pc is to take care of Hebrew. 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.500
 then in stratum 1 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.370
 then after teams the author once 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.690
 corner 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.390
 You tell others why. 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.010
 after all not 11 forward and 3 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.379
 towns 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.610
 in check after we let it here 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.700
 down 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.099
 I 'm going to show the rest nuno video 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.689
 who had already recorded 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.829
 I will leave here also those formed for 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.360
 you 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.239
 while to get the match may 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.040
 living the team site is bad what it is 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:46.400
 faster for you 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:53.470
 then the coordinates are less - 1441 and 61 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:57.129
 ez - 803 then I dropped the rest here 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.129
 no recorded video 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.400
 So you know, you fall into the hole. 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.620
 then click on it and dismiss it 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.470
 inside the dispensary has two words of 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.180
 Iron Full Armor 2 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.099
 diamond that can already make some blades 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:23.180
 via the blanket of 2 mÃµes was enough 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:26.480
 food and think it's only then as 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.209
 You can see I'd say she's the hottie 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.480
 luminous stone the luminous block what 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.430
 puts part is that once the block and to go there 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.760
 and in this case I did not know when 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.949
 I recorded this and walked away from it. 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.099
 soon to think it was more thought than 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:51.769
 was the most populous country but dear 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:54.889
 not a first panel that already can 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:59.060
 do also a sword day keep and 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:02.030
 after doing this they earn below that 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:06.709
 take a few more layoffs to show the 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:10.370
 What's inside is that I've already found 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:32.500
 this trip but it was much easier 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:32.500
 as you can see from the dispensation 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.840
 the rest does not matter 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.020
 and on the other side in the same place has the 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.020
 same thing 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.640
 that's why they find four blocks 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.950
 magnet is that the author found four 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:56.000
 swords of iron a diamond sword 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.580
 can make and gets an iron so 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.940
 best thing you can not want this one here 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:08.660
 is the best place to play on this map is 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.810
 the best place to go but how do you know 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.660
 Are you going to say some people already know? 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.060
 other people danced so they could 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.880
 try to always teach 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:25.130
 If you do not want to risk, you can do it. 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:27.830
 neutral tip and stay and stay there in my 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.560
 hidden until the end and then 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.400
 try to kill a person was the car is 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:38.080
 it's all about strategy and the whole 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.610
 You'll get as close win 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.910
 so I hope you have enjoyed it more 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.830
 a tip here blue sweetness 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.630
 if they did not forget they would leave 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:53.240
 I like sharing this video by teaching them 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:56.110
 Favorites subscribe to the channel and 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.110
