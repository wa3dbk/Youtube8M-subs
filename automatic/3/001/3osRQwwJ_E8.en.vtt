00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
cycle so basically it's going to take

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.569 
cycle so basically it's going to take
the<00:03:00.840> developers<00:03:01.620> three<00:03:02.010> years<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.459> actually

make the game instead of the usual to

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.550 
make the game instead of the usual to
now<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.609> means<00:03:06.139> because<00:03:07.139> we<00:03:07.260> get<00:03:07.379> in<00:03:07.470> the
