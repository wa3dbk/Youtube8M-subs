nevertheless whenever you're working
with<00:00:43.980> solvents<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> good<00:00:44.700> idea<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.030> have

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
with solvents it's a good idea to have

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.529 
with solvents it's a good idea to have
some<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> nice<00:00:46.289> thick<00:00:46.500> rubber<00:00:46.710> gloves<00:00:47.039> on

carbo<00:00:48.539> lift<00:00:48.719> says<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> good<00:00:49.379> rule<00:00:49.530> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
carbo lift says that is a good rule of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.490 
carbo lift says that is a good rule of
thumb<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.250> should<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.300> least<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
thumb you should have at least the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.459 
thumb you should have at least the
thickness<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.510> what<00:00:54.510> you're<00:00:54.629> taking<00:00:54.840> off<00:00:55.140> in

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
thickness of what you're taking off in

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.639 
thickness of what you're taking off in
carbo<00:00:56.280> lift<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.020> if<00:00:58.020> you're<00:00:58.170> working<00:00:58.320> through

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
carbo lift so if you're working through

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.290 
carbo lift so if you're working through
two<00:00:58.920> millimeters<00:00:59.430> worth<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.850> paint<00:01:00.120> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
two millimeters worth of paint you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.970 
two millimeters worth of paint you
should<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> two<00:01:00.930> millimeter<00:01:01.230> layer<00:01:01.620> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
should have a two millimeter layer of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.670 
should have a two millimeter layer of
cargo<00:01:02.399> that's<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.789> there<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.210> think<00:01:04.080> typically

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
cargo that's on there I think typically

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.810 
cargo that's on there I think typically
things<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> little<00:01:05.400> thinner<00:01:05.729> than

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
things will be a little thinner than

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.080 
things will be a little thinner than
that<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:07.470> directions<00:01:07.890> also<00:01:08.130> instruct<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
that the directions also instruct you to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.780 
that the directions also instruct you to
put<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.840> coat<00:01:09.869> wait<00:01:10.799> about<00:01:10.950> 15<00:01:11.490> minutes

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
put on one coat wait about 15 minutes

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.510 
put on one coat wait about 15 minutes
and<00:01:11.970> then<00:01:12.380> put<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> second<00:01:13.950> coat<00:01:14.159> before

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and then put on a second coat before

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.109 
and then put on a second coat before
proceeding<00:01:16.400> okay<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.850> we've<00:01:17.970> got<00:01:18.090> our

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
proceeding okay now that we've got our

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.149 
proceeding okay now that we've got our
two<00:01:18.390> layers<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.229> we're<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> go

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
two layers on here we're going to go

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.370 
two layers on here we're going to go
ahead<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.820> wrap<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.659> some<00:01:22.259> more

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
ahead and just wrap it in some more

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.039 
ahead and just wrap it in some more
plastic<00:01:22.680> sheeting<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.210> seal<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.720> carbo

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
plastic sheeting just to seal the carbo

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.620 
plastic sheeting just to seal the carbo
lift<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.590> while<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.920> does<00:01:26.100> its<00:01:26.250> work

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
lift in there while it does its work

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
lift in there while it does its work
because<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.869> particular<00:01:28.650> bar<00:01:28.860> only<00:01:29.100> has<00:01:29.369> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
because this particular bar only has a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.550 
because this particular bar only has a
very<00:01:29.820> thin<00:01:30.180> layer<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.689> clear<00:01:30.900> coat<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.439> then

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
very thin layer of clear coat and then

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.130 
very thin layer of clear coat and then
some<00:01:31.770> pretty<00:01:32.009> thin<00:01:32.280> logos<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.970> think<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> hour

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
some pretty thin logos I think the hour

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.330 
some pretty thin logos I think the hour
that<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.530> been<00:01:34.710> here<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.250> be

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that it's been here is going to be

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.460 
that it's been here is going to be
enough<00:01:35.549> time<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.090> most<00:01:36.780> parts<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> probably

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
enough time for most parts you probably

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.649 
enough time for most parts you probably
want<00:01:37.650> some<00:01:37.829> more<00:01:38.040> time<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.240> carbo

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
want some more time just like carbo

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.679 
want some more time just like carbo
lifts<00:01:39.840> recommends<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.210> even<00:01:42.450> see
