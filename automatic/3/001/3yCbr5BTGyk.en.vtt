00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.210
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.700
 another test video to that sony hdr cx 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.650
 320 e I am on my 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.530
 terrace in the foreground you can see now 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.289
 my dog â€‹â€‹with his teddy we play 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.300
 sense or tests that will be in this video 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.850
 the fusion I am now behind 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.230
 the camera if sound problems 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.670
 the man should not be fine 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.010
 I can understand, I hope you understand 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.390
 me as I said I'm right behind 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.460
 the camera and I'll just go now 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.460
 humming the chimney 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.170
 so now we have the optical zoom 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.310
 fully extended so that's 30 now 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.650
 fold optical zoom 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.130
 So you can do the chimney very well 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.850
 if you recognize the first one now 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.340
 compared to Sony HDR cx2 120i takes 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.830
 you have to say that it is today 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.380
 right as you can see is a bright day 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.500
 a lot of sunlight during the other test video 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.890
 the sony hdr cx2 20e has it unfortunately 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.479
 snowed and it was slightly gray as 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.619
 Now we have a nice one really 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.030
 I would say nice picture 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.710
 razor sharp you can even lazy 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.660
 first pigeons in the background again 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 fly 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.610
 you look like the deaf ones behind it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.040
 fly or birds a few sc still in the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.220
 foreground and yes very nicely focused 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.660
 the chimney is at the maximum 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.430
 I would just slow down again 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.619
 unfortunately not quite back 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.200
 Shake-free although I use tripod 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.860
 movies you dog otherwise wiemann game 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.710
 pull down there and just go again 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.860
 go on running again what 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.930
 in the meantime, a really big step 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.400
 nice picture at least on the monitor 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.170
 what I can see here 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.380
 Let's go back a bit 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.210
 every time I go to the chamber 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.580
 Of course, touch is a small blur 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.000
 in there we are the pack can be 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.709
 of course not avoid despite the deep 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.360
 because you only have the song directly over that 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.610
 can handle housing so you have 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.260
 again this will be fixed as well as at 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.360
 the precursors or the other sony 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.440
 Models you also from the last 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.120
 year knows so on we can 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.720
 with the optical zoom not so sum 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.780
 Again we look at my dog 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.760
 in front and watching us here 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.600
 and thinks what is this that is the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:42.020
 a shit yes now again maximum 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.840
 speed call at the end 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.220
 stops the camera a bit 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.590
 nevertheless I would say a very very 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.990
 nice result 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.880
 30 times optical zoom very cool like 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.500
 I can recommend it very well 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.720
 Well that's it for this one 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.530
 video wants to see us next time 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.530
 later
