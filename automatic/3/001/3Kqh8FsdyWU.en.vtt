00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.849 
black circle inside it draw a line up
and<00:00:28.730> then<00:00:29.730> from<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.380> I'm<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.590> draw<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
and then from here I'm going to draw the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.340 
and then from here I'm going to draw the
nose<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.450> comes<00:00:36.750> up

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.979 

and<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:40.980> about<00:00:41.400> lined<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:42.060> with<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.450> down

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and then about lined up with this down

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.380 
and then about lined up with this down
here<00:00:43.410> I'm<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.190> draw<00:00:44.370> out<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.760> top<00:00:45.030> lip

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
here I'm going to draw out the top lip

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.799 
here I'm going to draw out the top lip
and<00:00:46.280> then<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.430> comes<00:00:47.730> back<00:00:48.150> up<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and then it comes back up here and the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.729 
and then it comes back up here and the
line<00:00:52.020> behind<00:00:52.290> it<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.290> down<00:00:55.500> here<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:57.739> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
line behind it and then down here is the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.910 
line behind it and then down here is the
chin<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.730> goes<00:00:59.970> in<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.440> goes<00:01:01.470> out<00:01:03.920> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
chin it goes in and then it goes out and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.600 
chin it goes in and then it goes out and
up<00:01:07.759> to<00:01:08.759> about<00:01:09.000> there<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.320> an<00:01:10.470> ear<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.430> go

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
up to about there and then an ear it go

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.540 
up to about there and then an ear it go
to<00:01:11.670> curves<00:01:12.030> up<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.660> point<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.289> then

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
to curves up to a point and then

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.440 
to curves up to a point and then
straight<00:01:14.550> down<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.800> then<00:01:16.800> from<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.450> there's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
straight down and then from here there's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.150 
straight down and then from here there's
the<00:01:18.690> back<00:01:18.899> of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.410> head

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
the back of the head

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.570 
the back of the head
so<00:01:23.160> from<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.630> draw<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:25.020> curved<00:01:25.710> line<00:01:26.550> that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
so from here draw a curved line that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.570 
so from here draw a curved line that
comes<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.539> swoops<00:01:28.350> down<00:01:28.500> across<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.340> top<00:01:29.550> of

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
comes and swoops down across the top of

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.740 
comes and swoops down across the top of
this<00:01:29.940> line<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.399> it<00:01:32.580> goes<00:01:32.789> up<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.390> stops

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
this line and then it goes up and stops

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.389 
this line and then it goes up and stops
right<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:35.420> then<00:01:36.420> from<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:37.399> drawn

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
right there and then from here drawn

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:45.230 
right there and then from here drawn
this<00:01:38.550> curves<00:01:39.300> up<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:41.479> out<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:44.400> back<00:01:44.909> like

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
this curves up and out and back like

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.110 
this curves up and out and back like
that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.630 

then<00:01:50.120> we'll<00:01:50.300> draw<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.480> top<00:01:50.900> of<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.200> Hat<00:01:51.770> it

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
then we'll draw the top of the Hat it

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:01.210 
then we'll draw the top of the Hat it
goes<00:01:52.910> up<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:55.070> over<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.950> down<00:01:59.650> and<00:02:00.650> this<00:02:00.890> goes

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
goes up and over and down and this goes

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.880 
goes up and over and down and this goes
down<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:02.200> that

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.380 

and<00:02:09.890> then<00:02:10.250> there's<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.789> ribbon<00:02:11.210> at<00:02:11.360> the
