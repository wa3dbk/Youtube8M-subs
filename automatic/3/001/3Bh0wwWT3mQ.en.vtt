00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.070
 the blue planet our home 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.259
 He is the foundation of human life 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.689
 and the worth protecting good that we 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.310
 have we must again long with city 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.350
 give nature to life 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.180
 the sustainable use of the 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.150
 resources available to us 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.050
 becomes more and more existential 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.050
 Sustainable action is essential 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.590
 as we had decided 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.930
 expanding was the energetic standard 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.120
 especially important for us in times 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.630
 rising energy costs should be there 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.489
 become a highly insulated passive house 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.550
 moreover, this should be in 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.020
 solid construction realized 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.520
 another aspect was the 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.920
 naturalness of the used 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.200
 resources in the combination of these 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.320
 points our architect gave us one 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.879
 interesting building material and presents it 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.620
 look like stones 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.870
 They are easily made of plastic and 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.750
 they consist mainly of wood, the 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.340
 This saves a building material of all positive 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.680
 characteristics of the ecology of 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.710
 energy efficiency and a simple one 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.380
 processing unites the company their 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.290
 spahn has different spaces with the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.750
 offer with different insulation values 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.130
 once it can be insulated 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.520
 insulation and as an ecological stone the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.710
 The company also offers wood fiber insulation 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.479
 Eizo save all variations of the wood 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.460
 Coat stones also as finished wall 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.549
 module in addition to the excellent 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.520
 the values a rational for above all 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.990
 Swift tree ensures wood chips 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.049
 stones have a lot of positive ones 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.039
 English they are very easy to 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.189
 to process 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.310
 The shell construction is much faster than 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.170
 In conventional brick building the insulation 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.479
 is protected from the beginning 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.759
 Interior work in the cold season 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.799
 is very easy because that 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.980
 building practically does not already become 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.010
 got to 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.230
 we have a very high stability 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.770
 we have a very good sound insulation 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:16.190
 and we have a balanced climate 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.980
 through the building material wood the 97 percent 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.960
 of wood accounts 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.150
 the uncomplicated to process 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.860
 individual elements are also perfect 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.050
 for construction projects in own performance 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.760
 suitable by simple cutting 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.410
 the stones can be cut into the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.180
 be brought desired shape 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.400
 This way you can also 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.120
 easy complicated floor plans 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.430
 the components are realized 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.290
 they are placed and aligned 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.250
 By filling with liquid concrete 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.580
 stabilized 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.410
 It is possible with this technology 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.750
 Construction project from a small family house 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.620
 up to large industrial buildings too 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.380
 realize 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.510
 my customers always ask me what is 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.520
 because with the many parts of wood with the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.310
 fire resistance there I can mine 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.320
 Customers calm down we have a fire 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:10.190
 Resistance of 1180 latest designation 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.780
 european name 380 that means 15 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.780
 hours fire again strong 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.970
 but especially in the area of 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.040
 low energy and passive house construction is 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.630
 so save the first choice 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.640
 through the integrated insulation 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.920
 ensure the wood coat stones 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.500
 a thermal bridge free construction of the 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.260
 cellar plate over the outer walls up 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.090
 to the attic itself to the window 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.010
 and door cutouts or pipe 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.560
 There is no need for further connections 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.870
 insulation as a transition to the house wall 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.360
 This not only saves valuable time 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.630
 but also the budget of 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.010
 builders most customers believe that 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.080
 a high efficiency house or a 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.180
 passive house is much more expensive than one 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.950
 become conventionally built there 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.120
 but not by choice of 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.130
 appropriate construction and the 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.950
 appropriate building material for example 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.960
 The insured wood coat are stone 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.210
 the additional costs relatively low and through 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.710
 the high energy prices I have in 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.710
 a few years the additional costs of 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.660
 used is the shell finished 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.750
 shows a further advantage of 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.799
 woodchip trade stones through the 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.360
 vapor-permeable coat stones is a 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.400
 fast drying of the turn 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.890
 guaranteed because of all this 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.020
 Properties are iso spahn buildings 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.480
 not only in shorter construction times too 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.340
 realize but also essential 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.530
 faster habitable than houses in 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.210
 conventional construction with the 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.210
 Completion of the house for us 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.430
 100 percent works right 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.750
 and in hindsight 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.880
 taking into account all aspects 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.390
 we can only say we have everything 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.200
 right you too, the right one 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.140
 decision 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.700
 so of course, save building more
