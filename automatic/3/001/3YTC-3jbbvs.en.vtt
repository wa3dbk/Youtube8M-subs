body<00:06:50.200> that's<00:06:50.530> fine<00:06:50.620> but<00:06:51.070> I<00:06:51.130> just<00:06:51.400> had<00:06:51.580> that

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
body that's fine but I just had that

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.650 
body that's fine but I just had that
line<00:06:52.000> around<00:06:52.360> so<00:06:52.600> I<00:06:52.660> decided<00:06:53.110> to<00:06:53.229> use<00:06:53.380> it

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.150
