00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
have that same power cuz he he'd

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.339 
have that same power cuz he he'd
obviously<00:02:15.329> have<00:02:15.659> to<00:02:15.719> probably<00:02:15.870> come<00:02:16.049> down<00:02:16.079> and

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
obviously have to probably come down and

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.910 
obviously have to probably come down and
fight<00:02:16.439> you<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.590> 140<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.489> would<00:02:17.609> assume<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.920> what
