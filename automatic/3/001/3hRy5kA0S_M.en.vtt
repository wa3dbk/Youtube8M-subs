again<00:06:19.659> we<00:06:19.990> got<00:06:20.139> to<00:06:20.229> see<00:06:20.409> how<00:06:20.619> Cain<00:06:20.919> and<00:06:21.219> the

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:21.279 
again we got to see how Cain and the

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:23.489 
again we got to see how Cain and the
Goshen<00:06:21.669> play<00:06:21.939> next<00:06:22.209> year<00:06:22.360> I<00:06:22.659> think<00:06:23.019> the<00:06:23.079> safer

00:06:23.489 --> 00:06:23.499 
Goshen play next year I think the safer

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:25.219 
Goshen play next year I think the safer
trade<00:06:23.740> is<00:06:23.860> for<00:06:23.979> the<00:06:24.039> Winnipeg<00:06:24.249> Jets<00:06:24.399> but<00:06:24.849> if

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
trade is for the Winnipeg Jets but if

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.419 
trade is for the Winnipeg Jets but if
Bogosian<00:06:26.229> it<00:06:26.349> again<00:06:26.589> at<00:06:26.769> Boghossian<00:06:27.159> ends<00:06:27.339> up

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:27.429 
Bogosian it again at Boghossian ends up

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:28.889 
Bogosian it again at Boghossian ends up
being<00:06:27.550> a<00:06:27.669> stud<00:06:27.879> defenseman<00:06:28.269> a<00:06:28.300> Cain<00:06:28.539> ends<00:06:28.779> up

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:28.899 
being a stud defenseman a Cain ends up

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:30.239 
being a stud defenseman a Cain ends up
laying<00:06:29.110> alongside<00:06:29.349> of<00:06:29.619> McDavid<00:06:30.009> or<00:06:30.099> ICO
