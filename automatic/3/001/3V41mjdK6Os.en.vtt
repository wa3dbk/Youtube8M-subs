this<00:00:51.090> new<00:00:51.329> system<00:00:51.570> they're<00:00:51.899> calling<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> 75

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
this new system they're calling the 75

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.650 
this new system they're calling the 75
which<00:00:53.789> uses<00:00:54.269> 75<00:00:54.960> mil<00:00:55.260> wide<00:00:55.530> filters<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.660> it'll

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
which uses 75 mil wide filters and it'll

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.689 
which uses 75 mil wide filters and it'll
let<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.839> put<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.679> a<00:00:58.710> whole<00:00:59.129> range<00:00:59.160> of

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
let you put it on to a whole range of

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
let you put it on to a whole range of
different<00:00:59.760> lenses<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.989> thread<00:01:01.379> on

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
different lenses that have a thread on

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.400 
different lenses that have a thread on
the<00:01:01.559> front<00:01:01.949> down<00:01:02.519> to<00:01:02.789> 37<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.629> half<00:01:03.839> mil<00:01:04.170> all

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
the front down to 37 and a half mil all

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.950 
the front down to 37 and a half mil all
the<00:01:04.559> way<00:01:04.679> up<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.000> 72<00:01:06.000> mil<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> think<00:01:06.539> it<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.660> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the way up to 72 mil I think it is to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.440 
the way up to 72 mil I think it is to
have<00:01:07.140> clearance<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.830> filter<00:01:08.220> holder<00:01:08.580> the

have clearance for the filter holder the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.820 
have clearance for the filter holder the
best<00:01:09.690> thing<00:01:09.899> about<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.409> you've<00:01:10.619> got<00:01:10.800> a

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
density is all of that sort of thing but

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.359 
density is all of that sort of thing but
really<00:01:18.569> great<00:01:18.810> news<00:01:19.050> it<00:01:19.440> also<00:01:19.710> allows<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.280> to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.350 
you can use a whole range of different
slide<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.770> filters<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.430> there<00:01:47.700> it'll<00:01:48.329> take

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
slide in filters in there it'll take

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.690 
slide in filters in there it'll take
more<00:01:48.930> than<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.320> filter<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> front<00:01:50.430> so

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
more than one filter in the front so

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.340 
more than one filter in the front so
gradual<00:01:51.149> neutral<00:01:51.539> densities<00:01:51.960> whatever<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
gradual neutral densities whatever you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.230 
gradual neutral densities whatever you
like<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.860> rotate<00:01:53.250> them<00:01:53.430> around<00:01:53.520> that's

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
like you can rotate them around that's

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.490 
like you can rotate them around that's
another<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> system

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
another one they have in the system

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980 
another one they have in the system
which<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.310> circular<00:01:56.850> polarizer<00:01:57.390> which<00:01:57.780> will

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
which is a circular polarizer which will

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.980 
which is a circular polarizer which will
fit<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.500> front<00:01:58.740> end<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.360> you<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.539> see<00:02:00.750> how

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
fit on the front end and you can see how

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.569 
fit on the front end and you can see how
it<00:02:01.110> comes<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.770> off<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.340> there's

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
it comes on and off and then there's

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.730 
it comes on and off and then there's
also<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.119> optional<00:02:03.630> enormous<00:02:04.170> hood<00:02:04.469> which

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
also this optional enormous hood which

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.880 
also this optional enormous hood which
makes<00:02:05.189> your<00:02:05.399> camera<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.090> look<00:02:06.350> crazy<00:02:07.350> you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
makes your camera just look crazy you

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.349 
makes your camera just look crazy you
know<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.250> looks<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.640> suddenly<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.060> shooting

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:09.359

bigger sizes just pare down in size and
price<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.020> check<00:02:45.350> them<00:02:45.470> out<00:02:45.560> those<00:02:45.970> once<00:02:46.970> these

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
price so check them out those once these

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.580 
price so check them out those once these
hit<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.480> market<00:02:47.870> which<00:02:47.990> I<00:02:48.080> think<00:02:48.290> won't<00:02:48.440> be

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
hit the market which I think won't be

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.140 
hit the market which I think won't be
too<00:02:48.770> long<00:02:48.800> I'll<00:02:49.160> be<00:02:49.190> doing<00:02:49.430> my<00:02:49.580> best<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:50.000> get

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
too long I'll be doing my best to get

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.360 
too long I'll be doing my best to get
ahold<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.450> one<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.720> these<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.530> test<00:02:51.860> out<00:02:52.070> on

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
ahold of one of these to test out on

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.210 
ahold of one of these to test out on
maybe<00:02:53.030> an<00:02:53.210> omd<00:02:53.660> or<00:02:53.870> something<00:02:54.260> once<00:02:54.860> I'm<00:02:55.070> back

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
maybe an omd or something once I'm back
