camera here which is really good for

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.550 
camera here which is really good for
something<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.720> want<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.959> do<00:03:19.080> every<00:03:19.410> day

something that you want to do every day

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.470 
something that you want to do every day
so<00:03:19.620> obviously<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.519> don't<00:03:20.670> have<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:21.030> use<00:03:21.180> all

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
so obviously you don't have to use all

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.080 
so obviously you don't have to use all
of<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.750> products<00:03:22.200> every<00:03:22.560> day<00:03:22.739> but<00:03:23.489> if<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.820> had

to<00:03:24.269> choose<00:03:24.510> one<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:25.110> would<00:03:25.350> be<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.739> daily

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
to choose one it would be the daily

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.729

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
growth lotion to use every day so I use
