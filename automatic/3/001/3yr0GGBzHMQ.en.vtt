00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
fits right in that seam we could go

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.329 
fits right in that seam we could go
lower<00:00:59.719> but<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.749> little<00:01:01.140> bit<00:01:01.319> any<00:01:01.559> lower<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
lower but a little bit any lower and

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.169 
lower but a little bit any lower and
really<00:01:02.519> you're<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.819> start<00:01:02.999> affecting

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
really you're going to start affecting

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:04.999 
really you're going to start affecting
the<00:01:03.510> its<00:01:03.899> ability<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.290> air<00:01:04.530> conditioned

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
the its ability to air conditioned

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.770 
the its ability to air conditioned
because<00:01:05.399> what<00:01:05.610> happens<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.689> you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
because what happens is is that if you

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.870 
because what happens is is that if you
put<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.470> hat<00:01:07.680> question<00:01:08.280> all<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:08.430> time<00:01:08.579> can

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
put this hat question all the time can

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.139 
put this hat question all the time can
we<00:01:08.939> put<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> ductless<00:01:09.479> down<00:01:09.659> yes<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:11.149> we're

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
we put a ductless down yes you can we're

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.609 
we put a ductless down yes you can we're
going<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.360> collect<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> disclaimer<00:01:13.200> which<00:01:13.439> we

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
going to collect a disclaimer which we

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.749 
going to collect a disclaimer which we
did<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:13.950> case<00:01:14.159> even<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.610> this

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
did in this case even for this

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.330 
did in this case even for this
application<00:01:15.590> but<00:01:16.590> if<00:01:16.649> you<00:01:16.740> put<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.009> any<00:01:17.130> lower

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
application but if you put it any lower

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.069 
application but if you put it any lower
what<00:01:17.610> happens<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.299> cold<00:01:18.600> air<00:01:18.869> gets

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
what happens is that cold air gets

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.560 
what happens is that cold air gets
sucked<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.890> then<00:01:20.640> blown<00:01:20.909> out<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.090> bottom

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
sucked in and then blown out the bottom

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.649 
sucked in and then blown out the bottom
and<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> system<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.820> over<00:01:23.820> cools<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.420> top

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and the system just it over cools on top

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.630 
and the system just it over cools on top
of<00:01:24.810> itself<00:01:25.110> being<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.920> cold<00:01:26.280> air<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.520> always

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
of itself being that cold air is always

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.010 
of itself being that cold air is always
going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> settle<00:01:27.149> towards<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> bottom<00:01:27.719> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
going to settle towards the bottom and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.990 
going to settle towards the bottom and
it<00:01:28.380> will<00:01:28.469> just<00:01:28.619> shut<00:01:28.890> off<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.729> won't<00:01:29.909> get

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
it will just shut off and you won't get

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.480 
it will just shut off and you won't get
any<00:01:30.060> cooling<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.649> case<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.219> aren't

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
any cooling so in this case we aren't

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.800 
any cooling so in this case we aren't
really<00:01:32.700> concerned<00:01:32.939> about<00:01:33.090> cooling<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.689> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
really concerned about cooling in this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.200 
really concerned about cooling in this
application<00:01:34.649> in<00:01:34.770> them<00:01:34.950> there's<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.030> gonna<00:01:36.149> be

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
application in them there's not gonna be

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.779 
application in them there's not gonna be
any<00:01:36.390> problems<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.710> room<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.219> this<00:01:38.549> height

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
any problems in this room at this height

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.149 
any problems in this room at this height
but<00:01:39.630> that's<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.170> reason<00:01:40.560> why<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.740> don't<00:01:40.950> put

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
but that's a reason why you don't put

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.060 
but that's a reason why you don't put
them<00:01:41.219> on<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> ground<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.850> well<00:01:42.770> but<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
them on the ground as well but this is a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.859 
them on the ground as well but this is a
12<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.640> dike<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.000> 12<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.539> dike<00:01:45.719> in

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
12 a dike in 12 is a dike in

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.889 
12 a dike in 12 is a dike in
multi-system<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.340> there's<00:01:47.609> that<00:01:47.789> one

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
multi-system and so there's that one

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.469 
multi-system and so there's that one
okay<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.049> I've<00:01:49.979> got<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:50.880> 50<00:01:51.180> degrees

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
okay and I've got it I was at 50 degrees

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.539 
okay and I've got it I was at 50 degrees
in<00:01:51.630> here<00:01:51.810> these<00:01:51.960> will<00:01:52.109> go<00:01:52.229> down<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.500> 50<00:01:52.829> at<00:01:53.009> set

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
in here these will go down to 50 at set

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.700 
in here these will go down to 50 at set
temperature<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:53.969> got<00:01:54.180> them<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.359> to<00:01:54.390> 70<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.049> so

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
temperature I got them up to 70 and so

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.039 
temperature I got them up to 70 and so
they're<00:01:55.920> all<00:01:56.039> on<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.689> you<00:01:57.689> know<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:57.960> about

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
they're all on and you know that's about

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.480 
they're all on and you know that's about
the<00:01:58.289> noise<00:01:58.500> there<00:02:00.530> okay<00:02:01.530> its<00:02:01.799> intelligence<00:02:02.369> is

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the noise there okay its intelligence is

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.999 
the noise there okay its intelligence is
ramping<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.909> up<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.149> little<00:02:03.270> bit<00:02:03.450> even<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:04.009> so

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
ramping it up a little bit even now so

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.510 
ramping it up a little bit even now so
I'll<00:02:05.070> take<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.399> over<00:02:05.429> to<00:02:05.609> that<00:02:05.759> actually

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.260 

okay<00:02:12.110> moving<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.940> upper

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
okay moving on this is the upper

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.690 
okay moving on this is the upper
apartment<00:02:15.840> up<00:02:16.020> here<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:19.459> there's<00:02:20.459> another

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
apartment up here and so there's another

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:29.350 
apartment up here and so there's another
12<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> wall<00:02:26.870> see<00:02:27.870> our<00:02:27.959> other<00:02:28.080> one

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
12 on the wall see our other one

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.979 
12 on the wall see our other one
beckoning<00:02:30.470> okay

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:42.910 

downstairs<00:02:38.739> down<00:02:39.739> here<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.189> have<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.700> 15<00:02:41.650> 15<00:02:42.650> 18

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
downstairs down here we have a 15 15 18

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.940 
downstairs down here we have a 15 15 18
and<00:02:43.040> 24<00:02:43.430> all<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.849> same<00:02:44.060> size<00:02:44.329> on<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.560> die

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
and 24 all the same size on the die

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.030 
and 24 all the same size on the die
Koons<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:48.610> here<00:02:49.610> we<00:02:49.730> have<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:51.560> one<00:02:51.620> there

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
Koons so here we have that one there

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.890 
Koons so here we have that one there
from<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.400> profile<00:02:52.879> standpoint<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:56.269> l-series

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
from a profile standpoint the l-series

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.199 
from a profile standpoint the l-series
head<00:02:57.409> which<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.340> larger<00:02:58.670> units<00:02:58.940> going<00:02:59.150> to

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
head which is the larger units going to

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.660 
head which is the larger units going to
have<00:02:59.329> a<00:02:59.359> flatter<00:02:59.720> here<00:03:00.709> it's<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:01.010> little<00:03:01.250> deeper

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
have a flatter here it's a little deeper

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.759 
have a flatter here it's a little deeper
as<00:03:01.849> you<00:03:02.150> can<00:03:02.390> see<00:03:02.540> from<00:03:02.780> when<00:03:03.109> you<00:03:03.200> saw<00:03:03.349> the<00:03:03.409> 12

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
as you can see from when you saw the 12

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.640 
as you can see from when you saw the 12
earlier<00:03:04.129> they're<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.060> little<00:03:05.540> bit<00:03:05.750> deeper

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:16.300 

again<00:03:09.680> noise<00:03:14.440> nice<00:03:15.440> thing<00:03:15.680> about<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:16.010> the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
again noise nice thing about the the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.580 
again noise nice thing about the the
ductless<00:03:16.700> is<00:03:16.879> normal<00:03:17.269> heat<00:03:17.569> pumps<00:03:17.959> are<00:03:18.139> going

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
ductless is normal heat pumps are going

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.750 
ductless is normal heat pumps are going
to<00:03:18.650> give<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:18.920> any<00:03:19.250> word<00:03:19.459> from<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.760> 95<00:03:20.299> to<00:03:21.760> 100

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
to give you any word from a 95 to 100

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.369 
to give you any word from a 95 to 100
degree<00:03:23.000> output<00:03:23.389> temperature<00:03:23.569> ductless<00:03:24.230> can

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
degree output temperature ductless can

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.129 
degree output temperature ductless can
get<00:03:24.500> up<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.680> 130<00:03:25.190> degrees<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.959> you're<00:03:27.079> just

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
get up to 130 degrees so you're just

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.690 
get up to 130 degrees so you're just
getting<00:03:27.319> way<00:03:27.769> more<00:03:27.799> I<00:03:28.099> can<00:03:28.280> do<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.549> because

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
getting way more I can do that because

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.240 
getting way more I can do that because
of<00:03:28.970> such<00:03:29.420> low<00:03:29.690> resistance<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:30.889> static

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
of such low resistance and the static

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.470 
of such low resistance and the static
elements<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:32.060> then<00:03:32.720> I'm<00:03:33.019> going<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.200> head<00:03:33.349> out

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
elements and then I'm going to head out

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.099 
elements and then I'm going to head out
okay

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.210 

we'll<00:03:39.109> head<00:03:39.290> out<00:03:39.319> and<00:03:39.620> take<00:03:39.769> a<00:03:39.799> look<00:03:40.010> at<00:03:40.129> the

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
we'll head out and take a look at the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.369 
we'll head out and take a look at the
outdoor

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.690 

and<00:03:48.379> then<00:03:48.500> we<00:03:48.590> got<00:03:48.709> all<00:03:48.799> three<00:03:48.950> heads<00:03:49.189> on<00:03:49.370> there

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
and then we got all three heads on there

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.360 
and then we got all three heads on there
all<00:03:49.849> set<00:03:50.150> up<00:03:50.269> they<00:03:50.480> had<00:03:50.599> a<00:03:50.629> 20<00:03:50.989> degree

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
all set up they had a 20 degree

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.740 
all set up they had a 20 degree
differential<00:03:52.370> from<00:03:52.610> where<00:03:53.150> they<00:03:53.269> were<00:03:53.329> set<00:03:53.599> to

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
differential from where they were set to

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.509 
differential from where they were set to
where<00:03:53.840> they're<00:03:53.989> at<00:03:54.170> now<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:54.650> this<00:03:55.189> units

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
where they're at now so this units

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.100 
where they're at now so this units
should<00:03:56.030> be<00:03:56.090> running<00:03:56.329> it<00:03:56.540> close<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.900> high<00:03:57.680> speed

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
should be running it close to high speed

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.729 
should be running it close to high speed
seeing<00:04:00.110> an<00:04:00.170> idea<00:04:00.409> of<00:04:00.500> noise<00:04:00.769> volume<00:04:02.530> okay

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
seeing an idea of noise volume okay

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.860 
seeing an idea of noise volume okay
now<00:04:04.340> this<00:04:04.489> might<00:04:04.700> be<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.879> said<00:04:05.000> three<00:04:05.329> mxs<00:04:05.720> this

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
now this might be I said three mxs this

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.420 
now this might be I said three mxs this
might<00:04:06.019> be<00:04:06.140> form<00:04:06.409> Excel<00:04:06.739> so<00:04:06.860> actually<00:04:07.250> because

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
might be form Excel so actually because

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.349 
might be form Excel so actually because
I<00:04:07.519> can't<00:04:07.730> remember<00:04:07.879> note<00:04:08.810> three<00:04:09.019> mxs<00:04:09.349> okay<00:04:10.359> can

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
I can't remember note three mxs okay can

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.930 
I can't remember note three mxs okay can
remember<00:04:11.569> if<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:11.959> had<00:04:12.489> bumped<00:04:13.489> that<00:04:13.549> up<00:04:13.609> for<00:04:13.909> a

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
remember if I had bumped that up for a
