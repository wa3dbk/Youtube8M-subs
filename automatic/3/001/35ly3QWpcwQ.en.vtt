understand<00:00:36.790> this<00:00:37.000> information<00:00:38.160> first<00:00:39.160> thing

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.490 
understand this information first thing

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.510 
understand this information first thing
let's<00:00:40.030> talk<00:00:40.330> about<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.840> similarities

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
let's talk about the similarities

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.220 
let's talk about the similarities
because<00:00:42.520> I<00:00:42.820> think<00:00:42.910> that's<00:00:43.510> where<00:00:43.780> students

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
because I think that's where students

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.460 
because I think that's where students
get<00:00:44.380> most<00:00:44.680> confused<00:00:45.810> Hepburn<00:00:46.810> and<00:00:46.960> coumadin

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
get most confused Hepburn and coumadin

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.720 
get most confused Hepburn and coumadin
are<00:00:47.680> both<00:00:49.500> anticoagulants<00:00:50.500> which<00:00:50.680> means<00:00:51.370> that

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
are both anticoagulants which means that

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.680 
are both anticoagulants which means that
they<00:00:51.880> thin<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.390> blood<00:00:52.710> all<00:00:53.710> right<00:00:54.060> but<00:00:55.060> the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
they thin the blood all right but the

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.340 
they thin the blood all right but the
differences<00:00:56.290> are<00:00:56.530> in<00:00:56.790> how<00:00:57.790> they<00:00:58.090> work<00:00:58.810> how

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
differences are in how they work how

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.860 
differences are in how they work how
fast<00:00:59.680> they<00:00:59.920> work<00:01:00.160> what<00:01:00.880> to<00:01:01.000> look<00:01:01.150> for<00:01:01.420> when<00:01:01.660> you

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
fast they work what to look for when you

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.710 
fast they work what to look for when you
want<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.290> patients<00:01:02.710> on<00:01:02.830> this<00:01:03.070> medication<00:01:03.790> so

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
want to patients on this medication so

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.590 
want to patients on this medication so
they're<00:01:05.290> both<00:01:05.670> anticoagulant<00:01:06.670> so<00:01:07.150> that<00:01:07.330> means

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
they're both anticoagulant so that means

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.989 
they're both anticoagulant so that means
that<00:01:07.930> when<00:01:08.439> we<00:01:08.590> give<00:01:08.859> either<00:01:09.280> heparin<00:01:09.909> or

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:09.999 
that when we give either heparin or

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.419 
that when we give either heparin or
coumadin<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.929> goal<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.439> that<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.649> patient<00:01:12.219> will

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
coumadin the goal is that a patient will

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.870 
coumadin the goal is that a patient will
not<00:01:12.670> develop<00:01:12.999> a<00:01:13.240> blood<00:01:13.509> clot<00:01:13.840> now<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:15.729> are

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
not develop a blood clot now what are

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.499 
not develop a blood clot now what are
some<00:01:15.909> conditions<00:01:16.719> or<00:01:17.109> what<00:01:17.619> are<00:01:17.770> some<00:01:18.509> disease

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
some conditions or what are some disease

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.080 
some conditions or what are some disease
processes<00:01:20.049> that<00:01:20.560> will<00:01:20.799> cause<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.310> patient<00:01:21.909> to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
processes that will cause a patient to

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.410 
processes that will cause a patient to
have<00:01:22.119> a<00:01:22.630> blood<00:01:22.899> clot<00:01:23.249> right<00:01:24.249> the<00:01:24.850> first<00:01:25.179> one

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
have a blood clot right the first one

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.459 
have a blood clot right the first one
could<00:01:26.109> be<00:01:26.280> irregular<00:01:27.280> heartbeat<00:01:27.759> so<00:01:28.469> atrial

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
could be irregular heartbeat so atrial

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.080 
could be irregular heartbeat so atrial
fibrillation<00:01:30.329> ventricular<00:01:31.329> tachycardia<00:01:33.090> how

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
fibrillation ventricular tachycardia how

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.859 
fibrillation ventricular tachycardia how
about<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:35.399> pulmonary<00:01:36.399> embolism<00:01:36.999> okay<00:01:37.569> we<00:01:37.719> don't

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.209 
about a pulmonary embolism okay we don't
want<00:01:37.990> our<00:01:38.170> patients<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.590> have<00:01:38.649> on<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.009> bills

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
want our patients to have on the bills

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.179 
want our patients to have on the bills
how<00:01:39.969> about<00:01:40.179> a<00:01:40.210> deep<00:01:40.539> vein<00:01:40.780> thrombosis<00:01:41.189> we

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
how about a deep vein thrombosis we

thinner also can't rule out bed rest
that's<00:01:51.009> a<00:01:51.249> big<00:01:51.459> one<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.850> lot<00:01:52.389> of<00:01:52.420> patients<00:01:52.899> come

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
into the hospital and they're

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.920 
into the hospital and they're
complaining<00:01:55.359> of<00:01:55.539> chest

well<00:02:00.850> what<00:02:01.030> you'll<00:02:01.210> see<00:02:01.480> is<00:02:01.630> that<00:02:01.770> heparin

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
well what you'll see is that heparin

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.580 
well what you'll see is that heparin
will<00:02:03.010> be<00:02:03.130> given<00:02:03.490> as<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.760> prophylactic<00:02:04.590> against

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
will be given as a prophylactic against

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.380 
will be given as a prophylactic against
developing<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.250> blood<00:02:06.490> clot<00:02:06.820> while<00:02:07.120> you're<00:02:07.270> in

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
developing a blood clot while you're in

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.020 
developing a blood clot while you're in
the<00:02:07.510> hospital<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.710> no<00:02:08.920> matter<00:02:09.100> what<00:02:09.430> unit<00:02:09.880> you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
the hospital so no matter what unit you

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.390 
the hospital so no matter what unit you
find<00:02:10.270> yourself<00:02:10.630> working<00:02:10.869> on<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:12.070> could<00:02:12.310> be

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
find yourself working on you could be

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.020 
find yourself working on you could be
given<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.850> lot<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.570> heparin<00:02:14.310> all<00:02:15.310> right<00:02:15.490> let's

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
given a lot of heparin all right let's

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.030 
given a lot of heparin all right let's
talk<00:02:16.210> about<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.600> differences<00:02:17.140> our<00:02:17.500> first

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
talk about the differences our first

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.690 
talk about the differences our first
difference<00:02:18.520> is<00:02:18.640> going<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.090> be<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:20.020> onset<00:02:20.830> how

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
difference is going to be the onset how

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.210 
difference is going to be the onset how
fast<00:02:22.060> these<00:02:22.480> medications<00:02:23.020> work<00:02:23.380> once<00:02:23.980> they're

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
fast these medications work once they're

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.310 
fast these medications work once they're
given<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:24.670> want<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.630> take<00:02:25.810> out<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.960> piece<00:02:26.140> of

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
given I want you to take out a piece of

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.230 
given I want you to take out a piece of
paper<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.830> know<00:02:27.190> one<00:02:27.490> side<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:27.790> want<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.150> to

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
paper you know one side I want you to

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.820 
paper you know one side I want you to
write<00:02:28.390> heparin<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:28.990> on<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.290> other<00:02:29.500> side<00:02:29.800> I

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
write heparin and on the other side I

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.350 
write heparin and on the other side I
want<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.280> write<00:02:30.430> cumin<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:30.880> because<00:02:31.209> we're

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
want you to write cumin in because we're

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.520 
want you to write cumin in because we're
going<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.510> look<00:02:31.630> at<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.840> differences

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
going to look at the differences

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.520 
going to look at the differences
so<00:02:33.070> on<00:02:33.280> our<00:02:33.400> heparin<00:02:33.850> side<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.660> onset<00:02:35.290> is

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
so on our heparin side the onset is

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.940 
so on our heparin side the onset is
going<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.890> be<00:02:36.070> one<00:02:37.060> hour<00:02:37.330> about<00:02:38.170> one<00:02:38.440> hour<00:02:38.620> this

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
going to be one hour about one hour this

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.160 
going to be one hour about one hour this
medication<00:02:39.400> will<00:02:39.550> start<00:02:39.940> working<00:02:40.420> whereas

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
medication will start working whereas

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.590 
medication will start working whereas
coumadin<00:02:41.709> our<00:02:41.950> onset<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.910> going<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.209> be<00:02:43.330> about

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
coumadin our onset is going to be about

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.360 
coumadin our onset is going to be about
3<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.620> 10<00:02:44.980> days<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:46.570> it's<00:02:47.080> not<00:02:47.320> unusual<00:02:47.620> for<00:02:48.070> a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
3 to 10 days so it's not unusual for a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.910 
3 to 10 days so it's not unusual for a
patient<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.060> be<00:02:49.090> on<00:02:49.600> both<00:02:50.290> heparin<00:02:50.830> and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
patient to be on both heparin and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.240 
patient to be on both heparin and
coumadin<00:02:51.430> at<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.820> same<00:02:52.060> time<00:02:52.390> because<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
coumadin at the same time because the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.180 
coumadin at the same time because the
goal<00:02:54.550> is<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.360> take<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.350> heparin<00:02:56.830> while

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
goal is that you take the heparin while

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.210 
goal is that you take the heparin while
the<00:02:57.400> coumadin<00:02:57.910> is<00:02:58.060> building<00:02:58.480> up<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.780> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
the coumadin is building up to the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.680 
the coumadin is building up to the
therapeutic<00:03:00.220> level<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:00.910> then<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.300> can<00:03:01.480> quit

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
therapeutic level and then you can quit

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.479 
therapeutic level and then you can quit
taking<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.110> heparin<00:03:02.320> altogether<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.280> let

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
taking the heparin altogether and let

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.870 
taking the heparin altogether and let
the<00:03:03.610> cumin<00:03:03.910> in<00:03:04.150> do<00:03:04.690> its<00:03:04.870> job<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:06.280> second<00:03:06.730> one

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
the cumin in do its job the second one

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.750 
the cumin in do its job the second one
is<00:03:07.030> going<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.300> be<00:03:07.540> how<00:03:08.290> long<00:03:08.590> can<00:03:08.950> be<00:03:09.010> patients

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
is going to be how long can be patients

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.570 
is going to be how long can be patients
take<00:03:10.200> medications<00:03:11.200> such<00:03:11.769> as<00:03:11.800> heparin<00:03:12.340> or

be looking at all right because patients

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.900 
be looking at all right because patients
that<00:03:47.140> are<00:03:47.230> on<00:03:47.260> heparin<00:03:47.650> or<00:03:47.739> coumadin<00:03:48.070> will<00:03:48.760> be

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
that are on heparin or coumadin will be

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.220 
that are on heparin or coumadin will be
getting<00:03:49.090> their<00:03:49.330> blood<00:03:49.570> drawn<00:03:49.900> pretty

frequently sometimes when the patients

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.509 
frequently sometimes when the patients

on a heparin drip they are getting their

blood drawn every six hours so if your

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.870 
blood drawn every six hours so if your
patients<00:03:58.630> getting<00:03:58.810> happen<00:03:59.440> you<00:04:00.280> want<00:04:00.580> to<00:04:00.700> look

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
patients getting happen you want to look

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.630 
patients getting happen you want to look

at the laboratory value called the pea

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.860 
at the laboratory value called the pea
tt<00:04:04.120> okay<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:05.500> PTT<00:04:05.920> should<00:04:06.700> be<00:04:06.850> one<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.660> half

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
tt okay the PTT should be one and a half

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.550 
tt okay the PTT should be one and a half
to<00:04:08.410> two<00:04:08.650> times<00:04:08.980> greater<00:04:09.250> than<00:04:09.940> normal<00:04:10.750> now

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
to two times greater than normal now

to two times greater than normal now
I<00:04:11.590> can't<00:04:12.250> give<00:04:12.520> you<00:04:12.550> a<00:04:13.120> straight<00:04:13.930> number<00:04:14.110> -<00:04:14.410> no

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
I can't give you a straight number - no

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.770 
I can't give you a straight number - no
because<00:04:14.890> heparin<00:04:15.790> is<00:04:15.910> usually<00:04:16.299> weight<00:04:16.480> based

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
because heparin is usually weight based

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.750 
because heparin is usually weight based
okay<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:18.730> INR<00:04:19.450> is<00:04:19.900> what<00:04:20.769> you'll<00:04:20.919> look<00:04:21.160> at<00:04:21.400> when

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
okay the INR is what you'll look at when

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.940 
okay the INR is what you'll look at when
you<00:04:21.970> are<00:04:22.000> monitoring<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:23.470> effective

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
you are monitoring the effective

medications really quickly if your

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.159 
medications really quickly if your
patients<00:07:24.010> on<00:07:24.159> a<00:07:24.550> blood<00:07:24.909> thinner<00:07:25.270> you<00:07:25.810> need<00:07:26.050> to

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:26.169 
patients on a blood thinner you need to

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:27.839 
patients on a blood thinner you need to
be<00:07:26.289> careful<00:07:26.770> if<00:07:26.889> they're<00:07:27.070> taking<00:07:27.460> herbal

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:33.300 
medications such as garlic or gingko
biloba<00:07:30.960> because<00:07:31.960> that<00:07:32.260> thins<00:07:32.560> the<00:07:32.680> blood<00:07:32.800> too

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.310 
biloba because that thins the blood too

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.520 
biloba because that thins the blood too
so<00:07:34.060> you<00:07:34.120> don't<00:07:34.360> want<00:07:34.539> your<00:07:34.630> patient<00:07:35.020> to<00:07:35.110> be<00:07:35.289> on

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:35.530

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.740 
so you don't want your patient to be on
