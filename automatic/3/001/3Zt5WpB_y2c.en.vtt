00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.290
 so hello everyone is engaged 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:10.780
 car repair 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.249
 somehow not professional since i 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:19.170
 let's say amateur in his yard 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:21.210
 so decided to shoot a video made myself such 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.429
 assaults 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.859
 because I can no and no 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.530
 opportunities and dig up yes and not need it 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:36.760
 in principle, especially 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:39.070
 so decided to make himself drink assaults shop 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.530
 it was possible to lift the car 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.840
 to do something underneath that's why 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.440
 jacks with clues with these 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:59.160
 zadolbalsya and decided to cook such here 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:05.590
 such a bedside table 63 roll top 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:11.429
 wood 40 from old window sill and from 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:18.509
 two parts the bedside cabinet itself and here 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:23.100
 disconnected here hitting welded 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.030
 the connection is the former this very finger 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.929
 piston from Muscovite 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.969
 from cut in half a laser section 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:36.960
 massager such 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:39.960
 the catch is generally easy to connect 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.960
 So 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:50.170
 order quickly and conveniently for what did 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.750
 collapsible in order to first place 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.380
 less occupies garages in the second easier 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.039
 all the same 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:01.000
 A corner of a hard shit here and so 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:05.860
 disassembled put everything on 1 really did 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.649
 In short, not enough material can 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.360
 redistribution when bye 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:16.840
 I use this 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.620
 run so without him something bumper right here 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.709
 here clings when you run so 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.150
 puts a board on the other side there 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:30.690
 there is a long climb 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.110
 Here's an option if anyone is interested 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.110
 you can do yourself 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:46.810
 looks from different sides well and now 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:51.010
 I'll show you how it will be a car 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.380
 stand on them well that's actually I drove 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.269
 the car 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.890
 I cannot show the process 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:02.950
 because it is easy to shoot minicom 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.389
 Nastya drives in without tension 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.200
 and so 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:15.190
 you can freely get everything open 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:20.139
 You can lie down in principle the engine is removed 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:26.260
 down the box and hodovke access is everything 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:31.170
 completely at this height 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.940
 get a car now take a tape measure 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:42.310
 estimate how much 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:56.340
 as far as rises so here it means 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:04:02.140
 rack itself 28 centimeters length 47 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:10.060
 here is a banker means rising opinions 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:12.450
 part as much as whole here roughly 60 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.450
 centimeters 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.659
 enough times higher than 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.700
 jack 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:27.780
 even tincture well and safer after all 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:32.409
 4 coasters are much more stable 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:37.210
 on their own even similarity collapse on it 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:40.930
 to do this 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:47.210
 it turned out basically due to 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:54.370
 This for the most part did here 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:05:01.569
 Now if anyone would benefit from this video 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:04.990
 I will be glad in principle to all bye 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.990
 so here
