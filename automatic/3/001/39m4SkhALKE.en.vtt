going<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.460> doable<00:00:23.760> or<00:00:23.970> not<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:25.199> can

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
going to be doable or not and you can

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.470 
going to be doable or not and you can
see<00:00:25.470> right<00:00:25.500> here<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.090> get<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> blue

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
see right here you can get the blue

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.410 
see right here you can get the blue
schools<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:28.050> solo<00:00:28.289> mode<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.760> don't<00:00:30.210> know

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420

schools in solo mode and I don't know
what<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> attributes<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.009> what<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.700> ends

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
what it attributes to and what that ends

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.120 
what it attributes to and what that ends
up<00:00:33.030> meaning<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:34.440> makes<00:00:34.620> me<00:00:34.770> want<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.040> try

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
up meaning but it makes me want to try

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.250 
up meaning but it makes me want to try
