00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.600
 and I have discussed it with the producer of 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.070
 spot or with the agency or even with the 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.099
 own singers who have participated in 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.080
 the movie that the reason they told me 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.640
 to me to direct this announcement is because 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.640
 He was born on Christmas lottery 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.860
 when they contacted me to do this 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.780
 spot and I was presented with the idea in a 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.360
 model from the same moment I thought that 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.520
 it was a he who was a brilliant idea 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.190
 and I remembered a lot about my father all 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.070
 years proved alcohol and was still 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.400
 very closely so I almost almost do it 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.400
 for him 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.620
 for me directing this announcement has been a 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.329
 challenge because for many years all 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.440
 the three spectators are waiting for the 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.440
 announcement the lottery 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.850
 I feel like as coach 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.380
 national the best singers in the country 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.270
 because we want to do something very special 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.850
 and I have considered myself as a movie 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.710
 that reaches the heart then what you 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.710
 Unite everyone is have great voices 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.130
 I suddenly came across a song 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.680
 a beautiful song always on my mind 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.680
 a version made carol 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.149
 for me, Christmas is the tree of 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.689
 Christmas are the gifts of finding me 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.219
 with all my family and there is something that 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.100
 identifies our Christmas is that 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.649
 we sing a lot of Christmas carols is a 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.709
 element that attracted me to this announcement 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.750
 the fact that there is an important fact 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.140
 in the concept that was the song of the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.140
 Christmas
