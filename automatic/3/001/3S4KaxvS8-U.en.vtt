00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.530
 The second half 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.079
 to be continue 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:13.209
 while the temperature has increased rapidly towards Asia 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.820
 wildfire center the pooches 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.820
 two 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.870
 Well there are some consequences of the effects that it pointed out today that these 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.670
 changes not for example 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.280
 the snowy ones are disappearing not only in the Peru but all in others 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.460
 places 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.510
 what is happening with the snow 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.280
 what is more evident 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.950
 in short there is no doubt 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.110
 and is that global warming 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.440
 this expression of the cause so that the glaciers 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.750
 in the tropical areas of the planet 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.340
 in the quality club is located in mexico is the one that has more 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670
 of medals in the world 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.100
 I'm starting to retreat towards 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.710
 anti-Semitism do 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.820
 that definitely has big implications 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.270
 just the fact that the future and we will not be able to 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.510
 keep asking is an obscene 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.530
 in the mountains 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.400
 china qian to see 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.400
 irun the new customers many of the citizens 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.770
 places 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.770
 they believe that these antisocials are located 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.950
 they provide the water 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.260
 every September course and then drinking 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.340
 for the use of energy and electric power generation and for the use of 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 crops towards parana 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.610
 cdc have decreased 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.500
 the massacre 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.030
 1 the water in the heavens 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.080
 definitely a near future 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.170
 you will not be able to count on it you have appeal resources available 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.860
 discriminated 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.409
 drinking water for example the institution and in gustatory moment 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.309
 me to disappear 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:13.299
 but it was the side itself 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.859
 per cent of the glaciers are not the only ones that contribute 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.009
 efe the other 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.279
 for example for drinking water use but also 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.279
 are the social classifications during the rainy season 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.089
 at the headquarters in the ravines that make sub-basins 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.889
 Pemex reported the rivers then neither that continue 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.999
 kennedy and walkers and lombÃ¡n 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.999
 contributing to the strengthening of the service 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:44.849
 once the rainy season finishes since the dry season 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.259
 Science and contribution of the city 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:52.129
 then the actor who has mainly of the glaciers and of the 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.249
 groundwater society creation 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.429
 then in the future the contribution will disappear 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.439
 of the church will only be the contribution 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.269
 in the dry season 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.769
 Groundwater leaks 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.209
 its snowy landscapes that have been having the amount of snow that has 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.199
 there is a way to recover the snow loss moth has no turning back 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.159
 I can hear comments that 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.329
 giselle way of empreser give them 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.329
 the works 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.719
 I do not believe because the Japanese prosecutor 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.459
 it will also continue 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.669
 increasing the temperature 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.620
 nor is it going to increase or accelerate the partial retirement eventually homeland 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:45.159
 and what conditions can we recover only when the planet 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.619
 entities 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:51.569
 With another change that is taking treatment we have been able to notice here 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.479
 are changes in temperature and changing China novillada 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.559
 and they release what lime does not feel like in other times 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:00.729
 yes 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.549
 in places where it must be raining there yes 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.379
 and to the zoo dominica and honda wait a bit of it would be seeing alan and 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.919
 amounts that is what is happening 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.259
 as a result of global warming 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.059
 climate change 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:18.479
 I found out that the rain regime 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.189
 change 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.189
 percent colleges and coincident that if there's higher 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.809
 recently the initial attempt 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:30.729
 of the more than 70 in increase among the hot infants 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.379
 as a result of the greater evaporation 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.749
 and it is invisible that there are more clubs 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:40.059
 percent and the winds are responsible for you 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.519
 after the destruction of a place to another place but as a social space 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.650
 after that simple fact that there will be more availability 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.319
 own or other monge eras 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:55.439
 when they rush 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:59.029
 if the possibility of a way that we do not know so far are doing 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:00.080
 studies 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.659
 function 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.830
 of what is the rainfall regime that has been observed at present in 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.050
 the last fifty hundred years 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.460
 merck 1 will change 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.900
 if only using 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.849
 by climate models 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.460
 can not anticipate 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.460
 not very accurately but have a 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.580
 milledge what would be the changes in the rain regime 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.029
 it implies who 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:27.830
 in some cases 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.259
 in places where you have to see enough will continue to live Mancini is a pleasure 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:35.219
 Unused elections 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:37.699
 in other places where 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.059
 and there was a deficit 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:43.900
 type of sites lies 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.550
 then in some cases 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.569
 the financial situation 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:49.099
 but there were other places 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.479
 I do not understand, I saw 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:51.389
 it will rain 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:52.819
 where before 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:53.759
 for one hundrerd 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.339
 I want a lot will decrease 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.789
 then valverde a type of balance 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:00.629
 efe 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:02.849
 as it happened then it happens 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:03.979
 it's not a research topic
