to test your logical thinking for the

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.710 
to test your logical thinking for the
SonoSite<00:04:52.860> it's<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:54.100> five<00:04:54.310> redstone<00:04:55.150> don't

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
SonoSite it's the five redstone don't

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.180 
SonoSite it's the five redstone don't
worry<00:04:56.320> there<00:04:56.860> are<00:04:56.890> only<00:04:57.720> 128<00:04:58.720> different

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
worry there are only 128 different

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.510 
worry there are only 128 different
possibility<00:05:00.190> Oh

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.580 

so<00:05:03.730> we<00:05:03.850> follow<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.240> redstone<00:05:04.840> int<00:05:05.200> the

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
so we follow the redstone int the

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.440 
so we follow the redstone int the
following<00:05:05.950> redstone<00:05:06.430> torches<00:05:06.850> at<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.270> end

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
following redstone torches at the end

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.530 
following redstone torches at the end
must<00:05:07.930> be<00:05:08.140> off<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:09.280> five<00:05:09.520> torches<00:05:10.150> at<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.390> end

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
so we've got to follow the redstone

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.240 
so we've got to follow the redstone
trail<00:05:21.960> I'll<00:05:22.960> follow<00:05:23.410> this<00:05:23.620> end<00:05:23.860> lever<00:05:26.250> that

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
trail I'll follow this end lever that

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.790 
trail I'll follow this end lever that
goes<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.790> that

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.439 

so<00:05:32.460> we<00:05:32.580> don't<00:05:32.849> touch<00:05:33.120> this<00:05:34.020> one<00:05:34.229> here<00:05:35.360> with<00:05:36.360> the

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
so we don't touch this one here with the

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.159 
so we don't touch this one here with the
sign<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.690> don't<00:05:36.810> think<00:05:37.319> this<00:05:37.740> one<00:05:37.949> leads<00:05:38.400> to<00:05:38.789> a

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
sign I don't think this one leads to a

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:45.409
