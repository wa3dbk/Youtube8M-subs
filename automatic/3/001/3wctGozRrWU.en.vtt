00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
you want stick to which is this one to

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.659 
you want stick to which is this one to
be<00:04:27.060> mouse<00:04:27.360> movements<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.410> have<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.919> double

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
be mouse movements you have to double

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.540 
be mouse movements you have to double
click<00:04:29.700> it<00:04:30.060> if<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.660> can<00:04:30.810> find<00:04:31.080> my<00:04:31.230> mouse<00:04:31.410> here<00:04:31.740> it

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
click it if I can find my mouse here it

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.290

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
is okay double click it then you go into

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.180 
is okay double click it then you go into
Mouse<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:38.630> here<00:04:39.630> are<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.960> cursor<00:04:40.500> movements

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
Mouse and here are the cursor movements

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.140 
Mouse and here are the cursor movements
and<00:04:41.430> here's<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:41.970> wheel<00:04:42.150> rotation<00:04:42.950> so<00:04:44.150> let's

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
and here's the wheel rotation so let's

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.570 
and here's the wheel rotation so let's
say<00:04:45.419> if<00:04:45.810> it's<00:04:46.110> minecraft<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.220> wanted<00:04:47.460> to

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
say if it's minecraft and you wanted to

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.570 
say if it's minecraft and you wanted to
set<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:47.820> so<00:04:48.120> each<00:04:48.480> button<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.110> press<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:50.400> would

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
set it so each button you press it would

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.700 
set it so each button you press it would
go<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:51.030> next<00:04:51.270> slot<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:53.120> believe<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:55.470> mouse

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
go to the next slot I believe the mouse

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.780 
go to the next slot I believe the mouse
rotation<00:04:56.370> would<00:04:56.460> go<00:04:56.669> up<00:04:56.910> or<00:04:57.210> down<00:04:57.470> 40<00:04:58.470> or<00:04:59.220> 50<00:04:59.760> I

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
rotation would go up or down 40 or 50 I

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.330 
rotation would go up or down 40 or 50 I
can't<00:05:00.330> remember<00:05:00.630> but<00:05:00.900> let's<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:01.950> worry

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
can't remember but let's just worry

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.860 
can't remember but let's just worry
about<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:03.120> movement<00:05:03.690> so<00:05:04.590> if<00:05:05.210> that's<00:05:06.210> going<00:05:06.540> to

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
about the movement so if that's going to

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.670 
about the movement so if that's going to
go<00:05:07.110> left<00:05:08.390> then<00:05:09.390> we're<00:05:09.630> putting<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:10.110> cursor

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
go left then we're putting the cursor

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.400 
go left then we're putting the cursor
moment<00:05:11.250> left<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:12.240> then<00:05:12.690> put<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.320> the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
moment left and then put it to the

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.219 
moment left and then put it to the
sensitivity<00:05:14.100> you<00:05:14.130> want<00:05:14.450> and<00:05:15.450> you<00:05:15.630> can<00:05:15.810> scroll

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
sensitivity you want and you can scroll

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.600 
sensitivity you want and you can scroll
with<00:05:16.440> your<00:05:16.470> little<00:05:16.950> mouse<00:05:17.550> thing<00:05:19.310> mouse<00:05:20.310> wheel

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
with your little mouse thing mouse wheel

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.210 
with your little mouse thing mouse wheel
to<00:05:21.510> set<00:05:21.840> it<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:23.930> you<00:05:24.930> press<00:05:25.140> ok<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:25.710> that

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220

is five from the top and the bottom the
right<00:05:58.050> trigger<00:05:58.380> is<00:05:58.800> X<00:05:59.220> is<00:05:59.400> five<00:05:59.930> top<00:06:00.930> one<00:06:01.260> and

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
right trigger is X is five top one and

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.570 
right trigger is X is five top one and
then<00:06:02.490> left<00:06:03.450> trigger<00:06:03.870> is<00:06:04.260> X<00:06:04.710> is<00:06:04.950> five<00:06:05.220> on<00:06:05.250> the

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
then left trigger is X is five on the

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.770 
then left trigger is X is five on the
bottom<00:06:06.410> so<00:06:07.410> the<00:06:07.919> first<00:06:08.160> X<00:06:08.520> is<00:06:08.760> five<00:06:09.060> that<00:06:09.510> shows

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
bottom so the first X is five that shows

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.379 
bottom so the first X is five that shows
up<00:06:10.020> if<00:06:10.290> you<00:06:10.410> want<00:06:10.590> it<00:06:10.680> to<00:06:10.770> be<00:06:10.889> a<00:06:10.919> left<00:06:11.220> click<00:06:11.490> go

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
up if you want it to be a left click go

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.040 
up if you want it to be a left click go
to<00:06:12.419> Mouse<00:06:12.690> you<00:06:13.139> can<00:06:13.260> also<00:06:13.410> do<00:06:13.650> it<00:06:13.770> from<00:06:14.040> here

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
to Mouse you can also do it from here

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.570 
to Mouse you can also do it from here
but<00:06:16.050> I<00:06:16.110> like<00:06:16.260> to<00:06:16.440> go<00:06:16.590> from<00:06:16.860> Mouse<00:06:17.070> and<00:06:17.400> then<00:06:17.490> you

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
but I like to go from Mouse and then you

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.630 
but I like to go from Mouse and then you
can<00:06:17.760> see<00:06:18.360> all<00:06:18.480> the<00:06:18.600> options<00:06:18.630> and<00:06:19.340> left<00:06:20.340> click

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
can see all the options and left click

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.220 
can see all the options and left click
so<00:06:21.300> that<00:06:21.510> means<00:06:21.750> I<00:06:22.050> leave<00:06:22.860> my<00:06:23.100> mouse<00:06:23.310> here<00:06:24.230> and

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
so that means I leave my mouse here and

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.390 
so that means I leave my mouse here and
then<00:06:25.380> I<00:06:25.650> can<00:06:26.100> move<00:06:26.280> my<00:06:26.340> stick<00:06:27.300> to<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:27.750> left

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
then I can move my stick to the left

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.370 
then I can move my stick to the left
until<00:06:29.400> it<00:06:29.669> gets<00:06:29.820> Internet<00:06:30.360> Explorer<00:06:30.750> and<00:06:30.900> then
