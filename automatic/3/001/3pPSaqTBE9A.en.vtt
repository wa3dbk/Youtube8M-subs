 Welcome, today I will show you how to make snowmen exactly like these 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.850
 using these colored balls. 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:26.210
 We will need three white balls of different sizes, one smaller than the other, three of 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:38.530
 a color of your choice (I chose this dark blue), two browns to make the branches, then 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:47.429
 limbs, two of another color of your choice, three of the same color as these 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.539
 here, an orange one to make the nose and two black ones to make the eyes. 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:59.480
 Let's start with the three whites to form the snowman. 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.659
 We crush a little. 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:10.910
 We use water to glue. 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:18.240
 Now let's form the hat. 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:32.010
 If the sugar paste cracks do not worry, it will be a pleasant effect in fact 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.260
 it will look like an old and worn hat. 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:46.420
 Once crushed, always with a little water, we attach it up here. 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.630
 Let's finish the hat. 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:08.270
 For a more pleasing effect, take the other color you have chosen and with a rolling pin 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.690
 we spread it ... and we attach our cord. 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:23.030
 In the same way we can create a scarf: we take the color of the hat, we crush it, 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:36.091
 we cut it to give a regular shape. 

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.230
 We create effects by superimposing the color we have chosen for the hat band, 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.480
 for example we could create polka dots. 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:03:00.660
 Once created we can perfect our scarf by applying cuts at the ends 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.840
 and we put the scarf on him. 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.890
 We make buttons of the same color, then crushed balls. 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:47.800
 We also crush the black balls, we make two holes to give the appearance of a button, 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.810
 so. 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:04:14.030
 We form our carrot and finally we create the limbs. 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:25.730
 We wet the part. 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:37.700
 In case they can't stand you can also use toothpicks ... and two! 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:05:07.310
 Our snowman is ready!
