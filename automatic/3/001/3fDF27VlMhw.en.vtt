00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 all the same, not playing in this club is 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.450
 great sergio yesterday in a match 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.059
 Friendly in Murcia and people cheering us up 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.299
 the category change of the same playing 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.850
 in the betis yes I have the thorn in 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.640
 that I am one of the ones to say 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.750
 guilty of the decline not then 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.970
 I also want to be one of the culprits 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.420
 to help the team make first 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.910
 not only are rumors are also things 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.980
 that as I'm not interested I am 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.870
 I have always been very clear that I want 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.239
 play here and today I do not pose 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.219
 nothing more is already clear not that the club 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.230
 it depends what what they bring you not 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.820
 you can look at the two parts and what I 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.260
 they have commented to each one but I have 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.870
 very clear that for me it will not be 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.039
 serial and it is true is that if 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.930
 I knew what I would change last season 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.719
 It was rare in the team finally after 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.730
 I also ended down not returned 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.350
 again to have another injury that had me 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.320
 for two months 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.629
 they are not excuses I do not know what years can not 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.360
 pass not can not happen from this year 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.920
 to make a good season and to achieve 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.439
 the objective 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.820
 well yes it is true that last year 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.509
 when I started having a bit of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.180
 continuity 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.950
 I think I did my best match up 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.380
 that I get to the injury in Almería that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.330
 he has me again two months unemployed but 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 I think it 's a bit the key 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.229
 continuity of matches that is clear 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.869
 that they do not give you anything that they know 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.880
 have to earn one with work and I 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.890
 I think the continuity of playing match 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.340
 often it is what makes you jump 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.840
 more if I have lived one of the most 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.319
 criticism of last season not 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.630
 I guess they would have their reasons not 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.880
 it is clear that to the people of the house 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.729
 he is always required more as is normal 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.470
 no and good helps you does not always help you 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.470
 until he sees he imposes himself to follow you every day 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.820
 more no longer relax well well enough 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.530
 close with us is very very close 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.900
 and the truth that very well does not understand us 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.450
 he understands us quite a lot 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.310
 intensity does not always make us be 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.270
 one hundred percent and that is very beneficial 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.530
 for the group 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.080
 He told me not that he will serve me 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.450
 pretty worthless not that maybe what 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.420
 I need a little bit to not defend and 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.510
 help the team without the ball and if he's going 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.640
 to follow in that much better seems and 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.070
 he has to stay not rubén already we know 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.380
 everything as in the qualities that it has 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.730
 which it does to you and for us 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.420
 is the key piece has to be 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.239
 important because trust I know there's 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.489
 saying this at this point is difficult not 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.680
 but trust that I am sure 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.910
 it's going to be a good year and well here I 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.070
 I always said no I do not like 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.450
 the comparisons walking uac and I am 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.030
 I have his qualities and I have 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.770
 mine but for me yes yes that is a 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.709
 reference is not from my land too 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.850
 came here taste here yes it is a reference 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.480
 and sharing clothes with him would be something 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.480
 what would i like
