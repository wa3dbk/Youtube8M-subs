 erc ingolstadt met the eagle today 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.180
 mannheim as the team of the game 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.670
 has experienced here the short 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.700
 summary 2 to 1 home defeat in the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.230
 well visited saturn arena fans though 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.660
 split opinion about her panther yes 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.820
 the lower edge is better if it is not 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.640
 bad bad so except for the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.800
 taste goodies 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.500

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.570
 of the germany cups dealers that are 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.420

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.610
 compact is to play 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.180
 bad 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.080
 yes i 'm saying tip only the rc shows 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.890
 you can not fit 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.960
 That's why I think the Eagles are lucky 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.700
 successful start of the season for the eagle 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.780

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.430
 what was going on 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.100
 Do not use the chance 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.280
 scorer was very clear to us first 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.479
 a third of a day gives me and me 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.310
 think but then we have the game 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.200
 but dominated but unfortunately the gates 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.759
 made 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.100

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.200

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.350
 21 experienced already said scarce 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.509
 little result and both 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.619
 have played well defensively 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.420
 not allowed much we wanted to go back 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.009
 are it has not succeeded in 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.480
 ingolstadt are very difficult to play 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.400
 I put a lot of pressure on that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.800
 defender at the gang it's pretty 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.989
 hard but our team of 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.890
 play away games and dennis endras 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.209
 a huge game 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.790
 You can also get three points 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.150
 was the one or the other lack of what was 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.459
 go there 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.040
 mister good for ice hockey is clear 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.260
 thus trying to be a bit know 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.060
 To mark territory but we let ourselves 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.060
 you did not like it and you clever us often 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.799
 no nonsense and so on 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.239
 you have to perform abroad again 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.540
 wants to get points and it has done times 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.540
