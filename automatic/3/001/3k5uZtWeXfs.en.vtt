00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.600 
figuring something out I had lots of
times<00:03:22.620> where<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:22.860> was<00:03:22.980> like<00:03:23.070> okay<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.310> think<00:03:23.430> this

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
times where I was like okay I think this

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.730 
times where I was like okay I think this
is<00:03:23.730> what's<00:03:23.940> gonna<00:03:24.060> happen<00:03:24.240> and<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:25.110> did<00:03:25.350> sort<00:03:25.650> of

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
is what's gonna happen and I did sort of

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.250 
is what's gonna happen and I did sort of
have<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.100> in<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.280> end<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.880> epilogue<00:03:27.570> just

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
have it in the end but the epilogue just

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.810 
have it in the end but the epilogue just
kind<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.310> throws<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:30.420> curveball<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.820> there

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
kind of throws you a curveball and there

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.790 
kind of throws you a curveball and there
is<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.300> lot<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.020> stuff<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.320> this<00:03:34.410> book<00:03:34.590> but

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
is a lot of stuff in this book but

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.199 
is a lot of stuff in this book but
there's<00:03:34.950> especially<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.640> lot<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.790> stuff<00:03:36.060> at<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
there's especially a lot of stuff at the

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.180 
there's especially a lot of stuff at the
end<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.810> think<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.290> was<00:03:37.470> probably<00:03:37.709> my<00:03:37.980> least

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
end I think that was probably my least

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.180 
end I think that was probably my least
favorite<00:03:38.520> part<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> fact<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:40.410> was

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
favorite part and the fact that I was

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.740 
favorite part and the fact that I was
like<00:03:41.310> okay<00:03:41.430> I've<00:03:41.760> come<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.180> conclusion<00:03:42.209> I

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
like okay I've come to the conclusion I

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.880 
like okay I've come to the conclusion I
understand<00:03:43.110> where<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:43.320> book<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.590> gonna<00:03:43.709> be

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
understand where this book is gonna be

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.080 
understand where this book is gonna be
and<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.040> thought<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.280> epilogue<00:03:44.610> was<00:03:44.820> sort<00:03:45.030> of

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
and I thought the epilogue was sort of

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.110 
and I thought the epilogue was sort of
settle<00:03:45.810> things<00:03:45.959> off<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.440> kind<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.310> bring<00:03:48.030> the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
settle things off and kind of bring the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.300 
settle things off and kind of bring the
story<00:03:48.330> together<00:03:48.630> with<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> semi<00:03:49.440> happy<00:03:49.770> ending

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
story together with a semi happy ending

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.830 
story together with a semi happy ending
but<00:03:51.239> no<00:03:51.709> not<00:03:52.709> at<00:03:53.010> all<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.610> just<00:03:53.640> took<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.510> turn

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
but no not at all it just took a turn

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.040 
but no not at all it just took a turn
for<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.380> even<00:03:55.770> worst<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.940> epilogue<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.600> I

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
for the even worst in the epilogue and I

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.199 
for the even worst in the epilogue and I
kind<00:03:58.440> of<00:03:58.590> wish<00:03:58.770> she<00:03:59.190> hadn't<00:03:59.580> done<00:03:59.730> that<00:03:59.910> or<00:04:00.120> at

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
kind of wish she hadn't done that or at

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.910 
kind of wish she hadn't done that or at
least<00:04:00.239> made<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.690> book<00:04:00.810> longer<00:04:01.290> because<00:04:01.680> that

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
least made the book longer because that

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.740 
least made the book longer because that
was<00:04:02.100> a<00:04:02.130> lot<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.670> take<00:04:02.850> in<00:04:02.910> right<00:04:03.300> at<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.480> end

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
was a lot to take in right at the end

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.840 
was a lot to take in right at the end
overall<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.590> would<00:04:04.739> rate<00:04:04.920> this<00:04:05.070> book<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.400> 5<00:04:05.640> out

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
overall I would rate this book a 5 out

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.479 
overall I would rate this book a 5 out

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
of 5 definitely a dark and creepy book

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.750 
of 5 definitely a dark and creepy book

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
I'm not someone who gets queasy easily

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.670 
I'm not someone who gets queasy easily
ders<00:04:11.910> easily<00:04:12.540> disturbed<00:04:12.870> but<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:13.440> book

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.250 
ders easily disturbed but this book
definitely<00:04:14.370> had<00:04:14.640> some<00:04:15.000> really<00:04:15.540> creepy<00:04:15.930> parts

to<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.650> they<00:04:17.400> kind<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.730> like<00:04:17.970> goose<00:04:18.180> bumps<00:04:18.600> on

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.659 
to it they kind of like goose bumps on
the<00:04:18.840> skin<00:04:19.109> like<00:04:19.140> you<00:04:20.100> know<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.310> had<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.489> take<00:04:20.640> a

the skin like you know you had to take a
break<00:04:20.880> from<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.209> book<00:04:21.390> because<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:21.810> was<00:04:21.840> just

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
break from the book because it was just

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.020 
break from the book because it was just
getting<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.890> in<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:23.190> sense<00:04:23.520> this<00:04:23.850> is
