00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:07.960 
yo what up man it is Tico from Tico

Rhino<00:00:08.200> or<00:00:08.490> dot-com<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:10.690> this<00:00:11.020> video<00:00:11.350> I<00:00:11.559> want<00:00:11.799> to

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
Rhino or dot-com in this video I want to

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.549 
Rhino or dot-com in this video I want to
talk<00:00:12.039> about<00:00:12.250> somos<00:00:12.940> types<00:00:13.180> somos<00:00:14.139> types<00:00:14.379> are

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
talk about somos types somos types are

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.720 
talk about somos types somos types are
basically<00:00:15.119> the<00:00:16.119> three<00:00:16.350> classifications<00:00:17.350> for

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
basically the three classifications for

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.250 
basically the three classifications for
different<00:00:18.730> body<00:00:18.940> types<00:00:19.300> you've<00:00:19.510> got<00:00:19.720> the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
different body types you've got the

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.410 
different body types you've got the
endomorph<00:00:21.070> with<00:00:21.280> it<00:00:21.430> which<00:00:21.700> is<00:00:21.880> more<00:00:22.210> of<00:00:22.330> the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
endomorph with it which is more of the

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.140 
endomorph with it which is more of the
heavy<00:00:22.660> set<00:00:22.960> build<00:00:23.230> you've<00:00:23.740> got<00:00:23.890> that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
heavy set build you've got that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.420 
heavy set build you've got that
ectomorph<00:00:25.150> which<00:00:25.360> is<00:00:25.540> the<00:00:25.720> skinny<00:00:26.020> rail<00:00:26.530> built

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
ectomorph which is the skinny rail built

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.980 
ectomorph which is the skinny rail built
and<00:00:27.610> then<00:00:27.760> you've<00:00:27.850> got<00:00:28.000> the<00:00:28.090> mesomorph<00:00:28.570> which

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
and then you've got the mesomorph which

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.810 
and then you've got the mesomorph which
is<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.320> muscular<00:00:29.920> build<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.310> we're<00:00:30.730> gonna

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
is the muscular build and we're gonna

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.369 
is the muscular build and we're gonna
talk<00:00:31.060> about<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.330> endomorph<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.079> in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
talk about the endomorph and in

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.529 
talk about the endomorph and in
particular<00:00:33.039> we<00:00:33.670> are<00:00:33.760> going<00:00:34.000> to<00:00:34.120> talk<00:00:34.329> about

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
particular we are going to talk about

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.050 
particular we are going to talk about
how<00:00:35.170> you<00:00:35.230> should<00:00:35.650> be<00:00:35.680> eating<00:00:36.190> as<00:00:36.340> an<00:00:36.520> endomorph

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
how you should be eating as an endomorph

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.740 
how you should be eating as an endomorph
now<00:00:37.570> I<00:00:37.930> share<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:38.739> bit<00:00:39.520> of<00:00:39.550> this<00:00:39.760> body<00:00:40.270> type<00:00:40.540> I

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
now I share a bit of this body type I

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.020 
now I share a bit of this body type I
think<00:00:41.110> I'm<00:00:41.200> a<00:00:41.260> mix<00:00:41.470> of<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:41.770> eds<00:00:41.950> endo<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:42.910> the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
think I'm a mix of the eds endo and the

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.330 
think I'm a mix of the eds endo and the
mesomorph<00:00:43.630> meaning<00:00:44.410> I<00:00:44.500> can<00:00:44.620> put<00:00:44.980> on<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.100> lot<00:00:45.310> of

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
mesomorph meaning I can put on a lot of

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.130 
mesomorph meaning I can put on a lot of
muscle<00:00:45.520> very<00:00:45.970> very<00:00:46.270> quickly<00:00:46.540> but<00:00:46.750> it's<00:00:46.899> hard

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
muscle very very quickly but it's hard

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.620 
muscle very very quickly but it's hard
for<00:00:47.200> me<00:00:47.440> to<00:00:47.560> drop<00:00:48.130> fat<00:00:48.430> ok<00:00:49.000> it's<00:00:49.210> hard<00:00:49.420> for<00:00:49.510> me

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
for me to drop fat ok it's hard for me

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.639 
for me to drop fat ok it's hard for me
to<00:00:49.720> get<00:00:49.840> lean<00:00:50.110> so<00:00:50.940> how<00:00:51.940> do<00:00:52.480> you<00:00:52.660> how<00:00:53.290> do<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:53.410> eat

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
to get lean so how do you how do you eat

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.889 
to get lean so how do you how do you eat
to<00:00:53.829> get<00:00:53.950> lean<00:00:54.160> as<00:00:54.340> an<00:00:54.579> endomorph<00:00:55.120> this<00:00:55.660> is<00:00:55.780> what

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
to get lean as an endomorph this is what

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:56.910 
to get lean as an endomorph this is what
you<00:00:56.020> got<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.290> do<00:00:56.469> okay

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
you got to do okay

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.299 
you got to do okay
and<00:00:57.100> no<00:00:57.520> morphs<00:00:57.880> we<00:00:58.570> uh<00:00:58.600> we<00:00:59.559> don't<00:00:59.800> handle

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
and no morphs we uh we don't handle

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.280 
and no morphs we uh we don't handle
sugar<00:01:00.820> that<00:01:01.030> well<00:01:01.270> okay<00:01:01.780> we're<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:01.989> little<00:01:02.200> bit

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
sugar that well okay we're a little bit

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.009 
sugar that well okay we're a little bit
in<00:01:02.469> insulin<00:01:03.280> resistant<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:04.719> what<00:01:04.839> you've<00:01:04.989> got

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
in insulin resistant so what you've got

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.099 
in insulin resistant so what you've got
to<00:01:05.199> do<00:01:05.500> is<00:01:05.770> you've<00:01:06.280> got<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.579> cut<00:01:06.790> back<00:01:07.090> on<00:01:07.360> the

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:08.109 
to do is you've got to cut back on the

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:12.209 
to do is you've got to cut back on the
sugar<00:01:08.459> in<00:01:09.459> your<00:01:09.759> diet<00:01:09.819> okay<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.810> would<00:01:11.590> go<00:01:12.069> as

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
sugar in your diet okay I would go as

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.370 
sugar in your diet okay I would go as
far<00:01:12.249> as<00:01:12.639> to<00:01:12.670> say<00:01:13.030> no<00:01:13.749> more<00:01:13.990> than<00:01:14.409> 20%<00:01:15.249> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
far as to say no more than 20% of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.859 
far as to say no more than 20% of
carbohydrates<00:01:17.380> in<00:01:17.619> your<00:01:18.130> diet<00:01:18.749> definitely<00:01:19.749> no

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
carbohydrates in your diet definitely no

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.719 
carbohydrates in your diet definitely no
more<00:01:20.020> than<00:01:20.170> that<00:01:20.289> and<00:01:20.499> the<00:01:21.130> carbohydrates

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
more than that and the carbohydrates

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.580 
more than that and the carbohydrates
that<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.969> should<00:01:22.240> be<00:01:22.420> ingesting<00:01:22.929> should<00:01:23.469> be

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
that you should be ingesting should be

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.709 
that you should be ingesting should be
coming<00:01:23.979> from<00:01:24.869> vegetables<00:01:25.869> green<00:01:26.670> leafy

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
fibrous vegetables that should be your

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.389 
fibrous vegetables that should be your
primary<00:01:31.840> source<00:01:32.349> if<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:33.009> are<00:01:33.159> gonna<00:01:33.310> eat

I<00:01:38.349> would<00:01:39.039> eat<00:01:39.130> sweet<00:01:39.340> potatoes<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:39.849> would<00:01:39.969> eat

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
I would eat sweet potatoes I would eat

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.690 
I would eat sweet potatoes I would eat
brown<00:01:40.359> rice<00:01:40.389> and<00:01:40.869> I<00:01:40.929> would<00:01:41.049> probably<00:01:41.770> only<00:01:42.159> eat

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
brown rice and I would probably only eat

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.480 
brown rice and I would probably only eat
them<00:01:42.909> post-workout<00:01:43.869> in<00:01:44.770> terms<00:01:45.069> of<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.279> rest

them post-workout in terms of the rest

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.859 
them post-workout in terms of the rest
of<00:01:45.579> your<00:01:45.670> diet<00:01:45.819> what<00:01:46.029> you<00:01:46.179> want<00:01:46.299> to<00:01:46.359> look<00:01:46.509> at<00:01:46.659> is

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
of your diet what you want to look at is

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.899 
of your diet what you want to look at is
increasing<00:01:47.529> the<00:01:47.919> amount<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.249> fat<00:01:48.520> which<00:01:48.759> you

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
increasing the amount of fat which you

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:49.559 
increasing the amount of fat which you
eat

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
eat

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.139 
eat
which<00:01:50.079> sounds<00:01:50.529> counterintuitive<00:01:51.149> eating

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
which sounds counterintuitive eating

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.959 
which sounds counterintuitive eating
more<00:01:52.359> fat<00:01:52.599> to<00:01:52.779> get<00:01:52.899> leaner<00:01:53.139> but<00:01:53.829> you've<00:01:54.759> gotta

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
more fat to get leaner but you've gotta

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.050 
more fat to get leaner but you've gotta
remember<00:01:55.179> as<00:01:55.569> an<00:01:56.289> endomorph<00:01:57.009> you<00:01:57.490> don't<00:01:57.669> deal

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
remember as an endomorph you don't deal

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.940 
remember as an endomorph you don't deal
that<00:01:58.419> well<00:01:58.719> with<00:01:58.990> carbohydrates<00:01:59.709> so<00:01:59.859> you've

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
that well with carbohydrates so you've

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.339 
that well with carbohydrates so you've
got<00:02:00.099> to<00:02:00.189> get<00:02:00.340> your<00:02:00.630> calories<00:02:01.630> somewhere<00:02:02.259> else

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349

okay<00:02:03.039> so<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.609> would<00:02:03.849> increase<00:02:04.179> the<00:02:04.359> fat<00:02:04.539> intake

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
okay so I would increase the fat intake

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.790 
okay so I would increase the fat intake
and<00:02:05.819> then<00:02:06.819> I<00:02:07.090> would<00:02:07.270> keep<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.689> fairly<00:02:08.410> high<00:02:08.739> to

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
and then I would keep a fairly high to

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.120 
and then I would keep a fairly high to
moderate<00:02:09.459> protein<00:02:10.209> intake<00:02:10.539> okay<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.349> don't
