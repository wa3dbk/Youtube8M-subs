00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello to all guys and girls I hope that 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.640
 you are great today I will give you 10 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.859
 tips to make the most of 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.260
 the rebates and we optimize our 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.120
 purchases are 10 very simple things but 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.820
 that will facilitate us a lot at the time 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.710
 to buy that we do not spend so much and that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.260
 I always do so with head 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.420
 let's see what are the 10 things in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.609
 first place and the most important thing is that 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 think before going to buy what 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.140
 we want to think what we need what 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.179
 It is better that we make a list with 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.369
 those things that we have to buy that 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.350
 then we can go without them look 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.570
 very good our closet and see what 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.850
 we need to renew and what no other 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.670
 very very very important thing is that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.620
 let's have a fixed budget, that is, if 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.480
 I want to spend 100 euros because I have 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.719
 100 euros to spend on the sales 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.820
 do not buy like crazy go spending without 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.800
 know how much we have or spend because 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.420
 at the end we will arrive home we will see everything 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.610
 what we have bought and we will live as 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.320
 done this we have to look at both 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.059
 physical stores as by internet what 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.000
 it is better to look at the two places 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.730
 also many times when that store 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.520
 can sell both in physical store and 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.320
 internet prices are different from me 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.090
 It has happened to me to buy something in stores 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.920
 and on the internet I have a different price 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.720
 so this has to be looked at very well 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.410
 to be able to buy it where it is most 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.330
 cheap 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.090
 the sales is the best time to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.860
 buy basic clothes that are going to 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.900
 accompany throughout the year because the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.390
 we can use a lot to get them out a lot 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.350
 match and rise in rajas we can invest 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.210
 in quality 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.190
 I always take the rebates for 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.560
 invest in basics like they can be a 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.480
 little black dress a short dress 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.910
 that can be useful for many 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.130
 sometimes blazers also because they tend to 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.140
 be a little too expensive jeans too 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.910
 jeans that always 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.100
 we use myself at least in my day to 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.020
 day are far and it takes 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.640
 find one that is good 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.760
 quality and that I feel good so the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.220
 discounts you have to take advantage of and also in 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.630
 some bag that is of a good fabric 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.340
 that can serve us for the whole year 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.530
 to carry a lot of weight for example to 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.330
 the university or to go to work and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.950
 also shoes some shoe that is 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.950
 comfortable and that we will take it out 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.200
 what we sometimes forget a little is 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.629
 that the rebates are made at the end of the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.730
 season so the best thing is that 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.650
 let's think about the next season in the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.840
 time that will come next now 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.030
 same is summer there are summer sales and 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.950
 very well all the sundresses what 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.440
 study pants all very cool 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.230
 but inside nothing we have here the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.480
 winter and we can also invest in 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.269
 buy winter things like they can 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.579
 be jerseys long pants coats 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.620
 also without a doubt that we have to give 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.239
 some quirk of something that we like 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.400
 a lot of season something that has some 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.980
 very striking print that has a 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.200
 embroidery so nice that you have beads 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.690
 rhinestones these garments are usually more 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.670
 faces in season and in sales as it 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.319
 let's find cheaper things are 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.750
 that maybe we're not going to get that much 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.459
 party for that because we are much more 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.019
 striking but good to give us a 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.730
 whimsical with something we've seen in 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.250
 season that we loved because also 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.600
 we will come great in the sales not 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.150
 you have to doubt it 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.280
 but one thing if we like it very much 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.110
 we see in buying it or not because then we 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.610
 let's regret let's say what 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.680
 I had to have bought I'll see if 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.630
 serves and will not be on sale the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.370
 things are thrown very fast is not the same 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.660
 that in season if we do not buy it 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.390
 in the store we can buy it for 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.390
 internet in the sales is not now or 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.100
 never so if you like too much to 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.770
 for that reason what more tires of the sales 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.600
 is when there are a lot of people when you see 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.510
 all thrown away and is that you take away 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.000
 looking forward to have to search again 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.160
 search and search to find good 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.200
 offers in those piles where there are 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.150
 thousand things that you do not feel much searching 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.920
 but good since we are going to look 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.450
 for sure we're going to find something and 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.940
 that's where the three most often are 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.100
 cheap super important that we keep 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.620
 all the tickets because many times 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.480
 we're tired or there's a lot of line to 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.520
 enter the tester and we did not try the 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.900
 things or how we see that something is cheap 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.520
 we say hey, I'm going to take it 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.650
 that I'm not going to spend much 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.290
 and then we got home we tried the 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.780
 things and we see that it was not what we thought 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.080
 And finally enjoy enjoy 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.090
 the sales of everything you like 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.980
 buy with a head but good to enjoy 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.980
 a little bit proving things by trying 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.810
 this I leave it been that mango things 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.580
 latita if they are no longer a fad of time 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.410
 in when we always enjoy the day 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.390
 and it does not come badly from time to time 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.830
 thank you very much for watching me I hope that
