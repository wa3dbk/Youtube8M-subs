00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.580
 hi guys oliver montana here and in 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.069
 this video i want to tell you what to eat 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.290
 to put on mass if you're one of 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.110
 those who find it hard to put on weight 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.150
 so if you are a broomstick or 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.920
 you're one of those bags that despite 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.900
 what you eat does not see the scale 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 go up from week to week 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.070
 then open your ears well because 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.590
 this video is just for you I'll tell you 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.260
 a moment how to approach yours 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.510
 power supply to get results from 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.520
 week to week and I receive emails 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.680
 everyday frustrated guys that 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.950
 tell me oliver look i'm eating 5 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.700
 6 7 times a day but the scale does not 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.559
 goes up 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.309
 that is, I don't know what to do for weeks 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.739
 so on and go on to tell me what 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.149
 they eat during the day for example 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.530
 for breakfast maybe egg whites with 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.789
 a bowl of oatmeal then 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.510
 snack a yogurt then lunch dinner rice 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.629
 vegetables with chicken other snack one 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.220
 protein chef and of course if you're not 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.770
 putting on weight this way 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.229
 despite what he eats because he is a 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.240
 very fast metabolism or yours 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.939
 metabolism burns more efficiently 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.159
 calories compared to another person 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.159
 so this approach to eating 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.159
 very clean civic are not dense of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.530
 calories is not good for you is a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.119
 approach that is not good for yours 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.840
 case precisely because it has a metabolism 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.990
 so fast you need more food 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.619
 calorie daisy to get those 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.329
 extra calories and break through that wall 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.560
 lets you put on mass and 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.140
 develop your muscles 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.229
 now then what you have to do is to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.659
 prefer other more dense foods more 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.360
 complete warmly than others 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.450
 for example, vegetables are carbohydrates 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.950
 vacuums do not contain so many calories 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.560
 they contain so many vitamins anyway 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.719
 they do not contain those calories than alla 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.490
 end of the day you need to 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.219
 reach that tot and allow 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.619
 just a development a response 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.099
 anabolic from your body too 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.840
 the chicken is not thick with rice 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.580
 it is not full of calories 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.709
 instead of the chicken he eats white meat 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.989
 ok and more complete even with fats 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.280
 saturated that you need anyway for 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.430
 balance your levels of 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.470
 testosterone is still denser 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.900
 warmly compared to chicken and fish 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.540
 yes, maybe you replace rice with them 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.930
 with pasta then you have to evaluate a 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.150
 ok moment and find more dense foods 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.160
 warmly and this does not mean to 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.980
 eat chips that beard McDonald's 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.799
 Chinese every day means 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.079
 simply to choose foods that 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.420
 however they are healthy but are more dense 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:52.019
 therefore for example heat rather than 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.599
 get yourself a shake with protein only e 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.450
 water add some fruit or 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.200
 maybe some whole eggs and even some 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.629
 milk 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.790
 ok that surely is more complete more 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.519
 calories gives you many more nutrients 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.510
 compared to something he still has 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.629
 few calories 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.510
 ok so make these choices play a little 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.640
 with food, consider what is going 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.650
 better for you that has more calories too a 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.780
 rieti allows you to reach the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.930
 need your caloric target 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.660
 daily for precisely putting on mass 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.269
 this great uncle is good for you because he is a 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.160
 very fast metabolism that I repeat 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.690
 burns calories more 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.230
 efficiently then those calories 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.359
 extras you need and for example I have a 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.900
 friend who still weighs like me has one 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:42.690
 developed musculature like me though 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.569
 he walks around around 6 for 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.150
 a hundred 365 days a year this is why 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.480
 he has a very fast metabolism he me 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.340
 said that if there is no such thing as a 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.510
 mcdonald sandwich or a pizza 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.669
 every day ok he would lose mass 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.620
 muscle therefore on metabolism and so 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.269
 fast this is due to its genetics 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.090
 a genetic factor 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:09.239
 ok and his metabolism and so fast 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.609
 which does not allow him to eat much 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.220
 clean ok even needs to include 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.310
 some food that is still dirty between 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.229
 quotation marks to put on mass then 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.090
 each of us is different you have to 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.520
 evaluate what works best for you 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.700
 however the general rule is that in this 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.550
 case if you're not putting mass 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.370
 eating cleanly like ibra ok 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.500
 therefore eating vegetables chicken rice must 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.520
 obviously eating foods that are more 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.010
 dense in calories 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.130
 however this way the eating in way 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.530
 very clean of course works for the 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.900
 people who are more inclined to 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.690
 put on fat and weight easily 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.570
 during the mass period therefore if 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.760
 instead you are a person who struggles to 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.820
 stay slim and put on anyway 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.130
 easily fat during a phase of 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.530
 mass a mass period of course 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.910
 eat as cleanly as it does 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:07.070
 book does just for you ok then evaluates 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.110
 a moment of course choose foods that 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.000
 they are better for you based on 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.850
 calorie amounts that help you 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.660
 reach your calorie target car 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.640
 daily 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.190
 ok so this is all for it 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.360
