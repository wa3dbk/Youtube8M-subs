 this short I did still by the faculty of scenic arts 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.550

 your social internet 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.810
 I wrote about ordering and it's a way 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.079
 filmmaking and production was very funny because 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.330
 it takes six photos 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.710
 the role that a great friend of my knowledge is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.140
 production 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.030

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.980
 that was once 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.280
 about a year after we had done 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.980
 metalinguistic short film was once the people 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.870
 iran had done it was not once because 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.650
 We ended up filming 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.440
 recording a little about ajapra kubango before and we recorded people badly 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.249
 that we have some grandchildren adored difficult defenses 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:55.170
 the cities affected 24 9% 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.350
 he looks for credit should hit the mayor with the problem 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.880
 takes a long time to be finalized we recorded all the sectors 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.430
 Patricia was crazy what we want is that we totally made their 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.950
 relatives also after having expired the pope greeted 35 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.499
 and it was recorded and that a bus garage 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:18.439
 and a year ended bus battery because it makes idea of ​​the dawn the camera 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.129
 borrowed was a mess 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.079
 soon after the GM will have to make an early scene as a member of the Belenenses 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.079
 took the scene from the movie 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.889
 looks in fact was only with was once affects more caffeine why 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.609
 when I close the victims who had already worked so the two short 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:41.959
 from other people 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.989
 after you go to work for once I drive tuition to the direction 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.450
 more to say of bié then pm can accept this condition after 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.089
 I just joined as a director. 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.139
 but the cool thing is that you work and hurt others 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.439
 because you learn that but now the movie said it's silly 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:04.409
 I have worked in several threads doing photo oim of 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.599
 production that the survey feel that its jump my points that the manager 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.229
 deny 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.209
 I think it's really cool to work on people. 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.179
 because to know that recently when he went to do the seven people have affection for 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:16.999
 What are you leading? 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:21.049
 just so for the person to have affection for the team for about 130km deep others 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.209
 people too 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.489
 I think it's because the rest of the world a big family said 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.489
 wonderful 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.499
 bishop of raw material and smoke 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:36.319
 with special work 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.319
 I really like to do the second 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:42.599
 with the same actors with the same team 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.479
 because he had already done the dismissal 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:46.639
 in new material 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.119
 I'm going to work with a new circuit of the actors was 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.289
 very good they have a strength yes 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.349
 your presence 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.839
 have the staff speak that have this information 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.019
 they are vague 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.059
 due to this true age factors 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.509
 is in fact very marked messi very rehearsed 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:07.429
 it's wonderful actors 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:10.639
 easy to get along with and have professionals 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.349
 actually a meeting with obama meeting of friends the people I 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.620
 I have known for a long time that later we are adding more people 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.499
 it's the hour of truth first of all it's a whole life project 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.739
 It's a way of making up movies. 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.180
 with people you like and not always 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.850
 In this state you have an approved movie and a half right now refuse people 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.930
 worked hard working on the other 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.710
 and we settle down very funny because a lot of people when they are going to do 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.059
 we have created these meetings have more money in one thing I want to hire a 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:48.289
 photographer 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.419
 but experienced everyone has just developed a little ahead 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.159
 in a certain way 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.489
 he has some problems but on the other hand it's good that we learn a lot too 

00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:59.169
 we end up doing everything
