then this part here is like I think its

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.320 
then this part here is like I think its
calf<00:05:36.780> but<00:05:37.260> it's<00:05:37.470> kind<00:05:38.160> of<00:05:38.190> like<00:05:38.280> that<00:05:38.460> fur<00:05:38.940> and

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
calf but it's kind of like that fur and

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.740 
calf but it's kind of like that fur and
it's<00:05:39.570> more<00:05:40.320> of<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.940> leopard<00:05:41.940> type<00:05:42.150> print<00:05:42.510> and

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
it's more of a leopard type print and
