how retarding the exhaust cam 8°

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.370 
how retarding the exhaust cam 8°
eliminated<00:00:21.000> pretty<00:00:21.270> much<00:00:21.449> every<00:00:22.199> bit<00:00:22.350> of

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
eliminated pretty much every bit of

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.880 
eliminated pretty much every bit of
overlap<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:25.230> pretty<00:00:25.529> neat<00:00:25.680> actually

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
cylinder intake and exhaust valves are
closed<00:00:42.750> I've<00:00:43.200> got<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.620> set<00:00:43.829> up<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.040> where<00:00:45.410> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
closed I've got it set up to where it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.229 
closed I've got it set up to where it's
about<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.800> do<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> intake<00:00:47.460> stroke<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.090> what

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
about to do the intake stroke and what

about to do the intake stroke and what
I'm<00:00:48.329> gonna<00:00:48.450> do<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.930> show<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.200> where<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.219> at

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
I'm gonna do to show you where it's at

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.350 
I'm gonna do to show you where it's at
is<00:00:51.300> I'm<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> take<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.340> extension<00:00:53.360> it's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
is I'm going to take this extension it's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.540 
is I'm going to take this extension it's
half<00:00:54.739> three-eighths<00:00:55.739> extension<00:00:56.340> I'm<00:00:56.430> going

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
half three-eighths extension I'm going

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.010 
half three-eighths extension I'm going
to<00:00:56.610> drop<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.910> down<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.239> there<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.870> goes

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
to drop it down in there and it goes

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.900 
to drop it down in there and it goes
perfectly<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.680> touches<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.190> top<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.730> and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
perfectly it touches the top of it and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.810 
perfectly it touches the top of it and
you<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.539> tell<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> goes<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.489> because

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you can tell that it goes in because

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.539 
you can tell that it goes in because
over<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.660> goes<00:01:03.809> all<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.049> way<00:01:04.140> down<00:01:04.549> in

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
over here it goes all the way down in

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.820 
over here it goes all the way down in
the<00:01:05.640> second<00:01:06.030> cylinder<00:01:06.450> so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
the second cylinder so

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.220 
the second cylinder so
put<00:01:09.370> that<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:09.700> there<00:01:09.880> drop<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.870> spark

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
put that in there drop it to the spark

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.090 
put that in there drop it to the spark
plug<00:01:11.290> hole<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:14.110> right<00:01:14.290> I'm<00:01:14.560> gonna<00:01:14.770> put<00:01:14.860> the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
plug hole all right I'm gonna put the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.370 
plug hole all right I'm gonna put the
camera<00:01:15.310> right<00:01:15.670> here<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.210> I'm<00:01:16.750> gonna<00:01:16.930> turn<00:01:17.170> the

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
camera right here and I'm gonna turn the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.430 
camera right here and I'm gonna turn the
engine<00:01:17.710> over<00:01:17.830> at<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.790> crank<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:20.110> show<00:01:20.380> you

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.730 
this is all right hopefully the camera
doesn't<00:01:34.179> move<00:01:34.329> while<00:01:34.689> I<00:01:34.749> turn<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:35.439> engine

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
doesn't move while I turn the engine

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.290 
doesn't move while I turn the engine
over<00:01:35.859> so<00:01:36.539> alright

go<00:03:07.890> for<00:03:08.190> an<00:03:08.250> intake<00:03:08.910> stroke<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.390> let's<00:03:09.540> speed

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
go for an intake stroke and let's speed

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.750 
go for an intake stroke and let's speed
it<00:03:09.780> up<00:03:09.959> for<00:03:09.990> you<00:03:10.230> you're<00:03:11.100> going<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.250> see<00:03:11.459> on<00:03:11.640> the

 fantastic

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.720

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.490 

I<00:04:38.780> think<00:04:39.140> it's<00:04:39.260> gonna<00:04:39.380> run<00:04:40.010> fantastic
