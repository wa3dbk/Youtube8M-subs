00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.320 
use shortcut keys to snap windows with
air<00:00:13.860> oh<00:00:13.889> snap<00:00:14.360> okay<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.420> let's<00:00:15.870> get<00:00:16.020> started

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
air oh snap okay so let's get started

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.250 
air oh snap okay so let's get started
sometimes<00:00:18.330> when<00:00:18.570> you're<00:00:18.690> working<00:00:18.869> with

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
sometimes when you're working with

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.439 
sometimes when you're working with
windows<00:00:19.740> multiple<00:00:20.310> windows<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
windows multiple windows you have a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.439 
windows multiple windows you have a
problem<00:00:21.840> with<00:00:22.670> resizing<00:00:23.670> those<00:00:23.850> windows<00:00:24.269> you

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
problem with resizing those windows you

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.000 
problem with resizing those windows you
have<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.660> move<00:00:24.810> them<00:00:24.990> around<00:00:25.080> sometimes<00:00:25.859> they

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
have to move them around sometimes they

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.980 
have to move them around sometimes they
overlap<00:00:26.460> each<00:00:26.490> other<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.810> may<00:00:27.930> be

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
overlap each other and it may be

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.330 
overlap each other and it may be
difficult<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.560> work<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.010> may<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.160> difficult

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
difficult to work it may be difficult

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.769 
difficult to work it may be difficult
especially<00:00:29.730> if<00:00:30.119> you're<00:00:30.240> trying<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.570> do<00:00:30.750> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
especially if you're trying to do a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.420 
especially if you're trying to do a
comparison<00:00:31.260> between<00:00:31.439> one<00:00:31.890> screen<00:00:32.219> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
comparison between one screen and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.880 
comparison between one screen and
another<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.690> feature<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.469> going<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
another so the feature that is going to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.440 
another so the feature that is going to
help<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> feature<00:00:35.880> called<00:00:36.000> arrow

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
help with that is a feature called arrow

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.560 
help with that is a feature called arrow
snap<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.739> air<00:00:37.980> oh<00:00:38.010> snap<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.360> grab<00:00:39.540> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
snap with air oh snap you can grab a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.299 
snap with air oh snap you can grab a
window<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.110> example<00:00:40.469> I'm<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.739> grab<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
window for example I'm going to grab the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.180 
window for example I'm going to grab the
windows<00:00:41.670> explorer<00:00:42.120> here<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.710> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.890> move

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
windows explorer here and you can move

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.840 
windows explorer here and you can move
it<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:45.120> an<00:00:45.270> edge<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.770> screen<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it to an edge of the screen and the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.799 
it to an edge of the screen and the
window<00:00:48.210> will<00:00:48.480> resize<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:50.879> fill<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.360> screen

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
window will resize to fill that screen

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.270 
window will resize to fill that screen
now<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.260> might<00:00:52.469> say<00:00:52.500> okay<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.190> I'm

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
now you might say okay but if I'm

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.360 
now you might say okay but if I'm
working<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:54.000> window<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:54.600> great<00:00:54.899> if

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
working with one window that's great if

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.549 
working with one window that's great if
I'm<00:00:56.370> working<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.760> multiple<00:00:57.090> windows<00:00:57.600> how

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
I'm working with multiple windows how

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
I'm working with multiple windows how
would<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.859> benefit<00:00:59.340> me<00:00:59.489> well<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.600> also

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
would this benefit me well you can also

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
would this benefit me well you can also
grab<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.440> move<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.770> off<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.219> left<00:01:02.399> side

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
grab it and move it off to the left side

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.509 
grab it and move it off to the left side
here<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> right<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:04.290> will<00:01:04.470> resize<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
here or the right and it will resize to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.500 
here or the right and it will resize to
fill<00:01:05.729> half<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> screen

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:17.050 

so<00:01:09.410> if<00:01:09.500> we<00:01:09.620> have<00:01:09.770> multiple<00:01:10.010> windows<00:01:10.490> open<00:01:16.060> you

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
so if we have multiple windows open you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.850 
so if we have multiple windows open you
can<00:01:17.240> see<00:01:17.420> that<00:01:17.600> now<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:17.810> can<00:01:18.260> organize<00:01:18.440> your

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
can see that now you can organize your

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.860 
can see that now you can organize your
windows<00:01:19.190> a<00:01:19.220> little<00:01:19.550> bit<00:01:19.640> easier<00:01:20.030> if<00:01:20.300> you're

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
windows a little bit easier if you're

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.980 
windows a little bit easier if you're
using<00:01:21.110> Windows<00:01:21.560> snap<00:01:22.600> now<00:01:23.600> one<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.960> things

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
using Windows snap now one of the things

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.530 
using Windows snap now one of the things
I<00:01:24.260> really<00:01:24.290> like<00:01:24.680> about<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:25.190> is<00:01:25.400> that<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:26.510> can

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
I really like about this is that you can

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.600 
I really like about this is that you can
use<00:01:26.810> shortcut<00:01:27.260> keys<00:01:27.500> which<00:01:27.740> we<00:01:27.950> discussed<00:01:28.340> in

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
use shortcut keys which we discussed in

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.970 
use shortcut keys which we discussed in
the<00:01:28.700> previous<00:01:28.850> lesson<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:30.200> accomplish<00:01:30.740> the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
the previous lesson to accomplish the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.430 
the previous lesson to accomplish the
grabbing<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.700> moving<00:01:31.790> part<00:01:32.420> of<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.020> arrow

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
grabbing and moving part of the arrow

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.740 
grabbing and moving part of the arrow
snap<00:01:33.770> feature<00:01:34.040> so<00:01:34.880> instead<00:01:35.150> of<00:01:35.210> grabbing<00:01:35.480> the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
snap feature so instead of grabbing the

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.230 
snap feature so instead of grabbing the
window<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.260> moving<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.010> up<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> top<00:01:37.520> if<00:01:37.730> I

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
window and moving it up to the top if I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.040 
window and moving it up to the top if I
hit<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.540> Windows<00:01:38.870> key<00:01:38.900> +<00:01:39.380> i<00:01:39.590> hit<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.770> up<00:01:40.010> arrow

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
hit the Windows key + i hit the up arrow

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.780 
hit the Windows key + i hit the up arrow
you<00:01:42.050> see<00:01:42.260> it<00:01:42.380> just<00:01:42.620> resizes<00:01:43.220> it<00:01:43.340> right<00:01:43.520> there

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
you see it just resizes it right there

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.370 
you see it just resizes it right there
if<00:01:43.940> I<00:01:44.240> want<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.540> bring<00:01:44.690> it<00:01:44.810> right<00:01:44.930> back<00:01:44.990> down<00:01:45.170> I

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
if I want to bring it right back down I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.930 
if I want to bring it right back down I
can<00:01:45.650> hit<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.860> Windows<00:01:46.160> key<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.729> down

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
can hit the Windows key and the down

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.360 
can hit the Windows key and the down
arrow<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.740> it<00:01:48.740> brings<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.040> back<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.340> its

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
arrow and it brings it back to its

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.580 
arrow and it brings it back to its
original<00:01:49.580> size<00:01:50.060> if<00:01:50.360> i<00:01:50.750> want<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.080> go<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
original size if i want to go to the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.320
