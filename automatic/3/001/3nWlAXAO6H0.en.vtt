 tonight from the place of history to the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.110
 television a rather privileged place 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.940
 since the beginning of the year which are 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.229
 match your expectations if we have 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.909
 judge both before success 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.440

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.909
 documentary obviously in syria 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.890
 of apocalypse on France 2 is also 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.860
 more recently the documentary of France 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.750
 3 had about the bomb under the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.490
 France under the zinc bombs is then at 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.100
 beyond the commemorations that are 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.750
 particularly important in 2014 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.670
 that's fine we'll try to see 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.810
 how television can make live 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.000
 memory and we will devote 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.830
 their quest for your TV you go 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.899

 possible while respecting the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.110
 production requirements with character 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.030

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.470
 documentaries or of course it's 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.710
 for fiction and then we 'll see 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.320
 that it is self-evident and memories 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.810
 more painful and therefore often more 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.670
 difficult to evoke that others like to 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.920
