00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.649 
I'm rolling for my skills and my
abilities<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.880> how<00:01:06.090> much<00:01:06.240> equipment

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
abilities and for how much equipment

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.840 
abilities and for how much equipment
that<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> will<00:01:07.320> have

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that I will have

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.270 
that I will have
and<00:01:09.030> all<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.960> will<00:01:10.020> factor<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.799> later<00:01:11.009> on

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and all of this will factor in later on

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.310 
and all of this will factor in later on
because<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> high<00:01:13.200> enough

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
because if you have a high enough

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.460 
because if you have a high enough
toughness<00:01:14.060> then<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.360> means<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.720> creatures

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
toughness then that means that creatures

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.240 
toughness then that means that creatures
have<00:01:16.799> an<00:01:16.950> extremely<00:01:17.460> hard<00:01:17.909> time<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.390> actually

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
have an extremely hard time of actually

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.420 
have an extremely hard time of actually
even<00:01:20.250> attacking<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> first<00:01:21.479> place

even attacking you in the first place

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.830 
even attacking you in the first place
