00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.690
 Good, I'll show you how. 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:13.740
 here with the client 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:01:40.130
 two speakers of 15 000 votes each 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:01:40.130
 60 liter with 12 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:04:06.760
 inside even then I already had 95 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:06.760
 could rise 45 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.770
 forty three in height 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.410
 then you cuts you can make cash and 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:52.140
 then cement from this piece 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:52.140
 makes the cut of the steering wheel make of the wood 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:06:12.790
 it's not good at the ball 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.360
 I'll make another video later because I 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.360
 I can do 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.650
 the process then I make this video 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.530
 then I'll do another window video 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.170
 lined up i'll show some strength 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:44.890
 front here I have several video 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:48.390
 teaching to line but did not do as 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:53.250
 then this is a good measure both 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:07:09.550
 also use any other 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:07:10.360
 What you need to do is a great help. 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.530
 there 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.530
 Now my other video
