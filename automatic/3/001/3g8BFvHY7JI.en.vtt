00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.990 

so<00:00:14.410> let's<00:00:14.680> see<00:00:14.830> how<00:00:15.220> we<00:00:15.280> can<00:00:15.550> play<00:00:15.790> this

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
so let's see how we can play this

00:00:16.000 --> 00:03:56.810 
so let's see how we can play this
counting<00:00:16.570> a<00:00:16.660> plane

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.610 

that's<00:03:57.820> right<00:04:00.360> because<00:04:01.360> if<00:04:01.810> we<00:04:02.050> learn<00:04:02.380> to

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
that's right because if we learn to

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.790 
that's right because if we learn to
count<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:04.450> play<00:04:04.720> then<00:04:05.230> would<00:04:05.380> really<00:04:05.680> know

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
count and play then would really know

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.570 
count and play then would really know
where<00:04:06.040> we<00:04:06.190> are

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
where we are

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.370 
where we are
otherwise<00:04:07.120> there<00:04:07.570> is<00:04:07.660> doubt<00:04:08.460> rhythmic<00:04:09.460> and

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
otherwise there is doubt rhythmic and

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.130 
otherwise there is doubt rhythmic and
this<00:04:11.380> would<00:04:11.560> be<00:04:11.680> very<00:04:12.090> problematic

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
this would be very problematic

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.240 
this would be very problematic
maintenance<00:04:14.140> we<00:04:14.350> have<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.620> solution<00:04:15.100> this

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
maintenance we have the solution this

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.060 
maintenance we have the solution this
problem<00:04:15.580> by<00:04:15.730> learning<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.840> count<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.650> phrases

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
problem by learning to count the phrases

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:26.370 
problem by learning to count the phrases
contemplate<00:04:18.880> with<00:04:19.210> the<00:04:21.090> objective<00:04:25.230> point<00:04:26.230> of

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
contemplate with the objective point of

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.070 
contemplate with the objective point of
reference<00:04:26.640> which<00:04:27.640> is<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:27.850> metronome<00:04:28.420> this<00:04:28.960> is

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
reference which is the metronome this is

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.200 
reference which is the metronome this is
the<00:04:29.230> objective<00:04:31.680> measure<00:04:32.680> would<00:04:33.610> make<00:04:33.880> sure<00:04:34.060> if

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
the objective measure would make sure if

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.530 
the objective measure would make sure if
we<00:04:34.390> are<00:04:34.420> okay<00:04:34.840> or<00:04:35.020> not<00:04:35.170> we<00:04:35.500> can<00:04:36.060> write<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.330> then

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
we are okay or not we can write and then

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.390 
we are okay or not we can write and then
after<00:04:38.530> we<00:04:38.680> do<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:38.860> then<00:04:39.250> we<00:04:39.370> can<00:04:40.830> enlarge<00:04:41.830> the

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
after we do that then we can enlarge the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.710 
after we do that then we can enlarge the
phrases<00:04:43.030> or<00:04:44.100> make<00:04:45.100> it<00:04:45.250> longer<00:04:46.060> or<00:04:46.300> make<00:04:46.600> it

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
phrases or make it longer or make it

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.320 
phrases or make it longer or make it
shorter<00:04:46.750> change<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.860> remati<00:04:48.220> change<00:04:49.210> the

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
shorter change the remati change the

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.850 
shorter change the remati change the
thing<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.690> things<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:50.230> happen

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
thing that things that happen

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.800 
thing that things that happen
automatically<00:04:51.430> later<00:04:51.730> on<00:04:52.030> in<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.390> advanced

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
automatically later on in the advanced

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.630 
automatically later on in the advanced
stage<00:04:53.230> in<00:04:53.890> advanced<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.520> intermediate

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
stage in advanced and intermediate

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.890 
stage in advanced and intermediate
stages<00:04:55.980> but<00:04:56.980> first<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:58.300> will<00:04:58.480> happen<00:04:58.860> only

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
stages but first it will happen only

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.200 
stages but first it will happen only
provided<00:05:01.900> we<00:05:02.050> master<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.860> rhythm<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:04.060> to

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
provided we master the rhythm and to

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.960 
provided we master the rhythm and to
master<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.870> rhythm<00:05:05.200> we<00:05:05.530> need<00:05:05.680> to<00:05:05.860> count<00:05:06.070> first

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
master the rhythm we need to count first

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.180 
master the rhythm we need to count first
because<00:05:07.570> precisely<00:05:08.320> because<00:05:08.680> we<00:05:08.890> want<00:05:09.130> to

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
because precisely because we want to

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.830 
because precisely because we want to
avoid<00:05:09.400> counting<00:05:10.320> so<00:05:12.300> so<00:05:13.300> explain<00:05:13.660> before

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
avoid counting so so explain before

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.320 
avoid counting so so explain before
another<00:05:14.260> lesson<00:05:14.610> phrase<00:05:15.610> will<00:05:15.850> will<00:05:16.030> count

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
another lesson phrase will will count

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.540 
another lesson phrase will will count
here<00:05:16.630> abhi<00:05:16.900> whenever<00:05:17.650> we<00:05:17.860> are<00:05:17.890> playing<00:05:18.250> the

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
here abhi whenever we are playing the

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.920 
here abhi whenever we are playing the
phrase<00:05:18.820> properly<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:20.410> we<00:05:20.560> are<00:05:20.650> not<00:05:20.920> counting

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
phrase properly and we are not counting

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.020 
phrase properly and we are not counting
right<00:05:22.930> we<00:05:23.350> are<00:05:23.470> playing<00:05:23.740> it<00:05:23.950> nicely<00:05:24.400> with<00:05:24.700> the

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
right we are playing it nicely with the

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.050 
right we are playing it nicely with the
metal<00:05:25.390> fits<00:05:25.990> perfectly<00:05:26.560> well<00:05:26.800> aware<00:05:27.400> suppose

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
metal fits perfectly well aware suppose

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.540 
metal fits perfectly well aware suppose
we<00:05:28.210> are<00:05:28.300> not<00:05:28.480> counting<00:05:29.070> still<00:05:30.070> then<00:05:30.280> we<00:05:30.430> are

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
we are not counting still then we are

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.810 
we are not counting still then we are
counting<00:05:31.140> mentally<00:05:32.400> we're<00:05:33.400> counting

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
counting mentally we're counting

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.300 
counting mentally we're counting
mentally<00:05:34.270> or<00:05:34.420> even<00:05:34.810> unconsciously<00:05:35.440> otherwise

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
mentally or even unconsciously otherwise

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.160 
mentally or even unconsciously otherwise
how<00:05:36.580> is<00:05:36.760> that<00:05:36.910> you<00:05:37.090> are<00:05:37.120> fitting<00:05:37.600> the<00:05:37.720> phrasing

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
how is that you are fitting the phrasing

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.200 
how is that you are fitting the phrasing
suppose<00:05:38.620> you<00:05:38.890> are<00:05:38.980> counting<00:05:39.370> also<00:05:39.640> internally

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
suppose you are counting also internally

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.200 
suppose you are counting also internally
so<00:05:40.840> therefore<00:05:41.350> when<00:05:42.160> we<00:05:42.340> have<00:05:42.670> to<00:05:42.880> count

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
so therefore when we have to count

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:51.300 
so therefore when we have to count
loudly<00:05:48.060> then<00:05:49.060> that<00:05:49.360> that<00:05:50.050> loudly<00:05:50.440> counting<00:05:51.070> is

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
loudly then that that loudly counting is

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.659 
loudly then that that loudly counting is
the<00:05:51.580> external<00:05:52.540> representation<00:05:53.430> of<00:05:54.430> our

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
the external representation of our

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.510 
the external representation of our
internal<00:05:55.270> rhythm<00:05:56.669> and<00:05:57.669> then

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
internal rhythm and then

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.820 
internal rhythm and then
that<00:05:58.970> thing<00:05:59.539> there<00:05:59.780> when<00:06:00.319> we<00:06:00.500> are<00:06:00.650> not

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
that thing there when we are not

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.080 
that thing there when we are not
counting<00:06:01.129> it<00:06:01.789> will<00:06:02.569> still<00:06:02.900> be<00:06:02.930> there<00:06:03.289> existing

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
counting it will still be there existing

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.710 
counting it will still be there existing
in<00:06:05.090> demand<00:06:05.449> and<00:06:06.229> that's<00:06:07.159> how<00:06:07.340> we<00:06:07.539> master<00:06:08.539> the

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
in demand and that's how we master the

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.909 
in demand and that's how we master the
rhythm<00:06:09.370> then<00:06:10.539> that's<00:06:11.539> a<00:06:11.659> proper<00:06:12.050> way<00:06:12.229> to

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
rhythm then that's a proper way to

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.800 
rhythm then that's a proper way to
understanding<00:06:13.550> of<00:06:13.819> their<00:06:14.030> to<00:06:14.360> approach<00:06:14.629> the

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
understanding of their to approach the

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.920 
understanding of their to approach the
understanding<00:06:15.289> of<00:06:15.409> a<00:06:15.530> center<00:06:15.889> plane<00:06:16.099> and<00:06:16.340> also

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
understanding of a center plane and also

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.990 
understanding of a center plane and also
for<00:06:17.930> composition<00:06:18.590> is<00:06:18.770> very<00:06:18.830> useful<00:06:19.460> right<00:06:19.759> if

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
for composition is very useful right if

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.510 
for composition is very useful right if
you<00:06:20.150> compose<00:06:20.629> them<00:06:20.930> you<00:06:21.860> would<00:06:22.039> be<00:06:22.159> able<00:06:22.250> to

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
you compose them you would be able to

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.230 
you compose them you would be able to
see<00:06:22.870> very<00:06:23.870> clearly<00:06:24.229> where<00:06:24.740> you<00:06:24.919> are<00:06:25.069> which<00:06:26.000> bit

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
see very clearly where you are which bit

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.830 
see very clearly where you are which bit
you<00:06:26.419> are<00:06:26.599> and<00:06:26.840> then<00:06:26.990> therefore<00:06:27.259> you<00:06:27.770> can<00:06:28.550> make

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
you are and then therefore you can make

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.800 
you are and then therefore you can make
longer<00:06:29.840> the<00:06:29.960> fraser<00:06:30.280> or<00:06:31.280> shorter<00:06:31.849> can<00:06:32.630> do

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
longer the fraser or shorter can do
