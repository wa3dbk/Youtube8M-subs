00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
today I'm going to be showing you how to

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.339 
today I'm going to be showing you how to
make<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:08.040> perfect<00:00:08.610> iron<00:00:09.269> door<00:00:09.599> both<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.110> single

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
make the perfect iron door both a single

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.959 
make the perfect iron door both a single
door<00:00:11.340> version<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.540> double<00:00:13.320> door<00:00:13.469> version

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
door version and a double door version

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.840 
door version and a double door version
so<00:00:14.969> with<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.990> 1.6<00:00:16.590> Update<00:00:16.710> zombies<00:00:17.550> have

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
so with the 1.6 Update zombies have

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.590 
so with the 1.6 Update zombies have
gotten<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.449> lot<00:00:18.630> harder<00:00:18.869> there<00:00:20.270> you<00:00:21.270> know<00:00:21.390> they

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
gotten a lot harder there you know they

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.150 
gotten a lot harder there you know they
can<00:00:21.779> detect<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.320> from<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.590> lot<00:00:22.710> farther<00:00:22.980> away

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
can detect you from a lot farther away

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.120 
can detect you from a lot farther away
and<00:00:23.550> they<00:00:23.850> will<00:00:24.060> swarm<00:00:24.750> at<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.920> hit

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
and they will swarm at you if you hit

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.880 
and they will swarm at you if you hit
one<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.449> these<00:00:27.869> wooden<00:00:28.230> doors<00:00:28.500> if<00:00:28.769> you're

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
one and so these wooden doors if you're

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.830 
one and so these wooden doors if you're
playing<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.250> hard<00:00:29.550> will<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.300> cut<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.539> they

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
playing on hard will not cut it they

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.639 
playing on hard will not cut it they
will<00:00:31.080> break<00:00:31.380> down<00:00:32.000> pretty<00:00:33.000> frequently<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
will break down pretty frequently so the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.860 
will break down pretty frequently so the
obvious<00:00:34.980> choice<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.820> get<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.360> iron<00:00:36.660> door

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
obvious choice is to get the iron door

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.110 
obvious choice is to get the iron door
but<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.010> problem<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> iron<00:00:38.790> door<00:00:38.940> is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
but one problem with the iron door is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.240 
but one problem with the iron door is
that<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.660> know<00:00:39.750> only<00:00:39.989> stays<00:00:40.320> open<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
that it you know only stays open for a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.229 
that it you know only stays open for a
little<00:00:41.579> bit<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.000> time<00:00:43.700> you<00:00:44.700> know<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.090> you

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
little bit of time you know and if you

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.330 
little bit of time you know and if you
have<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.899> mean<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> single-player

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
have I mean here I'm on a single-player

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.560 
have I mean here I'm on a single-player
world<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:47.879> not<00:00:48.030> having<00:00:48.239> any<00:00:48.390> problems

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
world so I'm not having any problems

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.150 
world so I'm not having any problems
there<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.230> did<00:00:50.480> but<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:52.350> you're<00:00:52.530> having<00:00:52.649> any<00:00:52.860> leg

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
there I did but if you're having any leg

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.770 
there I did but if you're having any leg
issues<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.820> know<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.000> might<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.239> troubles

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
issues you know you might have troubles

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.180 
issues you know you might have troubles
actually<00:00:55.289> getting<00:00:55.559> through<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.890> door

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
actually getting through that door

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.330 
actually getting through that door
before<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.710> before<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.800> closes<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:01.309> here<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
before the before it closes so here I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.520 
before the before it closes so here I
have<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:05.030> perfect<00:01:06.030> iron<00:01:06.330> door<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.290> has

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
have a the perfect iron door as it has

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.789 
have a the perfect iron door as it has
been<00:01:07.740> dubbed<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.210> submitted<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.780> while<00:01:10.439> ago

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
been dubbed it was submitted a while ago

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.340 
been dubbed it was submitted a while ago
I<00:01:10.830> believe<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.729> when<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> when<00:01:12.479> 1.5<00:01:13.080> came

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
I believe like when the when 1.5 came

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.640 
I believe like when the when 1.5 came
out<00:01:13.470> by<00:01:13.830> someone<00:01:14.820> named<00:01:15.000> named<00:01:15.570> bad<00:01:16.140> man<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
out by someone named named bad man and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.590 
out by someone named named bad man and
it's<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.880> very<00:01:18.390> simple<00:01:18.720> design<00:01:20.210> this<00:01:21.210> actually

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
it's a very simple design this actually

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.190 
it's a very simple design this actually
is<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.759> bit<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.240> variation<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
is it's a little bit of a variation or a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.980 
is it's a little bit of a variation or a
little<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.650> improved<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.310> his<00:01:26.700> design<00:01:27.060> but

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
little bit improved on his design but

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.289 
little bit improved on his design but
what<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.259> door<00:01:28.500> does<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.009> when<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.909> push<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
what this door does is when you push the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.569 
what this door does is when you push the
button<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:31.020> door<00:01:31.229> will<00:01:31.409> actually<00:01:31.710> stay<00:01:32.100> open

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
button the door will actually stay open

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.999 
button the door will actually stay open
until<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.570> step<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.110> pressure<00:01:34.710> plate

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
until you step on this pressure plate

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.590 
until you step on this pressure plate
and<00:01:35.189> reset<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.210> switch<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:38.420> exiting<00:01:39.420> is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and reset the switch and then exiting is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.950 
and reset the switch and then exiting is
the<00:01:39.930> same<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.409> before<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.400> know<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.610> just

the same as before you know you just
walk<00:01:42.960> over<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> pressure<00:01:43.500> plate<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.040> opens<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
walk over the pressure plate it opens it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.120 
walk over the pressure plate it opens it
and<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:45.899> out<00:01:46.790> so<00:01:47.990> let's<00:01:48.990> build<00:01:49.770> this

blocks<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.329> the<00:02:19.599> corners<00:02:20.049> now<00:02:20.459> first<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.579> want

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
blocks in the corners now first you want

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.470 
blocks in the corners now first you want
to<00:02:21.760> do<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.359> put<00:02:23.319> redstone<00:02:23.739> torches<00:02:24.069> on<00:02:24.489> the

blocks as such and then underneath the
doorframe<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.849> want<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.420> repeater<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:33.930> on<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
doorframe you want a repeater and on the

redstone right on top of that block so

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.869 
redstone right on top of that block so
now<00:02:43.599> we<00:02:43.659> can<00:02:44.079> cover<00:02:44.709> this<00:02:44.950> up

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
now we can cover this up

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.819 
now we can cover this up
you<00:02:46.180> can<00:02:46.359> cover<00:02:46.569> it<00:02:46.689> the<00:02:47.319> whole<00:02:47.500> thing<00:02:47.680> up<00:02:47.799> with

you can cover it the whole thing up with

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.429 
you can cover it the whole thing up with
blocks<00:02:48.489> except<00:02:48.819> for<00:02:48.939> this<00:02:49.239> spot<00:02:49.629> this<00:02:50.169> spot

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
blocks except for this spot this spot

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.729 
blocks except for this spot this spot
you<00:02:50.470> do<00:02:50.769> need<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> half<00:02:51.340> slab<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:53.260> we<00:02:53.500> just

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
you do need a half slab and then we just

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.659 
you do need a half slab and then we just
need<00:02:53.919> to<00:02:54.129> place<00:02:54.730> our<00:02:54.909> door<00:02:56.159> place<00:02:57.159> our<00:02:57.340> button

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:57.669 
need to place our door place our button

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.289 
need to place our door place our button
down<00:02:57.939> here<00:02:57.970> on<00:02:58.419> the<00:02:58.569> right<00:02:58.810> on<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.680> bottom<00:02:59.709> and

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
down here on the right on the bottom and

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.780 
down here on the right on the bottom and
then<00:03:01.299> place<00:03:01.750> our<00:03:02.019> pressure<00:03:02.349> plate<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.549> that<00:03:03.579> is

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
then place our pressure plate so that is

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.449 
then place our pressure plate so that is
how<00:03:03.939> you<00:03:04.000> make<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:05.230> single<00:03:05.680> door<00:03:06.159> version

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
how you make the a single door version

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.589 
how you make the a single door version
of<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.780> perfect<00:03:08.379> iron<00:03:08.590> door<00:03:12.090> all<00:03:13.090> right<00:03:13.269> but

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
of the perfect iron door all right but

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.080 
of the perfect iron door all right but
sometimes<00:03:14.379> a<00:03:14.680> single<00:03:15.069> iron<00:03:15.370> door<00:03:15.639> is<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.790> little

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
sometimes a single iron door is a little

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.190 
sometimes a single iron door is a little
annoying<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.510> get<00:03:16.659> through<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.959> know<00:03:17.049> it's

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
annoying to get through you know it's

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.319 
annoying to get through you know it's
just<00:03:17.349> one<00:03:17.829> space<00:03:18.099> sometimes<00:03:18.879> it's<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.150> tight

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
just one space sometimes it's a tight

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.839 
just one space sometimes it's a tight
stair<00:03:19.599> feels<00:03:19.900> like<00:03:20.079> a<00:03:20.109> tight<00:03:20.349> squeeze<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.949> so

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
stair feels like a tight squeeze and so

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.509 
stair feels like a tight squeeze and so
here<00:03:22.419> I've<00:03:22.629> modified<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.530> perfect<00:03:24.010> iron<00:03:24.220> door

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
here I've modified the perfect iron door

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.949 
here I've modified the perfect iron door
to<00:03:24.909> work<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:25.359> a<00:03:25.870> double<00:03:26.260> door<00:03:27.299> situation<00:03:28.299> so

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
to work in a double door situation so

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.659 
to work in a double door situation so
here<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.409> works<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.769> same<00:03:29.799> you<00:03:30.310> push<00:03:30.519> the

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
here it works the same you push the

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.610 
here it works the same you push the
button<00:03:30.970> both<00:03:31.269> doors<00:03:31.569> open<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:32.199> they<00:03:32.349> stay

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
button both doors open and they stay

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.119 
button both doors open and they stay
open<00:03:33.090> until<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.569> step<00:03:35.260> on<00:03:35.439> this<00:03:35.829> right

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
open until you step on this right

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.270 
open until you step on this right
pressure<00:03:36.489> plate<00:03:37.229> so<00:03:38.229> that<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.799> one<00:03:39.010> thing<00:03:39.250> they

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
pressure plate so that is one thing they

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.210 
pressure plate so that is one thing they
have<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.699> be<00:03:39.970> careful<00:03:40.419> about<00:03:40.510> with<00:03:40.930> this

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
have to be careful about with this

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.309 
have to be careful about with this
design<00:03:42.220> if<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.389> step<00:03:43.659> on<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.870> Left<00:03:44.049> pressure

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
design if you step on the Left pressure

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.629 
design if you step on the Left pressure
plate<00:03:44.590> only<00:03:44.799> it<00:03:45.159> will<00:03:45.340> not<00:03:45.519> shut<00:03:46.049> but<00:03:47.159> it's<00:03:48.159> not

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
plate only it will not shut but it's not

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.249 
plate only it will not shut but it's not
a<00:03:48.669> big<00:03:49.030> problem<00:03:49.180> most<00:03:49.540> of<00:03:49.659> the<00:03:49.720> time<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:50.079> run

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:50.259 
a big problem most of the time you run

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:51.990 
a big problem most of the time you run
through<00:03:50.560> in<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.739> middle<00:03:50.859> and<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.639> will<00:03:51.759> close

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
through in the middle and it will close

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.210 
through in the middle and it will close
both<00:03:52.269> doors<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:53.500> I'll<00:03:53.590> show<00:03:53.739> you<00:03:53.769> how<00:03:53.859> to<00:03:53.949> make

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
both doors so I'll show you how to make

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.539 
both doors so I'll show you how to make
this<00:03:55.079> so<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.290> design<00:03:56.799> for<00:03:56.979> the<00:03:57.069> double<00:03:57.370> door

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
this so the design for the double door

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.149 
this so the design for the double door
is<00:03:57.790> very<00:03:58.569> similar<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.259> the<00:03:59.620> single<00:03:59.799> door<00:04:00.129> and

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
is very similar to the single door and

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.270 
is very similar to the single door and
uses<00:04:00.699> all<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.569> same<00:04:01.750> materials<00:04:02.229> that<00:04:03.099> we<00:04:03.250> have

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
uses all the same materials that we have

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.539 
uses all the same materials that we have
that<00:04:03.790> we<00:04:03.879> use<00:04:04.090> there<00:04:04.680> this<00:04:05.680> time<00:04:05.979> you<00:04:06.280> want<00:04:06.489> to

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
that we use there this time you want to

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.539 
that we use there this time you want to
make<00:04:06.729> a<00:04:06.939> three<00:04:07.449> by<00:04:07.629> four<00:04:08.009> hole<00:04:09.009> in<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.370> ground

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
make a three by four hole in the ground

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.920 
make a three by four hole in the ground
too<00:04:10.000> deep<00:04:10.209> again<00:04:10.509> and<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:12.220> want<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:13.120> block<00:04:13.659> in

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
too deep again and you want a block in

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.189 
too deep again and you want a block in
this<00:04:14.109> corner<00:04:14.530> again<00:04:15.269> but<00:04:16.269> instead<00:04:16.539> of<00:04:16.989> having

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
this corner again but instead of having

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.899 
this corner again but instead of having
a<00:04:17.259> block<00:04:17.500> in<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.709> back<00:04:17.799> corner<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.459> want<00:04:18.669> it

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
a block in the back corner you want it

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.509 
a block in the back corner you want it
up<00:04:18.940> in<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.359> front<00:04:19.659> corner<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.220> now<00:04:21.220> we'll

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
up in the front corner and now we'll

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.950 
up in the front corner and now we'll
place<00:04:21.729> our<00:04:21.880> redstone<00:04:22.510> torches

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
place our redstone torches

on all three sides coming over and into
this<00:04:36.259> block<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:36.860> then<00:04:37.819> a<00:04:38.090> repeater<00:04:38.539> going
