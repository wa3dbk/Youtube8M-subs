you can see in this case that the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.550 
you can see in this case that the
bearings<00:01:37.150> were<00:01:37.299> pretty<00:01:37.600> well<00:01:37.780> eaten<00:01:38.140> up<00:01:38.320> and

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
bearings were pretty well eaten up and

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.510 
bearings were pretty well eaten up and
definitely<00:01:39.490> needed<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.850> replacement<00:01:41.340> go<00:01:42.340> ahead

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
definitely needed a replacement go ahead

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.580 
definitely needed a replacement go ahead
and<00:01:42.640> remove<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:43.119> seals<00:01:43.479> from<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.020> outer<00:01:44.170> part

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
and remove the seals from the outer part

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.840 
and remove the seals from the outer part
of<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.740> bearings<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:47.950> you<00:01:48.009> can<00:01:48.280> pry<00:01:48.490> out<00:01:48.640> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
of the bearings now you can pry out the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.940 
of the bearings now you can pry out the
thrust<00:01:49.150> washer<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.780> radial<00:01:50.200> bearings<00:01:50.590> using

if<00:01:57.500> you've<00:01:58.280> got<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.520> propane<00:01:58.820> torch<00:01:59.330> it's<00:01:59.660> a

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
if you've got a propane torch it's a

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.510 
if you've got a propane torch it's a
good<00:01:59.870> idea<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.350> heat<00:02:00.530> up<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.860> outer<00:02:01.010> bearing

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.090 
good idea to heat up the outer bearing
assembly<00:02:02.140> makes<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.290> much<00:02:03.470> easier<00:02:03.530> for<00:02:04.010> the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
assembly makes it much easier for the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.580 
assembly makes it much easier for the
bearings<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:04.610> come<00:02:04.790> out

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.520

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.550 
you can see here that we've driven the
bearing<00:02:44.610> out<00:02:44.760> already<00:02:45.210> about<00:02:45.540> 3/8<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.260> an<00:02:46.410> inch

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
bearing out already about 3/8 of an inch

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.170 
bearing out already about 3/8 of an inch
then<00:02:47.070> we're<00:02:47.220> going<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.370> flip<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.790> swing<00:02:48.030> arm

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
then we're going to flip the swing arm

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.880 
then we're going to flip the swing arm
over<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.720> drive<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.140> out<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.410> rest<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.770> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
over and drive it out the rest of the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:59.910 
over and drive it out the rest of the
way<00:02:50.040> with<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.370> same<00:02:50.580> socket

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.350 

okay<00:03:00.920> here<00:03:01.190> we've<00:03:01.340> cleaned<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.820> inside<00:03:01.850> of

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
okay here we've cleaned the inside of

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.940 
okay here we've cleaned the inside of
the<00:03:02.450> swingarm<00:03:02.840> mating<00:03:03.320> surfaces<00:03:03.890> very

the swingarm mating surfaces very

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.040 
the swingarm mating surfaces very
thoroughly<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.970> now<00:03:05.240> we're<00:03:05.450> applying<00:03:05.660> some

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
thoroughly and now we're applying some

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.110 
thoroughly and now we're applying some
heat<00:03:06.260> with<00:03:06.290> some<00:03:06.710> propane<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:09.970> here's<00:03:10.970> the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
heat with some propane and here's the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.910 
heat with some propane and here's the
trick<00:03:11.390> if<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:11.780> want<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.140> make<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.410> job<00:03:12.650> easy

swingarm

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.490 

okay<00:03:35.510> there<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.900> have<00:03:36.020> it

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
okay there you have it

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.830 
okay there you have it
we<00:03:36.980> now<00:03:37.130> push<00:03:37.430> in<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.880> bearing<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.510> rest<00:03:38.690> of

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
we now push in the bearing the rest of

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.410 
we now push in the bearing the rest of
the<00:03:38.930> way<00:03:39.080> with<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.470> same<00:03:39.680> socket<00:03:40.300> get<00:03:41.300> it

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
the way with the same socket get it

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.660 
the way with the same socket get it
carefully<00:03:41.960> lined<00:03:42.200> up<00:03:42.380> exactly<00:03:42.590> evenly<00:03:43.310> with

carefully lined up exactly evenly with
the<00:03:43.820> edge<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.390> bearing<00:03:45.050> mating<00:03:45.470> surface

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
the edge of the bearing mating surface

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.640 
the edge of the bearing mating surface
and<00:03:46.420> then<00:03:47.420> we<00:03:47.510> go<00:03:47.660> ahead<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:47.900> lubricate<00:03:48.470> the

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
and then we go ahead and lubricate the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.830 
and then we go ahead and lubricate the
entire<00:03:48.680> bearing<00:03:49.490> with<00:03:49.970> some<00:03:50.150> good<00:03:50.330> quality

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
entire bearing with some good quality

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.569 
entire bearing with some good quality
lubricant

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.819 

now<00:03:55.579> we<00:03:55.640> are<00:03:56.000> pre<00:03:56.420> lubricating<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.200> thrust

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
now we are pre lubricating the thrust

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.849 
now we are pre lubricating the thrust
bearings<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:59.540> radial<00:03:59.959> bearings<00:04:00.379> and<00:04:00.709> the

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
bearings the radial bearings and the

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.729 
bearings the radial bearings and the
thrust<00:04:01.159> washers<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.200> putting<00:04:03.200> them<00:04:03.290> in<00:04:03.439> you

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
thrust washers and putting them in you

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.039 
thrust washers and putting them in you
can<00:04:03.769> see<00:04:04.069> from<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.340> diagram<00:04:04.519> here<00:04:05.239> that<00:04:05.359> would

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
can see from the diagram here that would

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.140 
can see from the diagram here that would
be<00:04:06.459> items<00:04:07.459> I<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:08.269> a<00:04:08.659> B<00:04:09.280> they<00:04:10.280> slide<00:04:10.670> right<00:04:10.939> in

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
be items I and a B they slide right in

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.430 
be items I and a B they slide right in
and<00:04:11.329> with<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.019> grease<00:04:12.230> they<00:04:12.500> stick

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.300 

and<00:04:16.600> next<00:04:17.600> comes<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.050> seal<00:04:18.320> which<00:04:19.280> is

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
and next comes the seal which is

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.880 
and next comes the seal which is
basically<00:04:19.850> all<00:04:20.090> there<00:04:20.300> is<00:04:20.420> to<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:20.930> it's<00:04:21.830> a

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
basically all there is to it and it's a

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.740 
basically all there is to it and it's a
good<00:04:22.010> idea<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.430> slide<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.850> caller<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.360> first

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
good idea to slide the caller in first

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.420 
good idea to slide the caller in first
but<00:04:24.080> we<00:04:24.200> did<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:24.470> without<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:24.980> time

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
but we did it without this time

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.120 
but we did it without this time
either<00:04:26.270> way<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.930> seal<00:04:27.200> pushes<00:04:27.620> in<00:04:27.770> easily

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
either way the seal pushes in easily

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.430 
either way the seal pushes in easily
with<00:04:28.280> your<00:04:28.310> thumb<00:04:28.730> put<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.480> end<00:04:29.630> cap<00:04:29.900> on<00:04:30.110> and

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
with your thumb put the end cap on and

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.330 
with your thumb put the end cap on and
you're<00:04:31.280> done<00:04:31.460> with<00:04:31.490> that<00:04:31.700> side<00:04:33.100> okay<00:04:34.100> here

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
you're done with that side okay here

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.220 
you're done with that side okay here
we're<00:04:34.520> putting<00:04:34.730> in<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.090> radial<00:04:35.510> bearing<00:04:35.900> and

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
we're putting in the radial bearing and

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.430 
we're putting in the radial bearing and
thrust<00:04:36.620> washers<00:04:37.070> on<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.340> other<00:04:37.490> side<00:04:37.790> and

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
thrust washers on the other side and

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.500 
thrust washers on the other side and
again<00:04:39.440> putting<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.280> seal<00:04:40.580> in<00:04:40.790> with<00:04:41.330> our

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
again putting the seal in with our

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.450 
again putting the seal in with our
fingers<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:43.000> it<00:04:44.000> pushes<00:04:44.300> in<00:04:44.600> pretty<00:04:44.870> easy<00:04:45.460> the

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
fingers and it pushes in pretty easy the

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.160 
fingers and it pushes in pretty easy the
collar<00:04:46.700> on<00:04:46.940> this<00:04:47.090> side<00:04:47.300> is<00:04:47.450> already<00:04:47.660> in<00:04:47.870> place

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
collar on this side is already in place

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.490 
collar on this side is already in place
we<00:04:48.920> put<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:49.250> outer<00:04:49.430> cap<00:04:49.820> on<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.360> we<00:04:51.200> are<00:04:51.290> good

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
we put the outer cap on and we are good

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.070 
we put the outer cap on and we are good
to<00:04:51.590> go<00:04:52.660> slide<00:04:53.660> in<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.990> collars<00:04:56.080> before

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
to go slide in the collars before

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.590 
to go slide in the collars before
putting<00:04:57.710> in<00:04:57.920> the<00:04:57.950> inner<00:04:58.310> seals<00:04:58.790> this<00:04:59.390> is

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
putting in the inner seals this is

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.020 
putting in the inner seals this is
important<00:05:00.170> as<00:05:00.350> you'll<00:05:00.620> see<00:05:00.830> here<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.850> could

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
important as you'll see here you could

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.540 
important as you'll see here you could
struggle<00:05:02.450> with<00:05:02.570> this<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.750> few<00:05:02.840> times<00:05:03.320> or<00:05:03.800> you

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
struggle with this a few times or you

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.250
