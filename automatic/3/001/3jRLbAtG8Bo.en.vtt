00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
little slow this is actually because i'm

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.880 
little slow this is actually because i'm
doing<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.120> screencast<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:06.989> screencast<00:04:07.709> is

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
doing a screencast and screencast is

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.160 
doing a screencast and screencast is
tied<00:04:08.129> in<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.370> gallery<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.930> makes

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
tied in the gallery and so it makes

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.610 
tied in the gallery and so it makes
gallery

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
gallery

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.170 
gallery
a<00:04:10.680> little<00:04:11.010> slow<00:04:11.220> I'm<00:04:11.519> trying<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.790> run<00:04:11.879> it<00:04:12.000> so

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
a little slow I'm trying to run it so

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.629 
a little slow I'm trying to run it so
let<00:04:12.810> me<00:04:12.870> just<00:04:13.019> pick<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.400> background<00:04:14.400> here<00:04:14.670> and

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
let me just pick a background here and

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.140 
let me just pick a background here and
get<00:04:17.639> back<00:04:17.820> out<00:04:18.290> that<00:04:19.290> here<00:04:19.949> we<00:04:20.040> go<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.459> then

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
get back out that here we go and then

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.010 
get back out that here we go and then
once<00:04:21.359> this<00:04:21.510> is<00:04:21.690> done<00:04:26.449> there<00:04:27.449> we<00:04:27.510> go<00:04:27.630> all<00:04:27.900> right

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
once this is done there we go all right

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.210 
once this is done there we go all right
now<00:04:28.139> we're<00:04:28.290> back<00:04:28.440> out<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.770> gallery<00:04:28.949> and

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
now we're back out of the gallery and

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.520 
now we're back out of the gallery and
things<00:04:29.820> are<00:04:30.030> running<00:04:30.600> back<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.050> normal<00:04:31.410> here

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
things are running back to normal here

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.250 
things are running back to normal here
so<00:04:32.190> it's<00:04:32.820> got<00:04:32.940> this<00:04:33.060> nice<00:04:33.240> CRT<00:04:33.810> when<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.110> when

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
so it's got this nice CRT when you when

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.659 
so it's got this nice CRT when you when
you<00:04:34.290> close<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.620> when<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:35.010> block<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.430> screen

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
you close it when you block the screen

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.210 
you close it when you block the screen
kind<00:04:36.180> of<00:04:36.240> looks<00:04:36.540> like<00:04:36.600> a<00:04:36.720> CRT<00:04:37.020> going<00:04:37.350> off<00:04:37.470> I've

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
kind of looks like a CRT going off I've

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.540 
kind of looks like a CRT going off I've
replaced<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.210> standard<00:04:39.660> slider<00:04:39.960> with

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
replaced the standard slider with

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.340 
replaced the standard slider with
widgetlocker<00:04:41.550> again<00:04:42.030> but<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:42.870> runs<00:04:43.050> real

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
widgetlocker again but it runs real

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.100 
widgetlocker again but it runs real
smooth<00:04:43.650> real<00:04:43.680> nice<00:04:44.419> let's<00:04:45.419> take<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.660> look<00:04:45.900> in

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
smooth real nice let's take a look in

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.920 
smooth real nice let's take a look in
about<00:04:46.590> phone<00:04:46.919> and<00:04:47.190> I'll<00:04:47.250> just<00:04:47.370> show<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.580> the

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
about phone and I'll just show you the

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.840 
about phone and I'll just show you the
they<00:04:48.930> use<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.289> Blitzkrieg<00:04:49.800> Colonel<00:04:50.220> I'm<00:04:50.699> not

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
they use the Blitzkrieg Colonel I'm not

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.159 
they use the Blitzkrieg Colonel I'm not
exactly<00:04:51.060> sure<00:04:51.240> what<00:04:51.449> they've<00:04:51.570> changed<00:04:51.810> in<00:04:52.080> the

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
exactly sure what they've changed in the

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.779 
exactly sure what they've changed in the
colonel<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.680> think<00:04:53.039> this<00:04:53.130> is<00:04:53.190> where<00:04:53.340> they<00:04:53.490> do

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
colonel I think this is where they do

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.010 
colonel I think this is where they do
all<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:54.030> overclock<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:54.720> stuff<00:04:54.870> like<00:04:54.960> that

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
all the overclock and stuff like that

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.320 
all the overclock and stuff like that
I'm<00:04:55.560> not<00:04:55.800> real<00:04:55.949> familiar<00:04:55.979> with<00:04:56.430> that<00:04:56.460> but<00:04:57.210> I'm

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
I'm not real familiar with that but I'm

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.700 
I'm not real familiar with that but I'm
exceeds<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.750> blitz<00:04:57.990> create<00:04:58.260> colonel<00:04:58.590> and

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
exceeds the blitz create colonel and

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.400 
exceeds the blitz create colonel and
i'll<00:04:59.340> show<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.580> i<00:04:59.699> did<00:04:59.850> a<00:04:59.940> benchmark<00:05:00.449> test<00:05:01.229> on

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
i'll show you i did a benchmark test on

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.170 
i'll show you i did a benchmark test on
this<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:01.860> a<00:05:02.150> pretty<00:05:03.150> decent<00:05:03.539> scores<00:05:03.800> 3678

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
this and a pretty decent scores 3678

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.189 
this and a pretty decent scores 3678
that's<00:05:06.180> with<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.330> ton<00:05:06.570> of<00:05:06.600> apps<00:05:06.810> but<00:05:07.020> you<00:05:07.110> can

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
that's with a ton of apps but you can

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.040 
that's with a ton of apps but you can
see<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.470> cpu<00:05:07.860> frequency<00:05:08.150> 15<00:05:09.150> 16<00:05:09.479> megahertz

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
see the cpu frequency 15 16 megahertz

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.830 
see the cpu frequency 15 16 megahertz
that's<00:05:10.320> 1.5<00:05:11.010> gigahertz<00:05:11.520> so<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:12.660> phones

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
that's 1.5 gigahertz so the phones

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.890 
that's 1.5 gigahertz so the phones
running<00:05:13.110> over<00:05:13.919> its<00:05:14.150> standard<00:05:15.150> one<00:05:15.690> gigahertz

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
running over its standard one gigahertz

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.260 
running over its standard one gigahertz
so<00:05:16.590> that's<00:05:16.770> just<00:05:16.800> a<00:05:16.979> real<00:05:17.190> quick<00:05:17.220> look<00:05:17.580> at<00:05:17.820> the

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
so that's just a real quick look at the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.210 
so that's just a real quick look at the
ginger<00:05:19.080> steam<00:05:19.349> rom<00:05:19.860> for<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.639> LG<00:05:20.910> Esteem
