00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
thing that could take you far it's also

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.450 
thing that could take you far it's also
what<00:01:13.860> how<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.909> manage<00:01:15.090> time<00:01:15.540> how<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.840> can

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.740 
what how you can manage time how you can
show<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.490> besides<00:01:18.090> studies<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.570> can

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
show that besides studies you can

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.940 
show that besides studies you can
progress<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.860> other<00:01:20.580> fields<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> think<00:01:22.380> it's

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
progress in other fields so I think it's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.350 
progress in other fields so I think it's
an<00:01:23.750> important<00:01:24.750> decision<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:27.060> start
