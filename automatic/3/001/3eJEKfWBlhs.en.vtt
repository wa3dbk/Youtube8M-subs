greetings this is Jeff I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.179> bring<00:00:03.480> procedural<00:00:04.170> lightning

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
you how to bring procedural lightning

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.760 
you how to bring procedural lightning
into<00:00:05.040> your<00:00:05.250> unity<00:00:06.029> scene<00:00:06.330> from<00:00:06.899> scratch<00:00:07.259> so

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
into your unity scene from scratch so

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.580 
into your unity scene from scratch so
let's<00:00:07.980> dive<00:00:08.189> right<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:09.110> the<00:00:10.110> first<00:00:10.349> thing

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
let's dive right in the first thing

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.290 
let's dive right in the first thing
you'll<00:00:10.830> want<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.130> do<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.370> download<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.849> asset

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
you'll want to do is download the asset

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.789 
you'll want to do is download the asset
from<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.570> asset<00:00:12.929> store<00:00:13.170> which<00:00:13.380> I've<00:00:13.559> already

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
from the asset store which I've already

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.330 
from the asset store which I've already
done

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
done

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.670 
done
that'll<00:00:15.240> create<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.690> procedural<00:00:16.230> lightning

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
that'll create this procedural lightning

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.750 
that'll create this procedural lightning
folder<00:00:18.289> inside<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> prefab<00:00:20.279> folder

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
folder inside of that is a prefab folder

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.570 
folder inside of that is a prefab folder
so<00:00:21.000> you'll<00:00:21.180> want<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.420> start<00:00:21.689> there<00:00:22.580> lightning

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
so you'll want to start there lightning

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.849 
so you'll want to start there lightning
bolt<00:00:23.789> script<00:00:24.180> does<00:00:24.480> all<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.840> magic<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.800> you

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
bolt script does all the magic so you

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.009 
bolt script does all the magic so you
want<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:26.580> drag<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.390> script<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.900> your

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
want to just drag that script to your

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.999 
want to just drag that script to your
main<00:00:28.199> camera<00:00:30.619> once<00:00:31.619> you've<00:00:31.740> done<00:00:31.949> that

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
main camera once you've done that

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.740 
main camera once you've done that
there's<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> couple<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.270> things<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.719> want

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
there's just a couple of things you want

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.490 
there's just a couple of things you want
to<00:00:33.960> set<00:00:34.170> up<00:00:34.399> lightening<00:00:35.399> material<00:00:36.230> goes<00:00:37.230> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
to set up lightening material goes to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.200 
to set up lightening material goes to
this<00:00:37.680> little<00:00:38.010> texture<00:00:38.460> here<00:00:38.670> with<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> blue

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
this little texture here with the blue

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.580 
this little texture here with the blue
and<00:00:39.570> white<00:00:41.570> there's<00:00:42.570> another<00:00:42.870> texture<00:00:43.350> for

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and white there's another texture for

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.529 
and white there's another texture for
our<00:00:43.710> mesh<00:00:43.890> renderer<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.969> right<00:00:45.149> next<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
our mesh renderer which is right next to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.400 
our mesh renderer which is right next to
it<00:00:45.719> lightning<00:00:45.989> bolt<00:00:46.440> material<00:00:47.340> mesh<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
it lightning bolt material mesh and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.680 
it lightning bolt material mesh and
finally<00:00:49.610> lightning<00:00:50.610> bolt<00:00:50.789> material<00:00:51.390> mesh

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
finally lightning bolt material mesh

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.540 
finally lightning bolt material mesh
with<00:00:52.140> no<00:00:52.379> glow<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> little<00:00:53.370> more

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
with no glow it's a little more

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.189 
with no glow it's a little more
optimized<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.420> lightning<00:00:54.629> doesn't<00:00:55.079> have

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
optimized if your lightning doesn't have

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.020 
optimized if your lightning doesn't have
any<00:00:55.350> glow

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
any glow

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.520 
any glow
now<00:00:57.030> I've<00:00:57.210> already<00:00:57.480> made<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> prefab<00:00:58.079> object

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
now I've already made a prefab object

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.590 
now I've already made a prefab object
that's<00:00:58.710> already<00:00:58.890> done<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.370> this<00:01:00.090> lightning

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that's already done this this lightning

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.650 
that's already done this this lightning
bolt<00:01:00.629> prefab<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.520> could<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.090> theory<00:01:03.359> just

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
bolt prefab so you could in theory just

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.320 
bolt prefab so you could in theory just
drag<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:03.989> into<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:04.949> scene<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:06.119> add

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
drag that into your scene and then add

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.020 
drag that into your scene and then add
your<00:01:06.570> script<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:08.490> I'm<00:01:08.670> gonna<00:01:08.939> just

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
your script to it but I'm gonna just

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.969 
your script to it but I'm gonna just
show<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.420> how<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.930> from<00:01:10.110> scratch<00:01:10.590> so

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
show you how to do this from scratch so

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.770 
show you how to do this from scratch so
that<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.729> how<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> materials

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that you can see how all the materials

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.690 
that you can see how all the materials
are<00:01:12.900> assigned<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.470> how<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.770> work<00:01:13.950> there's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
are assigned and how they work there's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.880 
are assigned and how they work there's
this<00:01:14.970> lightning<00:01:15.479> origin<00:01:15.990> particle<00:01:16.229> system

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
this lightning origin particle system

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.160 
this lightning origin particle system
and<00:01:17.070> lightning<00:01:17.520> glow<00:01:17.700> particle<00:01:18.210> system<00:01:18.570> you

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and lightning glow particle system you

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.539 
and lightning glow particle system you
probably<00:01:19.320> don't<00:01:19.680> need<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> worry<00:01:20.130> about<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
probably don't need to worry about the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.160 
probably don't need to worry about the
lightning<00:01:20.880> glow<00:01:21.060> particle<00:01:21.600> system<00:01:21.930> that's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
lightning glow particle system that's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.929 
lightning glow particle system that's
kind<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.590> legacy<00:01:22.920> thing<00:01:23.280> from<00:01:23.460> an<00:01:23.610> earlier

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
kind of a legacy thing from an earlier

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.749 
kind of a legacy thing from an earlier
version<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:25.080> Lightning<00:01:25.470> origin<00:01:26.100> however<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
version the Lightning origin however you

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.789 
version the Lightning origin however you
can<00:01:26.970> attach<00:01:27.299> your<00:01:27.509> own<00:01:27.659> particle<00:01:28.200> system<00:01:28.560> so

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
can attach your own particle system so

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.740 
can attach your own particle system so
wherever<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.430> lightning<00:01:29.820> bolts<00:01:30.119> start<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
wherever the lightning bolts start this

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.429 
wherever the lightning bolts start this
particle<00:01:31.320> system<00:01:31.350> will<00:01:31.890> get<00:01:32.130> fired<00:01:33.000> off<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:34.200> if

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
particle system will get fired off so if

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.140 
particle system will get fired off so if
you<00:01:34.590> want<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.100> something<00:01:35.400> happen<00:01:35.700> at<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
you want to have something happen at the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.270 
you want to have something happen at the
source<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.720> lightning<00:01:36.960> bolts<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:38.100> can

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
source of your lightning bolts you can

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.100 
source of your lightning bolts you can
assign<00:01:38.579> your<00:01:38.850> own<00:01:38.909> particle<00:01:39.509> system<00:01:39.900> there

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
assign your own particle system there

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.600 
assign your own particle system there
I'm<00:01:40.829> gonna<00:01:41.009> leave<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.670> none<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.060> now

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
I'm gonna leave that to none for now

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.039 
I'm gonna leave that to none for now
okay<00:01:44.610> I've<00:01:44.759> got<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> lightning<00:01:45.479> bolt<00:01:45.659> script

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
okay I've got the lightning bolt script

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.510 
okay I've got the lightning bolt script
but<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.320> don't<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:46.920> any<00:01:47.250> way<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
but I don't really have any way to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.149 
but I don't really have any way to
summon<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.090> lightning<00:01:48.540> bolt<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.680> order<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
summon a lightning bolt so in order to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.219 
summon a lightning bolt so in order to
do<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.490> I'm<00:01:50.759> gonna<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.240> create<00:01:51.509> my<00:01:52.020> own

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
do that I'm gonna have to create my own

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.920 
do that I'm gonna have to create my own
script<00:01:52.770> I'm<00:01:53.670> thinking<00:01:54.119> whenever<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.899> user

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
script I'm thinking whenever the user

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.929 
script I'm thinking whenever the user
presses<00:01:55.590> spacebar<00:01:56.159> we'll<00:01:56.399> create<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
presses spacebar we'll create a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.230 
presses spacebar we'll create a
lightning<00:01:57.240> bolt<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.890> let's<00:01:59.040> create<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.700> c-sharp

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
lightning bolt so let's create a c-sharp

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.199 
lightning bolt so let's create a c-sharp
script<00:02:01.310> video<00:02:02.310> demo<00:02:05.540> let's<00:02:06.540> go<00:02:06.750> over<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.110> that

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
script video demo let's go over to that

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.349 
script video demo let's go over to that
and<00:02:09.299> how<00:02:10.140> about<00:02:10.289> we<00:02:10.709> make<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> function<00:02:11.549> good

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:12.359 
and how about we make a function good

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:17.149 
and how about we make a function good
coding<00:02:12.959> practices<00:02:13.609> all<00:02:14.609> call<00:02:15.120> lightning<00:02:16.159> and

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
coding practices all call lightning and

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.880 
coding practices all call lightning and
then<00:02:17.370> whenever<00:02:17.579> user<00:02:18.090> presses<00:02:19.519> spacebar<00:02:21.890> we

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
then whenever user presses spacebar we

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.459 
then whenever user presses spacebar we
will<00:02:23.069> call<00:02:23.519> lightning

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
will call lightning

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.959 
will call lightning
now<00:02:25.469> that<00:02:25.650> function<00:02:26.069> doesn't<00:02:26.250> do<00:02:26.519> anything

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969 
now that function doesn't do anything

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.270 
now that function doesn't do anything
yet<00:02:27.209> because<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.989> need<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.739> go<00:02:28.889> get<00:02:29.040> my

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
yet because I need to go get my

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.580 
yet because I need to go get my
lightning<00:02:29.730> bolt<00:02:29.760> script<00:02:30.599> from<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.079> demo

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
Lightning is with this generation slider

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.849 
Lightning is with this generation slider
6<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.209> pretty<00:03:00.480> good<00:03:00.719> number<00:03:01.109> for<00:03:01.139> a<00:03:01.379> balance

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
6 is a pretty good number for a balance

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.780 
6 is a pretty good number for a balance
of<00:03:02.010> performance<00:03:02.129> and<00:03:02.819> appearance<00:03:04.519> let's<00:03:05.519> turn

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
of performance and appearance let's turn

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.580 
of performance and appearance let's turn
down<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.030> glow<00:03:06.510> with<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.840> little<00:03:07.319> bit<00:03:07.439> oh

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
down that glow with a little bit oh

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.970 
down that glow with a little bit oh
that's<00:03:07.889> looking<00:03:08.069> pretty<00:03:08.280> good<00:03:09.530> 5<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.739> one<00:03:10.889> of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
that's looking pretty good 5 is one of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.399 
that's looking pretty good 5 is one of
my<00:03:11.099> favorite<00:03:11.459> numbers<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.060> 3/4<00:03:12.689> of<00:03:12.719> a<00:03:12.959> second

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
my favorite numbers and 3/4 of a second

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.860 
my favorite numbers and 3/4 of a second
so<00:03:13.650> now<00:03:14.040> we're<00:03:14.280> going<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.489> do<00:03:14.699> five<00:03:15.359> lightning

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
so now we're going to do five lightning

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.119 
so now we're going to do five lightning
bolts<00:03:16.199> over<00:03:16.590> 3/4<00:03:17.519> of<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.729> second<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.620> now<00:03:19.799> as<00:03:19.979> I'm

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
bolts over 3/4 of a second so now as I'm

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.800 
bolts over 3/4 of a second so now as I'm
hitting<00:03:20.280> spacebar<00:03:20.699> we're<00:03:21.120> getting<00:03:21.419> kind<00:03:21.629> of

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
hitting spacebar we're getting kind of

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.949 
hitting spacebar we're getting kind of
this<00:03:22.069> multi<00:03:23.069> bolt<00:03:23.370> static<00:03:24.000> discharge<00:03:24.540> effect

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
this multi bolt static discharge effect

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.270 
this multi bolt static discharge effect
which<00:03:25.229> is<00:03:25.409> pretty<00:03:25.650> cool

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
which is pretty cool

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.219 
which is pretty cool
some<00:03:26.909> of<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.150> may<00:03:27.299> not<00:03:27.449> like<00:03:27.659> it<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.959> spread

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
some of you may not like it to spread

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.469 
some of you may not like it to spread
out<00:03:28.409> as<00:03:28.590> much<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.189> if<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.609> lower<00:03:29.879> the<00:03:30.000> chaos

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
out as much so if you lower the chaos

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.890 
out as much so if you lower the chaos
factor<00:03:31.019> now<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.069> got<00:03:32.400> kind<00:03:32.669> of<00:03:32.900> more

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
factor now you got kind of more

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.020 
factor now you got kind of more
normalized<00:03:34.530> lightning<00:03:35.189> or<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.579> can<00:03:35.760> spread

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
normalized lightning or you can spread

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.229 
normalized lightning or you can spread
it<00:03:36.180> out<00:03:36.299> with<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.569> high<00:03:36.810> chaos<00:03:37.739> factor<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:39.120> up

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
it out with a high chaos factor it's up

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.110 
it out with a high chaos factor it's up
to<00:03:39.479> you<00:03:39.599> I'm<00:03:40.409> gonna<00:03:40.500> leave<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.829> as<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.939> right

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
to you I'm gonna leave that as is right

there make the trunk with a little

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.330 
there make the trunk with a little
bigger<00:03:44.989> and<00:03:45.989> now<00:03:46.169> I'm<00:03:46.590> pretty<00:03:46.799> happy<00:03:47.220> with

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
bigger and now I'm pretty happy with

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.800 
bigger and now I'm pretty happy with

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
press the spacebar it's going to call

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.339 
press the spacebar it's going to call
call<00:04:07.769> lightning<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:09.239> right<00:04:09.599> here<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.139> going

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
call lightning this right here is going

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.080 
call lightning this right here is going
to<00:04:10.439> look<00:04:10.590> at<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.829> game<00:04:11.009> object<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.669> pull<00:04:11.849> that

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
to look at the game object and pull that

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.420 
to look at the game object and pull that
lightning<00:04:12.540> bolt<00:04:12.569> script<00:04:13.199> off<00:04:13.439> which

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
lightning bolt script off which

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.310 
lightning bolt script off which
thankfully<00:04:14.970> was<00:04:15.449> the<00:04:15.569> very<00:04:15.780> first<00:04:16.049> thing<00:04:16.289> we

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
thankfully was the very first thing we

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.740 
thankfully was the very first thing we
did<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.979> add<00:04:17.130> that

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
did is to add that

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.190 
did is to add that
the<00:04:17.900> main<00:04:18.079> camera<00:04:18.650> in<00:04:19.130> our<00:04:19.900> switch<00:04:20.900> back<00:04:21.170> over

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
the main camera in our switch back over

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.800 
the main camera in our switch back over
to<00:04:21.530> video<00:04:21.980> scene<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:23.150> look<00:04:23.390> at<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.600> main

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
to video scene so look at the main

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.810 
to video scene so look at the main
camera<00:04:24.140> we<00:04:24.500> already<00:04:24.800> added<00:04:25.160> lightning<00:04:25.580> bolt

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
camera we already added lightning bolt

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.440 
camera we already added lightning bolt
script<00:04:26.270> so<00:04:27.170> now<00:04:27.410> before<00:04:28.250> we<00:04:28.520> run<00:04:28.880> this<00:04:29.030> we<00:04:29.240> want

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
script so now before we run this we want

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.330 
script so now before we run this we want
to<00:04:29.540> put<00:04:29.630> our<00:04:29.870> demo<00:04:30.110> script<00:04:30.470> on<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:30.980> that<00:04:31.160> that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
to put our demo script on so that that

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.410 
to put our demo script on so that that
keyboard<00:04:31.640> handler

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
keyboard handler

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.580 
keyboard handler
runs<00:04:32.950> and<00:04:33.950> if<00:04:34.100> I've<00:04:34.250> done<00:04:34.490> everything<00:04:34.820> right

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
runs and if I've done everything right

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.190 
runs and if I've done everything right
we<00:04:36.590> should<00:04:36.860> get<00:04:37.040> a<00:04:37.100> lightning<00:04:37.640> bolt<00:04:37.820> here<00:04:38.330> keep

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
we should get a lightning bolt here keep

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.920 
we should get a lightning bolt here keep
your<00:04:39.350> fingers<00:04:39.710> crossed<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.750> we<00:04:41.750> have

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
your fingers crossed and we have

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.660 
your fingers crossed and we have
lightning<00:04:42.200> it's<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.830> miracle<00:04:43.280> now<00:04:43.460> you'll

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
lightning it's a miracle now you'll

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.240 
lightning it's a miracle now you'll
notice<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:44.060> this<00:04:44.450> lightning<00:04:45.140> looks<00:04:45.830> the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
notice that this lightning looks the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.490 
notice that this lightning looks the
same<00:04:46.640> every<00:04:47.240> time<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.810> that's<00:04:47.960> because<00:04:48.380> our

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
same every time and that's because our

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.540 
same every time and that's because our
script<00:04:48.980> assigned<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.790> seed<00:04:50.180> value<00:04:51.430> let's<00:04:52.430> go

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
script assigned a seed value let's go

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.240 
script assigned a seed value let's go
back<00:04:52.730> to<00:04:52.880> visual<00:04:53.060> studio<00:04:53.740> here's<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.950> seed

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
back to visual studio here's the seed

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.940 
back to visual studio here's the seed
that<00:04:55.280> I<00:04:55.550> got<00:04:55.820> when<00:04:56.030> I<00:04:56.060> copied<00:04:56.600> my<00:04:56.780> lightning<00:04:57.290> if

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
that I got when I copied my lightning if

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.520 
that I got when I copied my lightning if
you<00:04:58.160> don't<00:04:58.340> like<00:04:58.580> that<00:04:58.910> change<00:04:59.750> this<00:05:00.140> system

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
you don't like that change this system

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.750 
you don't like that change this system
random<00:05:01.460> here<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:02.000> just<00:05:02.270> be<00:05:02.950> like<00:05:03.950> that<00:05:04.430> and

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
random here to just be like that and

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.500 
random here to just be like that and
that<00:05:05.180> way<00:05:05.390> you'll<00:05:05.630> get<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:05.900> completely<00:05:06.710> random

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
that way you'll get a completely random

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.830 
that way you'll get a completely random
lightning<00:05:08.510> bolt<00:05:08.750> every<00:05:09.110> time<00:05:09.380> so<00:05:10.510> let's<00:05:11.510> try

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
lightning bolt every time so let's try

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.520 
lightning bolt every time so let's try
that<00:05:12.050> see<00:05:12.500> how<00:05:12.620> that<00:05:12.830> looks

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.950 

and<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.310> still<00:05:19.670> looks<00:05:19.940> the<00:05:20.060> same<00:05:20.210> so<00:05:20.780> we've

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
and it still looks the same so we've

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.100 
and it still looks the same so we've
obviously<00:05:21.140> done<00:05:21.560> something<00:05:21.800> wrong<00:05:23.110> probably

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
obviously done something wrong probably

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.520 
obviously done something wrong probably
we<00:05:24.590> need<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:24.980> change<00:05:26.080> probably<00:05:27.080> we<00:05:27.170> just<00:05:27.200> need

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
we need to change probably we just need

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.830 
we need to change probably we just need
to<00:05:27.620> rebuild<00:05:28.010> and<00:05:28.340> save<00:05:28.580> this<00:05:28.850> script<00:05:29.180> if<00:05:29.480> I<00:05:29.630> had

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
to rebuild and save this script if I had

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:37.450 
to rebuild and save this script if I had
to<00:05:29.990> guess<00:05:31.300> all<00:05:32.300> right<00:05:32.600> let's<00:05:32.840> try<00:05:33.080> that<00:05:36.460> and

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
to guess all right let's try that and

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.550 
to guess all right let's try that and
there<00:05:37.820> we<00:05:37.970> go<00:05:38.150> we<00:05:38.390> have<00:05:38.420> completely<00:05:39.170> random

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
there we go we have completely random

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.200 
there we go we have completely random
lightning<00:05:39.890> that's<00:05:40.070> one<00:05:40.340> thing<00:05:40.580> that<00:05:40.610> unity

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
lightning that's one thing that unity

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.990 
lightning that's one thing that unity
doesn't<00:05:42.050> it's<00:05:42.770> not<00:05:42.890> very<00:05:43.250> intuitive<00:05:43.580> if<00:05:43.910> you

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
doesn't it's not very intuitive if you

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.480 
doesn't it's not very intuitive if you
don't<00:05:44.180> actually<00:05:44.570> save<00:05:45.110> your<00:05:45.500> script<00:05:45.950> to<00:05:46.190> disk

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
don't actually save your script to disk

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.880 
don't actually save your script to disk
it<00:05:47.180> can<00:05:47.360> be<00:05:47.510> kind<00:05:47.780> of<00:05:47.840> confusing<00:05:47.990> when<00:05:48.740> you

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
it can be kind of confusing when you

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.130 
it can be kind of confusing when you
typed<00:05:49.160> some<00:05:49.550> code<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:50.120> it's<00:05:50.720> not<00:05:50.930> actually

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
typed some code and it's not actually

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.130 
typed some code and it's not actually
running<00:05:51.770> so<00:05:52.640> now<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.360> can<00:05:53.660> see<00:05:53.840> we're<00:05:54.020> getting

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
running so now you can see we're getting

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.200 
running so now you can see we're getting
some<00:05:54.500> great<00:05:54.770> random<00:05:55.310> looking<00:05:55.550> Lightning

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
some great random looking Lightning

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.810 
some great random looking Lightning
pasted<00:05:57.200> it<00:05:57.410> in<00:05:57.560> from<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:57.950> designer<00:05:58.370> view<00:05:58.640> it

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
pasted it in from that designer view it

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.970 
pasted it in from that designer view it
looks<00:05:58.970> exactly<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.660> same<00:05:59.840> as<00:06:00.290> it<00:06:00.470> did<00:06:00.620> in<00:06:00.800> that

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
looks exactly the same as it did in that

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.260 
looks exactly the same as it did in that
configuration<00:06:01.370> scene<00:06:03.700> that's<00:06:04.700> pretty<00:06:05.060> much

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
configuration scene that's pretty much

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.790 
configuration scene that's pretty much
it<00:06:05.570> that's<00:06:05.690> all<00:06:05.930> you<00:06:06.110> need<00:06:06.260> to<00:06:06.380> do<00:06:06.500> to<00:06:06.680> get

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
it that's all you need to do to get

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.760 
it that's all you need to do to get
lightning<00:06:07.130> into<00:06:07.580> your<00:06:07.730> scene<00:06:08.350> you<00:06:09.350> can<00:06:09.530> go<00:06:09.710> to

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
lightning into your scene you can go to

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.300 
lightning into your scene you can go to
that<00:06:09.890> script<00:06:10.430> and<00:06:10.550> tweak<00:06:10.880> things<00:06:11.150> like<00:06:11.480> the

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
that script and tweak things like the

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.820 
that script and tweak things like the
start<00:06:13.310> location<00:06:13.870> so<00:06:14.870> now<00:06:15.080> this<00:06:15.260> lightning<00:06:15.740> is

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
start location so now this lightning is

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.950 
start location so now this lightning is
going<00:06:15.860> to<00:06:16.070> be<00:06:16.220> a<00:06:16.250> little<00:06:16.490> bit<00:06:16.730> of<00:06:16.850> a<00:06:16.940> diagonal<00:06:17.360> I

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
going to be a little bit of a diagonal I

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.700 
going to be a little bit of a diagonal I
think<00:06:18.680> I<00:06:19.040> did<00:06:19.550> that<00:06:19.580> all<00:06:19.850> right<00:06:20.030> I<00:06:20.710> probably

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
think I did that all right I probably

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.310 
think I did that all right I probably
didn't<00:06:22.070> save<00:06:22.280> the<00:06:22.550> script<00:06:22.820> huh<00:06:23.120> see<00:06:24.110> there's

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
didn't save the script huh see there's

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.340 
didn't save the script huh see there's
that<00:06:24.760> little<00:06:25.760> confusing<00:06:26.240> there<00:06:28.900> so<00:06:29.900> yeah<00:06:30.080> now

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
that little confusing there so yeah now

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.050 
that little confusing there so yeah now
we're<00:06:30.530> coming<00:06:30.919> in<00:06:31.100> from<00:06:31.430> the<00:06:31.610> side<00:06:31.820> a<00:06:31.850> little

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
we're coming in from the side a little

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.440 
we're coming in from the side a little
bit<00:06:32.479> if<00:06:32.780> we<00:06:32.930> make<00:06:33.140> this<00:06:33.490> more<00:06:34.490> extreme<00:06:35.090> and

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
bit if we make this more extreme and

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.219 
bit if we make this more extreme and
save<00:06:36.640> we<00:06:37.640> can<00:06:37.880> make<00:06:38.210> our<00:06:38.390> lightning<00:06:38.600> be<00:06:38.900> even

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
save we can make our lightning be even

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.909 
save we can make our lightning be even
more<00:06:39.410> diagonal<00:06:41.140> and<00:06:42.140> now<00:06:42.290> we're<00:06:42.470> coming<00:06:42.800> in

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
more diagonal and now we're coming in

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.440 
more diagonal and now we're coming in
from<00:06:43.130> the<00:06:43.280> side<00:06:43.520> a<00:06:43.550> little<00:06:43.850> bit<00:06:43.970> and<00:06:44.180> you<00:06:44.270> can

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
from the side a little bit and you can

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.640 
from the side a little bit and you can
just<00:06:44.690> play<00:06:45.350> with<00:06:45.380> these<00:06:45.740> numbers<00:06:47.410> once<00:06:48.410> you've

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
just play with these numbers once you've

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.880 
just play with these numbers once you've
pasted<00:06:49.130> in<00:06:49.280> your<00:06:49.460> script<00:06:49.910> once<00:06:50.450> you<00:06:50.900> can<00:06:51.140> kind

would end up doing is making those
parameters<00:07:10.250> of<00:07:10.460> this<00:07:10.610> call<00:07:10.880> lightning

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
parameters of this call lightning

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.620 
parameters of this call lightning
function<00:07:11.870> so<00:07:12.740> that<00:07:12.770> it's<00:07:13.340> easy<00:07:14.000> to<00:07:14.360> move<00:07:14.570> the

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.630 
function so that it's easy to move the
