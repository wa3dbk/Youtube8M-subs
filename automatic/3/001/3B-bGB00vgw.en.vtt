00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.089
 on YouTube I bring you a video of these 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.950
 things that our friends sent us 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.850
 rather, they sponsored us 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.640
 bardem friends that's why nobody is 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.580
 where you can buy accessories more been 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.749
 accessories for your system and when 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.119
 you speak is today our talking about 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:23.699
 horns or so I'm talking about 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.909
 things like carpet to be able to upholster 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.529
 your drawer to wired cable you can also 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.169
 find it there and it's super cheap 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.609
 it was good price the truth and this 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.190
 also from here as salaries are 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:37.800
 products that are taking out months like 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.660
 I said it's good and as good to open it as 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.219
 You can see the box was damaged in a hole 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.170
 this side step for this side the camera 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.480
 can you see Daniel has a life this 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 side but then let's do it ourselves 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.079
 we are going to administer it or it is going to 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.910
 be like unboxing because it's already 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.469
 practically open but good is that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.630
 open it first, you have to open it 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.180
 Madrid 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.750
 i 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.750
 we open 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.870
 for this 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.870
 we are going to be two big rolls 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.340
 carpet 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:25.720
 for this gray carpet and this rug 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.720
 as drawers inside 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.270
 are three plants of your glue that 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.270
 supposedly it is a very good glue 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.620
 in your drawer and everything when I make my drawer 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.320
 for what is going to buy everything 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.600
 and I think there is one thing that does not stay 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.600
 inside the box completely 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.130
 and he left 10 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.469
 but 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.899
 and with these men also also this 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.890
 video is powerful and you can put it to 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.479
 your what are they called 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.160
 you can not put it to your 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:12.120
 amplifiers if they stick to the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.520
 to the summit is to return is a black and 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.170
 no gray to use black for my drawer 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.420
 and the gray for the raca for the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.640
 amplifiers and all that and there is the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.920
 rubber to stop this and there is a mother 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.130
 how and what you stick to the amplifier the 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.180
 parta warlock under the applicator and stick it 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.620
 directly to the drawer so you do not have 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.860
 that supposedly authorize it as I said 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.660
 all this holds very well all the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.970
 quotas but is made for sounds of 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.410
 cardio well and good then this no more than 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.510

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.430

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.960

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.090

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.300
