00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.330
 or the double maniacs we are here with 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.030
 belle coz and well let's see a little bit 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.410
 how it works we enter through the passive of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.240
 organic construction consists of when 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.360
 a target is hit by three 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.940
 skills bell with the following 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.240
 next skill 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.880
 inflicts real damage then q 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.270
 bell with a plasma beam shot that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.710
 inflicts 160 base damage at level 2 on 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.050
 this case 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.149
 implies a slowdown of 70 per 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.500
 cent is decreasing that long value 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.500
 1.5 seconds 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.790
 you can activate it whenever you want and the cv 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.410
 then the w 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.630
 creates a vacuum crack 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.650
 and it explodes twice once when the 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:01:00.650
 active and the other after a few seconds 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:03.210
 the two explosions create impacts create 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.890
 of organic constructions or the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.410
 passive to then give the real damage 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.970
 and then the aee is simply a stud 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:14.160
 that also affects magic damage and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.100
 also the good thing about stability is that 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.180
 the characters close to warlike are 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.180
 slightly displaced 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.080
 and then the last radio disintegrator of 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.530
 living beings channel an energy ray 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.880
 that you can control it with the mouse and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.360
 level 1 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.490
 the enemies are also slowing down 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.140
 at level 1 because you have 500 damage it 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.700
 magical which seems to me a savage 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.700
 well let's see the q 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.420
 there is the passive the other and the other 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.020
 passive 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.729
 there is the ae and now we go with the wiki 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.729
 You see how he handles it with the mouse 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.720
 let's see control 1 the dance and everything 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.360
 this 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.670
 we see with war machine that is the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.090
 skin that has belkov there is the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.090
 control and not 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.940
 we went to control 2 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.940
 which is very similar to this ski 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.370
 to control 3 which is the same in both 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.180
 and control 4 have not yet gotten the 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.180
 laughter 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.970
 but well now let's see the 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.620
 skills with the skin machine 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.620
 war we go through with the q 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.480
 the w 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.249
 and now the last 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.340
 and we see how it slows me down 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.430
 and there we see how it dies 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.560
 will show us the recall now 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.220
 there is where the normal skin 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.220
 it was older and the truth 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.599
 and now let's see the recall of in this 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.599
 case in the corner of the cor 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.520
 the truth is pretty cool 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.280
 and there it is there is it comes out of the void 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.380
 well to say it well, this is all 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.630
 I hope you like the character I 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.260
 I'll buy it as soon as it comes out and 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.260
 see you soon
