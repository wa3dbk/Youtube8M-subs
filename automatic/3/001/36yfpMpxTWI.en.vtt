and<00:00:13.380> then<00:00:13.500> we<00:00:13.590> get<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.769> general<00:00:14.160> idea<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.670> what

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
and then we get a general idea of what

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.540 
and then we get a general idea of what
we<00:00:15.690> kind<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.960> want<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.230> do<00:00:16.379> with<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.590> sometimes

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
we kind of want to do with it sometimes

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.090 
we kind of want to do with it sometimes
use<00:00:17.789> six<00:00:17.940> or<00:00:18.119> music<00:00:18.720> gets<00:00:18.869> really<00:00:19.230> good<00:00:19.410> for

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
use six or music gets really good for

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.519 
use six or music gets really good for
writing<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.640> story<00:00:20.850> line<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.350> then<00:00:22.350> other

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
writing a story line and then other

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.960 
writing a story line and then other
times<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.220> better<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.460> keep<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
times it's just better to keep it as a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.279 
times it's just better to keep it as a
group<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.480> just<00:00:24.539> dancing<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> music

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
group and just dancing to the music

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.710 
group and just dancing to the music
instead<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.970> next<00:00:27.300> step<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.599> our<00:00:27.660> process

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
instead the next step in our process

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.620 
instead the next step in our process
after<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.529> write<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.710> music<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.429> land<00:00:30.269> really

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
after we write the music is land really

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.120 
after we write the music is land really
and<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.199> where<00:00:31.349> we<00:00:31.470> stand<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.890> land

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and this is where we stand on the land

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.319 
and this is where we stand on the land
and<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.700> me<00:00:33.180> perform<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:34.440> we're<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.980> do

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
and we me perform what we're going to do

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.490 
and we me perform what we're going to do
while<00:00:36.329> we're<00:00:36.480> listening<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> music<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
while we're listening to the music and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.369 
while we're listening to the music and
that's<00:00:38.430> anything<00:00:38.940> from<00:00:39.210> moving<00:00:39.840> our<00:00:39.960> arms<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that's anything from moving our arms to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.590 
that's anything from moving our arms to
how<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.680> would<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> water<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.510> we

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
how it would be in the water to what we

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.389 
how it would be in the water to what we
would<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.750> doing<00:00:42.870> upside<00:00:43.559> down<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.920> hybrid

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
would be doing upside down and a hybrid

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.590 
would be doing upside down and a hybrid
which<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.760> where<00:00:44.910> our<00:00:44.940> legs<00:00:45.210> are<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
which is where our legs are out of the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.139 
which is where our legs are out of the
water<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.489> where<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.670> put<00:00:47.850> our<00:00:47.910> arms

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
water and that is where we put our arms

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.970 
water and that is where we put our arms
like<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:48.660> move<00:00:48.809> from<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
like this and then move from here to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.709 
like this and then move from here to
simulate<00:00:50.520> what<00:00:51.059> things<00:00:51.270> were<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> be

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
simulate what things were going to be

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.020 
simulate what things were going to be
doing<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:52.050> our<00:00:52.199> legs<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.920> also<00:00:53.129> perform<00:00:53.730> are

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
doing with our legs we also perform are

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.869 
doing with our legs we also perform are
called<00:00:54.270> figures<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.379> where<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:56.489> try

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
called figures and this is where we try

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.670 
called figures and this is where we try
and<00:00:57.059> hold<00:00:57.239> still<00:00:57.570> while<00:00:58.079> we're<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> water

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and hold still while we're in the water

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.650 
and hold still while we're in the water
we<00:00:59.070> don't<00:00:59.280> want<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.670> move<00:00:59.910> either<00:01:00.239> direction

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
we don't want to move either direction

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.049 
we don't want to move either direction
and<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.890> try<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.430> keep<00:01:02.579> ourselves<00:01:02.699> as

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and then we try and keep ourselves as

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.149 
and then we try and keep ourselves as
high<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> water<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.930> possible<00:01:04.159> while

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
high out of the water as possible while

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:15.820 
high out of the water as possible while
performing<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:06.330> ballet<00:01:06.810> leg

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.139 

the<00:01:40.859> most<00:01:41.070> important<00:01:41.460> part<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.700> synchronized

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
the most important part of synchronized

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.999 
the most important part of synchronized
swimming<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.750> also<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:43.380> we're<00:01:43.500> most<00:01:43.590> famous

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
swimming is also what we're most famous

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.399 
swimming is also what we're most famous
for<00:01:44.039> and<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.850> our<00:01:44.969> routines<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.259> can

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
for and that is our routines and you can

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.850 
for and that is our routines and you can
do<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> solo<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.280> duet<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.969> trio<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.960> then<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
do a solo a duet or a trio and then a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.950 
do a solo a duet or a trio and then a
natural<00:01:50.490> routine<00:01:50.880> group<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.360> from<00:01:51.569> four<00:01:51.840> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
natural routine group is from four to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
natural routine group is from four to
eight

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
eight

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.670 
eight
and<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.060> where<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.450> work<00:01:55.200> where<00:01:55.470> our

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and this is where we work where our

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.880 
and this is where we work where our
sequined<00:01:56.190> suit<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.540> would<00:01:57.690> have

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
sequined suit that we would have

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.920 
sequined suit that we would have
glittery<00:01:58.890> stuff<00:01:59.220> in<00:01:59.430> our<00:01:59.520> hair<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.150> we'd<00:02:00.900> have

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
glittery stuff in our hair and we'd have

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.280 
glittery stuff in our hair and we'd have
the<00:02:01.380> elaborate<00:02:01.830> makeup<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.760> be<00:02:03.720> usually

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the elaborate makeup on and be usually

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.810 
the elaborate makeup on and be usually
travel<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.800> different<00:02:04.950> states<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.520> perform

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
travel to different states to perform

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.550 
travel to different states to perform
these<00:02:05.910> routines<00:02:06.300> because<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:07.080> are<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.380> only

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
these routines because we are the only

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.760 
these routines because we are the only
collegiate<00:02:08.190> group<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:08.760> Indiana<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:10.500> we'll<00:02:10.650> go

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
collegiate group in Indiana so we'll go

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.080 
collegiate group in Indiana so we'll go
to<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.070> Ann<00:02:11.390> Arbor<00:02:12.390> or<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.770> st.<00:02:14.340> Louis<00:02:14.730> in
