00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
do so that's what they're doing in the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.590 
do so that's what they're doing in the
Philippines<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.970> was<00:02:30.120> Joey's<00:02:30.360> doing<00:02:30.540> it

tortilla chips and sriracha what a great

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:18.890 
tortilla chips and sriracha what a great
flavor<00:03:06.840> combination

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.350 

it's<00:03:19.560> just<00:03:19.860> spicy<00:03:20.190> enough<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:20.730> know<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:21.030> didn't

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
it's just spicy enough you know I didn't

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.580 
it's just spicy enough you know I didn't
overdo<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.720> with<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.989> sriracha<00:03:22.290> sauce

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
overdo it with the sriracha sauce

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.960 
overdo it with the sriracha sauce
because<00:03:22.860> you'd<00:03:23.010> want<00:03:23.159> to<00:03:23.220> kill<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.519> flavor<00:03:23.819> of

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
because you'd want to kill the flavor of

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.589 
because you'd want to kill the flavor of
the<00:03:24.090> burger<00:03:25.400> but<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.549> is<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.700> good<00:03:26.970> deal<00:03:27.299> this

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
the burger but this is a good deal this

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:42.610 
the burger but this is a good deal this
is<00:03:27.659> really<00:03:27.959> good

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.540 

so<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.710> regular<00:03:43.950> burger<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.280> 6:39<00:03:46.280> so<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.400> new

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
so the regular burger is 6:39 so the new

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.420 
so the regular burger is 6:39 so the new
burger<00:03:47.820> I'm<00:03:47.970> thinking<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:50.010> know<00:03:50.070> by<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.220> time

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
they do all the advertising everything

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.650 
they do all the advertising everything

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
and when it hopefully gets her to the

and when it hopefully gets her to the
states<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.640> probably<00:03:56.640> like<00:03:56.850> seven<00:03:57.150> bucks<00:03:57.560> front
