so the star of today's video is this

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.129 
so the star of today's video is this
giant<00:00:10.950> machine<00:00:11.219> right<00:00:11.610> here<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:12.120> know<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.990> is

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
giant machine right here I know it is

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.990 
giant machine right here I know it is
bigger<00:00:13.410> than<00:00:13.530> my<00:00:13.799> head<00:00:13.950> but<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.580> very

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
bigger than my head but it is very

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.990 
bigger than my head but it is very
powerful<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.980> this<00:00:16.980> kerning<00:00:17.490> machine<00:00:17.789> has

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
powerful and this kerning machine has

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.210 
powerful and this kerning machine has
got<00:00:18.210> your<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.080> first<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.439> want<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.740> turn<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.070> up

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
got your so first you want to turn it up

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.759 
got your so first you want to turn it up
and<00:00:21.710> this<00:00:22.710> that's<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.250> heat<00:00:24.320> there<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:25.470> trees

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
and this that's the heat there are trees

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.580 
and this that's the heat there are trees
heat<00:00:26.160> settings<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.000> um<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.109> just<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
heat settings and um it's just the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.550 
heat settings and um it's just the
lightest<00:00:29.010> medium<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.730> any<00:00:29.880> hot<00:00:30.570> set<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.140> then

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
lightest medium and any hot set and then

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.580 
lightest medium and any hot set and then
here<00:00:32.189> there's<00:00:33.149> got<00:00:33.420> three<00:00:33.719> speed<00:00:34.559> settings

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
here there's got three speed settings

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.459 
here there's got three speed settings
the<00:00:35.219> first<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> eight<00:00:36.059> second<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.140> ten

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the first one is eight second one is ten

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.639 
the first one is eight second one is ten
third<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.760> twelve<00:00:39.090> seconds<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
third one is twelve seconds and then the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.340 
third one is twelve seconds and then the
last<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:41.040> will<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.300> alternate<00:00:42.300> which<00:00:42.809> will

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
last one will be alternate which will

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.319 
last one will be alternate which will
set<00:00:43.590> your<00:00:43.739> coal<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.430> either<00:00:44.610> alternate

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
set your coal so it's either alternate

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.400 
set your coal so it's either alternate
left<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.960> has<00:00:49.170> stopped

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
left or right so now that it has stopped

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.709 
left or right so now that it has stopped
beeping<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:50.010> light<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.789> use<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.210> let's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
beeping to light we can use it let's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
beeping to light we can use it let's
just<00:00:51.840> put<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.350> into<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> test<00:00:52.980> right<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:55.699> so

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
just put this into the test right now so

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.540 
just put this into the test right now so
I'm<00:00:57.000> gonna<00:00:57.570> take<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.140> very<00:00:58.649> little<00:00:58.949> amount<00:00:59.160> as

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
I'm gonna take a very little amount as

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.049 
I'm gonna take a very little amount as
you<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:00.199> this<00:01:01.199> much<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.370> we're<00:01:02.789> going<00:01:02.969> to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you can see this much and we're going to

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.250 
you can see this much and we're going to
put<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:04.170> clamp<00:01:04.860> this

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.210 

voila

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.800 

after<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.370> makes<00:01:16.610> four<00:01:16.910> peaks<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:17.390> want<00:01:17.690> to

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
after it makes four peaks you want to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.870 
after it makes four peaks you want to
lose<00:01:18.050> it<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:21.710> make<00:01:21.950> it

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.490 

who<00:01:25.880> doesn't<00:01:26.450> agree<00:01:26.660> with<00:01:26.750> me<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.140> this

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
who doesn't agree with me that this

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.210 
who doesn't agree with me that this
machine<00:01:27.740> is<00:01:27.950> truly<00:01:28.550> revolutionary<00:01:29.320> I<00:01:30.320> didn't

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
machine is truly revolutionary I didn't

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.920 
machine is truly revolutionary I didn't
do<00:01:31.340> any<00:01:31.430> magic<00:01:31.700> it's<00:01:32.090> all<00:01:32.330> this<00:01:32.570> technology

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
do any magic it's all this technology

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.130 
do any magic it's all this technology
