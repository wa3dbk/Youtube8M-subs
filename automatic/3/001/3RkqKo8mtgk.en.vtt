all have asked me a lot of questions
about<00:00:11.610> dangerous<00:00:12.210> treats<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.440> go

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
about dangerous treats so here you go

about dangerous treats so here you go
number<00:00:14.250> one<00:00:14.460> no<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.780> tree<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.740> just

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
number one no the tree this just

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.340 
number one no the tree this just
involves<00:00:17.609> getting<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.119> know<00:00:18.300> how<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.750> tree<00:00:19.140> is

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
involves getting to know how the tree is

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.290 
involves getting to know how the tree is
broken<00:00:19.710> down<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.279> how<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.699> ultimately

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
broken down and how it's ultimately

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.109 
broken down and how it's ultimately
consumed<00:00:21.869> by<00:00:22.080> your<00:00:22.260> pet<00:00:22.470> some<00:00:23.070> treats<00:00:23.430> crumble

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
or lacerations I've seen some treats get

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.729 
or lacerations I've seen some treats get
lodged<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.600> trachea<00:00:54.899> or<00:00:55.350> even<00:00:55.620> the

esophagus some treats end up lodged in

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.979 
esophagus some treats end up lodged in
the<00:00:58.649> intestine<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.370> I've<00:00:59.760> even<00:01:00.030> seen<00:01:00.420> cases

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the intestine and I've even seen cases

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.950 
the intestine and I've even seen cases
of<00:01:01.260> colonic<00:01:01.890> impaction<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.449> important

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
of colonic impaction so it's important

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.530 
of colonic impaction so it's important
to<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.400> various<00:01:05.760> risks<00:01:06.030> that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to know all the various risks that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
to know all the various risks that
treats<00:01:06.900> impose<00:01:07.320> before<00:01:08.220> giving<00:01:08.520> them<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.729> your

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
regular bone as you can see it shatters

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.270 
regular bone as you can see it shatters
sometimes<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.799> end<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.220> your

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
sometimes and this can end up in your

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.310 
sometimes and this can end up in your
dog's<00:01:20.549> intestine<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.659> will<00:01:21.810> end<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
dog's intestine this will end up in a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440 
dog's intestine this will end up in a
perforation<00:01:22.830> or<00:01:23.250> even<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.700> hole<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.240> don't

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.920 
pose a certain risk large rawhides this
is<00:01:35.310> not<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> large<00:01:35.790> rawhide<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.689> certainly

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
is not a large rawhide but it certainly

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.170 
is not a large rawhide but it certainly
can<00:01:37.320> cause<00:01:37.530> cuts<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> mouth<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> even
