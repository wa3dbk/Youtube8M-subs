ah<00:00:42.510> now<00:00:43.510> over<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.140> last<00:00:44.290> two<00:00:44.500> years<00:00:44.530> since

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
ah now over the last two years since

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.650 
ah now over the last two years since
we've<00:00:44.949> been<00:00:45.070> using<00:00:45.280> computers<00:00:45.879> it's<00:00:46.480> just

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
we've been using computers it's just

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.189 
we've been using computers it's just
broadened<00:00:47.170> kid<00:00:47.379> skills<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.879> be<00:00:49.090> at<00:00:49.899> a<00:00:49.930> point

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
broadened kid skills to be at a point

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.569 
broadened kid skills to be at a point
where<00:00:50.350> they<00:00:50.620> are<00:00:50.920> ready<00:00:51.100> for<00:00:51.339> the<00:00:51.399> world

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
where they are ready for the world

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.009 
where they are ready for the world
because<00:00:52.000> they're<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.600> kind<00:00:52.839> of<00:00:52.870> skills

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
because they're the kind of skills

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.509 
because they're the kind of skills
they're<00:00:53.230> going<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.410> need<00:00:53.500> having<00:00:54.129> access<00:00:54.460> to

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
they're going to need having access to

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.020 
they're going to need having access to
technology<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.390> skills<00:00:55.899> of<00:00:56.850> Photoshop<00:00:57.850> and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
technology and skills of Photoshop and

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.329 
technology and skills of Photoshop and
image<00:00:58.210> making<00:00:58.449> in<00:00:58.780> computer-based<00:00:59.559> art<00:01:00.070> has

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
image making in computer-based art has

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.460 
image making in computer-based art has
just<00:01:00.579> broaden<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.690> art<00:01:01.960> students

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
just broaden the art students

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.469 
just broaden the art students
skill-based<00:01:03.129> so<00:01:03.430> much<00:01:03.579> more<00:01:03.850> you<00:01:04.089> could<00:01:04.420> ask

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
skill-based so much more you could ask

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.480 
skill-based so much more you could ask
any<00:01:04.930> kid<00:01:05.140> in<00:01:05.290> my<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.470> ten<00:01:05.740> art<00:01:05.979> class<00:01:06.220> right

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
any kid in my you ten art class right

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.010 
any kid in my you ten art class right
now<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:06.940> design<00:01:07.240> something<00:01:07.570> whether<00:01:07.780> it<00:01:07.960> be

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
now to design something whether it be

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.630 
now to design something whether it be
opposed<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.500> advertising<00:01:08.920> something<00:01:09.490> or

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
opposed to advertising something or

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.249 
opposed to advertising something or
something<00:01:10.360> for<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.540> school<00:01:10.750> musical<00:01:10.780> they

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
something for the school musical they

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.510 
something for the school musical they
could<00:01:11.409> all<00:01:11.530> do<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.710> their<00:01:12.009> skills<00:01:12.280> are<00:01:12.429> really

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
could all do it their skills are really

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.300 
could all do it their skills are really
high<00:01:12.789> as<00:01:13.330> far<00:01:13.539> as<00:01:13.660> I'm<00:01:13.780> concerned<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:14.259> think<00:01:14.530> the

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
high as far as I'm concerned I think the

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.980 
high as far as I'm concerned I think the
art<00:01:15.580> department<00:01:16.090> here<00:01:16.240> at<00:01:16.270> kims<00:01:16.539> because<00:01:16.840> of

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
art department here at kims because of

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.150 
art department here at kims because of
our<00:01:17.050> connection<00:01:17.500> with<00:01:17.590> computers<00:01:18.039> is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
our connection with computers is

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.190 
our connection with computers is
cutting-edge<00:01:18.580> we're<00:01:19.210> doing<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.869> kind<00:01:20.110> of

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
cutting-edge we're doing the kind of

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.499 
cutting-edge we're doing the kind of
stuff<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.440> other<00:01:20.710> schools<00:01:20.890> envy<00:01:21.340> because

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
stuff that other schools envy because

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.700 
stuff that other schools envy because
kids<00:01:22.509> are<00:01:22.690> like<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:22.990> said<00:01:23.170> all<00:01:23.320> learning<00:01:23.530> the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
kids are like I said all learning the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.760 
kids are like I said all learning the
skills<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.280> do<00:01:25.119> I'm<00:01:25.300> use<00:01:25.479> technology<00:01:26.050> as<00:01:26.320> a

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
skills to do I'm use technology as a

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:35.010 
skills to do I'm use technology as a
really<00:01:27.280> powerful<00:01:27.460> tool<00:01:33.539> the<00:01:34.539> difference<00:01:34.869> is

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
really powerful tool the difference is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.590 
really powerful tool the difference is
now<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.590> sea<00:01:35.830> is<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.429> laptops<00:01:36.819> you<00:01:37.060> just<00:01:37.240> kind

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
now the sea is the laptops you just kind

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.950 
now the sea is the laptops you just kind
of<00:01:37.630> sits<00:01:38.619> so<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.399> easy<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.940> disco<00:01:40.330> okay<00:01:40.780> we've

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
of sits so so easy to disco okay we've

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.480 
of sits so so easy to disco okay we've
done<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.350> now<00:01:41.530> just<00:01:41.770> get<00:01:41.979> on<00:01:42.009> your<00:01:42.220> machines

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
done it now just get on your machines

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.680 
done it now just get on your machines
let's<00:01:42.850> do<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.590> put<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.679> data<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.300> to<00:01:46.300> do<00:01:46.660> a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
let's do that put the data in to do a

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.020 
let's do that put the data in to do a
graph<00:01:46.929> of<00:01:47.110> that<00:01:47.319> get<00:01:47.739> a<00:01:48.030> mathematical

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
graph of that get a mathematical

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.479 
graph of that get a mathematical
relationship<00:01:49.569> it<00:01:49.750> just<00:01:49.780> just<00:01:50.229> flows<00:01:50.800> so

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:51.489 
relationship it just just flows so

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:54.300 
relationship it just just flows so
smoothly<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:52.899> would<00:01:53.470> Vista<00:01:53.860> gating

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
smoothly so we would Vista gating

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.219 
smoothly so we would Vista gating
acceleration<00:01:55.090> with<00:01:55.330> different<00:01:55.629> masses<00:01:55.840> and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
acceleration with different masses and

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.350 
acceleration with different masses and
this<00:01:56.739> is<00:01:56.860> one<00:01:57.039> where<00:01:57.250> could<00:01:57.849> have<00:01:57.970> sort<00:01:58.330> of

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
this is one where could have sort of

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.650 
this is one where could have sort of
came<00:01:58.599> alive<00:01:58.899> for<00:01:59.259> me<00:01:59.349> I<00:01:59.410> thought<00:01:59.679> I<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.819> it

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
came alive for me I thought I I it

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.449 
came alive for me I thought I I it
suddenly<00:02:02.020> hit<00:02:02.080> me<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.709> can<00:02:02.860> just<00:02:02.890> do<00:02:03.310> this

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
suddenly hit me and we can just do this

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.969 
suddenly hit me and we can just do this
and<00:02:03.520> this<00:02:03.759> so<00:02:03.819> we<00:02:04.479> did<00:02:04.660> this<00:02:04.780> experiment<00:02:05.200> just

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
and this so we did this experiment just

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.190 
and this so we did this experiment just
in<00:02:06.129> this<00:02:06.250> room

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
in this room

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.010 
in this room
we<00:02:07.380> were<00:02:07.729> accelerating<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.849> slot<00:02:09.119> car<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
we were accelerating a slot car and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.660 
we were accelerating a slot car and
seeing<00:02:10.410> how<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.679> acceleration<00:02:11.400> vary

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
seeing how the acceleration vary

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
seeing how the acceleration vary
depending<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.209> work<00:02:12.450> masts<00:02:12.959> are<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.290> taping

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
depending on work masts are we taping

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.920 
depending on work masts are we taping
extra<00:02:14.099> mass<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.489> his<00:02:14.550> poor<00:02:14.790> little<00:02:14.910> car<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.750> we

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
extra mass in his poor little car so we

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.410 
extra mass in his poor little car so we
did<00:02:16.140> once<00:02:16.410> again<00:02:16.849> physics<00:02:17.849> in<00:02:18.000> motion

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
did once again physics in motion

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.800 
did once again physics in motion
analysis<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.590> we<00:02:20.340> put<00:02:20.790> into<00:02:20.970> Excel<00:02:21.450> did

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
analysis and we put into Excel did

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.229 
analysis and we put into Excel did
graphs<00:02:22.110> compared<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.040> theory<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.970> they

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
graphs compared to the theory and they

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.420 
graphs compared to the theory and they
did<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.540> over<00:02:24.660> not<00:02:25.220> just<00:02:26.480> there<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.599> just<00:02:27.780> so

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
did that over not just there is just so

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.250 
did that over not just there is just so
flowed<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.700> even<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.180> from<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.750> so

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
flowed so even this from that to that so

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.250 
flowed so even this from that to that so
natural<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.250> go<00:02:32.430> from<00:02:32.640> one<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:32.910> other

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
natural just to go from one to the other

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.780 
natural just to go from one to the other
