 Welcome to Modest Tastes Cuisine 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 our recipe in this section; Modest Flavors ... 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.960
 We chose Turkish and World cuisine from our book 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.400
 "The apple marmalade" 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.400
 but before the material list 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.160
 4 pcs medium size apple 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.120
 2 cup powdered sugar 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.240
 half water cup water 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 half a teaspoon of cinnamon 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.840
 2 cloves 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.080
 and 1 teaspoon of lemon salt 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.520
 we start making our marmalade by peeling our apples 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.760
 slim the apples' shells as we can 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.560
 we robbed apples quickly, because as time goes by 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.600
 We could use lemons to keep it off, but ... 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.040
 we can do it with quick movements 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.440
 now we break it apart 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.280
 removing the core bearings 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.280
 roughly cut into several pieces 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.440
 and drop in pressure cooker 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.000
 we continue to prepare other apples in the same way 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
 the last apple we chopped 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.920
 Now on 2 cups of sugar powder 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.320
 and half a cup of water 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.200
 and we're closing the cover of the whistle 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.360
 We'll cook for another 8 minutes after boiling 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.000
 pressure came to boiling point, pin came out, now we're getting low fire 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 We cook for 8 minutes 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.360
 Yes, time is up, now we're closing the fire 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.360
 and wait for the pin to descend 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.520
 yeah, the pin came down and a little chilled marmalade 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.760
 Now, cinnamon ... 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.920
 cloves ... 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.400
 and adding lemon salt 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.000
 lemon salt 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.080
 we are burning the fire again 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.720
 and crushing 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.240
 and bake it this way for 20 minutes 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.800
 yes we've boiled for 20 minutes 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.840
 We will take them from the fire, we will fill them in jars 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.040
 Yes "Apples Mushroom" 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.400
