so<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.549> camera<00:01:44.970> features<00:01:45.720> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
so there you go this camera features a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.789 
so there you go this camera features a
30<00:01:46.320> millimeter<00:01:46.590> lens<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.640> has<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:49.020> 106

30 millimeter lens that has a like 106

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.580 
30 millimeter lens that has a like 106
degree<00:01:50.310> field<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.729> view<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.960> considered

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
degree field of view so it's considered

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.880 
degree field of view so it's considered
an<00:01:53.130> ultra<00:01:53.579> wide<00:01:53.610> or<00:01:54.090> super<00:01:54.450> wide<00:01:54.630> angle

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
an ultra wide or super wide angle

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.289 
an ultra wide or super wide angle
panorama<00:01:55.890> camera<00:01:56.340> hence<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.119> word

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
panorama camera hence the the word

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.789 
panorama camera hence the the word
panoramic<00:01:57.869> down<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.350> bottom

typically if sixteen will probably work
indoors<00:02:49.480> as<00:02:49.689> well<00:02:49.720> but<00:02:50.169> that's<00:02:50.950> typical<00:02:51.489> for

rotating the the lens here on top you

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.800 
rotating the the lens here on top you
have<00:02:58.299> two<00:02:58.599> settings<00:02:59.019> we<00:02:59.739> have<00:03:00.299> 0.621<00:03:01.299> meters

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
have two settings we have 0.621 meters

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.080 
have two settings we have 0.621 meters
and<00:03:01.989> that's<00:03:02.139> basically<00:03:02.980> flowers<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:03.879> and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
and that's basically flowers and and

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.360 
and that's basically flowers and and
whatnot<00:03:04.379> close<00:03:05.379> objects<00:03:05.919> and<00:03:06.069> any<00:03:06.189> other

setting on the other end is one meter to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.990 
setting on the other end is one meter to
infinity<00:03:09.129> and<00:03:09.280> that's<00:03:09.400> pretty<00:03:09.609> much<00:03:09.730> what

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
infinity and that's pretty much what

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.699 
infinity and that's pretty much what
everyone<00:03:10.359> will<00:03:10.450> probably<00:03:10.810> use<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.469> there<00:03:11.560> is

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
everyone will probably use and there is

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.140 
everyone will probably use and there is
the<00:03:11.889> little<00:03:12.099> gray<00:03:12.400> area<00:03:12.430> here<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.090> middle

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
the little gray area here in the middle

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.729 
the little gray area here in the middle
you<00:03:13.480> can<00:03:13.629> play<00:03:13.810> with<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:14.260> roll<00:03:14.469> the<00:03:14.620> dice

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
you can play with that and roll the dice

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.619 
you can play with that and roll the dice
and<00:03:15.010> see<00:03:15.159> what<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.400> get<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:16.180> bottom<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.569> the

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
and see what you get the bottom of the

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.420 
and see what you get the bottom of the
camera<00:03:16.840> has<00:03:17.079> a<00:03:17.109> tripod<00:03:17.409> socket<00:03:17.919> you<00:03:18.220> just

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
camera has a tripod socket you just

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.939 
camera has a tripod socket you just
unscrew<00:03:18.579> this<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.209> your<00:03:19.299> tripod<00:03:19.949> connects

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
unscrew this and your tripod connects

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.129 
unscrew this and your tripod connects
down<00:03:21.129> in<00:03:21.310> there<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:22.030> top<00:03:22.269> of<00:03:22.479> the<00:03:22.599> camera

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
down in there the top of the camera

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.500 
down in there the top of the camera
again<00:03:23.199> you<00:03:24.069> have<00:03:24.159> these<00:03:24.310> two<00:03:24.489> large<00:03:24.729> dials<00:03:25.209> one

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
again you have these two large dials one

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.530 
again you have these two large dials one
is<00:03:25.659> to<00:03:25.900> advance<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.729> film<00:03:27.729> to<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.090> next<00:03:28.299> frame

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
is to advance the film to the next frame

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.629 
is to advance the film to the next frame
and<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:29.199> other<00:03:29.379> one<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.799> rewind<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.459> film

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
and the other one is to rewind the film

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.280 
and the other one is to rewind the film
to<00:03:30.909> previous<00:03:31.389> frames<00:03:31.659> so<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:31.930> have<00:03:32.109> these<00:03:32.229> two

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
to previous frames so you have these two

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.710 
to previous frames so you have these two
windows<00:03:32.859> right<00:03:33.069> here<00:03:33.099> one<00:03:33.939> is<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.239> exposure

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
windows right here one is the exposure

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.990 
windows right here one is the exposure
account<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.650> tells<00:03:36.129> you<00:03:36.280> what<00:03:36.519> frame<00:03:36.819> you're

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
account that tells you what frame you're

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.580 
account that tells you what frame you're
on<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.449> the<00:03:37.540> other<00:03:37.689> one<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:37.989> an<00:03:38.139> indicator

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
on and the other one is an indicator

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.110 
on and the other one is an indicator
that<00:03:38.680> tells<00:03:38.829> you<00:03:39.159> when<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.340> stop<00:03:39.729> when<00:03:39.970> you're

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
that tells you when to stop when you're

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.240

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
this setup here one of the selling

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.229 
this setup here one of the selling
points<00:03:44.199> was<00:03:44.769> this<00:03:45.069> camera<00:03:45.459> does<00:03:45.669> multiple
