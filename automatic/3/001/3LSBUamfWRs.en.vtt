been<00:01:48.770> following<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.220> pre-veterinary<00:01:49.670> track

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
been following the pre-veterinary track

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.000 
been following the pre-veterinary track
but<00:01:50.480> as<00:01:50.600> time<00:01:50.810> goes<00:01:50.990> on<00:01:51.140> especially<00:01:51.350> as<00:01:51.890> I

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
but as time goes on especially as I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.410 
but as time goes on especially as I
continue<00:01:52.490> on<00:01:52.520> with<00:01:52.700> this<00:01:52.790> program<00:01:53.180> I<00:01:53.270> realized

wildlife<00:01:56.030> conservation<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:57.050> I<00:01:57.170> think<00:01:57.350> I'm

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
wildlife conservation and I think I'm

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.710 
wildlife conservation and I think I'm
going<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.680> try<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.610> use<00:01:59.000> this<00:01:59.180> knowledge<00:01:59.420> and

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
going to try and use this knowledge and

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.630 
going to try and use this knowledge and
see<00:01:59.869> where<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.110> leads<00:02:00.229> me<00:02:00.410> that<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:01.070> Galapagos

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
see where it leads me that the Galapagos

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.760 
see where it leads me that the Galapagos
is<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.000> place<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.840> everyone<00:02:03.470> should<00:02:03.740> visit

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770
