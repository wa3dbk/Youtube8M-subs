00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 just record a quick video for you to 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.630
 respect the unpleasant subject today 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.130
 here due to that defect that the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.440
 people have to want to mix fish 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.849
 these things last night had 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.590
 said that he had placed letters here 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.789
 because my wife solved me 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.250
 to convince 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.449
 I knew I could give a problem and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.820
 said and done right 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.189
 It is good that the cards here the size of the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.470
 with a reason for them to have a 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.630
 base of 100 liters was placed two 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.390
 What happened was she 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.620
 just messing too much water generated 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.590
 bacteria 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.120
 the bacteria attacked some of my 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.750
 fish not only for you here the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:49.320
 water quality in an aquarium is now 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.410
 connects before highlights the green color that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.270
 I did in the edition of a life 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:59.100
 it leaves the water yellow but in 48 hours 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.949
 man he is a fugitive is a suicide goes 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 to kill the funds there also associated with 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.020
 internet crash to kill bacteria 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.500
 I'm doing treatment with both of you. 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.170
 to try to put things in place 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.360
 remembering here on the court it's not bad 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.549
 There is not any bad water that happened. 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.650
 the next I thought that the broker 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.060
 who was infected here to show 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.299
 you in this white to cocoa 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.320
 race also thought that a load 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.360
 had swallowed 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.770
 but at the end of the story when I went 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.770
 right was here in the middle of the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.640
 here and spent two days without 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.549
 eat 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.369
 spent two days there so she lost her 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.170
 Immunity from immunity has 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.740
 bacteria comes up and comes with 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.329
 force and ended up infecting her from a 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.290
 That way I do not think it's going to 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.140
 return 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.610
 then this is normal in aquariums 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.299
 so when the fish loses its immunity 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.979
 due to stress or your mucous 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.170
 mucosa that protects the fish then the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.299
 bacteria and not up and right now 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.369
 with the fish 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.619
 So I wobbled there and ended up putting 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.920
 carlos is the cover of my seguradinha 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.190
 water I took out doing treatment 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.510
 here with collage knocking is not something 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.310
 to harm other fish because 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.300
 This has already been resolved. I'm doing 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.900
 here is a prevention measure 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.890
 so that's the tip for you guys no 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.980
 fish come out is mainly 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.240
 for a small aquarium but the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.940
 configuration that 's here for now. 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.680
 you remembering that when you make the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.930
 edit here 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.010
 two of the medicines or any type 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.110
 of medicine 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.620
 reminding you it 's good you're taking it there 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.550
 all the technology part of your 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:54.480
 aquarium including activated charcoal 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.220
 she responds that sucks the dirt responds 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.850
 that the bottom of it does not 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.770
 whether or not those 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.260
 medicines there it kills a little of the 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.130
 biology of the aquarium is not something that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.940
 I want it to happen then you take off and 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.130
 leaves the filter rolling without any 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.980
 type of defeat of madri is a sponge 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.980
 nowhere in the part of biology 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.340
 That's what you're doing. 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.970
 treatment and everything will return to the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.650
 normal 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.110
 remembering that I want my 4cm 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.290
 Amazon then thank god the 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.780
 covers here then launch the configuration 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.170
 that 's good now stayed here the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:59.930
 three abiding flags stay the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:59.930
 two out of 22 a little bit bigger 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.660
 3232 southern cruise and two neighborhoods 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.560
 peacefully the problem 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.430
 I also ran 23 chosen blue 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.740
 I have one here another one inside so 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.080
 What do I tell you? 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.910
 the gang had Amazon right that 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.810
 have a variety of fish a little bit 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:43.050
 different here but are fish of ph 7.0 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.310
 Down then it sure goes. 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.240
 remember that I'm going to put 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.680
 discs here then about to God that 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.110
 Dude passing by here are beautiful and 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.810
 wonderful but I do not want to 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.360
 so it's the tip for you guys there 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.690
 pay close attention to everything doing mine 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.460
 part of warning here come posting 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.060
 a video from my channel there about the 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.389
 aquarium always liked was 100% 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.600

 four floors then associates one 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.919
 thing with the other and I saw that really

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.880

 He's already solved beauty. 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.260

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.330
 hours will disappear taking with it all 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.880
 impure all the bacteria is malefic 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.910
