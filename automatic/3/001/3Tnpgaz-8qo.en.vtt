00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
I made a terrible it form here that's

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.749 
I made a terrible it form here that's
cylindrical<00:00:29.910> form<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:31.279> with<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> parabolic

cylindrical form and with the parabolic
dish<00:00:32.940> when<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> sun's<00:00:33.780> rays<00:00:34.050> come<00:00:34.410> down<00:00:34.680> they

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
dish when the sun's rays come down they

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.060 
dish when the sun's rays come down they
say<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.880> take<00:00:36.270> wherever<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:37.110> reflect<00:00:37.860> off

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
say you take wherever they reflect off

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.680 
say you take wherever they reflect off
they<00:00:38.280> come<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:38.760> point<00:00:39.059> which<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.480> called

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
they come to one point which is called

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.959 
they come to one point which is called
the<00:00:39.780> focus<00:00:40.200> point<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:41.280> cylinder<00:00:41.700> is

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the focus point and this cylinder is

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.720 
the focus point and this cylinder is
mounted<00:00:42.420> right<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> focal<00:00:43.500> point<00:00:43.770> it's

mounted right in the focal point it's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.130 
mounted right in the focal point it's
like<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.090> opposite<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.600> those<00:00:45.780> spotlights

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
like the opposite of those spotlights

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.840 
like the opposite of those spotlights
they<00:00:46.500> used<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.800> using<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.250> wall<00:00:47.460> where<00:00:47.789> they

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
they used to using the wall where they

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.340 
they used to using the wall where they
had<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.239> any<00:00:48.420> filaments<00:00:48.930> right<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
had to do any filaments right in the

middle of the focal point and the rays

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220 
middle of the focal point and the rays
reflected<00:00:50.910> out<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.510> they<00:00:51.570> went<00:00:51.809> out<00:00:51.870> parallel

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
reflected out and they went out parallel

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.970 
reflected out and they went out parallel
beams<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.280> office<00:00:53.550> opposite<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.980> so

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
beams the office opposite from that so

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160 
beams the office opposite from that so
that's<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:56.789> Suns<00:00:57.000> laser<00:00:57.210> focus<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
that's what what Suns laser focus and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.619 
that's what what Suns laser focus and
the<00:00:58.260> best<00:00:58.440> time<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.710> day<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.039> heat<00:00:59.430> is<00:01:00.090> round

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the best time of day to heat is round

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.560 
the best time of day to heat is round
about<00:01:00.809> or<00:01:01.590> 12<00:01:02.430> o'clock<00:01:02.579> when<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.000> sun's<00:01:03.329> rays

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
about or 12 o'clock when the sun's rays

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.070 
about or 12 o'clock when the sun's rays
it<00:01:03.809> directly<00:01:04.140> hits<00:01:04.589> over<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.540> well<00:01:06.540> me

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it directly hits over here well me

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.469 
it directly hits over here well me
thirty<00:01:07.680> degrees<00:01:08.130> were<00:01:08.549> about<00:01:08.820> thirty<00:01:09.119> degrees

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
thirty degrees were about thirty degrees

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
thirty degrees were about thirty degrees
latitude<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.310> this<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.430> facing<00:01:11.880> directly

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
latitude and this is facing directly

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.569 
latitude and this is facing directly
north

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
north

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.609 
north
now<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.450> around<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.750> back<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.469> have

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
now if we go around the back we can have

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.099 
now if we go around the back we can have
a<00:01:16.799> look<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.939> mixture<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.929> gets

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109 
a look at the mixture because it gets

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.270 
a look at the mixture because it gets
pretty<00:01:19.350> hot<00:01:19.619> at<00:01:20.840> what<00:01:21.840> comes<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.469> about<00:01:22.710> 17

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
pretty hot at what comes in at about 17

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.850 
pretty hot at what comes in at about 17
degrees<00:01:23.579> centigrade<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> goes<00:01:24.539> out<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:25.439> 60

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
degrees centigrade and goes out at 60

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.800 
degrees centigrade and goes out at 60
degrees<00:01:26.159> centigrade<00:01:26.610> which<00:01:26.789> is<00:01:26.909> far<00:01:27.210> too<00:01:27.479> hot

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
degrees centigrade which is far too hot

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.349 
degrees centigrade which is far too hot
for<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.770> shower<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.429> so<00:01:29.609> if<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.149> back

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
for a shower and so if we go on the back

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:39.320 
for a shower and so if we go on the back
of<00:01:30.539> our<00:01:30.659> mixer

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.450 

so<00:01:40.330> with<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.630> mixer<00:01:40.990> what<00:01:41.740> I've<00:01:41.860> got<00:01:42.040> here<00:01:42.280> is

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460

the hot water line I turn that on and it
goes<00:02:04.840> down<00:02:05.140> here<00:02:05.170> underneath<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.520> back

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
goes down here underneath to the back

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.490 
goes down here underneath to the back
the<00:02:07.240> bottom<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.840> back<00:02:08.020> of<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.260> cylinder

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
the bottom of the back of the cylinder

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.730 
the bottom of the back of the cylinder
with<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.070> hot<00:02:09.729> water<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.360> pushed<00:02:10.630> up<00:02:10.840> comes<00:02:11.530> out

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
with it hot water is pushed up comes out

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.180 
with it hot water is pushed up comes out
here<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:13.630> comes<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:14.260> here<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.830> mixes

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
here and it comes in here and it mixes

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.860 
here and it comes in here and it mixes
here<00:02:15.430> with<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.610> coal<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.390> get<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.690> water

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
here with a coal so you get the water

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.870 
here with a coal so you get the water
coming<00:02:17.110> off<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.410> top<00:02:17.590> here<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.100> share<00:02:18.850> our

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
coming off the top here to share our

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.589 
coming off the top here to share our
letter<00:02:19.480> W<00:02:19.990> ideas

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.530 

so<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.530> under<00:02:26.310> our<00:02:26.909> solar<00:02:27.269> hot<00:02:27.480> water

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
so that is under our solar hot water

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.979 
so that is under our solar hot water
heater<00:02:28.019> works<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:28.680> very<00:02:29.040> effective

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
heater works and it's very effective

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.989 
heater works and it's very effective
