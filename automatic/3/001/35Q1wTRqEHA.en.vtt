that<00:06:25.370> did<00:06:25.550> help<00:06:26.050> normally<00:06:27.050> I<00:06:27.080> take<00:06:27.230> a<00:06:27.290> lot<00:06:27.470> of

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
that did help normally I take a lot of

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.380 
that did help normally I take a lot of
time<00:06:27.740> doing<00:06:28.070> the<00:06:28.220> blow<00:06:28.370> drying<00:06:28.670> because<00:06:29.120> I'm

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
time doing the blow drying because I'm

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.170 
time doing the blow drying because I'm
trying<00:06:29.660> to<00:06:29.750> get<00:06:29.900> it<00:06:30.020> as<00:06:30.650> straight<00:06:30.920> as<00:06:31.130> possible

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
trying to get it as straight as possible

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.540 
trying to get it as straight as possible
so<00:06:32.870> that<00:06:33.080> the<00:06:33.470> flat<00:06:33.680> ironing<00:06:34.070> portion

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
so that the flat ironing portion

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.400 
so that the flat ironing portion
wouldn't<00:06:34.910> be<00:06:35.380> such<00:06:36.380> a<00:06:36.410> long<00:06:36.620> process<00:06:36.950> but<00:06:38.410> just

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
wouldn't be such a long process but just

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.280 
wouldn't be such a long process but just
kind<00:06:39.650> of<00:06:39.740> limited<00:06:40.250> that<00:06:40.460> I<00:06:41.030> do<00:06:41.510> have<00:06:41.810> a<00:06:41.840> secret

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
kind of limited that I do have a secret

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.030 
kind of limited that I do have a secret
though<00:06:42.440> I<00:06:42.770> did<00:06:43.400> use<00:06:43.760> a<00:06:44.360> smaller<00:06:45.260> flat<00:06:45.740> iron

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 
though I did use a smaller flat iron

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.400 
though I did use a smaller flat iron
just<00:06:47.030> for<00:06:47.240> my<00:06:47.420> bang<00:06:47.950> in<00:06:48.950> the<00:06:49.010> edges<00:06:49.550> because

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
just for my bang in the edges because

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:56.239 
just for my bang in the edges because
with<00:06:51.410> the<00:06:51.920> barrel<00:06:53.170> as<00:06:54.170> you<00:06:54.380> can<00:06:54.500> see<00:06:54.740> there<00:06:55.100> is

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:56.249 
with the barrel as you can see there is

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.599 
with the barrel as you can see there is
thing<00:06:56.839> protecting<00:06:57.839> you<00:06:58.799> from<00:06:59.009> getting<00:06:59.369> burned

00:06:59.599 --> 00:06:59.609
