Pacquiao<00:02:48.830> doesn't<00:02:49.700> have<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.390> killer<00:02:51.170> instinct

but<00:02:52.370> i<00:02:52.430> believe<00:02:52.549> that<00:02:53.180> one<00:02:53.450> thing<00:02:53.690> he<00:02:53.840> does

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.820 
but i believe that one thing he does
have<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:55.090> winner's<00:02:56.090> instinct<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.440> i<00:02:57.560> think

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
have is a winner's instinct and i think

have is a winner's instinct and i think

about<00:04:33.870> helping<00:04:34.470> people<00:04:34.520> than<00:04:35.520> hurting<00:04:35.880> people

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
about helping people than hurting people

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.950 
about helping people than hurting people
although<00:04:37.169> his<00:04:37.560> profession<00:04:38.280> requires<00:04:39.030> him<00:04:39.720> in

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
although his profession requires him in

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.150 
although his profession requires him in
many<00:04:40.470> cases<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.520> hurt<00:04:41.760> people<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.840> win<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:43.800> in

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
many cases to hurt people to win so in

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.659 
many cases to hurt people to win so in
that<00:04:44.880> case<00:04:45.150> maybe<00:04:45.600> he<00:04:45.990> has<00:04:46.320> lost<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.430> killer

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
that case maybe he has lost the killer

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.260 
that case maybe he has lost the killer
instinct<00:04:48.240> but<00:04:48.810> again<00:04:49.410> I<00:04:49.650> say<00:04:49.889> he<00:04:50.160> has<00:04:50.430> still

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
instinct but again I say he has still

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.370 
instinct but again I say he has still
the<00:04:51.930> winners<00:04:52.910> instinct<00:04:53.910> and<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.600> believe<00:04:54.990> that

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
the winners instinct and I believe that

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.650 
the winners instinct and I believe that
he's<00:04:55.830> going<00:04:56.040> to<00:04:56.160> show<00:04:56.430> that<00:04:56.760> against<00:04:57.630> Tim

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
he's going to show that against Tim

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.350 
he's going to show that against Tim
Bradley<00:04:58.110> I<00:04:58.470> think<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.070> key<00:04:59.400> for<00:04:59.760> many

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
Bradley I think the key for many

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.360 
Bradley I think the key for many
Pacquiao<00:05:00.990> is<00:05:01.199> that<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:02.039> fight<00:05:02.340> is

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
Pacquiao is that the fight is

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.370 
Pacquiao is that the fight is
competitive<00:05:03.360> when<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.080> fight<00:05:04.350> is

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
competitive when the fight is

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.409

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
Pacquiao when things are really getting

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.779 
Pacquiao when things are really getting
intense<00:05:10.110> in<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.410> ring<00:05:10.650> in<00:05:10.860> his<00:05:11.010> opponent<00:05:11.669> is

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
coming at him he claps those gloves

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.409 
coming at him he claps those gloves
above<00:05:15.449> his<00:05:15.600> hands<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.199> brings<00:05:17.039> it<00:05:17.280> and<00:05:17.430> that

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
above his hands and brings it and that

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.020 
above his hands and brings it and that
is<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:18.810> key<00:05:19.050> thing<00:05:19.350> for<00:05:19.620> him<00:05:19.919> it's<00:05:20.430> not<00:05:20.729> about

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
is the key thing for him it's not about

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.590 
is the key thing for him it's not about
killing<00:05:21.479> somebody<00:05:21.960> it's<00:05:22.860> about<00:05:23.070> engaging<00:05:23.669> in

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
killing somebody it's about engaging in

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.170 
killing somebody it's about engaging in
a<00:05:25.110> great<00:05:25.500> competition<00:05:25.979> and<00:05:26.580> when<00:05:27.000> his

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
a great competition and when his

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.290 
a great competition and when his
opponent<00:05:27.870> comes<00:05:28.050> at<00:05:28.320> him<00:05:28.460> he<00:05:29.460> brings<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:30.150> and

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
opponent comes at him he brings it and

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.170 
opponent comes at him he brings it and
he<00:05:30.930> enjoys<00:05:31.530> that<00:05:31.889> and<00:05:32.160> that's<00:05:32.400> when<00:05:32.760> he<00:05:32.789> has<00:05:33.000> no

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
he enjoys that and that's when he has no

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.469 
he enjoys that and that's when he has no
problem<00:05:33.510> when<00:05:34.470> letting<00:05:34.919> his<00:05:35.130> fists<00:05:35.520> fly<00:05:35.849> so<00:05:36.450> I

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
problem when letting his fists fly so I

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.180 
problem when letting his fists fly so I
think<00:05:36.660> as<00:05:36.990> long<00:05:37.229> as<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.650> fight<00:05:37.950> is

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
think as long as the fight is

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.960 
think as long as the fight is
competitive<00:05:39.120> than<00:05:39.660> he<00:05:40.020> does<00:05:40.830> that<00:05:41.250> can<00:05:41.849> you

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
competitive than he does that can you

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.400 
competitive than he does that can you
think<00:05:42.030> about<00:05:44.150> even<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:45.180> fight<00:05:45.539> with<00:05:45.780> Bradley

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
think about even the fight with Bradley

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.010 
think about even the fight with Bradley
you<00:05:46.889> know<00:05:47.010> that<00:05:47.250> fight<00:05:47.490> started<00:05:48.030> out<00:05:48.210> that

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
you know that fight started out that

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.810 
you know that fight started out that
Bradley<00:05:49.560> was<00:05:49.710> coming<00:05:50.010> forward<00:05:50.340> and<00:05:50.400> engaging

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
Bradley was coming forward and engaging

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.070 
Bradley was coming forward and engaging
and<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:51.900> I<00:05:52.289> think<00:05:52.620> Pacquiao<00:05:53.130> was<00:05:54.120> dominating

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
and and I think Pacquiao was dominating

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.650 
and and I think Pacquiao was dominating
at<00:05:55.260> that<00:05:55.530> point<00:05:55.830> but<00:05:56.010> then<00:05:56.250> when<00:05:56.660> Bradley

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
at that point but then when Bradley

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.750 
at that point but then when Bradley
decided<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:58.560> box<00:05:58.830> which<00:05:59.099> is<00:05:59.130> a<00:05:59.310> good<00:05:59.580> strategy

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
decided to box which is a good strategy

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.500 
decided to box which is a good strategy
for<00:06:00.060> him<00:06:00.389> then<00:06:01.310> Pacquiao<00:06:02.310> felt<00:06:02.760> like<00:06:02.970> as<00:06:03.270> well

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
for him then Pacquiao felt like as well

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.320 
for him then Pacquiao felt like as well
as<00:06:03.690> most<00:06:03.990> observers<00:06:04.860> felt<00:06:05.280> like<00:06:05.490> he<00:06:06.120> was

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
as most observers felt like he was

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.439 
as most observers felt like he was
winning<00:06:06.690> that<00:06:06.990> fight<00:06:07.349> but<00:06:08.130> when<00:06:08.430> pakiya<00:06:09.300> I

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
winning that fight but when pakiya I

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.270 
winning that fight but when pakiya I
mean<00:06:09.630> Bradley<00:06:10.050> starts<00:06:10.349> backing<00:06:10.620> off<00:06:10.949> a<00:06:10.979> little

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
mean Bradley starts backing off a little

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.060 
mean Bradley starts backing off a little
bit<00:06:11.460> Bradley's<00:06:12.060> I<00:06:12.240> mean<00:06:12.690> pack<00:06:13.020> else<00:06:13.229> and<00:06:13.500> you

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
bit Bradley's I mean pack else and you

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.700 
bit Bradley's I mean pack else and you
know<00:06:14.190> what<00:06:14.400> i<00:06:14.840> think<00:06:15.840> i've<00:06:16.139> got<00:06:16.289> this<00:06:16.440> fight

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
know what i think i've got this fight

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.730 
know what i think i've got this fight
one<00:06:17.039> and<00:06:17.340> he<00:06:18.270> didn't<00:06:18.630> go<00:06:18.810> after<00:06:19.020> him<00:06:19.349> the<00:06:19.560> way

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
one and he didn't go after him the way

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.770 
one and he didn't go after him the way
that<00:06:20.280> he<00:06:20.370> could<00:06:20.550> but<00:06:20.760> with<00:06:20.940> this<00:06:21.030> comment<00:06:21.630> that

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
that he could but with this comment that

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.230 
that he could but with this comment that
he's<00:06:21.870> made<00:06:22.110> about<00:06:23.039> the<00:06:23.280> killer<00:06:23.520> instinct<00:06:24.150> i

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
he's made about the killer instinct i

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.480 
he's made about the killer instinct i
think<00:06:24.449> that's<00:06:24.660> going<00:06:24.810> to<00:06:24.900> bring<00:06:25.080> the<00:06:25.229> focus<00:06:25.800> to

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
think that's going to bring the focus to

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.629 
think that's going to bring the focus to
Manny<00:06:26.820> and<00:06:27.090> he's<00:06:27.270> going<00:06:27.479> to<00:06:27.539> focus<00:06:27.930> on

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
Manny and he's going to focus on

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.089 
Manny and he's going to focus on
