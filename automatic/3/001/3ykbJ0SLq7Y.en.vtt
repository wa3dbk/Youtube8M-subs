00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:23.439 
have better information but I mean I'm

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.530 
have better information but I mean I'm
pretty<00:03:23.650> sure<00:03:23.889> it<00:03:23.979> was<00:03:24.099> like<00:03:24.250> okay<00:03:24.729> when<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.239> used

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
pretty sure it was like okay when I used

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.409 
pretty sure it was like okay when I used
it<00:03:25.689> it<00:03:25.840> was<00:03:25.870> just<00:03:26.109> not<00:03:26.319> that<00:03:26.530> much<00:03:26.739> product

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
it it was just not that much product

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.369 
it it was just not that much product
because<00:03:28.419> as<00:03:28.569> you<00:03:28.689> can<00:03:28.780> see<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:29.079> is<00:03:29.199> fairly

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379

I<00:05:12.750> can<00:05:12.900> get<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.110> open<00:05:15.530> this<00:05:16.530> is<00:05:16.710> what<00:05:16.860> this<00:05:16.979> one

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
I can get it open this is what this one

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.180 
I can get it open this is what this one
looks<00:05:17.190> like<00:05:17.460> you<00:05:18.270> have<00:05:18.860> your<00:05:19.860> highlight

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
looks like you have your highlight

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.010 
looks like you have your highlight
shades<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:20.729> then<00:05:20.849> your<00:05:21.000> contour<00:05:21.449> shades<00:05:21.750> but

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
shades and then your contour shades but

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.749 
shades and then your contour shades but
the<00:05:22.169> thing<00:05:22.380> about<00:05:22.650> this<00:05:22.919> that<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.340> think<00:05:23.460> it's

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
the thing about this that I think it's

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:29.110 
the thing about this that I think it's
just<00:05:23.940> really<00:05:24.060> versatile<00:05:24.720> is<00:05:25.050> that<00:05:27.500> not<00:05:28.500> only

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
just really versatile is that not only

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.520 
just really versatile is that not only
do<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.240> have<00:05:30.419> like<00:05:30.599> highlighting<00:05:31.139> contour

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
do you have like highlighting contour

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.310 
do you have like highlighting contour
shades<00:05:31.740> but<00:05:32.340> I<00:05:32.400> pretty<00:05:32.699> much<00:05:32.820> feel<00:05:33.150> like<00:05:33.320> these

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
shades but I pretty much feel like these

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.300 
shades but I pretty much feel like these
can<00:05:34.650> also<00:05:34.800> be<00:05:35.039> used<00:05:35.220> as<00:05:35.460> face<00:05:35.729> powders<00:05:37.099> you<00:05:38.099> I

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310
