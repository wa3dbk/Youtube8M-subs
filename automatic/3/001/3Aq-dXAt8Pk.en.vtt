00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
should be concerned with in regards to

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.940 
should be concerned with in regards to
actually<00:00:12.059> using<00:00:12.480> your<00:00:12.509> knife<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.920> a

actually using your knife one is a

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.849 
actually using your knife one is a
slicing<00:00:14.519> motion<00:00:14.730> when<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.780> slice<00:00:16.109> things<00:00:16.379> you

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
slicing motion when you slice things you

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.040 
slicing motion when you slice things you
go<00:00:17.010> from<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.369> tip<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.910> slide<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.869> knife

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
go from the tip and you slide the knife

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.340 
go from the tip and you slide the knife
forward<00:00:19.580> to<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> end<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.000> blade<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.480> it

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
forward to the end of the blade and it

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.650 
forward to the end of the blade and it
should<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> rocking<00:00:23.310> motion<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:24.330> should<00:00:24.539> be

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
should be a rocking motion you should be

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.230 
should be a rocking motion you should be
able<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> go<00:00:25.019> back<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.529> forth<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:26.820> next<00:00:27.029> would

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
able to go back and forth the next would

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.650 
able to go back and forth the next would
be<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.390> chop<00:00:28.039> for<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> most<00:00:29.460> part<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.029> chop<00:00:30.420> is
