00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.899
 well guys that gianpi still speaks 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.540
 I'm here today, I enjoy it in company 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:16.230
 of gianni creek derived her or serves or 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:19.020
 to sharpen the clique days here that 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.240
 compelling greeting however apart 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.939
 jokes today we bring you a gameplay 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.699
 slightly particular to present you 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.609
 the grind map of the revolution package 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.080
 however as you may have noticed sailing 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.600
 we are presenting a little bit 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.730
 microscopic because instead of bringing you 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.960
 a simple gameplay with the little man the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.640
 front rifle 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.260
 we report a recorded match 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.719
 only by doing trick jumps 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.700
 pussy killings with rcx of the toy car 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.160
 that you take to I don't remember how many 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.989
 points and so here was also for 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.100
 launch a little talk of the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.260
 series of killings 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.120
 so the question is which series of 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.739
 kills used by you and which series 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.699
 of killings we use then for 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 what concerns me 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.989
 generally if I have to do gameplay 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.790
 using dog blackboard and swarms while 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.650
 when I play to record clips 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.479
 however with the sniper I prefer 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.689
 lower rewards useful to the team 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.140
 as wabi counterattack vie guardian for 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.880
 example now the yo yo with for le 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.500
 rewards are very good Cossack 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.930
 sniper because I use the same stuff 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.070
 when I use in that the Czech though if used 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.710
 pole and harmony 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.270
 I put myself on is the fire if you call it that 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.340
 I don't remember the missile you wrote 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.570
 in many missants, the rest is the 4 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.700
 devil 's storm is storm then then me 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.860
 I put in love star because that stuff there 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.030
 even if in the star 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.890
 I think they have decreased the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.040
 speed beyond the release of the missile 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.720
 dinners it releases less, that is it does not and releases a 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.670
 pack how to say I never did a 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.360
 engraving because I never could 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.340
 wait for it to expect that missile 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.930
 then after which they admit dogs that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.280
 they will be pulled only once and as I have 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.920
 already mentioned before for the Czech equal 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.649
 while mr lennox 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.200
 look, I'm not one on black ops 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.890
 top 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.740
 I prefer as you would say 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.720
 paws I prefer rewards a 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.500
 a little lower in fact I always go 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.790
 for him supplies and the blow 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.400
 lightning-fast as a reward beats for one 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.160
 who wants to play in peace without 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.930
 go for the big scores for 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.970
 kick everyone's ass 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.830
 attention here from us oman in 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.540
 strategic instead of you battle already 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.670
 we know it but it is a clear drone exactly 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.500
 because I am the annoying player 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.230
 that is, even if you put that I can't 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.060
 make decent gameplay 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.800
 the important thing is to annoy those who 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.170
 they are trying to make a good score 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.360
 with my beautiful drone, the war of Florence 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.180
 pride sure as the bimbiminkia me 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.050
 really like to take the machine 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:07.730
 waiting for them near the sport is not then 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:09.620
 the mico would therefore come I want to 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.000
 today as perhaps it seems to me that the woman is 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.080
 the only person who doesn't know where yet 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.940
 Calls for which I have not yet 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.920
 asked before asking what you 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.500
 think of green what you tell me about 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.650
 revolution the new expensive yom package 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.440
 all hallow's eve is poor in fat 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.170
 a little more chrome question 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.560
 compromising for the one after 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.850
 knowing you and the package anyway 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.440
 revolution brought back a little 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.870
 want to play black ops two yes 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.810
 as we have some filed after 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.670
 not even so long but 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.170
 actually I didn't succeed 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.510
 agrees with that success 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.090
 they were more or less lacking that is what I had 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.280
 a little and there is always the same story 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.010
 however I'm package cuamm and it's not crazy and 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:58.180
 I think they are beautiful green yes yes that 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:00.830
 I like it or grind myself if I can have my say 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.380
 for me it has always been so on coccia e 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.760
 whenever first just before that 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.800
 the new package for must come out 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.840
 always the wish may have been also 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.910
 because by now it was the wait we knew that 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.440
 new maps would then come out of 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.270
 food starts me can't break 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.980
 balls rightly also seen that how many 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.720
 months before he came out the package 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.670
 how many months have passed since the release of 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.380
 game 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.880
 four months and four months at the end 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.140
 always on the usual maps that between 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.310
 the other in this black ops and I believe 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.870
 let them be less 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.960
 not much less but someone less 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.590
 there is and then chrome 6 in my opinion which one 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.420
 another factor like the 3 when tete 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.180
 the map package is released there too 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.250
 so zombies when you break i 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.830
 multiplayer cabasisi you can go 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.220
 on the zombie map you also deserve 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.650
 the new one and that the raids are fixed but 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.500
 the stuff I like to stay on the subject 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.080
 of the rewards that compared to mv 3 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.810
 where at one point it was a riot of 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.460
 video where there were people looking for hubs 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.950
 in order to understand each other 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.380
 at this point they went back to do some 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:07.300
 more than gameplay ok there is what comes 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:11.510
 not to take the famous swarm though 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.090
 they arrive less video on the swarm 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.970
 that comes from heaven and destroys everyone 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.130
 in a maximum instant because anyway 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.830
 there's me with what i noticed at 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.750
 end that removing all the super type 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.790
 mega complex rhythms of poultry then this 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.100
 is a personal opinion as lmv 2 at 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.560
 fiat to mortgages comes to nuclear era 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.690
 easy if you wear harrier cheries 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.730
 then he said I arrived that I know taylor 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.950
 cole to the support was facevi will declare the 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.380
 nuclear here a little more difficult second 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.990
 me to get to the swarm then more or 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.520
 less I think it is and even mary more color 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.190
 big is indeed you agree with 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.580
 you because there is nuclear by a certain 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.140
 point of view was that is until not 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.820
 came out black ops was the most powerful 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.440
 but now that it's gone black ops if there 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.180
 had it been nuclear I would have seen it 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.190
 with a release because the nuclear 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.720
 throw it once I kill you once and 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.760
 end the game we leave instead of 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.650
 hammer for as long as you have 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.330
 in the game and then leaving the model 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.570
 made so I don't even know too human 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.330
 race and why social presidia swarms e 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:15.610
 not 20137 near and down the champagne 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.610
 and the other one I have for him 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:25.310
 anyway if you give me one minute a 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:26.440
 moment again and I understood it myself not me 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.080
 to say that there is 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.730
 comparing the nuclear chance is a lot 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.580
 more rewarding to take a swarm 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.990
 also much more difficult than one 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.970
 nuclear therefore there is the fact that tim 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.660
 hammers for more time and lets you 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.460
 make more kills and quite enough 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.250
 deserved by the player is but the 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.170
 ugly I follow the ego but that sub the expensive 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.810
 take leave the train telli po 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.220
 hammers just over ten seconds 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.940
 then the opposing team quita 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:57.340
 practically yes 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.360
 in case you can't get him to mister 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.310
 battle 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.750
 I knew you took about 17 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.390
 18 no 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.420
 your own took the star air fleet 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.850
 wars star trek sauna everything and you don't know 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.920
 that exists after the train swarm and not 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.810
 you have the crayola version depriving 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.120
 neretini to the chairs because he is coming 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:19.300
 a battle is coming from the famous 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.520
 disheveled storm that is, after a 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.680
 presona swarm before here tar e 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.740
 begins to make the storm disheveled 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.150
 that is why it must be said is for this 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.050
 that not all men of black ops 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:34.330
 two have the perfect head bob 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.490
 there is the storm wait for you brings you 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.550
 directly into the zombie mode where 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:42.940
 you're dead and how many points you take 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:46.300
 this reward is taken care of 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:49.810
 Cafiero bridges from twenty dead in a row 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.910
 all cleared up everything we hope gentlemen 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.710
 we hope this chat with a 

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.840
 gameplay quite jab below with the 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.610
 machines you enjoyed we have 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.350
 so we tried to talk about ours 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:03.610
 it obviously rewards those of battle 

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:05.590
 don't take consistent sirs I vi 

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.800
