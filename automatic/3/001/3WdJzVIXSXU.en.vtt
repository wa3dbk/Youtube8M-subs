00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.090
 we are here with christian gaspari project 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.880
 manager of the sports family of the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.039
 ducati of panigale village will tell us 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.250
 some of the secrets of this new 899 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.079
 but the secrets are easy to reveal 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.509
 first of all the bike maintains 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.910
 the architecture and the pillars they have 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.699
 led the development of the 11 99 panigale 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.589
 then the new super square engine 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.239
 completely redefined with respect to 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.420
 past and the concept of frame 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.420
 monocoque 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.800
 thanks to the developments of this new one 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.690
 version we can make a 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.610
 significant power increase 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.040
 compared to the previous bikes 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.680
 family so we form the 148 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.690
 horses with a dense couple ed 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.470
 high at all rotation speeds 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.119
 of the engine 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.240
 this time compared to the past not 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.420
 we have only changed the engine and gods 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.070
 few details but we have worked 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.530
 strongly on the bike to change the 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.110
 focus of this project compared to a 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.960
 focus on more extreme performance like 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.790
 could be those of 11 99 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.680
 in fact the main objective is 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.570
 mission of this death to have a 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.289
 perfect balance for use in 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.300
 track but above all make it less 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.610
 intimidating easier to drive more 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.990
 fun and more comfortable too 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.990
 in road use 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.340
 one thing that catches the eye is the new 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.900
 swingarm but you haven't worked only at 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.740
 back because we also see one 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.960
 new fork 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.150
 we worked on the components 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.060
 main vehicle so we have a 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.060
 tank completely in steel with 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.880
 a fuel capacity equal to that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.220
 of the eleven 99 and comparing it with his 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.650
 predecessor of 3 liters higher than 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.020
 the 848 evo is also a kg 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.410
 less than the rotational tank 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.360
 of the 848 and of the eleven98 also the 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.550
 vehicle dynamics has changed therefore 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.740
 compared to eleven 99 just to have 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.810
 an easier bike we have more agile 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.330
 reduced the wheelbase this thanks 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.250
 to the use of a new swingarm and has 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.290
 therefore also reduced the steering angle 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.970
 the steering geometry is different 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.120
 the lowest steering angle for which the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.910
 motorbike is more agile in the curve entrances 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.040
 not only this the suspensions are 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.110
 dedicated and are at the top of the category 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.120
 of sports bikes not only of average 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.650
 displacement but also of the category in 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.570
 sport bikes in general indeed 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.360
 we have at the front a pair of 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.030
 forks show of christ further effort 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.320
 a shock absorber completely 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.620
 adjustable a geometry of the 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.120
 progressive rear suspension 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.790
 the steering damper then all 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.750
 important features for use 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.910
 also on the track for those who want to raise the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.840
 own level and have fun with highs 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.840
 performance on the track
