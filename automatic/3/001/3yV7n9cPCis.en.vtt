00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.190
 well all the guys and welcome in 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.069
 This brand new video is here today 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.559
 me too for the first time to bring you a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.280
 episode on the sale more than 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.199
 we will be talking about buying and selling 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.970
 also multiply by 5 mar the ten 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.010
 times your credits up and to the right 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.119
 how to wait until 17 March 2015 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.369
 obviously the date on which the tournament will be released 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.380
 of St. Patrick dedicated precisely to the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.920
 Irish holiday this tournament 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:42.000
 I repeat it will be March 17th 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.510
 and the winners will win a package from 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.719
 I don't remember 15 to 25 thousand more others 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.670
 15 thousand crisis so we talk about 30 40 k 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.039
 in only one tournament 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.579
 if I'm not mistaken, we say the tournament can 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.250
 be won multiple times we do not use not 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.320
 decreasing the prize money as and when 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.600
 always remaining the same and the requirements 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.930
 access is to have a team 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.390
 completely Irish so let's say 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.240
 most of you will have understood that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.490
 in those three four days in which it will come out 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.729
 the tournament is 95 percent of the version 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.770
 they will try to win the tournament 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.220
 and then to make a team 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.080
 completely Irish by the way there 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.670
 they will also want substitutes 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.659
 I recommend you to nine bodies or 3 4 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.500
 January 2015 already to buy i 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.840
 then Irish players for then 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.700
 sell them once the tournament is out 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.930
 I advise you to invest a good 10 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.930
 k the players 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.260
 3 mainly bronze because they are 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.220
 those quarrels and more will surely rise 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.140
 with the utmost certainty that ye may 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.630
 you will have to invest 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.190
 obviously not the bronze of 40 of 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.869
 speed even if gold rises 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.270
 they will go up but in those in that bronze with 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.740
 at least 70 80 speed as you can 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.700
 have as you can see this 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.080
 striker then I repeat 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.420
 buy these players 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.430
 you can also risk buying i 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.270
 gold players even if I don't remember 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.730
 very much like when i go up 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.480
 their prices I recommend you buy 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.840
 as gold surely coleman dj sara 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.350
 I think it will increase to around 10,000 credits 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.450
 safe but really safe to share that 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.450
 however they are players of 350 who 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.989
 surely they will be another thing in 1500 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.080
 I recommend vistra council of 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.060
 buy the players in shape now for 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.320
 which sell them because these players 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.549
 last year it really cost 100 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.040
 200 thousand crimes 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.580
 I still remember a bronze in the states from 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.850
 acs law youtuber umbro area that cost 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.680
 200 thousand credits therefore truly with itself 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:14.510
 absurd not seen not advise 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:17.360
 buy players silver players 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.480
 because I really don't know yes 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.660
 they will raise me whether or not I say about it 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.720
 to the gold and bronze of really they will have 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.640
 a growth of absurd money is there and 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.060
 last year I could not buy 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.500
 not even one player 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.319
 let's say bronze for less than 700 800 credits 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.930
 there really was 10 thousand pounds spent 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.940
 to live a team completely 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.069
 bronze so how can you see this 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.970
 already it costs 20 thousand credits I don't know how much 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.620
 will cost during the tournament 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.569
 I really recommend you use 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.560
 this method because you can get it 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:59.019
 even 100,000 credits focusing on certain 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.319
 players I recommend if you if you 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:07.780
 you will invest 100 110 thousand clicks on the bronze 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.810
 you will very well be able to get the 50's 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.330
 60 thousand but really is he is it easy 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.329
 so from but if all and I hope the 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.669
 video you enjoyed if you enjoyed it
