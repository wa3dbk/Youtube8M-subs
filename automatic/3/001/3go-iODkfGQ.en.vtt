00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.290
 ah 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.120
 no no no 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.800
 very good and all beings guys and in 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.140
 beni 2 a doctor erasing American and in 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.940
 this case we are in vampira z that is a 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.619
 minigame that good taught me a friend 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.029
 my name is hiccup a couple of 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.830
 days and the truth is that I liked 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.460
 quite because it's a video game that 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.810
 good 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.220
 I played a similar game a while ago in the 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.020
 which you have to go infecting people or 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.710
 suddenly this form goes one but in 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.329
 this case there are vampires against humans in 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.800
 this case appears a vampire in which 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.510
 has full visibility of all the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.340
 ground and then there are the humans that 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.870
 are those who try to survive kill 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.340
 these vampires I have to tell you that 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.720
 every time you kill a vampire they give us 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.720
 some gold coins with which we can 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.160
 buy equipment I will buy weapons by 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.230
 example already enchanted to be able 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.060
 try to defend ourselves a little too 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.040
 we humans do not have full visibility 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.330
 so we only see a little bit to 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.160
 around us it is as if we throw the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.900
 chips me that is two because we see it 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.460
 everything dark and without more let's give it a 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.330
 bit vampire z so you can see what it is 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.370
 what I am telling 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.409
 let's see some game that starts 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.380
 well to the focus and they are all as empty not 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.470
 to see and see or detour then 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.729
 the reader me and here back there is nothing 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.930
 get away like that people or I see that not 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.880
 gets anywhere I do not know what is 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.610
 going to a sector of putting energy 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.710
 but I want to go see and see 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.690
 hello sir this looks like a repressor to a 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.810
 pre duck good thing is that I love 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.810
 to put 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.660
 hey in fact one told me first the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.950
 done place as you read your play because 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.960
 because they tell me that I learn to 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.380
 play if it's play let's see let's 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.570
 get us you have days of a pita because 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.400
 this man this is not very heavy I 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.450
 you're following everywhere is that of 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.720
 fact I think everyone is getting into 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.720
 the clean 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.869
 you are seeing the same if a human and what 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.400
 that try to try is to go up and 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.690
 hide wherever I can what I 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.030
 I like are the ones seen as more 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.380
 closed because if also some kind of 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.360
 vampire well here I think I do not know 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.180
 can give I have to tell you that the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.250
 vampires are a little children of the great their 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.800
 mother because when they start giving you 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.090
 like you do not really know where you're going 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.010
 they're coming because both of them this one 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.450
 they come to you from all sides is to psuv 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.209
 nordis okay I think I'm moving away 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:22.650
 much of the focus or I think a pretty 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.650
 I think it's worth 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.070
 well right now I have on the right the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.819
 theme of the goal that with this we can 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.780
 buy your colony here 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.950
 I can buy if I want the one of the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.659
 burning plain that has like mine 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.889
 I'm going to buy it, but I should not 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.049
 the bought but most of all so that 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.870
 see how football is and every X 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.879
 time they go like giving you more money to 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.930
 things try to put the door all that 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.790
 tell you that vampires also 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.040
 they stick through what comes to be the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.500
 crystals and all so good it 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.530
 his would be like hiding well I think that 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.819
 here in fact before in the east and mental 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.019
 I go 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.370
 fort of youtube or that they want me 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.870
 kill me to post I do not understand very well 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.819
 that we are all those who hate the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.419
 youtubers let's see 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:16.459
 in fact the zombie to hit them to see if 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:16.459
 Can you give me a little something of a goal? 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.250
 14 coins, no, but I think that's fine 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.709
 mattress something like in general for 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.540
 spend on this server that is the dmc 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.239
 dot pixel point of pose to which we 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.530
 Interested in entering that playing is still very 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.790
 well you know if you like the kind of 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.980
 minigames but leaving me like a 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.269
 comment validate a lot to know 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.099
 what kind of mini-games do you like in the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.360
 channel because for example the slip 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.160
 survival not os 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.800
 I think he did not like it, he did not finish 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:51.800
 curdle in the channel although it has like my 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:54.000
 bursting line 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.100
 and good start watching right now 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.230
 I have everything and I have right now as a 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.010
 kind of vampire phases like the claw 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.330
 of the vampire to now kill these 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.790
 survivors that remain but will remain 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.680
 because these to see where you are this is 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.570
 a church here they try to hide 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.380
 so Mr. Bernal is viable 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.090
 sick 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:19.250
 I think there's a guy here I 'm not inside 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.639
 is hidden and you can argue about 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.639
 a lot of life 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.449
 now he has become a vampire but 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.860
 as you are seeing every time it kills us 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.599
 we are going to become vampires and 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.340
 martyrs all the time until trying 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.199
 do away with all of them is a way to 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.449
 game that I find very cool because 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.219
 how are you going as a means advancing not with the 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.569
 issue of receiving with yes of more then what 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.009
 I see funny and apart is fun is 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.289
 games with friends all hide or 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.849
 If you do or if you fear me, it's cool and 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.169
 well you know that many people emit 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.650
 ships but because you do not say when are you going to 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:50.680
 play yes I 'm going to for example decided 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:56.229
 record this so to speak because I 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.830
 set a normal blanket if I can 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.830
 warn 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.020
 to kill him 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.050
 ok they are like waves and still are I think 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.669
 that a wave is left and that it was a 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.619
 survivor that tells us where the and will be 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.089
 survivor piquÃ© da I do not think it's very 

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:21.319
 far in fact they will be already we can create 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:23.270
 through the windows as I have 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:26.119
 said at the beginning I do not know how the 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.649
 good football I think of the minimums that 

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:28.909
 most liked in channels the escapes 

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:30.559
 the beast that the truth is that it is very 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:32.569
 Pimp is also one of the games that 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:34.069
 only me, I like them, they are super 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.689
 cool on the subject of go doing parkour 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:36.919
 and escaping what happens is that I think that 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.240
 the time has the background also has a 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.800
 little disadvantage not because like the 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.990
 others are going to do parkour go to 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.360
 get quickly to the area where they catch 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.669
 all the team and you post you do not have 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.909
 any kind of advantages to which you leave 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:53.349
 about five seconds later you have to 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:55.129
 move from all go directly to 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.939
 directly to the part where the 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.789
 equipment so that they can not 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.050
 get it this way can kill them 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.240
 easily but good let's see where 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.889
 there is the one that remains, you have not hidden 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:12.189
 I've been here for two 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:12.189
 turns trying a vampire 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.499
 it's not here we never go by cully 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.870
 nothing in fact keeps walking the line 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:25.490
 to be waves of zombies but I'm still 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.110
 see this guy let's see down by 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.090
 here to see where this takes me 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.320
 it is very strange good all the 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.490
 minigames that have fired you is the one of 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.620
 mega of the same thing what happens is that it gives me 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.450
 the same is quite long to play and 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.680
 therefore I have to catch a day that 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.940
 have some time and do a little 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.260
 of football or the truth is that it is 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.400
 pretty cool and just so that 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.990
 have a contact of the 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.270
 videogame I will also leave the ip the 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.860
 kind surely if it's not mc point 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.270
 high pixel dot net because then 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.130
 I always forget about things between 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.360
 in the station and so on more and more 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.320
 guys who like after leaving 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.180
 I like your comments 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.590
 help me a lot and if you stay 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.670
 a little bit the video I'm sorry 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.140
 a lot but it is that right now I have 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.850
 that go to work at none the time it 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.890
 I came over and I wanted to 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.420
 record a bit of random mini-games 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.650
 more than anything also to show you what 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.870
 I'm discovering so we'll see each other 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:11.720
 a very big hug and until the 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.720
 next the bad
