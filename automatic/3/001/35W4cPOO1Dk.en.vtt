at in Flanders in Belgium and I would

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.690 
at in Flanders in Belgium and I would
like<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.600> spend<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.710> little<00:00:07.799> time<00:00:07.950> introducing

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
like to spend a little time introducing

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.629 
like to spend a little time introducing
our<00:00:08.849> new<00:00:08.880> bike<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:10.170> we<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.160> got<00:00:11.309> ready<00:00:11.550> and

this will be the first race this weekend
for<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.460> for<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.150> rabobank<00:00:15.420> team<00:00:16.190> the<00:00:17.190> bike<00:00:17.369> I

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
for the for the rabobank team the bike I

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.730 
for the for the rabobank team the bike I
have<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.869> new<00:00:19.020> bike<00:00:19.260> called<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
have here is the new bike called the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.570 
have here is the new bike called the
defy<00:00:20.130> advanced<00:00:20.939> SL<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.250> this<00:00:23.250> bike<00:00:23.550> is

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
defy advanced SL and this bike is

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.490 
defy advanced SL and this bike is
specifically<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> cobbled<00:00:25.350> classics

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
specifically for the cobbled classics

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.460 
specifically for the cobbled classics
and<00:00:26.039> there<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.490> several<00:00:26.810> key<00:00:27.810> issues<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.260> want

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and there are several key issues I want

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.429 
and there are several key issues I want
to<00:00:28.590> show<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.400> point<00:00:29.640> out<00:00:29.820> about<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.689> bike<00:00:30.869> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
to show it point out about the bike that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.410 
to show it point out about the bike that
makes<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.800> different<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.640> current<00:00:33.210> bike

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
makes it different to the current bike

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.900 
makes it different to the current bike
the<00:00:33.780> TCR<00:00:34.260> advanced<00:00:34.770> which<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.160> used<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.670> other

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
the TCR advanced which is used in other

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.229 
the TCR advanced which is used in other
races<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> main<00:00:38.610> king<00:00:38.879> thing<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
races the one of the main king thing is

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.400 
races the one of the main king thing is
is<00:00:39.329> compliance<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:41.120> that<00:00:42.120> means<00:00:42.360> one<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
is compliance and that means one of the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.529 
is compliance and that means one of the
most<00:00:43.620> important<00:00:44.070> thing<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> lose<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.390> much

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
most important thing is to lose as much

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.690 
most important thing is to lose as much
of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> vibrations<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.100> join<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
of the vibrations as you can join the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.170 
of the vibrations as you can join the
race<00:00:48.050> out<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> riders<00:00:50.010> legs<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.730> more

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
race out of the riders legs and more

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.360 
race out of the riders legs and more
onto<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> frame<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.440> saves<00:00:52.770> him<00:00:53.010> energy

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
onto the frame so it saves him energy

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.990 
onto the frame so it saves him energy
and<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.270> do<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.629> here<00:00:55.079> with<00:00:55.890> two<00:00:56.070> things<00:00:56.309> one

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and we do this here with two things one

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.229 
and we do this here with two things one
is<00:00:57.030> we've<00:00:57.660> increased<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.469> diameter<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.430> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
is we've increased the diameter of the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.619 
is we've increased the diameter of the
top<00:01:00.690> tube<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.039> down<00:01:02.219> tube<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
top tube is the down tube and of the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
top tube is the down tube and of the
down<00:01:03.809> tube<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.320> therefore<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> allows<00:01:05.129> more

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
down tube and therefore it allows more

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.020 
down tube and therefore it allows more
vibrations<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:07.229> go<00:01:07.439> out<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.820> club

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
vibrations here to go out in in the club

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.910 
vibrations here to go out in in the club
winner<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> cobbles<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.530> other<00:01:10.650> key

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
winner in the cobbles and the other key

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.649 
winner in the cobbles and the other key
thing<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.610> design<00:01:12.000> feature<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.540> have

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
thing is this design feature we have

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.950 
thing is this design feature we have
here<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> ISP<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> integrated<00:01:14.310> seatpost

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
here on the ISP the integrated seatpost

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.770 
here on the ISP the integrated seatpost
we<00:01:15.960> cut<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.560> by<00:01:16.650> cutting<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.130> away<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.780> we've

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
we cut it by cutting it away here we've

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.380 
we cut it by cutting it away here we've
now<00:01:18.960> made<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.229> able<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.310> dissipate<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
now made it able to it dissipate so it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.840 
now made it able to it dissipate so it
makes<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.780> less<00:01:21.990> harder<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.280> riders<00:01:23.670> when

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
makes it less harder on the riders when

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.399 
makes it less harder on the riders when
they're<00:01:24.000> riding<00:01:24.330> fast<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> cobbles

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
they're riding fast on the cobbles

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.140 
they're riding fast on the cobbles
because<00:01:25.619> that's<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.040> key<00:01:26.430> element<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.970> these

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
because that's a key element in these

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.569 
because that's a key element in these
races<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.840> other<00:01:27.960> parts<00:01:28.409> here<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:29.250> is

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
races the other parts here there is

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.780 
races the other parts here there is
there<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> head<00:01:30.329> tube<00:01:31.130> with<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.159> overdrive

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
there the head tube with the overdrive

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.300 
there the head tube with the overdrive
here<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.320> head<00:01:34.500> tube<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.040> at<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
here on the head tube and it's at the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.760 
here on the head tube and it's at the
extra<00:01:35.610> length<00:01:35.810> again<00:01:36.810> slightly<00:01:37.320> longer

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
extra length again slightly longer

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
extra length again slightly longer
higher<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.210> again<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> makes<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.900> more

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
higher so again it makes it more

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.920 
higher so again it makes it more
comfortable<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.799> more<00:01:40.860> stable<00:01:41.490> because<00:01:42.180> when

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
comfortable and more stable because when

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.270 
comfortable and more stable because when
they're<00:01:43.049> riding<00:01:43.320> fast<00:01:43.560> around<00:01:43.710> corners<00:01:44.159> in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
they're riding fast around corners in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.539 
they're riding fast around corners in
the<00:01:44.369> cobbles<00:01:44.729> stability<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.479> very<00:01:45.780> important

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
the cobbles stability is very important

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.030 
the cobbles stability is very important
and<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.759> other<00:01:47.880> feature<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.140> rear<00:01:49.710> stays

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
and the other feature is the rear stays

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.870 
and the other feature is the rear stays
here<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.759> longer<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:52.590> made<00:01:52.799> them<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> bit<00:01:53.670> long

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
here is longer we made them a bit long

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.539 
here is longer we made them a bit long
longer<00:01:54.329> than<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.290> color<00:01:55.500> bikes<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.130> again

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
longer than on the color bikes and again

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.819 
longer than on the color bikes and again
that<00:01:56.729> gives<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.329> more<00:01:58.140> comfort<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
that gives it more more comfort and a

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.359 
that gives it more more comfort and a
more<00:01:59.009> better<00:01:59.159> rolling<00:01:59.700> on<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.689> cobbles<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
more better rolling on the cobbles and

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.609 
more better rolling on the cobbles and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
finally under on the fork to straight a

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.310 
finally under on the fork to straight a

fork and the steerer tube is extra

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.830 
fork and the steerer tube is extra
strengthened<00:02:07.879> for<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.270> extra<00:02:09.539> rigors

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
strengthened for for the extra rigors

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.619 
strengthened for for the extra rigors
that<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.140> does<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.730> then<00:02:11.730> they<00:02:11.940> are<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.239> extra

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
that it does and then they are the extra

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.430 
that it does and then they are the extra
clearance

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
clearance

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.760 
clearance
because<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.490> tires<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:15.060> normally<00:02:15.960> either<00:02:16.110> 25

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
because the tires are normally either 25

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.730 
because the tires are normally either 25
or<00:02:17.250> even<00:02:17.640> 28<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.750> bike<00:02:18.960> can<00:02:19.200> can<00:02:19.590> have

or even 28 and this bike can can have
both<00:02:19.980> without<00:02:21.080> affecting<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.910> breaking<00:02:24.890> of

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
both without affecting the breaking of

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.050 
both without affecting the breaking of
the<00:02:26.280> bike<00:02:27.650> we<00:02:28.650> designed<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.310> black<00:02:29.490> instead

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
the bike we designed it in black instead

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.570 
the bike we designed it in black instead
of<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.360> typical<00:02:30.930> white<00:02:31.350> bike<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:32.430> this

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
of the typical white bike for this

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.840 
of the typical white bike for this
because<00:02:33.470> these<00:02:34.470> bikes<00:02:34.770> have<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.250> little<00:02:35.670> bit

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
because these bikes have a little bit

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.880 
because these bikes have a little bit
extra<00:02:35.970> weight<00:02:36.450> for<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.260> stiffness

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
extra weight for the for the stiffness

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.580 
extra weight for the for the stiffness
and<00:02:38.070> for<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.850> compliance<00:02:39.450> about<00:02:40.170> having<00:02:40.440> it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
and for the compliance about having it

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.660 
and for the compliance about having it
black<00:02:41.280> we<00:02:41.490> save<00:02:42.350> extra<00:02:43.350> weights<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
black we save extra weights so that the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.130 
black we save extra weights so that the
bike<00:02:44.850> ends<00:02:45.150> up<00:02:45.270> being<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.570> same<00:02:45.780> weight<00:02:45.960> at

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
bike ends up being the same weight at

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.760 
bike ends up being the same weight at
6.8<00:02:47.900> for<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.960> race<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.960> yes<00:02:51.960> we're<00:02:52.500> looking

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
6.8 for the race and yes we're looking

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.000 
6.8 for the race and yes we're looking
forward<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.780> some<00:02:54.780> decent<00:02:55.230> racing<00:02:55.620> this

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
forward to some decent racing this

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.430 
forward to some decent racing this
weekend
