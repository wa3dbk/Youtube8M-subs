00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.189 
hopefully hopefully if all goes well we
can<00:04:40.310> come<00:04:40.580> in<00:04:40.669> with<00:04:40.759> a<00:04:40.819> Swampert<00:04:41.449> and<00:04:41.750> just

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
can come in with a Swampert and just

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.719 
can come in with a Swampert and just
annihilate<00:04:42.500> this<00:04:42.889> thing<00:04:43.099> or<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.310> can<00:04:43.460> come<00:04:43.610> in
