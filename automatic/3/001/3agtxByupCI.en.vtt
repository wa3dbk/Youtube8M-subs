00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.680
 We are already working on the cover of the 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:16.830
 trunk of a bolus 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.830
 with the machine is on horseback 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.740
 two 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.210
 this time to return to the sheet towards 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.810
 in making suckers with this part 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.020
 of the tool 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.330
 when we passed to regulate the 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.250
 intensity is done directly on the 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.250
 push button that reaches the tip of the handle 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.699
 and once she has spent the plate 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.859
 inside we can further develop 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.859
 the parts you have to develop 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.480
 the simple routes of a pink rod 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.650
 and you can sharpen it as you go 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.900
 has worn out there is no kind of 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.990
 consumables or anything 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.490
 they can also get as a spare 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.410
 on the one hand it has a threaded edge and 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.390
 the other side has a 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:30.390
 a copper rod to make the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.390
 sucker 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.300
 how can you see how easy it is and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.640
 also practical 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.530
 you do not need any kind of 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.750
 tool more only with this one 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.930
 depending on the use of the sheet and the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.940
 strength you need to develop the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.900
 part that is working can go 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.880
 regulating therefrom the same handle 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.190
 of the machine and go regulating the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:06.850
 intensity for 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:09.789
 to get more or less more or less sheet 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.780
 obviously it takes a little time 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.780
 take it in your hand 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.830
 I will take the hand to the machine for good 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.690
 to be able to handle and get the best 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.760
 results 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.760
 but neither is it impossible 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.080
 obviously the advantage of then 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.970
 and obviously it's not for everything all 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.800
 the buns but the vast majority the bag 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.220
 you can work with this and the 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.110
 ease is that it is not necessary to disarm 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.810
 the interior upholstery of the car 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.740
 disarm interiors 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.020
 nerves of the cars to be able 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:54.230
 and good to be able to iron the sheet and 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.230
 to undo the bun that has the car 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.700
 so that they have an idea more or less a 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.700
 work 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.900
 this car had a blow that good now 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.030
 the advanced video is already but this one 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.230
 state had a blow on the part 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.230
 back on the lid 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.170
 and well this more or less an hour ago and 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.110
 mean that what we end up with is 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.030
 working and you can see results in 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.790
 another video let's see the evolution 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.030
 from a bag from the beginning to 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.900
 until the end more or less how long 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.849
 we are here to finish this work 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.829
 half an hour half hour or let's go to 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.760
 finish with this piece so that you 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.190
 have an idea of the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.560
 of speed 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.030
 with which allows us to work this is 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.959
 a designed way 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.850
 very simple practice without anything of 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.850
 complications has the handle 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.100
 it's a team that simply 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.330
 or less 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.360
 has the ignition tab the cable 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.360
 feeding 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.800
 a small samper fuse and then the 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.230
 cable outlet that good to spend a 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.780
 little twisted but I hope you 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.780
 can appreciate in the video and they are ready 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.660
 a cable length of 3 meters a 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.620
 Dough clip is very important to the 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.660
 mass that is 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.090
 the closer you are to the area that 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.630
 we are working better is going to be the 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.900
 better result goes better or it will stick and 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.090
 easier we can get to work the 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.680
 dough clamp that they also have 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.630
 terminals in some cases does more 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.199
 practical remove the clamp from dough and 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.120
 locate the terminal screw a part 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.660
 of the bodywork when work does not 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.660
 It allows 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.020
 or one with practice when one goes 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:05.250
 taking practice you know how much 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.920
 of intensity you have to give to the 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.870
 that stick the handle and how can 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.350
 also appreciate something a little 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.740
 detail that this part of the handle we 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.130
 it serves to leverage and 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.570
 can you take out 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.900
 makes less effort to remove the sheet 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.900
 outside 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.080
 i 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.180
 we are going to have seen that they do not have 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.500
 no type of consumables simply 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.060
 the rod that is being smoothed the putting 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.210
 adapting to the rod as they 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.850
 working with a flat file or the one 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.740
 want with a grinder with a disk of 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.200
 I'm going to give shape to the 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.770
 point itself is when it goes 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.240
 working 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.860
 Carrying account when necessary 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.710
 retouch the tip you can 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:02.470
 have seen that in these 5 minutes of 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.470
 video will we have 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.920
 retouched the tip twice but 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.540
 is very practical and you can 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.620
 see that we are back to work without 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.620
 no type of inconvenience 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.180
 well I hope this video has them 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.280
 clarified enough doubts and that good 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.819
 any curve you have, do not hesitate 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.080
 ask how good we will try 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.680
 answer everything you need 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.680
 for later
