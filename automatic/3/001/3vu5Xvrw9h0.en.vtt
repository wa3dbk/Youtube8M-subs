so here I am to show you how to actually
get<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:24.080> so<00:00:25.080> first<00:00:25.410> things<00:00:25.619> first<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.920> need

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
get that so first things first you need

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.519 
get that so first things first you need
to<00:00:26.130> find<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.460> magic<00:00:26.730> herb<00:00:27.170> and<00:00:28.609> capture<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:30.529> and

to find a magic herb and capture it and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.500 
to find a magic herb and capture it and
while<00:00:31.830> that's<00:00:31.949> capturing<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.910> also<00:00:33.149> will

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
while that's capturing you also will

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
while that's capturing you also will
need<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.960> flint<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.410> steel<00:00:34.440> or<00:00:35.280> lava<00:00:37.040> lava

need a flint and steel or lava lava

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.470 
need a flint and steel or lava lava
actually<00:00:38.399> probably<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> easier<00:00:39.270> way<00:00:39.360> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
actually probably is the easier way to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.880 
actually probably is the easier way to
do<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.809> let<00:00:39.989> me<00:00:40.079> actually<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> bucket<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
do this let me actually get a bucket of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.630 
do this let me actually get a bucket of
lava

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.160 

again<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.820> find<00:00:45.000> any<00:00:45.120> natural<00:00:45.329> occurring

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
again you can find any natural occurring

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.430 
again you can find any natural occurring
pool<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.590> lava<00:00:46.770> as<00:00:47.070> well<00:00:48.079> alright<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.379> I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
pool of lava as well alright so now I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.220 
pool of lava as well alright so now I
have<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> Magikarp<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.190> my<00:00:50.309> team<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.989> is

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230

the<00:00:52.820> burnt<00:00:53.820> Magikarp<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.870> here's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> normal

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the burnt Magikarp so here's a normal

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.880 
the burnt Magikarp so here's a normal
Magikarp<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.960> need<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> first<00:00:58.379> burn<00:00:58.680> them

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
Magikarp and you need to first burn them

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.220 
Magikarp and you need to first burn them
by<00:00:59.160> putting<00:00:59.640> them<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.789> lava<00:01:00.120> or<00:01:00.449> setting<00:01:01.140> them

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
by putting them in lava or setting them

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.889 
by putting them in lava or setting them
on<00:01:01.289> fire<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:02.039> some<00:01:02.250> method<00:01:02.899> extinguish
