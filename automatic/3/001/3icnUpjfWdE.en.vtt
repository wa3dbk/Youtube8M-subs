00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.480
Hi.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.480
I'm Juli Auclair.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.480
Welcome to Parents TV.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.650
Whether it's an allergy, lactose intolerance
or just a picky eater, there are many reasons

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.440
why some children don't get enough calcium
through dairy.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.780
Well, joining us today is registered dietician
Tanya Zuckerbot to talk about some great milk

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.780
alternatives.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.310
And Tanya is the author of the F Factor Diet.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.350
Thank you so much for coming in.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.350
&gt;&gt;My pleasure, Juli.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.279
&gt;&gt;So, we hear it all the time that milk is
so important for kids.

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.350
But why so?

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.259
&gt;&gt;Well, milk is necessary for strong bones.

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.300
As a matter of fact, by the time you're done
with your teen years, you have put away probably

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.789
50 percent of what you need for the rest of
your live.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.800
So, those former years of our childhood are
really important for getting enough calcium.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.230
And as far as the requirements for calcium
go, for children ages 1 to 3, it's recommended

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.030
that children get on 500mg of calcium from
ages 4 to 8, you're aiming for 800 mg of calcium,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.079
and the really important years, those teen
years from ages 9 to 18, it's 1, 300 mg of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.559
calcium which is actually a highly recommended
daily amount than even for adults.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.860
So, those teen years are really important
but that's why you gotta be given -- with

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.390
your children, when they're young to introduce
these calcium- rich food, so that it's a habit

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.730
they'd stick with throughout their teens.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.250
&gt;&gt;What about kids who don't like milk or just
don't drink enough of it or maybe don't eat

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.250
a lot of dairy products.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.900
How do they -- are they getting enough?

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.040
&gt;&gt;They're not.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.780
Most of the time, for example, a lot of times
when children or toddlers especially dropped

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.620
their bottles, that's the last time they're
gonna drink milk.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.680
And then, they tend to go for more sugary
drinks such as juice or soda.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.830
Studies show that most teenage girls, in fact,
85 percent are not meeting the RDA for calcium

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.350
and 60 percent of boys are not meeting the
RDA either.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.250
So today, we're gonna go over some really
easy and delicious ways of getting some calcium

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.450
into your kids.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.450
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.460
So, you've got some food here that has a lot
of calcium in it and it's easy to incorporate

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.460
into the diet.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.460
Tell us what you have.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.880
&gt;&gt;Well, the first groups are dairy foods.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.740
And that's because, the easiest way to get
calcium into diet is to really on the dairy

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.740
foods.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.600
Those inherently had the most calcium.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.330
But if plain milk is not an option for kids
are refusing it.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.850
What I found, as a mother myself, is that
my children love the flavored milk.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.850
&gt;&gt;Uh- hmm.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.869
&gt;&gt;And even though, there's slightly more sugar
than a regular milk due to the flavoring.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.340
It's still lot less sugar than juice or soda.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.879
And with these flavored milk, from here we
had an example of banana, chocolate, and there's

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.450
vanilla and there's strawberry.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.020
For a one container, you get 300mg of calcium.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.590
&gt;&gt;It really a good dose there.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.590
&gt;&gt;It's a lot.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.020
&gt;&gt;Yogurt is another great source of calcium.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.609
You can get 300mg from yogurt as well.

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.950
And string cheese.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.470
One of those string cheese contain about 150mg
of calcium.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.330
And this is a cheese a lot of kids love and
it's easy to stick into the lunchbox.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.470
&gt;&gt;Absolutely, my daughter just loves the string
cheese.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.470
She can't get enough of it.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.249
My son, is allergic to milk so he needs to
eat things that have calcium in them that

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.349
aren't dairy foods, and you have some examples
of that.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.349
&gt;&gt;We do.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.359
Beginning with vegetables, here's an example
of sweet potato.

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.779
And this is gonna have around 90mg of calcium.

00:02:55.779 --> 00:03:01.290
[ unk ] and spinach also other high calcium
vegetables, as far as fruit go raisins naturally

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.769
contain calcium around 2 / 3 of a cup of raisins
will give you approximately 16mg of calcium

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.340
and then you have Edamame.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.829
Edamame [ unk ] and kids love Edamame.

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.510
You pick it into them -- in the pods.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.980
They like to pop into your mouth.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.980
&gt;&gt;Right.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.049
&gt;&gt;Even the shell -- I mean, it's just a great,
great addition to the diet.

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.440
And you're gonna get around 150mg of calcium
from Edamame.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.170
And you can also incorporate foods that are
enriched with calcium too.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.170
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.709
And this one -- to our next group.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.969
Foods that don't naturally contain calcium
but are fortified.

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.849
And here we have orange juice.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.010
A container of orange juice around a cup is
gonna give you 300mg of calcium which is the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.959
exact same amount as a cup of milk.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.110
So that's huge, if you know, when you're giving
your child beverages.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.299
Think about the calcium- fortified orange
juice as an alternative to milk.

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.250
And then we have a serial here, golden Grahams.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.279
Believe it or not, if you see here, they have
a good source of calcium on the box.

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:59.519
And if you serve this with a cup of milk,
you can get as much as 350mg of calcium into

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.519
your child.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.189
So, think about even breakfast foods -- &gt;&gt;Right.

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.459
&gt;&gt;Between orange juice and the Golden Grahams,
you're meeting half the RDA.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.459
&gt;&gt;They do pretty well there.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.769
&gt;&gt;And then, if you're looking for something
little salty, little, you know, crunchy -- cheeses.

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.279
You know, [ unk ] the cheese, that's also
gonna have some calcium around 60mg of calcium.

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.600
&gt;&gt;Okay, now what about supplements, if your
child doesn't like any of these things.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.130
Can you give them something else too?

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.030
&gt;&gt;You can give your child a calcium supplement
or a multivitamins.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.010
It's gonna have calcium.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.390
But studies do show that the bio- availability
of calcium from supplement is not as high

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.600
as some food.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.730
So, always think food first.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.640
If you're not concern, of course, you can
always supplement.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.120
But, we're gonna show you some really easy
examples of breakfast or lunch that you're

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.030
gonna need all your calcium needs through
foods alone.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.640
So, it really is quite simple to do and when
you're using food, you're also getting many

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.840
other benefits such as vitamins and nutrients
and fiber and other things that kids need.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.840
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.790
Let's start with the breakfast you were talking
about here.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.790
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.080
So this is a breakfast, which is an oatmeal.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.940
And we've made this with some skim milk.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.030
We're getting the calcium from the oatmeal
and the milk served with a cup of yogurt and

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.820
some of this calcium fortified orange juice.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.080
And this breakfast has 850mg of calcium.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.280
&gt;&gt;Wow, that's fantastic.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.280
&gt;&gt;That's a day's worth.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.320
It's a day's worth with just a breakfast.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.430
&gt;&gt;You don't even have to worry for the rest
of the day.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.430
&gt;&gt;You don't have to worry.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.160
&gt;&gt;However, you can have it in your lunch too.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.250
Tell us about we have here.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.250
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.250
And this is great.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.430
This is a sandwich made with calcium fortified
bread.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.800
I don't think a lot of people don't think
of bread is a source of calcium.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.160
But, if you find the right brands and this
one is, you know, marketed just for kids.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.420
This has around 160mg of calcium per size.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.420
&gt;&gt;Wow, that's fantastic.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.420
&gt;&gt;A lot.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.420
The kids love white bread.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.820
&gt;&gt;If you ever making a sandwich, that's right
320mg.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.660
And we serve some Edamame, and here we have
some chocolate soy milk.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.680
&gt;&gt;My son's favorite.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.220
&gt;&gt;So, this would be a perfect lunch actually
for your son who you said is lactose intolerant,

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.760
because there is no dairy item in here.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.490
All the calcium are coming from fortified
foods and foods that naturally contain calcium.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.280
So, here, you have the chocolate soymilk,
and here you have Graham crackers and Graham

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.780
crackers are also a fantastic health.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.930
&gt;&gt;Thank you so much.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.520
All great ideas for Moms who just don't know
what to do to get more calcium into their

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.520
kids' diet.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.520
Thank you for coming in.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.520
&gt;&gt;Oh, it's my pleasure.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.520
&gt;&gt;Great to meet you.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.520
&gt;&gt;You too.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520
&gt;&gt;And thank you for watching Parents TV.
