00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.330
 now let's do a little drawing 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.450
 closer to the reality that you are going 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:15.570
 I'm going to draw an area here. 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:18.539
 of 12 front by 30 deep 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.500
 on the ground in these measures would be 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.680
 my head 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.390
 in meters so I use the command 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.439
 for example of a line moved by the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.920
 keyboard 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.660
 l I will indicate the start point and then 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.140
 point in the direction I want 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 note that the cursor has a message 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.899
 saying looks at the measure up to that point 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.610
 you're 500 and is something that in the case 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.739
 of 585 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.110
 maybe if I make a line of 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.050
 length 30 now she gets very 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.300
 small but I'll do 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.579
 and then we 'll adjust the view 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.699
 That 's how it works. 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.100
 then points in the 30-digit direction with the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.359
 depth between the size of the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.119
 line approach with the south using the mouse 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.119
 or pull to the side using the 3rd mouse and 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.430
 never lose track of what you are is 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.780
 line is still drawn here tÃ¡ 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.790
 for you on the court 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.350
 you simply block the object in the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.360
 canvas keeps drawing 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.689
 Now I will tell you about it and I want a life. 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.930
 of 12 now having spot on this other 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.210
 direction 30 again to have and now I want 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.720
 close because I started the line and did not 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 I stopped so I can use the option c 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.610
 that this one of the very close that enters 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.890
 and he closed my area here a lot 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.520
 well then now over that area I 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.259
 I will use a command to simulate the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.350
 wall design that offset command 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:55.470
 offset on his icon here is this command 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.189
 here 17 by the keyboard is just you type 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.049
 powder 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.880
 I always prefer the keyboard then 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.450
 offset holder 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.659
 So, how does the command work? 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.300
 always read the ready he's asking you 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.160
 to specify the distance each 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.380
 command have your different questions 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.150
 but if you pay attention you see that 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.220
 always repeat the same procedure 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.990
 no surprise 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.210
 so you just get used to this 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.270
 sequence of questions is saying 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.670
 what's the distance 97 I'm going to say that the 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.140
 distance of 7 is the wall thickness 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.070
 because I want to copy this line here 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.960
 inside 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.960
 say that the appliance has 25 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.300
 centimeters but my drawing has meters 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.330
 then you have to think meters how much is 25 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.900
 inches in meters in meters would be 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.350
 point 25 auditors in chrome point 25 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.070
 how much this thickness of the apparatus is 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.890
 enter 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.720
 The command is very simple. 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.270
 you simply select the line that 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.120
 if you want to copy movement but exaggerate 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.790
 tanaka click here it does not look good 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.600
 far in the direction you want to go 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.120
 from here to here 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.260
 so click here it made the line 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.210
 understand the direction 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.490
 I want to get this line to play here. 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.020
 so I click on the line it continues the same 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.420
 distance 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.010
 so how have not you changed the distance? 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.400
 continue in command here exaggerate click 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.850
 on here 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.970
 exaggerates the clip here and so I did the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.110
 my offset from all the walls around 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.170
 we will see how it gives the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.560
 here in this 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.820
 bit of line that before that 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.130
 I want to show you how we could 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.000
 make a division here now 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.900
 of this area 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.270
 I want to generate a room here. 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.010
 say seven meters 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.280
 so from that line I want her to 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.810
 come seven meters away, but my 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.910
 offset command I 'm using now 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.250
 he is with the distance of points 25 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.110
 select this line and click on the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.780
 side here he will do with point 25 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.030
 I do not want this what I have to do 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.870
 I interrupt the command to 7 by pressing 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.850
 west and then enter to repeat it 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.709
 the command it returns in the command 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.510
 only he comes back asking me the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.790
 distance I want to tell the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.780
 The distance I want is seven meters 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.329
 I typed in the ready and seven in having 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.670
 and then you select the line you want 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.540
 copy and click on one side you want 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.460
 play and played seven meters over here I 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.020
 I'm sure that between this line is 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.930
 this one is seven meters 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.990
 now an inner wall, let's say that the 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.700
 its the thickness of 15 that I make 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.320
 have to change the new value that is 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.700
 working with 7 apply again 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.840
 to do with seven 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.820
 I do not want this one close and in having the 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.310
 inter or spacebar 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.430
 And then he asks me again 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.860
 away to do now is point 15 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.880
 always remembering is 15 centimeters more 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.770
 I'm talking to meters 1.15. 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.870
 select the line I want to copy click 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.460
 exaggerating to any side 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.500
 ready he made the line as he 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.600
 I needed and now it's just finishing 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.950
 the rest of the drawing the idea of 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.350
 at seven o'clock 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.350
 his basic idea is this one
