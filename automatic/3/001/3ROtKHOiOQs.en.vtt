00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.540
 he recently lost a very beautiful one 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.239
 sven kramer 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:09.439
 cortina 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:14.299
 we have others in the oranjestraat nine points behind his standing leg 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.299
 to score 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.019
 from 10 yes 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.279
 and with its editors 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.660
 it causes them to perform thus the bridge 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.660
 according to steps it becomes watch out 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.620
 there may be a gold medal in this 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.810
 it starts with capsizing 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.810
 look at the cities incredibly beautiful 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.770
 sometimes difficult 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 nothing from under three tenths of concatenation 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.400
 pension accrual movement 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.340
 it becomes the jump 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.340
 indeed 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.480
 would get geely 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.550
 quite worth it 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.010
 He gave a 24 hours of Francorchamps Android 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.010
 just before the break back in the second set 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.760
 in the city there were none of this exercise either 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.500
 that means they 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.440
 at least nine points 40 stops for the difficulty level and then the sixteenth 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.850
 once again mainly meant the bonifications through the special imagination and so did 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.150
 some difficult things 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.150
 put four plates with the card in this technique 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.080
 there that beautiful stretched somersault on the streets where hands stand with half a turn 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.079
 not quite up to the standard 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.179
 9 7 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.179
 why did eighteen seats score the highest 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.049
 at least a week in coma 8 on my score fire 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.189
 two last set 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.039
 along with luc viewers 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:27.199
 what movement is there 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:31.149
 I think she will be the world champion of rolf european champion 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.159
 but then you have to wait a bit and fall 9 if you already know 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.279
 Dutch citizenship 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.779
 I suffered a lot 8 15 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:42.749
 out of money 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.179
 america 8 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:45.519
 a sexual offense 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.749
 the first place 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:50.099
 for most cases 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.200
 they were not there
