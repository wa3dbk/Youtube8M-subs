the guitar they're made by Kaiser Capo's
and<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.560> think<00:00:25.740> there<00:00:25.949> maybe<00:00:26.789> 25<00:00:27.269> bucks<00:00:27.570> at<00:00:27.749> the

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839 
and I think there maybe 25 bucks at the

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.310 
and I think there maybe 25 bucks at the
most<00:00:28.579> what<00:00:29.579> you<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.079> I'm<00:00:31.169> in

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
most what you do and I'm and I'm in

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.229 
most what you do and I'm and I'm in
standard<00:00:31.800> tuning<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.669> guitar<00:00:32.910> right<00:00:33.090> now

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
standard tuning on the guitar right now

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.389 
standard tuning on the guitar right now
so<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.900> put<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.230> over<00:00:34.470> in<00:00:36.199> kind<00:00:37.199> of<00:00:37.289> a<00:00:37.500> clamp

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
so if I put this over in kind of a clamp

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.900 
so if I put this over in kind of a clamp
down<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.629> i<00:00:39.660> put<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.289> capo<00:00:40.649> um<00:00:40.859> right<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.789> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
down so i put the capo um right on the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.910 
down so i put the capo um right on the
second<00:00:42.239> fret<00:00:42.359> and<00:00:42.570> i<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.289> keep<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.590> pretty

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
second fret and i like to keep it pretty

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.090 
second fret and i like to keep it pretty
close<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> fret<00:00:45.350> because<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.859> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
close to the fret because if you do that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.740 
close to the fret because if you do that
you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.489> find<00:00:47.730> kind<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.120> sweet<00:00:48.420> spot<00:00:48.719> where

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
you can find kind of a sweet spot where

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.540 
you can find kind of a sweet spot where
it's<00:00:49.109> not<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> press<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> strings<00:00:50.280> down

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
it's not going to press the strings down

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
it's not going to press the strings down
too<00:00:50.910> hard<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.480> pull<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.559> strings<00:00:52.859> sharp<00:00:53.570> yet

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
too hard and pull the strings sharp yet

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.740 
too hard and pull the strings sharp yet
still<00:00:54.839> not<00:00:55.260> create<00:00:55.620> fret<00:00:55.890> buzz<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.390> put<00:00:57.660> it

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
still not create fret buzz so I put it

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.970 
still not create fret buzz so I put it
right<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.109> lot<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.350> people<00:00:58.530> put<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
right there a lot of people put it a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
right there a lot of people put it a
little<00:00:59.129> bit<00:00:59.280> further<00:00:59.460> down<00:00:59.780> but<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.960> this

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
little bit further down but what this

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.050 
little bit further down but what this
does<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.960> it's<00:01:03.960> really<00:01:04.230> interesting<00:01:04.500> because

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
does and it's really interesting because

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.429 
does and it's really interesting because
some<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.270> may<00:01:06.480> have<00:01:06.510> heard<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.840> dadgad

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
some of you may have heard of dadgad

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.620 
some of you may have heard of dadgad
tuning<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.700> dadgad<00:01:09.180> tuning

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
tuning and with with dadgad tuning

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.740 
tuning and with with dadgad tuning
you're<00:01:09.780> taking<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.850> standard<00:01:11.850> tuned<00:01:12.450> guitar

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
you're taking a standard tuned guitar

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.859 
you're taking a standard tuned guitar
and<00:01:13.320> you're<00:01:13.740> tuning<00:01:14.130> down<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.880> high<00:01:15.090> e<00:01:15.119> down

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
and you're tuning down the high e down

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.639 
and you're tuning down the high e down
to<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.079> d<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:17.520> high<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:18.119> down<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.689> an<00:01:18.780> A<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
to a d the high be down to an A and the

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.090 
to a d the high be down to an A and the
low<00:01:19.860> E<00:01:20.159> down<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> d<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.439> you're<00:01:22.740> taking

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
low E down to a d so it's you're taking

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.609 
low E down to a d so it's you're taking
these<00:01:23.340> three<00:01:24.240> strings<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.930> tuning<00:01:25.229> them<00:01:25.350> down

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
these three strings and tuning them down

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.569 
these three strings and tuning them down
a<00:01:26.030> full<00:01:27.030> step<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.110> capo<00:01:28.590> does<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
a full step what this capo does is the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.999 
a full step what this capo does is the
exact<00:01:29.939> opposite<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.960> takes<00:01:31.259> these<00:01:31.469> remaining

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
exact opposite it takes these remaining

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.149 
exact opposite it takes these remaining
three<00:01:32.430> strings<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.840> moves<00:01:34.590> them

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
three strings right here and moves them

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.480 
three strings right here and moves them
up<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.670> whole<00:01:36.119> step<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.439> end<00:01:37.829> result<00:01:38.070> is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
up a whole step so the end result is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.340 
up a whole step so the end result is
just<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.180> dadgad<00:01:39.600> without<00:01:39.960> actually

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
just like dadgad without actually

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.710 
just like dadgad without actually
changing<00:01:40.380> any<00:01:40.890> tuning<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.340> all

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
changing any tuning at all

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.320 
changing any tuning at all
so<00:01:43.230> it's<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.560> great<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.400> a<00:01:44.490> great<00:01:44.520> trick<00:01:45.060> if

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
so it's a great it's a great trick if

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.000 
so it's a great it's a great trick if
you<00:01:45.480> don't<00:01:45.630> want<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.440> know<00:01:46.560> tune<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
you don't want to you know tune the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.150 
you don't want to you know tune the
guitar<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.970> stick<00:01:48.120> on<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.270> capo<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:50.040> can

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
guitar you just stick on a capo you can

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.710 
guitar you just stick on a capo you can
play<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.370> lot<00:01:50.580> of<00:01:50.700> chords<00:01:51.030> using<00:01:51.330> only<00:01:51.420> one

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
play a lot of chords using only one

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.800 
play a lot of chords using only one
finger<00:01:52.610> opens<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.730> here

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:16.650 

your<00:01:58.470> other<00:01:58.590> fingers<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.159> do<00:01:59.280> other<00:01:59.430> things

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.230 

so<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.380> lot<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.650> fun<00:02:17.830> I've<00:02:18.820> written<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.150> lot

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240
