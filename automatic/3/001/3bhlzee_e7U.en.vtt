00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello hello friends welcome 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.250
 here for a new map presentation at 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.830
 diego map reloaded or description only 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.440
 with pictures ok this little bit something 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.740
 not a little and I'll come later 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:21.300
 right back this part size 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.430
 is huge without joke 945 mb rom as 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.170
 impact is huge so that's real 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.510
 Huge what you can clarify let's see friends 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.550
 where to start in the map is the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.210
 unique chance north portal point barely 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.149
 still possible the weblog objects 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.910
 here either, or the year again 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.399
 of course, and let's take a look here 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.020
 times to friends now again 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.789
 Of course , being priced is not 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.469
 mention that would be pretty stupid of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.200
 I want to say that we will print 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.329
 we have new items to friends 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.390
 map overview the map is very happy 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.170
 that's really huge and on the mac 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.870
 There are also reasons why the map is so huge 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.510
 is in the file size as it is 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.400
 because we have the following here 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.640
 not only map not only to let 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.920
 worried but we with very very very 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.869
 very very very many features what 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.659
 it will come to the committee friends 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.610
 mighty so weird in front of that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.750
 So that's what you want to flicker 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.970
 actually you can also directly 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.630
 claiming must confess ours 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.130
 would not want to fly 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.380
 fits then it fits here again 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.650
 the beautiful coal basin of the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.000
 electoral people have seen 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.579
 yes yes okay there we have a big bgh 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.549
 okay, nice point you can also 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.220
 tip over how they fly career 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.829
 everyone is going on again as can 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.990
 somebody runs around friends very dubious 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.970
 Kuranyi experienced as we have here 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.020
 Now this is a funny friends 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.020
 why we have here now 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.200
 Candidate here can here for 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.250
 example about how come here so 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.590
 invisible 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.970
 It is not great about it is it 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.619
 pity I have to be very high 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.209
 fly here machine construction site is 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.870
 already really a really cool feeling 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.120
 not boredom now 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.519
 boring to choose long that is 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.200
 1.9 percent here too 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.280
 buy because here you can already see the photo 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.380
 to see a trÃ¶ger 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.060
 Here you can buy friends come here 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.220
 open that can not fly here 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.290
 is real is your no-fly zone or 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.640
 like I can not fly this is 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.099
 really funny really still 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.220
 not experienced is important but nothing that 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.959
 Is it that's not the way it is 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.989
 no reason why you can fly 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.580
 that can be dubious 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.560
 shame I can fly york 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.470
 his 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.290
 we have objects to buy here 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.810
 imhof probably and strongly believe that 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.470
 but already a special feature 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.970
 the friends is definitely the one 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.299
 economic cycles endeavor since the 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.440
 bakery mack live clarification 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.890
 Water stations compost stock oil 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.829
 company is really cool 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.049
 we have refinery at the milk factory 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.720
 Greenhouses anyway and sawmill so 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.489
 that's the right thing going on here circus 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.519
 for example that's a very nice one 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.319
 detail beautiful decoration here is a 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.040
 beautiful beach really nice 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.269
 off veltins into the water 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.340
 litter store may not litter 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.690
 necessarily looks like is because no 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.859
 street where maybe i so small 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.870
 Settlement and here is a fat so jo 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.720
 and naya are web is huge as I said 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.750
 only 45 peter long ever some time 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.170
 but the whole thing has to go down 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.480
 honestly confess directly download 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.910
 in the morning we will have some access to the forest 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.870
 It is very nice and a lot 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.489
 many things to do 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.389
 the connect on the web what you me 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.310
 can recommend 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.680
 we played I always 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.590
 problem one is necessarily playing 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.780
 I have too little 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.310
 you tested that is always what I am 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.140
 would wish me a little more 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.629
 on this map so I think the 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.549
 economic cycles is extremely cool 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.040
 extremely cool but there is really here 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.229
 really really times looks friends 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.019
 and forgetting girlfriends to embitter 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.780
 that's the version 5.1 fake 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.210
 and here is really little going on here 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.220
 kuckart is a big straight forward 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.320
 flats with the hills so far 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.110
 but really that really 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.090
 really really that little bit going on 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.160
 Of course it is always difficult like that 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.550
 maybe to fill with life or something 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.800
 but that's too little for me personally 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.220
 so we were black this is 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.020
 great big arable land really not 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.660
 like for singleplayer but what a 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.669
 But negative is meant here maybe 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.789
 a bit with life and fill this 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.800
 Imagine something really better where to go 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.840
 as well as falls off then it is real 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.150
 already partially very very little going on 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.100
 there are definitely enough trees 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.870
 Trees here like tin soldiers around the 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:12.020
 See here, yes, how you look 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.240
 but also do not believe in preaching 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.620
 as I said, the map like it yourself 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.320
 Download friends 925 is the order 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.760
 and they would have to pack up and like 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.470
 yourself will form your opinion 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.349
 Aebischer play gladly with the 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.450
 opinion who will play the map and 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:31.550
 only there he likes it too 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.139
 I am very grateful as 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.660
 always for watching and looking forward to it 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.700
 like to see you next time 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.370
 again seeing a new market 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.370
 imagination immediately until then bye
