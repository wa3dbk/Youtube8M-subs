Samsung LCD monitor 2494 sync master and
they<00:00:12.780> said<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.139> doesn't<00:00:13.440> work<00:00:13.559> properly<00:00:13.889> so

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
they said it doesn't work properly so

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.599 
they said it doesn't work properly so
I'm<00:00:15.480> hoping<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.960> screens<00:00:16.230> not<00:00:16.470> broke<00:00:16.770> because

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
I'm hoping the screens not broke because

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.400 
I'm hoping the screens not broke because
I<00:00:17.910> want<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.180> take<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.480> apart<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.869> get<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.140> going

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
I want to take it apart and get it going

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.070 
I want to take it apart and get it going
this<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.789> one<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.000> nicer<00:00:21.660> monitors

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
this is a one of the nicer monitors

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.370 
this is a one of the nicer monitors
actually<00:00:23.449> well<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> screen<00:00:24.869> doesn't<00:00:25.109> look

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
actually well the screen doesn't look

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.720 
actually well the screen doesn't look
cracked<00:00:25.740> but<00:00:25.949> there's<00:00:26.130> something<00:00:26.460> rattling

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
cracked but there's something rattling

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.320 
cracked but there's something rattling
around<00:00:26.970> inside<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.570> sounds<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.260> screw

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
around inside that sounds like a screw

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.160 
around inside that sounds like a screw
and<00:00:30.560> I<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.940> stand<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and I do have all the stand and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.340 
and I do have all the stand and
everything<00:00:34.890> else<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.120> actually

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
everything else with it it was actually

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.569 
everything else with it it was actually
in<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> original<00:00:37.829> packaging<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.489> everything

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
in the original packaging and everything

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.930 
in the original packaging and everything
so<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.780> nice<00:00:40.460> safe<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.730> shipping

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
so it's kind of nice safe and shipping

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.779 
so it's kind of nice safe and shipping
that<00:00:42.180> way<00:00:42.530> but<00:00:43.530> let<00:00:44.190> me<00:00:44.250> pull<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> back<00:00:44.760> off

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
that way but let me pull the back off

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.389 
that way but let me pull the back off
and<00:00:45.059> find<00:00:45.750> out<00:00:45.870> what's<00:00:46.020> loose<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.950> there<00:00:47.160> and

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and find out what's loose in there and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.799 
and find out what's loose in there and
more<00:00:47.760> importantly<00:00:48.149> find<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.510> what's<00:00:48.629> wrong

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
more importantly find out what's wrong

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.340 
more importantly find out what's wrong
with<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.090> far<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.510> looks<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.809> lot<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
with it so far this looks a lot like the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.680 
with it so far this looks a lot like the
22<00:00:52.649> inch<00:00:53.010> Samsung<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.910> fixed<00:00:54.180> sometime

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
22 inch Samsung that I fixed sometime

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.650 
22 inch Samsung that I fixed sometime
thing<00:00:55.440> goes<00:00:55.590> back<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.949> January<00:00:56.480> even<00:00:57.480> has<00:00:57.629> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
thing goes back in January even has that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.729 
thing goes back in January even has that
same<00:00:58.370> rattle<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.430> metal<00:00:59.730> cover<00:01:00.199> and<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.500> think

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
same rattle a metal cover and I think

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.219 
same rattle a metal cover and I think
speaking<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.370> rattle<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.229> standoff

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
speaking of rattle I think this standoff

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.880 
speaking of rattle I think this standoff
here<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.799> inside<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.549> cage<00:01:05.850> rattling<00:01:06.540> around

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
here is inside this cage rattling around

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.109 
here is inside this cage rattling around
probably<00:01:07.890> what<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.010> heard<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.610> don't<00:01:08.909> know<00:01:09.060> how

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
probably what I heard I don't know how

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.480 
probably what I heard I don't know how
it<00:01:09.240> would<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.540> got<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.840> there<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.340> find<00:01:11.340> out

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
it would have got in there but find out

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.219 
it would have got in there but find out
in<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> second<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.210> didn't<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:12.990> too<00:01:13.110> much

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
in a second I didn't have too much

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.350 
in a second I didn't have too much
trouble<00:01:13.619> getting<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> back<00:01:14.700> cover<00:01:14.970> off<00:01:15.060> this

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
trouble getting the back cover off this

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.499 
trouble getting the back cover off this
one<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:16.020> know<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.320> snaps<00:01:16.650> all<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.950> place<00:01:17.189> but

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
one you know it snaps all in place but

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.390 
one you know it snaps all in place but
using<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.630> little<00:01:18.810> plastic<00:01:19.500> prying<00:01:19.950> tools<00:01:20.159> I

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
using my little plastic prying tools I

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.370 
using my little plastic prying tools I
was<00:01:20.520> able<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.810> whole<00:01:21.960> thing<00:01:22.200> off

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
was able to get the whole thing off

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.710 
was able to get the whole thing off
without<00:01:22.650> putting<00:01:23.340> dents<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.060> gouges<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
without putting dents and gouges in the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.219 
without putting dents and gouges in the
plastic<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> would<00:01:25.530> normally<00:01:27.080> do<00:01:28.080> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
plastic that you would normally do to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.810 
plastic that you would normally do to
the<00:01:28.350> plastic<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.009> use<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> flat<00:01:29.610> bladed

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the plastic if you use a flat bladed

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.490 
the plastic if you use a flat bladed
screwdriver<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.630> should<00:01:31.020> always<00:01:31.170> try<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> use

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
screwdriver you should always try to use

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.840 
screwdriver you should always try to use
something<00:01:31.890> that's<00:01:31.979> softer<00:01:32.549> than<00:01:32.670> whatever

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
something that's softer than whatever

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.170 
something that's softer than whatever
you're<00:01:33.090> praying<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.490> of<00:01:35.490> course<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.880> it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you're praying on and of course it it

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.819 
you're praying on and of course it it
screws<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> end<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> tool<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.409> pretty<00:01:37.619> bad

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
screws the end of the tool up pretty bad

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.130 
screws the end of the tool up pretty bad
after<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.280> while<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.729> that's<00:01:39.689> very<00:01:39.780> cheap

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
after a while but that's very cheap

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
after a while but that's very cheap
compared<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> replacing<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> bezel<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
compared to replacing the bezel of the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.050 
compared to replacing the bezel of the
monitor<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.840> looks<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.290> nicer<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.920> way

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
monitor and it looks much nicer that way

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.660 
monitor and it looks much nicer that way
instead<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.210> having<00:01:45.390> all<00:01:45.600> these<00:01:45.860> these<00:01:46.860> dents

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
instead of having all these these dents

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.520 
instead of having all these these dents
from<00:01:47.729> using<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.210> screwdriver<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:49.110> can't<00:01:49.320> even

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
from using a screwdriver you can't even

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.830 
from using a screwdriver you can't even
really<00:01:49.710> tell<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.100> been<00:01:50.250> taken<00:01:50.520> apart<00:01:50.840> there

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
really tell it's been taken apart there

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.660 
really tell it's been taken apart there
anyway<00:01:52.110> let<00:01:52.350> me<00:01:52.409> pull<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.740> cage<00:01:53.009> off<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> see

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
anyway let me pull this cage off and see

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
anyway let me pull this cage off and see
if<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:53.880> got<00:01:54.000> those<00:01:54.149> same<00:01:54.420> bad<00:01:54.720> capacitors

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
if it's got those same bad capacitors

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.910 
if it's got those same bad capacitors
that<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.890> always<00:01:56.159> find<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> Samsungs<00:01:57.920> from

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that I always find in the Samsungs from

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.139 
that I always find in the Samsungs from
what<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.340> tell<00:01:59.520> already<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.119> looks

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
what I can tell already it looks

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.600 
what I can tell already it looks
identical<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.079> 22<00:02:01.829> inch<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.460> it's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
identical to that 22 inch so it's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.359 
identical to that 22 inch so it's
probably<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> same<00:02:03.860> set<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.979> bad<00:02:05.189> capacitors

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
probably the same set of bad capacitors

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.830 
probably the same set of bad capacitors
again<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:07.099> there<00:02:08.099> was<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.520> standoff<00:02:09.060> inside

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
again and there was that standoff inside

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.630 
again and there was that standoff inside
the<00:02:10.020> cage<00:02:10.229> there<00:02:10.560> so

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the cage there so

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.640 
the cage there so
that's<00:02:12.150> all<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.510> rail<00:02:12.720> was<00:02:13.080> just<00:02:13.380> like<00:02:13.530> I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that's all that rail was just like I

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.930 
that's all that rail was just like I
thought<00:02:14.510> let<00:02:15.510> me<00:02:15.570> pull<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:15.960> thing<00:02:16.230> out<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
thought let me pull this thing out and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.870 
thought let me pull this thing out and
move<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> repair<00:02:19.460> surprised<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.700> see

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
move on with the repair surprised to see

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.780 
move on with the repair surprised to see
that<00:02:21.090> none<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.330> these<00:02:21.450> caps<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.990> bulging<00:02:22.790> see

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
that none of these caps of bulging see

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.110 
that none of these caps of bulging see
what<00:02:24.060> are<00:02:24.240> these<00:02:25.010> they're<00:02:26.010> those<00:02:26.280> same<00:02:26.580> crappy

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
what are these they're those same crappy

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.590 
what are these they're those same crappy
Sanwa<00:02:27.570> capacitors<00:02:28.320> though<00:02:28.790> let<00:02:29.790> me<00:02:29.880> do<00:02:30.000> an<00:02:30.120> ESR

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
Sanwa capacitors though let me do an ESR

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.630 
Sanwa capacitors though let me do an ESR
check<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.170> also<00:02:31.620> check<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> few<00:02:32.130> things<00:02:32.490> with

check and also check a few things with

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640 
check and also check a few things with
my<00:02:32.760> meter<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.960> make<00:02:34.260> sure<00:02:34.410> everything<00:02:34.620> is

my meter and make sure everything is

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.060 
my meter and make sure everything is
good<00:02:36.410> probably<00:02:37.410> going<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.650> end<00:02:37.680> up<00:02:37.800> having

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
the LCD panel is not crack I don't

the LCD panel is not crack I don't
really<00:02:44.130> care<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.940> fix<00:02:45.240> anything<00:02:45.870> else<00:02:46.170> I

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
really care I can fix anything else I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.890 
really care I can fix anything else I
probably<00:02:47.910> should<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.240> tested<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.690> thing

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
probably should have tested this thing

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.100 
probably should have tested this thing
before<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.290> took<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.590> apart<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.780> see<00:02:51.990> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
before I took it apart but you see the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.020 
before I took it apart but you see the
dose<00:02:52.320> here<00:02:52.590> when<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.800> turn<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.250> main<00:02:53.459> power

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.470 

Moo<00:03:04.160> sounds<00:03:05.160> like<00:03:05.220> another<00:03:05.310> arcing<00:03:05.970> backlight

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
Moo sounds like another arcing backlight

Moo sounds like another arcing backlight
just<00:03:06.720> like<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.050> Hinds<00:03:07.440> G<00:03:10.850> but<00:03:11.850> it's<00:03:12.000> on

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.350 

Wow<00:03:20.170> they're<00:03:21.170> going<00:03:21.320> to<00:03:21.380> know<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.590> broken<00:03:22.360> CFL

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
Wow they're going to know the broken CFL

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.870 
Wow they're going to know the broken CFL
connection<00:03:24.170> in<00:03:24.320> there<00:03:24.530> this<00:03:25.520> ought<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.760> be<00:03:25.850> fun

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880

let me see if I can take care of this

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.870 
let me see if I can take care of this
without<00:03:36.290> breaking<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.830> panel<00:03:39.790> speaking<00:03:40.790> of

the<00:03:40.970> Hinds<00:03:41.450> G<00:03:41.690> this<00:03:42.560> is<00:03:42.740> another<00:03:43.010> one<00:03:43.250> that's

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
the Hinds G this is another one that's

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.990 
the Hinds G this is another one that's
got<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.670> exact<00:03:44.120> same<00:03:45.010> style<00:03:46.010> metal<00:03:46.490> cover<00:03:46.730> and

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
got the exact same style metal cover and

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.090 
got the exact same style metal cover and
the<00:03:47.090> same<00:03:47.300> LVDS<00:03:47.990> connector<00:03:48.500> I'm<00:03:48.680> starting<00:03:49.010> to

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
the same LVDS connector I'm starting to

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.740 
the same LVDS connector I'm starting to
wonder<00:03:49.220> if<00:03:49.490> that<00:03:49.520> Hinds<00:03:49.910> G<00:03:50.240> panel<00:03:50.630> is<00:03:50.720> a

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
wonder if that Hinds G panel is a

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.880 
wonder if that Hinds G panel is a
rebadged<00:03:51.260> AU<00:03:51.770> Optronics<00:03:52.390> panel<00:03:53.709> because<00:03:54.709> it's

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
rebadged AU Optronics panel because it's

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.970 
rebadged AU Optronics panel because it's
got<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.160> same<00:03:55.490> problem<00:03:56.150> same<00:03:57.140> design<00:03:57.620> same

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
got the same problem same design same

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.540 
got the same problem same design same
metal<00:03:58.850> bezel<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.720> I<00:04:00.080> got<00:04:00.800> a<00:04:00.830> feeling<00:04:01.250> I'm<00:04:01.370> in

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
metal bezel so I got a feeling I'm in

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.199 
metal bezel so I got a feeling I'm in
for<00:04:01.790> some<00:04:01.820> real<00:04:02.120> crap<00:04:02.450> fixing<00:04:03.020> this<00:04:03.140> backlight

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
for some real crap fixing this backlight

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.350 
for some real crap fixing this backlight
well<00:04:05.209> damn<00:04:05.480> it<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.780> screen<00:04:06.080> fell<00:04:06.440> out<00:04:06.620> again

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
well damn it the screen fell out again

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.449 
well damn it the screen fell out again
let's<00:04:08.360> see<00:04:08.540> if<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.720> can<00:04:08.900> do<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:09.770> again<00:04:10.010> just

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
let's see if I can do this again just

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.070 
let's see if I can do this again just
like<00:04:10.610> before<00:04:10.880> but<00:04:11.150> maybe<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.690> little<00:04:11.810> better

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
like before but maybe a little better

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.410 
like before but maybe a little better
this<00:04:12.320> time

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
this time

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.240 
this time
there's<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.770> backlight<00:04:15.770> diffuser<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:18.250> here

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
there's the backlight diffuser and here

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.030 
there's the backlight diffuser and here
we<00:04:19.370> go<00:04:20.140> well<00:04:21.140> I<00:04:21.200> got<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.530> screen<00:04:21.829> out<00:04:22.010> of

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
we go well I got the screen out of

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.890 
we go well I got the screen out of
harm's<00:04:22.370> way<00:04:22.490> for<00:04:22.610> now<00:04:23.090> but<00:04:23.390> I'm<00:04:23.510> afraid<00:04:23.660> that

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
harm's way for now but I'm afraid that

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.070 
harm's way for now but I'm afraid that
the<00:04:25.180> self-adhesive<00:04:26.180> ribbon<00:04:26.660> cables<00:04:26.990> are

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
the self-adhesive ribbon cables are

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.980 
the self-adhesive ribbon cables are
going<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.260> come<00:04:27.410> off<00:04:27.440> that<00:04:27.770> board<00:04:28.010> died<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:28.990> had

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
going to come off that board died I had

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.900 
going to come off that board died I had
slipped<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.470> few<00:04:30.500> times<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.130> they<00:04:31.550> got<00:04:31.700> pulled

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
slipped a few times and they got pulled

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.120 
slipped a few times and they got pulled
on<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.150> little<00:04:32.390> bit<00:04:32.570> but<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.020> think<00:04:33.140> amazingly

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
on a little bit but I think amazingly

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.150 
on a little bit but I think amazingly
it's<00:04:34.400> still<00:04:34.669> not<00:04:34.820> cracked<00:04:35.979> here's<00:04:36.979> the

it's still not cracked here's the

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.840 
it's still not cracked here's the

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
of the lenses and you can see there the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.180

two lenses out and can't really see but

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
this it's going to be really hard to try

I<00:05:29.120> don't<00:05:29.540> know<00:05:29.630> if<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.810> can<00:05:29.870> even<00:05:30.169> get<00:05:30.290> some

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
I don't know if I can even get some

I don't know if I can even get some

fresh metal in there to cider that wire
back<00:05:32.600> in<00:05:32.900> and<00:05:34.990> it's<00:05:35.990> probably<00:05:36.260> going<00:05:36.350> to<00:05:36.410> short

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
back in and it's probably going to short

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.200

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
to the other one even if I do hmm I

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.600 
to the other one even if I do hmm I
can't<00:05:42.020> take<00:05:42.230> the<00:05:42.350> CFL<00:05:42.860> out<00:05:43.010> of<00:05:43.100> the<00:05:43.190> assembly

can't take the CFL out of the assembly

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.969 
can't take the CFL out of the assembly
because<00:05:43.760> the<00:05:44.090> other<00:05:44.210> wires<00:05:44.479> go<00:05:44.810> back<00:05:45.710> behind

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
because the other wires go back behind

that<00:05:46.400> metal<00:05:46.669> plate<00:05:47.410> I'm<00:05:48.410> not<00:05:48.620> sure<00:05:48.889> what<00:05:49.040> to<00:05:49.160> do

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
that metal plate I'm not sure what to do

that metal plate I'm not sure what to do
I<00:05:50.530> guess<00:05:51.530> I've<00:05:51.650> got<00:05:51.680> to<00:05:51.860> keep<00:05:51.979> digging<00:05:52.220> out<00:05:52.490> the

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
there the end of that CFL is so oxidized

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.820 
there the end of that CFL is so oxidized

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
and burned and and the wire too and I

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.409 
and burned and and the wire too and I
had<00:06:15.830> to<00:06:15.950> use<00:06:16.039> separate<00:06:16.490> flux<00:06:16.880> and<00:06:17.180> a<00:06:17.240> lot<00:06:17.390> of

had to use separate flux and a lot of

scraping and tinting and retaining and

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.150 
scraping and tinting and retaining and
it<00:06:20.419> just<00:06:20.630> would<00:06:20.810> not<00:06:21.020> take<00:06:21.289> solder<00:06:21.590> but<00:06:21.919> I<00:06:21.950> got

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
it just would not take solder but I got

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.370 
it just would not take solder but I got
the<00:06:22.250> white<00:06:22.430> one<00:06:22.460> on<00:06:22.820> there<00:06:23.090> now<00:06:24.020> I'm<00:06:24.169> getting

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
the white one on there now I'm getting

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.810 
the white one on there now I'm getting
ready<00:06:24.470> to<00:06:24.590> try<00:06:24.860> to<00:06:24.919> get<00:06:25.100> the<00:06:25.190> pink<00:06:25.400> one<00:06:25.580> back<00:06:25.789> on

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
ready to try to get the pink one back on

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.930 
ready to try to get the pink one back on
and<00:06:26.360> then<00:06:26.870> if<00:06:27.650> I<00:06:27.740> can<00:06:27.919> get<00:06:28.039> silicone<00:06:28.370> back<00:06:28.760> in

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
and then if I can get silicone back in

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.029 
and then if I can get silicone back in
there<00:06:29.090> without<00:06:29.210> breaking<00:06:29.720> the<00:06:29.870> wires<00:06:30.710> back

there without breaking the wires back

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.850 
there without breaking the wires back
off<00:06:31.280> I<00:06:31.520> might<00:06:31.760> be<00:06:31.940> good<00:06:32.090> to<00:06:32.240> go<00:06:32.390> I<00:06:32.690> guess<00:06:33.680> we'll

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
off I might be good to go I guess we'll

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.900 
off I might be good to go I guess we'll
see<00:06:35.500> well<00:06:36.500> after<00:06:36.919> a<00:06:36.950> long<00:06:37.190> nightmare<00:06:37.910> of

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
see well after a long nightmare of

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.090 
see well after a long nightmare of
reattaching<00:06:40.910> those<00:06:41.090> stupid<00:06:41.870> cables<00:06:42.680> over<00:06:42.950> and

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
reattaching those stupid cables over and

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.680 
reattaching those stupid cables over and
over<00:06:43.340> the<00:06:43.490> solder<00:06:43.760> kept<00:06:44.030> breaking<00:06:44.419> off<00:06:44.539> the

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
over the solder kept breaking off the

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.200 
over the solder kept breaking off the
CFL<00:06:45.260> and<00:06:45.620> I<00:06:45.830> had<00:06:46.220> to<00:06:46.370> keep<00:06:46.550> digging<00:06:46.760> the

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
CFL and I had to keep digging the

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.879 
CFL and I had to keep digging the
back<00:06:47.539> out<00:06:47.810> while<00:06:47.990> it<00:06:48.080> was<00:06:48.200> still<00:06:48.410> wet<00:06:48.680> and

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:48.889 
back out while it was still wet and

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:51.969 
back out while it was still wet and
starting<00:06:49.520> all<00:06:49.610> over<00:06:49.639> again<00:06:49.910> I<00:06:50.680> had<00:06:51.680> to<00:06:51.830> go

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:51.979 
starting all over again I had to go

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:53.469 
starting all over again I had to go
through<00:06:52.220> the<00:06:52.310> same<00:06:52.580> crap<00:06:52.850> I<00:06:53.090> did<00:06:53.300> with<00:06:53.419> that

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:53.479 
through the same crap I did with that

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.140 
through the same crap I did with that
Hinds<00:06:53.930> G<00:06:54.169> only<00:06:54.320> ten<00:06:54.710> times<00:06:54.979> worse<00:06:55.220> but<00:06:55.880> check

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
Hinds G only ten times worse but check

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.670 
Hinds G only ten times worse but check
this<00:06:56.330> out<00:06:57.100> no<00:06:58.419> no<00:06:59.419> pieces<00:06:59.900> of<00:07:00.050> dirt<00:07:00.200> behind<00:07:00.410> the

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
this out no no pieces of dirt behind the

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.400 
this out no no pieces of dirt behind the

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
considering all the crap it just went

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.890 
considering all the crap it just went
through<00:07:12.100> really<00:07:13.100> hope<00:07:14.060> it<00:07:14.210> holds<00:07:14.510> up<00:07:14.660> hope

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
through really hope it holds up hope

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.980 
through really hope it holds up hope
that<00:07:15.080> doesn't<00:07:15.350> start<00:07:15.560> arcing<00:07:15.950> again<00:07:16.190> because

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
that doesn't start arcing again because

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.330 
that doesn't start arcing again because
this<00:07:17.990> is<00:07:18.229> really<00:07:18.530> going<00:07:18.650> to<00:07:18.740> be<00:07:18.800> nice<00:07:19.010> to<00:07:19.220> have

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
footage of putting everything back

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.070 
footage of putting everything back
together<00:07:26.170> but<00:07:26.650> it<00:07:26.710> was<00:07:26.890> just<00:07:27.570> it<00:07:28.570> was<00:07:28.630> just<00:07:28.750> too
