00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
does the key have to be on the power up

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.200 
does the key have to be on the power up
that<00:00:30.019> socket<00:00:30.619> this<00:00:31.010> does<00:00:31.250> not<00:00:31.550> have<00:00:31.789> to<00:00:31.939> be<00:00:32.029> on

that socket this does not have to be on
okay<00:00:32.780> I<00:00:32.930> mean<00:00:33.110> apps<00:00:33.260> how<00:00:33.410> were<00:00:33.559> there<00:00:33.710> all

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
okay I mean apps how were there all

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.860 
okay I mean apps how were there all
times<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:34.460> you<00:00:34.730> love<00:00:34.910> someone<00:00:35.150> plug<00:00:35.480> in<00:00:35.690> there

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
times so you love someone plug in there

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.869 
times so you love someone plug in there
you<00:00:36.050> drain<00:00:36.320> your<00:00:36.440> battery<00:00:36.739> down<00:00:36.949> yep<00:00:37.519> you

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
you drain your battery down yep you

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.060 
you drain your battery down yep you
would<00:00:38.090> okay<00:00:38.600> but<00:00:38.989> that<00:00:39.140> LED<00:00:39.589> lights<00:00:39.860> not

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
would okay but that LED lights not

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.549 
would okay but that LED lights not
coming<00:00:40.370> on<00:00:40.489> it's<00:00:40.940> not<00:00:41.120> coming<00:00:41.479> on<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:42.379> where

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
coming on it's not coming on so where

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:43.990 
coming on it's not coming on so where
would<00:00:42.710> we<00:00:42.830> go<00:00:42.979> to<00:00:43.040> check<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:43.460> fuse<00:00:43.670> for<00:00:43.850> that

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
would we go to check the fuse for that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.890 
would we go to check the fuse for that
order<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.320> hood<00:00:45.549> nice<00:00:46.549> take<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:46.850> look<00:00:47.059> we're<00:00:47.809> on

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
order the hood nice take a look we're on

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.160 
order the hood nice take a look we're on
the<00:00:48.140> driver<00:00:48.589> side<00:00:48.769> under<00:00:49.400> the<00:00:49.549> hood<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.180> we

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
the driver side under the hood and we

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.640 
the driver side under the hood and we
got<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.350> box<00:00:51.620> right<00:00:51.890> here<00:00:52.750> this<00:00:53.750> would<00:00:53.960> be<00:00:54.170> your

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
got a box right here this would be your

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.479 
got a box right here this would be your
fuse<00:00:55.129> access<00:00:55.940> okay<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.710> what<00:00:57.860> fuse<00:00:58.129> would<00:00:58.280> I<00:00:58.309> be

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
fuse access okay so what fuse would I be

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.850 
fuse access okay so what fuse would I be
looking<00:00:58.790> for<00:00:59.030> if<00:00:59.119> I<00:00:59.269> needed<00:00:59.479> to<00:00:59.600> replace<00:01:00.530> the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
looking for if I needed to replace the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.789 
looking for if I needed to replace the
cigarette<00:01:01.519> lighter<00:01:01.549> fuse<00:01:02.589> must've<00:01:03.589> popped

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
cigarette lighter fuse must've popped

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.740 
cigarette lighter fuse must've popped
something<00:01:04.280> must've<00:01:04.760> pop<00:01:04.940> something<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:05.600> we

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
something must've pop something so we

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.550 
something must've pop something so we
look<00:01:05.930> at<00:01:06.049> our<00:01:06.110> display<00:01:06.770> here<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:08.409> we<00:01:09.409> look

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
look at our display here and we look

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.680 
look at our display here and we look
under<00:01:09.830> c4<00:01:10.280> cigarette<00:01:10.729> lighter<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.119> we<00:01:11.390> see

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
under c4 cigarette lighter and we see

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.290 
under c4 cigarette lighter and we see
that<00:01:12.020> we're<00:01:12.200> looking<00:01:12.350> for<00:01:12.800> fuse<00:01:13.310> number<00:01:13.640> 32

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
that we're looking for fuse number 32

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.510 
that we're looking for fuse number 32
okay<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.080> our<00:01:15.170> location<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:16.070> that<00:01:18.430> what<00:01:19.430> are

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
okay and our location of that what are

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.030 
okay and our location of that what are
you<00:01:19.610> right<00:01:19.820> here<00:01:20.270> yep<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.320> there's<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.860> shape

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
you right here yep so there's the shape

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.890 
you right here yep so there's the shape
of<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.370> box<00:01:22.610> okay<00:01:23.120> so<00:01:23.360> let's<00:01:23.480> see<00:01:23.600> if<00:01:23.690> we<00:01:23.750> can

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
of the box okay so let's see if we can

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.350 
of the box okay so let's see if we can
find<00:01:24.050> that<00:01:24.200> fuse<00:01:25.510> okay<00:01:26.510> so<00:01:27.020> going<00:01:27.590> by<00:01:27.890> 31<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.790> 46

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
find that fuse okay so going by 31 to 46

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.750 
find that fuse okay so going by 31 to 46
this<00:01:29.510> would<00:01:29.750> be<00:01:29.930> fuse<00:01:30.380> number<00:01:30.710> 31<00:01:31.160> and<00:01:31.190> well

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
this would be fuse number 31 and well

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.030 
this would be fuse number 31 and well
look<00:01:32.030> there's<00:01:32.390> no<00:01:32.570> fuse<00:01:32.900> there<00:01:33.200> that's

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
look there's no fuse there that's

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.900 
look there's no fuse there that's
because<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:34.340> stole<00:01:34.580> it

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
because I stole it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.170 
because I stole it
sorry<00:01:35.210> oh<00:01:35.900> he<00:01:36.260> stole<00:01:36.650> my<00:01:37.010> 30<00:01:37.370> amp<00:01:37.580> fuse<00:01:37.850> for<00:01:38.090> my

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
sorry oh he stole my 30 amp fuse for my

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.899 
sorry oh he stole my 30 amp fuse for my
cigarette<00:01:38.510> lighter<00:01:39.010> so<00:01:40.010> if<00:01:40.250> we<00:01:40.370> reinstall

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
cigarette lighter so if we reinstall

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.440 
cigarette lighter so if we reinstall
that<00:01:40.940> chances<00:01:41.690> are<00:01:41.870> it'll<00:01:42.290> probably<00:01:42.620> work<00:01:43.450> now

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
that chances are it'll probably work now

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.950 
that chances are it'll probably work now
it<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:44.780> common<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.530> plug<00:01:46.100> something<00:01:46.400> into<00:01:46.670> that

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
it is common to plug something into that

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.720 
it is common to plug something into that
socket<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.350> accidentally<00:01:48.920> arc<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.280> out<00:01:49.430> or

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
socket and accidentally arc it out or

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.700 
socket and accidentally arc it out or
ever<00:01:50.120> even<00:01:50.360> seen<00:01:50.600> penny<00:01:50.870> stuck<00:01:51.290> on<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.590> bottom

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
ever even seen penny stuck on the bottom

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.800 
ever even seen penny stuck on the bottom
of<00:01:52.040> them<00:01:52.220> which<00:01:52.700> would<00:01:52.909> definitely<00:01:53.060> pop<00:01:53.570> that

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
of them which would definitely pop that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.140 
of them which would definitely pop that
fuse<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.100> this<00:01:55.340> is<00:01:55.460> where<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.760> would<00:01:55.880> go

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
fuse so this is where you would go

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.060 
fuse so this is where you would go
obviously<00:01:56.960> we're<00:01:57.110> simulating<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.830> blown<00:01:58.040> fuse

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
obviously we're simulating a blown fuse

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.630 
obviously we're simulating a blown fuse
just<00:01:58.610> by<00:01:59.240> removing<00:01:59.780> it<00:01:59.930> to<00:02:00.860> really<00:02:01.250> check<00:02:01.490> it

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
just by removing it to really check it

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.250 
just by removing it to really check it
you<00:02:01.729> could<00:02:01.909> look<00:02:02.030> across<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.600> element<00:02:03.080> and

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
you could look across that element and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.410 
you could look across that element and
if<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:03.950> have<00:02:04.070> this<00:02:04.220> style<00:02:04.430> fuse<00:02:04.880> usually

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
if you have this style fuse usually

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.520 
if you have this style fuse usually
you'll<00:02:05.570> see<00:02:05.870> it's<00:02:05.990> burnt

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
you'll see it's burnt

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.289 
you'll see it's burnt
it'll<00:02:07.040> be<00:02:07.250> burnt<00:02:07.580> right<00:02:07.790> in<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.000> center

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
it'll be burnt right in the center

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.969 
it'll be burnt right in the center
although<00:02:08.509> sometimes<00:02:08.869> it's<00:02:09.259> deceiving<00:02:09.619> and

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
although sometimes it's deceiving and

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.550 
although sometimes it's deceiving and
the<00:02:10.519> burn<00:02:10.789> might<00:02:11.390> not<00:02:11.599> be<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.810> full<00:02:12.110> burn<00:02:12.319> all

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
the burn might not be a full burn all

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.020 
the burn might not be a full burn all
the<00:02:12.680> way<00:02:12.799> through<00:02:13.129> even<00:02:13.519> though<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.730> have<00:02:14.000> a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
the way through even though you have a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.150 
the way through even though you have a
voltage<00:02:14.269> drop<00:02:14.599> across<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:16.010> not

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
voltage drop across it and it's not

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.470 
voltage drop across it and it's not
enough<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.550> power<00:02:16.760> up<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:16.970> cigarette

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
enough to power up that cigarette

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.120 
enough to power up that cigarette
lighter<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:17.990> when<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.350> doubt<00:02:18.380> go<00:02:18.770> ahead<00:02:18.980> and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
lighter so when in doubt go ahead and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.220 
lighter so when in doubt go ahead and
replace<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.459> with<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.940> same<00:02:20.150> size<00:02:20.450> amperage

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
replace that with the same size amperage

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.260 
replace that with the same size amperage
fuse<00:02:21.950> which<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.490> don't<00:02:22.550> know<00:02:22.760> what<00:02:22.940> what

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
fuse which I don't know what what

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.780 
fuse which I don't know what what
amperage<00:02:23.569> was<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.959> fuse<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> 30<00:02:25.550> amp

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
amperage was that fuse that is a 30 amp

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.370 
amperage was that fuse that is a 30 amp
fuse<00:02:26.120> okay<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.720> would<00:02:26.840> make<00:02:27.020> some<00:02:27.170> sense

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
fuse okay that would make some sense

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.720 
fuse okay that would make some sense
let's<00:02:27.709> go<00:02:27.830> check<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.069> out<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.370> see<00:02:28.520> if<00:02:28.610> it's

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
let's go check it out and see if it's

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.670 
let's go check it out and see if it's
lighting<00:02:29.120> up<00:02:29.209> now<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.810> have<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.110> device<00:02:30.470> to

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
plug in and see what happens

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.710 
plug in and see what happens
