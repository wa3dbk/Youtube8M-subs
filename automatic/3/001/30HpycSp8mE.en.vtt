time<00:01:28.860> there<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.250> another<00:01:29.520> stamina<00:01:30.030> bar<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
time there is another stamina bar and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.880 
time there is another stamina bar and
that's<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> left<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.770> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that's the one on the left and that is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.679 
that's the one on the left and that is
for<00:01:32.070> combat<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.670> we'll<00:01:32.790> talk<00:01:32.970> more<00:01:33.030> about<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
for combat so we'll talk more about it

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.539 
for combat so we'll talk more about it
in<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.930> future<00:01:34.229> episode<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.070> all<00:01:35.310> that

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
in a future episode for now all that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.190 
in a future episode for now all that
matters<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> stamina<00:01:36.509> bar<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> right

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
matters is the stamina bar on the right

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.420 
matters is the stamina bar on the right
because<00:01:37.590> that's<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.310> represents

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
because that's the one that represents

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.920 
because that's the one that represents
your<00:01:38.909> movement<00:01:39.360> stamina

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
your movement stamina

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.630 
your movement stamina
besides<00:01:40.229> sprinting<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:40.950> are<00:01:41.070> other<00:01:41.310> moves

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
besides sprinting there are other moves

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.429 
besides sprinting there are other moves
that<00:01:41.850> consume<00:01:42.210> your<00:01:42.360> stamina<00:01:42.630> s--<00:01:42.869> such<00:01:43.200> as

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that consume your stamina s-- such as

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.170 
that consume your stamina s-- such as
stepping<00:01:43.920> over<00:01:44.009> zombies<00:01:44.549> head<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
stepping over zombies head that's the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.609 
stepping over zombies head that's the
best<00:01:45.450> name<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.659> could<00:01:45.899> come<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.500> but

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
best name I could come up for it but

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.410 
best name I could come up for it but
bear<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.890> mind<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.579> move<00:01:47.790> might<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.210> be

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
bear in mind that this move might not be

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.060 
bear in mind that this move might not be
available<00:01:48.630> from<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> start<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.770> might

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
available from the start it might

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.280 
available from the start it might
require<00:01:50.310> an<00:01:50.729> upgrade<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.390> usable<00:01:51.720> why<00:01:52.049> do<00:01:52.110> I

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
require an upgrade to be usable why do I

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
require an upgrade to be usable why do I
think<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.950> case<00:01:53.130> well<00:01:53.579> every<00:01:54.090> other

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
think this is the case well every other

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.630 
think this is the case well every other
move<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.750> way<00:01:55.170> more<00:01:55.470> basic<00:01:55.890> than<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.219> one<00:01:56.460> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
move is way more basic than this one and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.639 
move is way more basic than this one and
does<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.149> consume<00:01:57.600> stamina<00:01:58.110> jumping

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
does not consume stamina jumping

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.770 
does not consume stamina jumping
climbing<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.549> vaulting<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.240> not<00:02:00.390> consume

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
climbing and vaulting do not consume

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.690 
climbing and vaulting do not consume
stamina<00:02:01.259> at<00:02:01.439> all<00:02:01.619> sliding<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.490> other

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
stamina at all sliding on the other

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.730 
stamina at all sliding on the other
hands<00:02:03.149> doesn't<00:02:03.479> consume<00:02:03.869> movement<00:02:04.320> stamina

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
hands doesn't consume movement stamina

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.740 
hands doesn't consume movement stamina
but<00:02:04.860> consumes<00:02:05.340> combat<00:02:05.909> stamina<00:02:06.360> because<00:02:06.630> it

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
but consumes combat stamina because it

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.419 
but consumes combat stamina because it
can<00:02:06.930> actually<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.469> used<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> combat<00:02:08.250> move

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
can actually be used as a combat move

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.460 
can actually be used as a combat move
but<00:02:08.849> even<00:02:09.090> if<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.300> don't<00:02:09.509> hit<00:02:09.629> anything<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
but even if you don't hit anything the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.229 
but even if you don't hit anything the
stamina<00:02:10.860> will<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.160> drained<00:02:11.430> now<00:02:11.760> another

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
stamina will be drained now another

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.940 
stamina will be drained now another
reason<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.870> leads<00:02:13.110> me<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.290> believe

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
reason that leads me to believe

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.420 
reason that leads me to believe
at<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.220> jumping<00:02:14.819> over<00:02:15.090> zombies<00:02:15.629> face<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.170> a

at this jumping over zombies face is a

at this jumping over zombies face is a
special<00:02:17.430> move<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.670> needs<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.540> be<00:02:18.660> upgraded

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
special move that needs to be upgraded

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.229 
special move that needs to be upgraded
to<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.410> used<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.400> fact<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.700> angry<00:02:21.030> Joe

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
him at the end of his demo he tries to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.610 
him at the end of his demo he tries to
jump<00:02:26.970> over<00:02:27.239> exam<00:02:27.720> B's<00:02:27.870> head<00:02:28.050> several<00:02:28.560> times

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
jump over exam B's head several times

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.860 
jump over exam B's head several times
he's<00:02:29.160> not<00:02:29.340> able<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.640> do<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:30.000> maybe<00:02:30.450> he's<00:02:30.690> just

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
he's not able to do it maybe he's just

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.380 
he's not able to do it maybe he's just
growing<00:02:31.200> up<00:02:31.380> maybe<00:02:31.950> or<00:02:32.370> maybe<00:02:32.970> he<00:02:33.150> just

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
growing up maybe or maybe he just

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.360 
growing up maybe or maybe he just
doesn't<00:02:33.720> have<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.900> move<00:02:34.200> because<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.800> hasn't

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
doesn't have the move because it hasn't

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.430 
doesn't have the move because it hasn't
been<00:02:35.580> upgraded<00:02:36.180> yet<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.989> stepping<00:02:37.319> over

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
been upgraded yet so the stepping over

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.440 
been upgraded yet so the stepping over
zombies<00:02:37.980> head<00:02:38.190> looks<00:02:38.580> like<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.819> way<00:02:39.209> more

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
zombies head looks like a way more

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.089 
zombies head looks like a way more
advanced<00:02:39.870> move<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.319> it's<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.650> only<00:02:40.769> one

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
advanced move and it's the only one

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.979 
advanced move and it's the only one
we've<00:02:41.370> seen<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.670> far<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.120> consumes<00:02:42.599> stamina

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
we've seen so far that consumes stamina

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.720 
we've seen so far that consumes stamina
and<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.410> why<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.590> think<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.430> might

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
and this is why I think this might

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.030 
and this is why I think this might
require<00:02:45.209> an<00:02:45.450> upgrade<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.989> use<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:46.860> only

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
require an upgrade to use there is only

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.979 
require an upgrade to use there is only
one<00:02:47.340> more<00:02:47.549> movement<00:02:48.000> ability<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.720> haven't

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
one more movement ability that I haven't

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.630 
one more movement ability that I haven't
talked<00:02:49.260> about<00:02:49.560> yet<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.040> that's<00:02:50.220> climbing

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
talked about yet and that's climbing

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.390 
talked about yet and that's climbing
posts<00:02:51.269> as<00:02:51.420> well<00:02:51.480> as<00:02:51.989> jumping<00:02:52.349> off<00:02:52.530> them<00:02:52.769> now<00:02:53.370> I

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
posts as well as jumping off them now I

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.220 
posts as well as jumping off them now I
have<00:02:53.700> no<00:02:53.880> idea<00:02:53.910> if<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.630> will<00:02:54.870> consume

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
have no idea if this will consume

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.440 
have no idea if this will consume
stamina<00:02:55.769> or<00:02:55.950> not<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.849> only<00:02:56.880> gameplay

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450
