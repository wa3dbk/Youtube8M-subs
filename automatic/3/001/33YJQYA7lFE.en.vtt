00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.720
 you put here 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.720
 a piston 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.740

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.020
 you put here a square and now here 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.850

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.290
 If you want, if you do not like the consumer 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.520
 well I went up and I went up 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.080
 up here up to put 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.460
 a repeater because it reaches the 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.430
 running here and here and here comes and 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.340
 is here here you take and put to 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.619
 up a square there is for ice 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.350
 done with care that the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.229
 arrest and here you put a lever of 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.170
 this one of the traps and now forward 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.600

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:01.110
 the rope all the way to the bottom 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.830
 and now if you look, you know what happens 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.640
