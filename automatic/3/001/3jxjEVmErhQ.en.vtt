led that adjusts according to the boost

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.960 
led that adjusts according to the boost
12<00:01:18.500> decibels<00:01:19.009> of<00:01:19.130> boost<00:01:19.310> is<00:01:19.490> what<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.759> have

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
12 decibels of boost is what you have

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.240 
12 decibels of boost is what you have
there<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:20.539> if<00:01:20.690> you're<00:01:20.840> at<00:01:20.990> 12<00:01:21.740> then<00:01:22.009> you<00:01:22.100> get

maximum brightness if you're a little
bit<00:01:24.289> quieter<00:01:24.619> just<00:01:24.890> kind<00:01:25.039> of<00:01:25.100> dims<00:01:25.310> out<00:01:25.429> a

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
bit quieter just kind of dims out a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.179 
bit quieter just kind of dims out a
little<00:01:25.700> bit<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.439> my<00:01:27.439> favourite<00:01:27.890> thing<00:01:28.040> on

here<00:04:45.320> we're<00:04:45.440> going<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.590> emulate<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.190> sound<00:04:46.490> of

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
here we're going to emulate the sound of

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.450 
here we're going to emulate the sound of
an<00:04:46.760> upright<00:04:47.180> bass<00:04:47.389> or<00:04:47.870> Motown<00:04:48.440> bass<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:49.370> know

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460

an upright bass or Motown bass you know
the<00:04:49.580> electric<00:04:49.910> bass<00:04:50.060> with<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.270> foam

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
the electric bass with the foam

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.390 
the electric bass with the foam
underneath<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.110> strings<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.980> have<00:04:52.070> to<00:04:52.220> mute

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
underneath the strings and have to mute

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.370 
underneath the strings and have to mute
a<00:04:52.490> little<00:04:52.669> bit<00:04:52.790> on<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.000> fingers<00:04:53.360> but<00:04:53.720> by

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
a little bit on the fingers but by

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.500 
a little bit on the fingers but by
boosting<00:04:55.100> the<00:04:55.250> lows<00:04:55.460> cutting<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.090> mids<00:04:56.270> not

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
boosting the lows cutting the mids not

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.409 
boosting the lows cutting the mids not
as<00:04:56.690> much<00:04:56.870> as<00:04:56.990> we<00:04:57.110> did<00:04:57.260> in<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.470> scoop<00:04:57.830> and

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
as much as we did in the scoop and

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.969 
as much as we did in the scoop and
shifting<00:04:59.419> that<00:04:59.600> dip<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.260> little<00:05:00.290> bit<00:05:00.620> into<00:05:00.889> the

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
shifting that dip a little bit into the

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.980 
shifting that dip a little bit into the
highs<00:05:01.160> we're<00:05:01.910> going<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.090> get<00:05:02.240> that<00:05:02.449> sound<00:05:02.720> that

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
highs we're going to get that sound that

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.240 
highs we're going to get that sound that
you<00:05:03.110> might<00:05:03.290> be<00:05:03.440> looking<00:05:03.470> for<00:05:03.979> if<00:05:04.130> you're

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
you might be looking for if you're

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
we're going to set them to auto scroll

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.220 
we're going to set them to auto scroll
so<00:05:43.610> you<00:05:43.700> can<00:05:43.850> hear<00:05:44.060> just<00:05:44.450> what<00:05:44.630> that<00:05:44.810> sounds
