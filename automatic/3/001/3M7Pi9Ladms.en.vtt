00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.889
 and for this we will need caustic soda 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:14.920
 albal paper made in small balls 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:17.259
 and 400 liters of water according to the 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.740
 amount of caustic soda but also 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:23.160
 you need a pot this has the mouth 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.160
 we throw the water 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.480
 the caustic soda is put here 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:40.000
 or easier with a spoon we put 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.000
 the toasts 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.530
 and we started to move it 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.430
 what else 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.430
 do not 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.890
 and we started 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.530
 when it takes a considerable temperature 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.640
 more or less 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.199
 23 degrees that the wine 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.830
 that is what it would be if you think that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.830
 I would be with chela 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.810
 efe 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.969
 on camera a session because I do not know every 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.409
 wrong text then now we throw the fucking 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.950
 albal paper not much because we have 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.570
 done a lot and you've given a lot to do 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.570
 and we started to improve and you see 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.170
 but botelho her mouth 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.939
 When the smoke bottle jover 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.939
 then we see with all one 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.229
 and we see that the result is the I already there 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.229
 a 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.650
 pure 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.069
 here we can not do it because it comes out 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.069
 too much pressure 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.920
 Then, when entering the bottle , 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.490
 gas stays down because I left too much 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.490
 Pressure 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.590
 then this one is over I know
