00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.210 
I think after our first championship it
was<00:01:02.890> hard<00:01:03.400> to<00:01:03.550> go<00:01:03.850> back<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.239> back<00:01:04.590> and<00:01:05.590> then<00:01:05.800> the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
was hard to go back to back and then the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.210 
was hard to go back to back and then the
three-peat<00:01:06.670> come<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.180> we've<00:01:07.570> won<00:01:07.750> not<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.740> I

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
three-peat come and we've won not so I

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.810
