00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.200
 hello to all and all of these morgan and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.400
 so we end up again for 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.510
 measure so people have believed that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.200
 I stopped because I'm not going to do it 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.870
 last week 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.130
 do not worry it's just 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.029
 that last week the day before we 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.890
 had done a live that lasted eight 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.720
 hours anyway who was a super 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.270
 live a jadot remains an unforeseen live with 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.630
 you've been pretty awesome for me in 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.849
 any case 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.009
 and the next morning's blow I was a 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.180
 little tired after all that 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.099
 true that it tired the lives still 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.460
 more when canton it ended at 8 o'clock 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.379
 morning 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.640
 so I do not have fiction the week 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.180
 last I got you will hold me 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.130
 not rigorous 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.840
 I hope this is the case and so we are 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.640
 gone for ten days of course this 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.560
 week is so this week we have 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.170
 a lot of little things to say to each other 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.000
 so that will be the future from March 6 to 8 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.980
 march from Friday 10 am to sunday 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.070
 10 to and so you will see his stop 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.410
 why do we have things to say to each other 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.810
 he is here simply because he 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.489
 sells the icebreaker and there is 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.050
 had a bed that actually is if you 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.640
 follow a little bit specifically 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.920
 ray says it's true that there are a lot of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.460
 Destiny slips that are being made on 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.070
 reddit 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 this is really the source I have 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 really for almost every bed 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.259
 kale I think of what I could see I 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.659
 am not even sure that one elected elsewhere 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.210
 besides and so there is a guy who 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.039
 is called memong had just posted 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.920
 actually the weapons they were going to sell 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.389
 rupture for weapons and not that the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.639
 weapons also have the equipment that is 

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:27.959
 the good besides what he was going to sell 

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:30.179
 for the next two weeks and 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:31.289
 turns out it's just so I'll you 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.270
 did not talk about this book because 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.859
 it is true that there was no none 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.229
 confirmation there was nothing that 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:38.549
 could indicate reliably access so that 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.310
 serves no purpose that I tell you it's going to be 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.649
 that and if it's not okay it's a 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.060
 little bit unlucky knowing that he had planned 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.490
 also the assault of the week and who knows 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.950
 pic was nothing exceptional so so 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.329
 they had just so if you want 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.369
 precisely follow this guy follow these 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.049
 posts went to see his portrait says 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.950
 after you to think what you 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.170
 want a word it's true I find it 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.609
 a pity to lose the surprise of each 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.079
 week go see what I'm selling I 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.459
 find it nice to connect at 10am and 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.429
 to go for a ride on the 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.450
 look for it personally me I 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.190
 not look at sites or is it 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.649
 that he is or whatever even if what you 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.400
 do it but I'm going to get it 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.659
 and that's what I like 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.400
 I watch what they sell I discover 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.260
 at that time so that's nice but 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.159
 if you want to follow this guy etc 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.709
 I will put the links in the 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.689
 description so of this guy who 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.349
 is even called in gaye sarr axa has been 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:29.079
 relayed by a lot of two chains of 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.049
 sites and settat and so that will serve to be 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.269
 just so the icebreaker one of course I 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.060
 already wanted to say many times if you 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.470
 have not bought the really 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.730
 you start on the game ans is possible 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.489
 to people who still buy the game 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.379
 it's really a very essential weapon 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.799
 if mart to black is very very good 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.989
 also 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.370
 but if you are not to have seen 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.319
 this clash imagines that you do not have them 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.900
 means of loot and hammer noah finally 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.400
 is that you are a beginner on the game 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.450
 normally since he came out again 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.099
 two weeks ago I believe the breeze 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.019
 ice cream or something like that so 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.819
 normally you wash of it's a 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.670
 very good harmony with reloading 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.230
 automatic to the evaluation reloads as 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.639
 and as time goes on so you can 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.810
 not picked up two cartridges but it gets 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.159
 recharge as you go 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.930
 of six it's a little bit weak from 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.629
 that's what makes the difference 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.769
 I find with the black hammer 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.849
 am finally less short with the 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.410
 hammer en and his three shots from 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.669
 accuracy then the helmet 214 that makes 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.620
 that the enemies that crosses the rampart 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:26.109
 of rohr are blind and that I find that 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.370
 pretty cool for the titan and it seems to me 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.459
 that it's the only one I do not have 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.519
 besides, a game is already 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:38.230
 go buy the milk china 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.549
 janam carats for the hunter who does 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.879
 that the laser grenade last longer 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.109
 long time and the energy gain of your 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.489
 super is improved in case of cravings 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.819
 garnet so that's if you really play 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.079
 garnet it's pretty anecdotal for the 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.790
 for the hunter anyway compared 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.919
 to all the helmets we can have 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.389
 I will not take his arms 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.780
 personally if there was a choice to 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.579
 make 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.489
 after if you miss that to pass 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.530
 for now two levels does the the 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.180
 skull of despair lady carat but who 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.879
 allows to increase the range of the throws 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.829
 of grenades and improve the resistance 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.109
 we use the bung nova the drain 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.000
 of energy is reinforced that it can be 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.609
 nice if we just play the bomb nova 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.440
 on the pvp playing also it can be 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.000
 cool why not have you to me 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.590
 to say it's true that I have no no 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.930
 more art specialist than nice 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.110
 even though I have my little baby 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.500
 arganese as they say in the team so 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.479
 So here are some jade staffs all 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.590
 and staff the helmet is really at the top 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:38.289
 the titan helmet then so we have a 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.849
 exotic shine as always in g 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.680
 exotic of thor that you know they 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.810
 have solved the concern that 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.400
 never again did we have we had 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.469
 fake it was not in g like 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.639
 for the light heavy goods of a good the 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:49.750
 cartons of heavy weapons it is necessary that 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.570
 I take that I still have not done it 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.479
 quest with monty time is so always 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.190
 equipment improvements so the 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.870
 symbiote to kloten the mas of the third 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.180
 paul zardari man moment that this 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.620
 equipment for the hunter the case this 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.900
 is the interior walls the fortress 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.490
 cranial paul titan light by de 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.400
 adversity and the solar winds for 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.029
 the organist then for weapons the 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.340
 sweat to voodoo dolls lamidat plan 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:16.360
 his masters of thunder and welsh 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.500
 What I miss too 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.659
 cruelly 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.990
 you know if you follow a little 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.700
 little my channel and stream and so on 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.539
 Physio telemetry early shotgun 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.219
 launches rocket red plasma motor and 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.289
 blue asking for them 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.510
 telemetry I do not know which one I have 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.400
 do not have them here I imagine 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.900
 Well, no, it's so bad 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.520
 I think I do not have rockets auto 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.449
 in doubt I will not take them there 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.800
 I'll have to take some cartridges 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.030
 heavy in the hope of lot-et-garonne 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.199
 I told myself that I was not 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.620
 cartridges as much as I had not 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.759
 galore I do not see there I sulk the butt 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.400
 of time I have not gallant horn 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.960
 so that's so a week a week 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.280
 week of an interesting at the level of 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.870
 art has nothing commented on m and the bronze 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.449
 it's already sold what they did not 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.880
 not be very happy to think of them 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:04.669
 those who started the game there there are 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.250
 still like I tell you of course you 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.080
 may want others 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.090
 weapons but we can not have everything 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.530
 and if he wants another to hurt would not have 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.240
 better than others so good it's a small 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.400
 little like that I find that the staff by 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.990
 against changed well that's cool 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.400
 did it for a very long time 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.380
 had not seen these elements if I 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.190
 not deceive so that's rather a 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.500
 good thing 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.050
 so that's so listen bah of the blow 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.389
 will see next week if if the 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.570
 nobody and I forgot his name but 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.220
 moongai that's always right but 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.080
 saw how much they were right on 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.039
 this passage sam and in which are wrong 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.080
 for the next week 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.240
 so I'm not telling you what it will be 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.880
 go see on the post if you are 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.349
 interested to know exactly what 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.970
 it will be I do not want you this pole you

 is in this video I wanted this is the 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.770
