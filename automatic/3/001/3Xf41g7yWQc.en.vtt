different<00:05:37.919> lipsticks<00:05:38.460> show<00:05:38.729> you<00:05:38.789> all<00:05:39.060> of<00:05:39.240> them

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
different lipsticks show you all of them

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:40.700 
different lipsticks show you all of them
and<00:05:39.630> share<00:05:39.780> with<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.020> different<00:05:40.289> colors<00:05:40.560> I

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
and share with the different colors I

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.140 
and share with the different colors I
think<00:05:40.770> it'd<00:05:40.979> be<00:05:41.010> really<00:05:41.190> fun<00:05:41.310> but<00:05:41.940> maybe

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
think it'd be really fun but maybe

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.790 
think it'd be really fun but maybe
that's<00:05:42.360> a<00:05:42.510> project<00:05:42.900> for<00:05:43.320> another<00:05:43.410> time

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
that's a project for another time

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.000 
that's a project for another time
