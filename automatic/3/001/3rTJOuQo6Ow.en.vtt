00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:18.610
 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.320
 well my name is adriana ribas other 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.660
 healthy as you want to call it 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.890
 We're here at the gym because I bring 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.509
 a hint 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.439
 in fact this person tip asks me 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.250
 enough that is like conquering an abdomen 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.280
 defined 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.660
 Good, we'll see it depends on three factors. 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.360
 is the first is its genetics the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.970
 training and the third and 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.830
 important is the feeding 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.450
 Good. Come on, the exercises are good. 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.010
 fundamental you really have to 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.790
 do an exercise I will give some tips 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.400
 for you 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.070
 now it's no use you train has a 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.720
 strong abdomen and have to take a cover 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.180
 fat on top of it 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.790
 Then he will sing the one from the abdomen so 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.340
 Gorgeous it's there you trained strong 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.199
 to conquer beyond then 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.360
 training you have to have a diet 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.610
 hypocaloric has to decrease the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.480
 fat is about it for so he 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.930
 appear 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.310
 right now with regards to training 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.650
 You're a beginner, you should start without 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.610
 load get lighter prepare to 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.130
 musculature 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.800
 now they already train intermediate time 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.080
 is already advanced 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.130
 emphasizes saw this training do with 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.260
 charge 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.540
 It's no use making millions of 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.000
 repetitions this is not there 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.020
 do with freight pass with more quality 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.020
 and fewer repetitions 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.200
 the abdomen to the musician like any other 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.850
 So, training every day is wrong. 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.560
 You have to give a rest to the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.210
 musculature recovered 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.360
 You can train two times three times. 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.250
 week okay as long as there is a break from 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.740
 one to two days 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.360
 sometimes I see people sharing the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.880
 abdomen training 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.160
 today I will work top and 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880
 tomorrow or after work apart 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.740
 bottom 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.950
 There is no abdominal muscle there. 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.010
 not divide the work in this way into 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.990
 all the emphasis exercises for the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.550
 top part of the emphasis 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.820
 lower on a single day 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.680
 Okay, and the other day, you rest, and there. 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.850
 after it you will train two days or 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.360
 three days later 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.940
 Ok, so remember, healthy food. 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.160
 and physical activity walk together 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.110
 then you will achieve results 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.570
 excellent with physical activity 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.960
