texture<00:00:27.150> pack<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.540> there<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.290> actually<00:00:28.649> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
texture pack on there is actually the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.350 
texture pack on there is actually the
first<00:00:28.890> texture<00:00:29.279> pack<00:00:29.460> I've<00:00:29.640> ever<00:00:29.880> put<00:00:30.239> on

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
first texture pack I've ever put on

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.089 
first texture pack I've ever put on
minecraft<00:00:31.110> I<00:00:31.230> was<00:00:31.349> looking<00:00:31.590> through<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.800> lot<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
minecraft I was looking through a lot of

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.710 
minecraft I was looking through a lot of
them<00:00:32.220> and<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.030> didn't<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.360> know<00:00:33.510> how<00:00:33.660> to

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
them and I didn't really know how to

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.990 
them and I didn't really know how to
install<00:00:34.110> them<00:00:34.500> but<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:34.920> looking<00:00:35.340> back<00:00:35.399> I'm

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
install them but now looking back I'm

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.120 
install them but now looking back I'm
surprised<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.899> didn't<00:00:37.380> really<00:00:37.470> look<00:00:37.649> into<00:00:37.800> it

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
surprised I didn't really look into it

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.620 
surprised I didn't really look into it
that<00:00:38.610> much<00:00:38.640> before<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.510> actually

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
that much before because it's actually

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.870 
that much before because it's actually
fairly<00:00:40.020> simple<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> Mac<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.340> don't

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
fairly simple on the Mac so I don't

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.370 
fairly simple on the Mac so I don't
think<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.180> easy<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.170> like

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
think it's as easy as it is on like

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.830 
think it's as easy as it is on like
Windows<00:00:43.980> or<00:00:44.219> whatever<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.060> is<00:00:45.540> definitely

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
Windows or whatever but it is definitely

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.380 
Windows or whatever but it is definitely
very<00:00:46.320> very<00:00:46.950> simple<00:00:47.220> so<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:48.150> like<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
very very simple so I really like the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.630 
very very simple so I really like the
way<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.660> one<00:00:48.810> looks<00:00:49.080> I<00:00:49.380> like<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.800> have

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
way this one looks I like to have

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.130 
way this one looks I like to have
everyone's<00:00:51.030> opinion<00:00:51.540> do<00:00:51.810> you<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:51.990> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
everyone's opinion do you like the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.130 
everyone's opinion do you like the
regular<00:00:52.310> minecraft<00:00:53.310> do<00:00:53.580> you<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.790> this<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
regular minecraft do you like this and I

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.430 
regular minecraft do you like this and I
accidentally<00:00:55.650> fall<00:00:56.280> into<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.790> hole<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.440> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
accidentally fall into this hole and I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.250 
accidentally fall into this hole and I
still<00:00:58.770> end<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:58.980> killing<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> guy<00:00:59.520> but<00:01:00.150> I'm<00:01:01.110> at

still end up killing the guy but I'm at

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.319 
still end up killing the guy but I'm at
a<00:01:01.290> disadvantage<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:02.040> here<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.579> obviously

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329

a disadvantage now here and obviously
I'm<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:04.140> best<00:01:04.320> pvp<00:01:04.619> ER<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:05.820> getting

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
especially like with this this pack is

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.289 
especially like with this this pack is
texture<00:01:31.500> pack<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.490> way<00:01:32.580> iron<00:01:32.909> looks<00:01:33.150> I

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
texture pack is the way iron looks I

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.880 
texture pack is the way iron looks I
don't<00:01:33.450> know<00:01:33.510> I<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.440> way<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> normally

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
don't know I just the way it normally

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.860 
don't know I just the way it normally
looks<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.549> regular<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> regular

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
looks in regular you know the regular

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.380 
looks in regular you know the regular
minecraft<00:01:37.350> texture<00:01:37.830> pack<00:01:37.979> they<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:39.060> just

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
minecraft texture pack they have it just

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.180 
minecraft texture pack they have it just
kind<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.690> is<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> little<00:01:40.170> dull<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.010> one

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
kind of is a little dull but this one

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.770 
kind of is a little dull but this one
kind<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.490> brightens<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.240> little<00:01:42.420> bit<00:01:42.540> it's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
kind of brightens up a little bit it's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.200 
kind of brightens up a little bit it's
not<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> huge<00:01:43.680> change<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.940> definitely

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
not like a huge change but it definitely

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.180 
not like a huge change but it definitely
I<00:01:45.630> think<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.020> looks<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.260> little<00:01:46.380> bit<00:01:46.560> cooler<00:01:46.799> so

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
I think it looks a little bit cooler so

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.520 
I think it looks a little bit cooler so
that's<00:01:47.760> that<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.299> anyways<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.110> crevice

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
that's that but anyways in this crevice

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.030 
that's that but anyways in this crevice
I<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:50.190> find<00:01:50.850> full<00:01:51.600> iron<00:01:51.990> materials<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.890> have

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
I do find full iron materials and I have
