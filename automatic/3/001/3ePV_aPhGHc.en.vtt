00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
all right the thing about chocolate if

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.200 
all right the thing about chocolate if
you<00:00:25.080> want<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.320> get<00:00:25.439> specific<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.640> darker<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
you want to get specific the darker the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.990 
you want to get specific the darker the
chocolate<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:28.439> lighter<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.010> dog<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.760> more

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
chocolate the lighter the dog the more

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.790 
chocolate the lighter the dog the more
toxic<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.720> if<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.050> suspect<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.619> they've

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
toxic it is if you suspect that they've

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.170 
toxic it is if you suspect that they've
gotten<00:00:32.099> something<00:00:32.369> that's<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> dark<00:00:33.000> chocolate

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
gotten something that's a dark chocolate

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.860 
gotten something that's a dark chocolate
like<00:00:33.510> that

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
like that

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.900 
like that
you<00:00:34.050> can't<00:00:34.350> induce<00:00:34.620> vomiting<00:00:34.800> quickly<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
you can't induce vomiting quickly and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.729 
you can't induce vomiting quickly and
the<00:00:36.420> way<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.600> should<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.410> this

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the way you should do this have this

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.440 
the way you should do this have this
around<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> house<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.120> probably<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
around the house this is probably the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.690 
around the house this is probably the
best<00:00:39.629> thing<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.020> should<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:41.250> multiple

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
best thing you should have for multiple

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.299 
best thing you should have for multiple
purposes<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.620> little<00:00:43.620> thing<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.950> hydrogen

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
purposes a little thing of hydrogen

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.580 
purposes a little thing of hydrogen
peroxide<00:00:44.430> 99<00:00:45.270> cents<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.719> grocery<00:00:46.200> store

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
peroxide 99 cents at your grocery store

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.440 
peroxide 99 cents at your grocery store
yeah<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.860> fairly<00:00:47.280> easy<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.700> do<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.030> yeah<00:00:48.270> if

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
yeah it's fairly easy to do this yeah if

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.080 
yeah it's fairly easy to do this yeah if
you<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.840> something<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.520> use<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you have something like I just use a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.270 
you have something like I just use a
spoon<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.320> enough<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> spoon<00:00:53.129> or

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
spoon if you have enough in a spoon or

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.099 
spoon if you have enough in a spoon or
even<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> cap<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.739> fill<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> cap<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
even the cap just fill the cap up and

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.479 
even the cap just fill the cap up and
the<00:00:58.109> technique<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.739> probably<00:00:58.920> pretty<00:00:59.219> much

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the technique is probably pretty much

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.160 
the technique is probably pretty much
you<00:00:59.670> tilt<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> dog's<00:01:00.180> head<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you tilt the dog's head up like this I

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.460 
you tilt the dog's head up like this I
kind<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.770> put<00:01:02.100> my<00:01:02.460> fingers<00:01:02.850> between<00:01:03.260> like<00:01:04.260> this

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
kind of put my fingers between like this

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
kind of put my fingers between like this
and<00:01:04.739> I'm<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.250> open<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.790> mouth<00:01:05.909> slightly

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and I'm going to open the mouth slightly

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.480 
and I'm going to open the mouth slightly
pour<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.049> keeping<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> head<00:01:07.920> pointed

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
pour it in keeping the head pointed

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.539 
pour it in keeping the head pointed
upwards<00:01:09.290> okay<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> key<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.400> have

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
upwards okay that's the key if you have

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.250 
upwards okay that's the key if you have
the<00:01:11.700> head<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.540> you're<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.990> going

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the head like this and you're just going

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.170 
the head like this and you're just going
to<00:01:13.320> pour<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.580> tilt<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> head<00:01:15.150> back

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
to pour on it so you tilt the head back

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.690 
to pour on it so you tilt the head back
and<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.229> kind<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.500> gently<00:01:17.009> open<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> little

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and just kind of gently open the little

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.399 
and just kind of gently open the little
mouth<00:01:17.909> pour<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> back<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> throat

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
mouth pour it in the back of the throat

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.010 
mouth pour it in the back of the throat
closes<00:01:20.220> mouth<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.240> should<00:01:21.420> swallow<00:01:21.720> that

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
closes mouth and you should swallow that

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.050 
closes mouth and you should swallow that
and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:23.070> happens<00:01:23.430> once<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> hydrogen

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and then what happens once the hydrogen

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.660 
and then what happens once the hydrogen
peroxide<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.799> hydrogen

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
peroxide is in there this hydrogen

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.870 
peroxide is in there this hydrogen
peroxide<00:01:27.080> generally<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.110> would<00:01:28.229> say<00:01:28.759> 70<00:01:29.759> 80

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
peroxide generally I would say 70 80

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.700 
peroxide generally I would say 70 80
percent<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> time<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.439> cause

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
percent of the time is going to cause

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.340 
percent of the time is going to cause
the<00:01:32.310> dog<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.670> vomit<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> reflex<00:01:34.049> it's

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the dog to vomit just on a reflex it's

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.660 
the dog to vomit just on a reflex it's
so<00:01:35.570> caustic<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.040> nauseating<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.070> them<00:01:38.280> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
so caustic and nauseating to them it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.550 
so caustic and nauseating to them it
just<00:01:38.759> causes<00:01:39.150> there<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.140> bomb<00:01:40.380> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
just causes there to just bomb a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.260 
just causes there to just bomb a
whatever<00:01:40.710> they<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:40.979> ate<00:01:41.400> what<00:01:41.880> happens<00:01:42.180> if

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
whatever they just ate what happens if
