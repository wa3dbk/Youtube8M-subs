don't really know what I'm gonna do this

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.240

like I feel like if somebody sends me
something<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:53.759> definitely<00:01:53.880> gonna<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
something I'm definitely gonna have to

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.789 
something I'm definitely gonna have to
put<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> lookbook<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.409> show<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.649> how<00:01:55.770> to

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
put it in a lookbook and show you how to

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.920 
put it in a lookbook and show you how to
style<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.579> don't<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.149> how<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.420> could<00:01:57.689> style

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
style it I don't know how I could style

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.810 
style it I don't know how I could style
this<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.380> expected<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.070> longer<00:01:59.610> too

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
this I expected it to be longer too

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.690 
this I expected it to be longer too
because<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.360> gives<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.719> how<00:02:01.380> long<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.009> items

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
because it gives you how long the items

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.539 
because it gives you how long the items
are<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.840> definitely<00:02:04.469> does<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.799> look<00:02:05.130> as

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
are and it definitely does not look as

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.850 
are and it definitely does not look as
long<00:02:05.850> as<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.570> was

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
long as it was

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.040 
long as it was
your<00:02:07.070> ties<00:02:07.300> so<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.450> looks<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.750> really

bracelets or earrings from them but as

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.180 
bracelets or earrings from them but as
for<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.440> necklace

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
for the necklace

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.460 
for the necklace
it<00:03:43.340> seems<00:03:43.549> pretty<00:03:43.760> sturdy<00:03:44.120> but<00:03:44.480> just<00:03:45.170> like<00:03:45.290> any

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
it seems pretty sturdy but just like any

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.170 
it seems pretty sturdy but just like any
other<00:03:45.560> bracelet<00:03:45.980> or<00:03:46.250> necklace<00:03:46.310> if<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:46.970> pull

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
other bracelet or necklace if you pull

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.340 
other bracelet or necklace if you pull
it<00:03:47.209> too<00:03:47.299> hard<00:03:47.600> it's<00:03:47.720> gonna<00:03:47.810> break<00:03:48.110> every

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
it too hard it's gonna break every

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.990 
it too hard it's gonna break every
necklace<00:03:48.769> breaks<00:03:49.130> if<00:03:49.250> you<00:03:49.340> do<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.610> so<00:03:49.760> just

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
necklace breaks if you do that so just

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.949 
necklace breaks if you do that so just
be<00:03:50.299> careful<00:03:50.450> with<00:03:50.690> it

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
be careful with it

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.660 
be careful with it
so<00:03:51.590> just<00:03:51.799> since<00:03:51.950> this<00:03:52.100> is<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.340> little<00:03:52.580> bit

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
so just since this is a little bit

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.080 
so just since this is a little bit
cheaper<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.150> might<00:03:53.360> have<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:54.580> bigger<00:03:55.580> chance<00:03:55.910> of

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
cheaper it might have a bigger chance of

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.150 
cheaper it might have a bigger chance of
breaking<00:03:56.480> really<00:03:56.690> quickly<00:03:57.110> so<00:03:57.709> yeah<00:03:57.920> that's

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
breaking really quickly so yeah that's

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.150 
breaking really quickly so yeah that's
it<00:03:58.280> for<00:03:58.310> this<00:03:58.519> video<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:59.150> hope<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.480> guys
