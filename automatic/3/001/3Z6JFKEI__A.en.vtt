00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.380
 improvisations w 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.620
 to know that a truce agreement had a guitar and mike lazaridis only concern 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:25.759
 so we were interested in the win rope so the biggest the same 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.089
 price 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.469
 where they can serve as a point of reference the starting point for our 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:32.940
 improvisations 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.100
 so on this rope 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.970
 we will find the other notes 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.740
 that you know and mike patton the fidh aurelie 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.750
 so his effigy 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.330
 agricultural high school 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
 step at their first cloak 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.850
 it will be the third 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.830
 the hamas a level playing field 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.810
 or more if the 27th can 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.890
 cueto told afp 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.940
 the story to life as it 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.940
 searches in 2038 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.430
 the second war 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.430
 no, we went through a hospital 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.340
 so sarens now 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.340
 however robert they want busy makes loud noise 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.560
 what is called war by patrick juillard this is the one that will serve 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.580
 for a total in condition of all 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.810
 so this story with kristensen different positions we'll go first 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 be interested in the first position 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.790
 we will take an example again 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.510
 so it's not because I'm the best of the man it's she who 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.010
 order 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.620
 or an act of war said 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.620
 reform 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.389
 she was pursuing the morphology of each and then the regulars 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.159
 hortense 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.059
 so that will serve us for its part continued issing you expect conditions 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.599
 on the one hand and 8 billion in gold the great grouse wharton sound a 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.329
 tone we call it will happen on a piece that has a pitch tone 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.259
 so that can be understood 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.859
