 putting together the largest complex of its level system 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.819
 with an amount that exceeds 250 million dollars 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.689
 the lego Danish company bets beyond the expansion of space and 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:17.960
 production 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.500
 with a campus that will house the manufacturing and packaging part next 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.539
 installation of your plant located in the municipality of Cienega de Flores will count 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.190
 with a center for innovation and development of molds 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.510
 in addition to another new area that will have machinery and technology that does not exist 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.050
 in Mexico 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.500
 united states is a growing market for us

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.700
 each percent of growth as pastures in the market that are 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700
 in the united states is reflected in 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
 An increment 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.510
 three times in terms of manufacturing or then 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.040
 of that size is the return of that size is the challenge also that is 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.360
 Market Stall 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.689
 for us to be a manufacturing crime in Mexico 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.280
 of this plant in 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.410
 in terms of loans, the valuation of the mondeo 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.000
 the month of October is going to be 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.100
 already the largest manufacturing center delegated globally 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.110
 as soon as we have the warehouse structure already 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.200
 c is only going to turn into a campus iii and already it will be 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.820
 the center more than they were of that important mold and packaging 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.600
 from a global level except Czech Republic that complicated us a bit the part of the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.520
 package 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.560
 percent but they do not have molded then when it comes to combining the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.650
 different 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.390
 Manufacturing activity converts Monterrey into Mexico 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.510
 in the largest manufacturing center the bon iver gil 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.679
 we are called 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.900
 pieces to build game systems 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.799
 is generating in addition to intensive labor 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.189
 high-level employment both technicians and engineers with skills of the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.840
 same magnitude as those in the nanotechnology and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.899
 aerospace and that are mostly supplied by the local market 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.309
 to the percent growth 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:14.859
 mainly in 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.989
 in countries like Russia not in its Russian part this end 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.669
 spectacular 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:23.369
 england uk we are also seeing despite being a market 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.319
 considered a magician in a certain way 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.770
 germany which is our flagship so to speak 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.849
 where we have almost 20 percent of chevrolet Tuesday

 pya grow again 1 percent of the Sardinia market almost twenty has 12 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.569
 your world not then 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.729
 we continue to see the growth phenomenon obviously not at the same 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.439
 exponential level we are well north america 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.739
 but if we continue to see it, although in others 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.120
 the plot and that is a market that is in our friendship that is in which 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.689
 is being explored 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.109
 since this stage 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.649
 d of exploration precisely
