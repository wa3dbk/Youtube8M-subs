00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.210
 two 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.510
 good as they are, I hope very well 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.760
 we could talk about a subject that had already 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.870
 played some old videos which can 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.189
 find on the oscar channel itself 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.960
 they are interested in seeing it again 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.189
 I practically still think the same thing 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.750
 respect but the user is fernando 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.070
 He gave me the idea of playing again 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.840
 this topic and in passing also talk about 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.369
 fuji all since the current saga of 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.320
 manga 3 pink looks like it's going to be a 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.820
 very important character so the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.020
 which is interesting to touch this topic like this 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.939
 I thank you, friend, and well, let's go 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.440
 to start the first one we have is to 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.269
 just really he lost his eye what 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.860
 keep closed I do not think the same 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.570
 that in the old video for me it follows 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.250
 having to that eye the reasons for the 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.629
 it is closed to me they are two the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.430
 first is that it is a normal eye and when 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.690
 open it we will not see anything weird but this 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.610
 I would still give you a better view in the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.049
 battlefield would be something appearance in 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.600
 peace and how to remove the good patch 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.190
 it is a monster only look is the one that sees and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.510
 the other possibility and is commenting 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.680
 in several forums and is that it only has one 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.239
 hawk's eye 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.070
 something similar to those of my son whose 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.629
 name means hawk's eye and who 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.190
 know maybe the eye will relate that 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.720
 observations are at high points 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.760
 like a hawk to observe all the 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.369
 battlefield about a bird comes and 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.840
 enough troll which would give you just one 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.960
 almost perfect vision in the field of 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.960
 battle 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.850
 If I hear you fuck I can finally talk 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.280
 in your fucking videos for those who hate 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.680
 the loquendo told them that is my whore 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.300
 voice so they will have to tolerate me 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.640
 I want to comment on a fucking 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.860
 movie called zatoichi an oriental 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.050
 pretty old and good you see that oda 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.180
 sense paid homage to the protagonist of 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.920
 this movie a blind samurai who does not 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.650
 I had trouble knocking out their 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.720
 rivals though some say it was not 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.640
 but he pretended to be blind not to 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.820
 have too much advantage in front of their 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.820
 rivals 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.300
 this movie I really did not see the movie 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.580
 but I read several sources just in case 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.869
 already agree that the samurai the blind 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.790
 while theory that says actually 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.850
 it was not but maybe the blind man 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.560
 when really not and now yes 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.119
 mentioning astoria spoons again 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.190
 I think it 's all you have in common 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.720
 it's a splendid observation and hack 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.730
 so much that I want you to have it at 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.620
 level of nerves it seems to them so if 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.630
 I write it not only one eye is missing 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.790
 the two are not great and they are going to 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.020
 show a monstrous though it may 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.670
 all this is a topicality or do 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.880
 follow alone just have sharing 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.880
 ant 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.180
 Magnetic tribune in short now tell me 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.010
 what do you think you only lost when 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.959
 he lost his hat the blind man there is no 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.489
 deer have an active observation 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.140
 huge I do not know I hope your comments and 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.000
 theories very many times were this 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.000
 video see you next chau chau
