meghan<00:05:11.990> tier<00:05:12.199> I'm<00:05:12.470> there<00:05:12.740> this<00:05:12.949> is<00:05:13.039> gonna<00:05:13.160> be

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
meghan tier I'm there this is gonna be

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.159 
meghan tier I'm there this is gonna be
90<00:05:13.490> degrees<00:05:13.520> we're<00:05:14.090> going<00:05:14.210> from<00:05:14.389> behind<00:05:14.720> her<00:05:14.960> a

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
90 degrees we're going from behind her a

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.870 
90 degrees we're going from behind her a
little<00:05:15.500> bit<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:15.860> so<00:05:16.460> we're<00:05:16.610> going<00:05:16.699> to<00:05:16.789> make

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
little bit and so we're going to make

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.210 
little bit and so we're going to make
sure<00:05:17.150> that<00:05:17.300> that<00:05:17.330> side<00:05:17.630> of<00:05:17.660> her<00:05:17.780> face<00:05:17.960> is<00:05:18.260> in

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
sure that that side of her face is in

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.629 
sure that that side of her face is in
that<00:05:19.400> zone<00:05:20.000> that's<00:05:20.840> going<00:05:21.289> to<00:05:21.410> be<00:05:21.440> not<00:05:22.370> lick

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
that zone that's going to be not lick

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.060 
that zone that's going to be not lick
for<00:05:23.570> lick<00:05:23.750> related<00:05:24.500> from<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.680> right<00:05:24.860> way<00:05:25.010> so

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
for lick related from the right way so

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.430 
for lick related from the right way so
you<00:05:25.340> follow<00:05:25.760> me<00:05:25.940> anything<00:05:26.240> so<00:05:26.750> I<00:05:27.080> hope<00:05:27.260> I'm

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
lenio I hope I'm not moving too fast for

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.000 
lenio I hope I'm not moving too fast for
you<00:05:29.389> or<00:05:29.510> too<00:05:29.660> slow<00:05:29.810> for<00:05:29.900> you<00:05:30.169> definitely<00:05:30.919> not

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.939 
you or too slow for you definitely not
some<00:05:31.190> slow<00:05:31.370> but<00:05:31.610> we'll<00:05:31.729> see<00:05:31.940> you<00:05:32.000> here<00:05:35.949> alright

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
some slow but we'll see you here alright

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.500 
some slow but we'll see you here alright
so<00:05:37.190> maybe<00:05:37.370> turn<00:05:37.639> your<00:05:37.729> face<00:05:37.849> to<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.060> more<00:05:38.360> now

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
so maybe turn your face to the more now

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.570 
so maybe turn your face to the more now
can<00:05:38.539> we<00:05:38.930> go<00:05:39.699> you

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.700 

but<00:05:44.580> it's<00:05:45.510> a<00:05:45.600> little<00:05:45.810> too<00:05:45.930> dark<00:05:46.110> on<00:05:46.320> this<00:05:46.470> side

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
but it's a little too dark on this side

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.230 
but it's a little too dark on this side
and<00:05:46.980> so<00:05:47.280> what<00:05:47.550> I'm<00:05:47.640> going<00:05:47.730> to<00:05:47.790> do<00:05:47.880> now<00:05:48.030> is<00:05:48.180> I'm

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
and so what I'm going to do now is I'm

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.730 
and so what I'm going to do now is I'm
going<00:05:48.330> to<00:05:48.450> introduce<00:05:48.570> that<00:05:48.960> other<00:05:49.230> light

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
going to introduce that other light

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.080 
going to introduce that other light
source<00:05:50.100> that<00:05:50.160> we're<00:05:50.400> talking<00:05:50.520> about<00:05:50.730> either

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
source that we're talking about either

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.430 
source that we're talking about either
than<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.360> light<00:05:51.510> it's<00:05:52.050> actually<00:05:52.230> a

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
than the light it's actually a

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.480 
than the light it's actually a
reflective<00:05:52.890> so<00:05:53.010> we're<00:05:53.130> going<00:05:53.220> to<00:05:53.310> have<00:05:53.460> a

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
reflective so we're going to have a

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.430 
reflective so we're going to have a
reflector<00:05:54.030> come<00:05:54.180> in<00:05:54.360> and<00:05:54.870> we're<00:05:55.170> talking<00:05:55.350> to

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
reflector come in and we're talking to

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.780 
reflector come in and we're talking to
me<00:05:55.500> that's<00:05:55.950> why<00:05:56.100> that<00:05:56.250> guys<00:05:56.430> next<00:05:58.430> event<00:05:59.430> money

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
me that's why that guys next event money

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.740 
me that's why that guys next event money
play<00:05:59.940> comes<00:06:00.090> up<00:06:00.210> we're<00:06:00.390> going<00:06:00.480> to<00:06:00.540> put<00:06:00.630> this

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
play comes up we're going to put this

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.450 
play comes up we're going to put this
reflector<00:06:01.560> right<00:06:01.710> here<00:06:01.890> hopefully<00:06:02.220> we<00:06:02.340> can

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
reflector right here hopefully we can

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.000 
reflector right here hopefully we can
still<00:06:02.670> see<00:06:02.850> Megan<00:06:03.180> but<00:06:03.360> if<00:06:03.570> not<00:06:03.780> oh<00:06:04.020> well<00:06:04.680> we're

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
still see Megan but if not oh well we're

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.500 
still see Megan but if not oh well we're
trying<00:06:05.190> to<00:06:05.250> do<00:06:05.310> this<00:06:05.430> lighting<00:06:05.790> thing<00:06:05.970> so<00:06:06.270> i

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
trying to do this lighting thing so i

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.630 
trying to do this lighting thing so i
guess<00:06:07.200> if<00:06:07.350> we<00:06:07.440> can't<00:06:07.650> see<00:06:07.800> megan<00:06:08.100> lynn<00:06:08.520> we

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
guess if we can't see megan lynn we

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.270 
guess if we can't see megan lynn we
could<00:06:08.820> just<00:06:09.000> watch<00:06:09.630> me<00:06:09.870> here<00:06:10.680> Eddie<00:06:10.860> said<00:06:11.130> I'd

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
could just watch me here Eddie said I'd

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.630 
could just watch me here Eddie said I'd
look<00:06:11.400> hot<00:06:11.700> so<00:06:12.180> all<00:06:12.360> right<00:06:12.510> here<00:06:12.660> we<00:06:12.690> go<00:06:13.490> so<00:06:14.490> here

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
look hot so all right here we go so here

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.820 
look hot so all right here we go so here
we<00:06:14.670> go<00:06:14.820> I'm<00:06:15.120> gonna<00:06:15.300> be<00:06:15.420> up<00:06:15.510> here<00:06:15.780> and<00:06:15.990> now<00:06:16.770> we're

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.590 
we go I'm gonna be up here and now we're
going<00:06:17.070> to<00:06:17.160> see<00:06:17.280> this<00:06:17.400> with<00:06:17.580> a<00:06:17.610> reflector<00:06:18.090> we're

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
going to see this with a reflector we're

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.680 
going to see this with a reflector we're
going<00:06:18.810> to<00:06:18.870> make<00:06:18.990> sure<00:06:19.050> that<00:06:19.340> there<00:06:20.340> you<00:06:20.460> go

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
going to make sure that there you go

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.170 
going to make sure that there you go

Megan sharp she's on rehab so let's see

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.490 
Megan sharp she's on rehab so let's see
one<00:06:24.360> who's<00:06:24.510> reflective<00:06:24.990> in<00:06:25.080> just<00:06:25.290> a<00:06:25.380> little

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
one who's reflective in just a little

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.650 
one who's reflective in just a little
bit<00:06:25.620> here<00:06:26.030> and<00:06:27.030> what<00:06:27.150> we're<00:06:27.270> doing<00:06:27.300> is<00:06:27.510> we're

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
bit here and what we're doing is we're

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
bit here and what we're doing is we're
getting<00:06:27.870> some<00:06:28.020> of<00:06:28.110> this<00:06:28.170> light<00:06:28.350> to<00:06:28.500> bounce

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
getting some of this light to bounce

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.130 
getting some of this light to bounce
back<00:06:29.040> to<00:06:29.370> fill<00:06:29.550> in<00:06:29.700> the<00:06:29.790> shadows<00:06:30.150> there<00:06:30.330> better

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
this is more like a side lighting here
