heat pump and one of the cool things
about<00:01:13.210> this<00:01:14.110> is<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.580> you<00:01:15.790> can<00:01:16.000> retrofit<00:01:16.420> it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
about this is that you can retrofit it

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.380 
about this is that you can retrofit it
to<00:01:17.380> an<00:01:17.710> existing<00:01:18.280> water<00:01:18.729> heater<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.270> we're

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
to an existing water heater and we're

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.160 
to an existing water heater and we're
going<00:01:19.509> to<00:01:19.540> do<00:01:19.689> that<00:01:19.840> today

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
going to do that today

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
let me show you I'm draining this water

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.859 
let me show you I'm draining this water
heater<00:01:23.079> right<00:01:23.380> now<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.240> we<00:01:25.270> can<00:01:25.479> retrofit

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
heater right now so that we can retrofit

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.819 
heater right now so that we can retrofit
that<00:01:26.229> geyser<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:27.460> this<00:01:27.700> really<00:01:28.630> nice<00:01:28.829> Marathon

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
that geyser to this really nice Marathon

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.530 
that geyser to this really nice Marathon
water<00:01:30.130> heater<00:01:30.369> but<00:01:30.759> it's<00:01:30.909> electric<00:01:31.299> and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
water heater but it's electric and

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.810 
water heater but it's electric and
that's<00:01:32.200> a<00:01:32.320> no-no<00:01:32.500> putting<00:01:33.070> this<00:01:33.220> system<00:01:33.610> on

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
that's a no-no putting this system on

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.270 
that's a no-no putting this system on
your<00:01:34.090> solar<00:01:34.360> backup<00:01:34.930> battery<00:01:35.560> backup<00:01:35.920> system

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
your solar backup battery backup system

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.910 
your solar backup battery backup system
so<00:01:36.460> what<00:01:36.610> do<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.729> do<00:01:36.880> well<00:01:37.840> with<00:01:38.140> in<00:01:38.320> with<00:01:38.740> the

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
so what do you do well with in with the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.980 
so what do you do well with in with the
geyser<00:01:39.189> you<00:01:39.729> can<00:01:39.909> retrofit<00:01:40.299> it<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.780> it'll<00:01:40.930> be

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
geyser you can retrofit it and it'll be

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.840 
geyser you can retrofit it and it'll be
sitting<00:01:41.380> here<00:01:41.710> when<00:01:42.340> it's<00:01:42.490> done<00:01:42.640> I'll<00:01:42.820> show

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
sitting here when it's done I'll show

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
sitting here when it's done I'll show
you<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.680> can<00:01:44.860> heat<00:01:45.159> your<00:01:45.430> water

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
you that we you can heat your water

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.130 
you that we you can heat your water
using<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.409> heat<00:01:47.619> pump<00:01:47.890> technology<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.689> we're

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
using a heat pump technology and we're

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.190 
using a heat pump technology and we're
gonna<00:01:50.229> actually<00:01:50.469> plug<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.219> into<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.729> regular

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
gonna actually plug it into a regular

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.969 
gonna actually plug it into a regular
110<00:01:53.549> receptacle<00:01:54.549> so<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:56.229> is<00:01:56.500> about<00:01:56.740> three

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
110 receptacle so it is about three

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.969 
110 receptacle so it is about three
hundred<00:01:57.219> percent<00:01:57.310> more<00:01:57.700> efficient<00:01:58.299> than

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
hundred percent more efficient than

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.590 
hundred percent more efficient than
electric<00:01:59.979> water<00:02:00.130> heater<00:02:00.430> but<00:02:01.090> it's<00:02:01.299> not<00:02:01.450> as

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
electric water heater but it's not as

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.149 
electric water heater but it's not as
fast<00:02:01.899> so<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.439> have<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.710> wait<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.890> little<00:02:03.039> bit

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
fast so you have to wait a little bit

is<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> must<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.700> putting<00:02:20.599> in<00:02:20.689> a<00:02:20.749> solar<00:02:21.019> hot

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
is a must and putting in a solar hot

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.750 
is a must and putting in a solar hot
water<00:02:21.349> heating<00:02:21.769> system<00:02:22.219> can<00:02:22.370> cost<00:02:22.609> you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
water heating system can cost you

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.119 
water heating system can cost you
anywhere<00:02:22.790> from<00:02:23.239> seven<00:02:24.019> to<00:02:24.049> fourteen<00:02:24.590> thousand

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
anywhere from seven to fourteen thousand

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.940 
anywhere from seven to fourteen thousand
dollars<00:02:25.510> lots<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.629> copper<00:02:27.049> very<00:02:27.230> expensive<00:02:27.739> so

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
dollars lots of copper very expensive so

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.399 
dollars lots of copper very expensive so
we<00:02:28.129> just<00:02:28.310> put<00:02:28.459> enough<00:02:28.670> PV<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.420> roof<00:02:29.689> solar

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
we just put enough PV on the roof solar

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.069 
we just put enough PV on the roof solar
to<00:02:30.799> offset<00:02:31.219> the<00:02:32.120> power<00:02:32.359> that<00:02:32.659> this<00:02:32.870> little

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
to offset the power that this little

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.199 
to offset the power that this little
baby<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.530> gonna<00:02:33.680> going<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.310> use<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:35.060> other

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.789 
baby is gonna going to use the other
cool<00:02:35.599> I<00:02:35.870> think<00:02:35.989> it's<00:02:36.230> awesome

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
cool I think it's awesome

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.360 
cool I think it's awesome
side<00:02:37.489> benefit<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.379> because<00:02:39.379> it<00:02:39.889> is<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.069> heat

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
side benefit is because it is a heat

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.030 
side benefit is because it is a heat
pump<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:41.750> will<00:02:41.959> also<00:02:42.469> D<00:02:42.919> humidify<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:45.230> area<00:02:45.829> in

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
pump it will also D humidify the area in

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.830 
pump it will also D humidify the area in
which<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.639> set<00:02:46.879> so<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.299> mechanical

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
you that one of the coolest benefits is

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.800 
you that one of the coolest benefits is
that<00:03:08.299> this<00:03:08.569> room<00:03:08.930> will<00:03:09.379> be<00:03:09.560> temperature

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
that this room will be temperature

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.670 
that this room will be temperature
climate-controlled<00:03:11.810> because<00:03:12.349> of<00:03:12.590> the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
climate-controlled because of the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.470 
climate-controlled because of the
process<00:03:13.129> of<00:03:13.250> making<00:03:13.430> hot<00:03:13.730> water<00:03:13.969> so<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.299> get<00:03:14.449> a

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
process of making hot water so you get a

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.569 
process of making hot water so you get a
two<00:03:14.659> for<00:03:14.689> one<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.139> get<00:03:15.260> hot<00:03:15.469> water<00:03:15.650> in<00:03:16.010> a

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
two for one you get hot water in a

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.759 
two for one you get hot water in a
climate-controlled<00:03:17.060> room<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:18.290> store<00:03:18.560> your

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
climate-controlled room to store your

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.069 
climate-controlled room to store your
food<00:03:19.009> in<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.489> so<00:03:20.479> I<00:03:20.509> think<00:03:20.599> that's<00:03:20.870> just

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
food in and so I think that's just
