no<00:00:50.520> growth<00:00:50.930> above<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.140> soil<00:00:52.760> like<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.879> said

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
no growth above the soil like I said

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.430 
no growth above the soil like I said
before<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.570> takes<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.870> really<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.110> long

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
before it takes a really really long

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.990 
before it takes a really really long
time<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> last<00:00:56.100> time<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> grew<00:00:56.610> these<00:00:56.760> from

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
time the last time I grew these from

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.819 
time the last time I grew these from
from<00:00:57.600> leaf<00:00:57.780> cuttings<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.350> took<00:00:58.469> about<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.739> year

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
from leaf cuttings it took about a year

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.180 
from leaf cuttings it took about a year
for<00:00:59.250> them<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.120> start<00:01:00.359> showing<00:01:01.070> showing<00:01:02.070> any

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
for them to start showing showing any

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.179 
for them to start showing showing any
signs<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.670> life<00:01:04.129> let<00:01:05.129> me<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:07.189> take

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
signs of life let me see if I can take

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.590 
signs of life let me see if I can take
away<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.640> clump<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.299> dirt<00:01:11.270> no<00:01:12.270> there's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
away this clump of dirt no there's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.810 
away this clump of dirt no there's
nothing<00:01:12.960> down<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.770> thought<00:01:14.610> maybe

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
nothing down in there I thought maybe

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.420 
nothing down in there I thought maybe
there<00:01:15.090> would<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.710> little<00:01:16.710> sprout<00:01:17.009> starting

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
there would be a little sprout starting

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.719 
there would be a little sprout starting
but<00:01:18.030> nope<00:01:18.630> anyway<00:01:19.500> stay<00:01:19.799> patient<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.430> long<00:01:20.610> as

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
but nope anyway stay patient as long as

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.260 
but nope anyway stay patient as long as
they<00:01:20.790> stay<00:01:21.000> green<00:01:21.259> there<00:01:22.259> they're<00:01:22.950> still<00:01:23.270> good

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
they stay green there they're still good

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.810 
they stay green there they're still good
and<00:01:24.450> viable<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:26.070> give<00:01:26.220> them<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> little<00:01:26.520> tug

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and viable and give them a little tug

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.760 
and viable and give them a little tug
from<00:01:27.030> time<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> time<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> make<00:01:28.590> sure

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
from time to time just to make sure

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.620 
from time to time just to make sure
because<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.820> never<00:01:29.939> know<00:01:30.150> they<00:01:30.360> might<00:01:30.509> have

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
because you never know they might have

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.069 
because you never know they might have
rotted<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.380> yeah<00:01:32.250> they<00:01:32.460> need<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.790> kept

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
rotted out but yeah they need to be kept

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.280 
rotted out but yeah they need to be kept
evenly<00:01:34.079> moist<00:01:34.320> not<00:01:34.770> soaking<00:01:35.280> wet<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:36.420> put<00:01:37.079> mine

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
evenly moist not soaking wet I put mine

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.859 
evenly moist not soaking wet I put mine
in<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.619> little<00:01:38.220> greenhouse<00:01:38.610> thing<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.180> you

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
in this little greenhouse thing as you

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.420 
in this little greenhouse thing as you
can<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.619> leaves<00:01:40.799> are<00:01:41.009> discolored

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
can see the the leaves are discolored

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.830 
can see the the leaves are discolored
because<00:01:41.579> sometimes<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> humidity<00:01:42.630> gets<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
because sometimes the humidity gets a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080 
because sometimes the humidity gets a
little<00:01:42.960> bit<00:01:43.140> too<00:01:43.259> high<00:01:43.439> for<00:01:43.710> them<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:44.759> you

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
little bit too high for them but if you

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.499 
little bit too high for them but if you
keep<00:01:45.299> them<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.479> something<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.310> I

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
keep them in something like this I

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.760 
keep them in something like this I
usually<00:01:48.509> leave<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.840> open<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.409> little<00:01:49.619> bit

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
usually leave it open just a little bit

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.990 
usually leave it open just a little bit
and<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:51.689> stays<00:01:52.229> moist<00:01:52.590> more<00:01:53.220> moist<00:01:53.460> longer

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and it stays moist more moist longer

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.160 
and it stays moist more moist longer
because<00:01:54.540> when<00:01:54.659> you're<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:54.930> you're<00:01:54.960> dealing

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
because when you're when you're dealing

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.450 
because when you're when you're dealing
with<00:01:55.350> something<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.710> takes<00:01:56.009> about<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.399> year

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
with something that takes about a year

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.380 
with something that takes about a year
to<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:56.969> anything<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:58.460> produce<00:01:59.460> growth<00:01:59.820> you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
to do anything to produce growth you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.730 
to do anything to produce growth you
probably<00:02:00.719> will<00:02:00.899> forget<00:02:01.200> about<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.560> within

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
probably will forget about it within

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.889 
probably will forget about it within
within<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.399> first<00:02:02.579> six<00:02:02.790> months<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.719> if<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
within the first six months so if you

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.030 
within the first six months so if you
got<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.229> something<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.950> can

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
got it in something like this you can

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.069 
got it in something like this you can
walk<00:02:05.250> away<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.030> come<00:02:06.479> back<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
walk away and and come back to it a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.260 
walk away and and come back to it a
month<00:02:07.290> later<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.740> say<00:02:07.950> oh<00:02:08.160> oh<00:02:08.489> oh<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.789> forgot

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
month later and say oh oh oh I forgot

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.490 
month later and say oh oh oh I forgot
about<00:02:09.390> this

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
about this

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.960 
about this
but<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:10.979> still

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
but it's still
