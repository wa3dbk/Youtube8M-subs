00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.549
 you imagine icon 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.929
 I had luck on our website 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.929
 min in the favorite section some sellers 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.830
 In this video tutorial we will learn how to place an icon in the menu 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:23.619
 favorites 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.580
 so that when someone dies the page their favorites are seen on the page 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.689
 with the icon we want instead of the internet explorer icon 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.050
 stopped in Navarre let's see a little clearer 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.800
 let's see the icon here on top of the relay ue 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.210
 delage should 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.400
 come on add this page do not be favorites 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.400
 add and when we open the favorites tab 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.830
 that the icon 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.830
 remains in this case the jec 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.810
 another example we can see in the videos page about 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.100
 the logotype 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.720
 of the two arrows squared 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.920
 if we add 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.280
 to favorites 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.640
 we see here also the image is a very simple aspect but it has a serious 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.890
 inconvenience does not work with all versions of browsers an icon 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.070
 It is an image file 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.490
 in that they have the point function ico the usual graphics editors do not 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.990
 they work with this format so the use of a tool is required 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.140
 special to grow and treatment of the image that we are going to use as an icon 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.000
 to achieve its objective we have two possibilities with the first option 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.070
 we can assign an icon 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.400
 one page independently and the second one is about placing a 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.200
 icon 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.610
 everyone and awkward whole we go first 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.539
 howard ar 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.490
 the icon 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.180
 of the website and I was in controls 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.550
 for it 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.510
 we indicate the route 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.240
 where is this image we are located in ciudadella we press the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.240
 right button and save image as 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.350
 we keep on our site 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.000
 in the images folder and we will call it xavi with point ico saves 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.169
 we close browser 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.339
 we open the text editor 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:20.309
 let's talk an empty html document your body and let's place 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.769
 our own page we are going to insert a paragraph 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:36.439
 tenth recipes we already have an icon our page we were going to see where it 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.599
 insert an icon on a page 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.649
 it had to be 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:42.550
 in the header of the document 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.459
 not in the body 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.540
 therefore inside the header we write the following link 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.089
 the inc 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:59.889
 and here we insert the route where it is located I'm not with this case 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.059
 images / and the name of the file 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.039
 javi with 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.669
 we close that label 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.669
 let's save the image 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.319
 we go 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.289
 open not that site folder we open our goat html 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.350
 we'll go 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.309
 the semicolon image 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:24.730
 that we already have it 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.730
 next to the or the relay of our file 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.329
 this way we have placed an icon not specified 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.299
 on a page on our site but what would happen if we wanted to introduce 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.659
 estic onu 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.139
 all the pages of our site not only in one 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.989
 what we would have to do would be to open the folder of our site 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:48.959
 oscar lara image 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.549
 javi com semicolon 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.699
 copy it 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.719
 and paste it into the directory 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.839
 principal 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:01.199
 we must bear in mind that we do not have in our computers a 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.079
 server 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.879
 created therefore 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.049
 in local 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.409
 or this effect will work for us, we must also take into account 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.049
 for example if we go 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.049
 to the page 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.819
 the dotcom cites 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.039
 offers 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.529
 accommodations 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:27.909
 be that we end up giving a page with a domain like this 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.889
 dotcom geocities / 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.809
 website 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.279
 then no 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.810
 we would be working on the root director 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.960
 but on the directory my website 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.479
 Thus 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.800
 neither would she work in that way 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.800
 coc 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.249
 with 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.579
 with
