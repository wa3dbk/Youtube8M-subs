00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:12.830
 Yes it is very much in the lullaby song round today of the carburetor of the Super Cub 50 Noah 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:18.080
 That Well this a little before I'd think you try to introduce a way of setting the adjustment 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.190
 I bought it in the second hand, but I was immediately stalled by waiting for that signal. 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.000
 The road to that est 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:30.900
 After a little take a look at the net I thought I wonder if does not fix it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.530
 It was written that something like a carburetor's idling adjustment could be fixed 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.770
 a I actually got pretty good when I tried it 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.180
 So I will try to introduce the method this time 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.440
 Well I also got that kind of bike 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:50.170
 I may say something a bit wrong because I'm a beginner 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:53.230
 Well, I will not try to make such a grudge to introduce the video introduced this time. 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.190
 If you are going to have a blog or something more detailed 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:00.170
 I think it would be better to try Gugu on the net for a moment 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.009
 Yes that 's the way of adjustment, but it's a share of 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:08.570
 Well here if you come around like this 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:10.880
 There is a small hole in the side of this side, but here in the back of this hole is something here 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.119
 There is a carburetor like this 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.829
 In this place on this and with this plus screw 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:22.009
 a There is a screw with a screw here, but this one has a longer air 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:28.700
 It seems that this negative screw called screw 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:29.509
 The right brain looks like a throttle stop screw with an idle adjustment screw 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.900
 Is it 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:38.130
 It's an adjustment volcano 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.940
 But it niece full Mars first to the right towards people here of negative here of minus 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.810
 I want 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:49.560
 First turn to the right until you can not turn until the emmer stops 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.890
 It seems to be about one and a half turns to the left after turning it all the way to the right 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.650
 Depending on the softening blog 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:00.909
 Hey that is bought with the softening return one rotation and 1/8 Toka softening one rotation and a half I 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.680
 It seems that it is a little different to say how many things you want to bring back depending on people 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:09.009
 But I want to 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.880
 Return one rotation and a half to the left from a place of not turning the far right to turn to go fury more 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.770
 a just seems to be nice 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.880
 Like has become something guideline is return one rotation and a half since the beginning of the most right I wonder if the proper value 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.170
 is 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.670
 Hey maa then I 'll run the engine once and tweak it 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:29.330
 Mostly I was in good condition as a version in one time 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:34.040
 Something like an engine or something like poppo at the beginning 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.870
 It was quite bad condition for some time when I just started the engine 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.470
 a 5 root canal version of turn 3 nor to the end 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.069
 I guess I turned it to the right and then turned it back one turn to the left 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.690
 It became a very good engine movement 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:55.799
 I 'm getting better , so here 's a screw on the right with this plus 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.890
 It is possible to rotational speed adjustment where the engine at idle next Once you have it at me adjusted to some extent 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:02.440
 Adjust this 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:05.440
 To the left that we will So in will raise the number of revolutions of the engine at the time of mouse and idle on the right side and 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.420
 Speed decreases by turning 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:16.330
 It's a picture so it's too bad to turn it to the left too much, but it's no use 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.880
 It will continue to reduce the number of revolutions to the extent that it does not air engine stall over the engine 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.410
 Ma Marina 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:27.940
 I will not stop too much because it will stop immediately at the signal waiting etc when it turns that down 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:31.540
 Slowly turn to the left slowly to the extent and say and adjust 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:35.020
 If you say you're going to stop soon, or if it's a little upset, it's just a bit 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.800
 Turn to the right to increase the idle speed 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.800
 Well I will not stop the engine waiting for traffic lights 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:47.470
 So what a child's setting is just one shot 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.960
 Easily the bad guys' s I a I guess over here on the left side of the adjustment and the right of adjusting the way many times repeated 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.510
 While 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:58.760
 Saying just the right place condition often can run so it is a little day-building to 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:02.930
 I here first, when the theme is just like a stop at good Well briefly summarized 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:07.950
 Turn the left screw down all the way to the right 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:12.360
 And back about one and a half turns so it fits a little bit 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:20.310
 It's like I'm fine-tuned, so here's the engine 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:26.280
 Oh yeah slowly slowly yeah back to the left and say at the number of rotations that you do not est 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.150
 Adjust to the company Mashi this right I think the key in maintaining the number of revolutions of the extent that it does not stall even Toka 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.940
 Tatoh 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.920
 When it is stopped 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.910
 Be careful not to turn too much to the right, because the engine is so noisy 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.010
 I need it 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:42.370
 And engine stall in the signal waiting by successfully adjusting the Ekoko I mean that Well Well 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:47.350
 Seems to be able to prevent 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.960
 It 's kind of like that, but I could hardly explain it. 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.330
 but 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:58.669
 Well when you search stock signal waiting entost with net, that quite 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.380
 There are many ways to adjust the carburetor, so if you look at that , you will 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.430
 I think I do not understand 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:07.729
 I think that there Toka that description quite wrong part Toka little funny part of me 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.950
 But please understand that a little breath is that newbie 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.220
 That 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.430
 Once Well try it a little fiddling as I said that earlier 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:19.800
 a The engine is suddenly stopped by waiting for a signal 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:25.020
 Or what is the number of revolutions of the after something idle hemorrhoids it over over I started something engine is a low number of revolutions 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.940
 Stop is likely the middle or strange sound began around anymore do you or I inexpensive Poppo like a did you 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.940
 I was repeating something like 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.350
 Anoa in 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.360
 Once I adjusted it, I started to rotate properly from the moment I started playing it 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:39.729
 It sounds like a nice sound 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:44.289
 Every so often Toka Na stalls in the fact that now the Well that also come from your wait 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:48.189
 The reason why the engine seems to stop well after running the engine 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.599
 I hope to try the adjustment of that carburetor in the case of say I wish or start moving 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:54.380
 I think it is not 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:06:00.170
 Description I so kinda again saying you have but that after all that sumi painting dentist 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:02.660
 I think it's going to be funny, so if you're actually trying it that way I 'll go online and search 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:06.620
 Search for and try 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:12.860
 There I'm sorry but I forgot earlier of little means the adjustment of that carburetor 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:14.370
 If you do not adjust after warming up the engine after sufficient warm-up operation when 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.840
 So supplement 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:22.790
 And leave plus wear and then you place the last to put a little engine One 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.790
 I'll show you and finish 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:30.630
 Hey this is not like this 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.980
 It takes at a stroke properly 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.980
 Tone of Emaen tea is also good 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:43.570
 Something I'd also feel called Well wonder if a nice little that set the rotational speed to increase quality 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.160
 If you lower it further 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:50.830
 Anyway Well now I feel in Anonan Kasugu I think I'll be engine stall nano 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:55.830
 I think I will ride for a while 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.830
 I 'm sorry that the road was a little longer so then I 'm bye bye
