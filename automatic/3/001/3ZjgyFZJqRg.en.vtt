00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.050
 but tell me what supplement you recommend 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.119
 for the runners I imagine that what 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.220
 more suffer they are the joints 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.890
 for that impact not constant act 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.110
 imagine that the race is a sport 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.820
 of impact where our foot is going to step 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.379
 and we are going to transfer that impact to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.870
 knees are going to be areas that are going to 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.610
 suffer a lot and also good 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.230
 very long distances many hours of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.379
 training many hours of career 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.720
 let's introduce them animal flex is a 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.199
 cartilage protector we have it for 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.899
 here and it's made on good basis of 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.660
 shark cartilage also carries 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.390
 turmeric ginger substances that avoid 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.250
 inflammation of the joints 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.110
 also has control and tim sulfate 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.369
 Glucosamine is not given and I'm sure I'll 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.880
 say sure you've ever seen 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.090
 a joint maybe not a 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.090
 shark 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.330
 Well, the joints are going to be 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.520
 the joints of two bones but 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.160
 imagine that if we take two bones two 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.480
 chicken bones not if we hit them one 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.390
 against another 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.610
 They are areas that are good and are not soft and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.140
 that are going to produce almost damage and moles 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.730
 our a little unpleasant that 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.940
 feel then the joints 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.650
 they are covered with a film of a 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.140
 cartilage that favors the 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.630
 displacement of the joints be 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.360
 soft that there is no friction that are 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.360
 well lubricated so that the movement 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.140
 Do not be painful and do not be annoying when 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.330
 we practice long or long sports 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.260
 duration and high impact as the case of 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.510
 the race 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.470
 that cartilage is lost is going 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.390
 wearing 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.100
 we need to protect it because once 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.229
 that is lost is quite difficult to 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.850
 get it back then the first thing we have 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.610
 what to do is protect it before 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.740
 the damage happens let's start giving it to 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.020
 our cartilages to give to our 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.959
 joints the food they need 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.290
 to try that we do not occur 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.020
 that damage or that this product protects 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.880
 of inflammation and also protects 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.070
 the psoe the cartilage somehow 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.930
 will also help the joint 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.750
 is more lubricated that generates that 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.910
 lubricating liquid that rubs us that does not 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.970
 bother you imagine you were 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.970
 playing all the time bone against good 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.120
 if I'm still with him 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.950
 a basis that is done you commented 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.050
 before between your ingredients will have 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.820
 natural substances such as turmeric 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.250
 the ginger we'll talk about them in 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.710
 some program that especially what they go 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.110
 to do is reduce inflammation avoid 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.180
 that occurs and reduce it and on the other 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.450
 side we had the shark cartilage 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.100
 that is going to be gelatinous substance for 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.980
 say it in some way that will help 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.080
 to that that membrane of the 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.640
 joint is regenerated and that is not 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.800
 most important wear that is not 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.110
 wear before it degenerates and in addition 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.450
 has other substances like vitamins 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.820
 including vitamin a vitamin c 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.920
 the vitamin d that also favor the 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.870
 assimilation of nutrients and 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.640
 favor proper maintenance of 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.080
 the perfect joints and how 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.300
 we must take it 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.090
 in this case animal flex well in 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.190
 sachets comes in monodose is not so 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.980
 we just have to take one of the envelopes 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.630
 a day on an empty stomach important 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.640
 and in this case so that we have a 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.590
 good assimilation of the product that does not 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.330
 we have eaten before the more empty 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.040
 up to the stomach much better we're going to 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.520
 assimilate and much better now we can 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.020
 make him lift on an empty stomach 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.020
 many thanks to huca we take note 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.550
 of all these tips and you 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.020
 also note all those who 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.880
 participate in the race are those 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.860
 you just like to run because there 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.230
 to prevent and protect always in 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.820
 any sport where to find anima 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.900
 flex or any other product in my 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.900
