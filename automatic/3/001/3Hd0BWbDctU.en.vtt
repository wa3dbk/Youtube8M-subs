meijer<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.629> grew<00:00:42.809> up<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.350> era<00:00:43.559> where

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
meijer you grew up with an era where

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.340 
meijer you grew up with an era where
there<00:00:43.980> were<00:00:44.100> cameras<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:45.329> had<00:00:45.510> handles

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
there were cameras and they had handles

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
there were cameras and they had handles
and<00:00:46.620> buttons<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.370> different<00:00:47.760> things<00:00:47.789> that

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
were very physical and not virtual and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.970 
were very physical and not virtual and
so<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.110> actually<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
of a it's kind of an interesting angle
so<00:01:52.350> whatever<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:52.860> don't<00:01:53.399> force<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
so whatever you do don't force it and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.940 
so whatever you do don't force it and
I'm<00:01:54.540> always<00:01:54.659> very<00:01:54.780> careful<00:01:55.140> about<00:01:55.439> how<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
I'm always very careful about how I

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.969 
I'm always very careful about how I
connect<00:01:56.460> things<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.360> my<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:58.469> my<00:01:58.500> iPhone

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
connect things to my to my iPhone

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.179 
connect things to my to my iPhone
because<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> don't<00:01:59.729> want<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.390> don't<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.560> you

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
because I don't want I don't want to you

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.679 
because I don't want I don't want to you
know<00:02:02.280> damage<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.850> connector<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.630> it

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
know damage the connector so that it

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.469 
know damage the connector so that it
won't<00:02:03.780> charge<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.799> there<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.610> go<00:02:05.640> we've<00:02:06.180> got<00:02:06.210> it

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
up pretty well and it'll hold up with

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.100 
up pretty well and it'll hold up with
your<00:02:11.069> wrist<00:02:11.280> core
