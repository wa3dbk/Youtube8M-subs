hey<00:00:00.510> guys<00:00:00.719> in<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.020> video<00:00:01.260> we're<00:00:01.589> going<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.740> be

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
hey guys in this video we're going to be

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.370 
hey guys in this video we're going to be
doing<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.429> macbook<00:00:03.000> air<00:00:03.210> verse<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.959> retina

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
doing a macbook air verse the retina

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.920 
doing a macbook air verse the retina
MacBook<00:00:04.890> Pro<00:00:05.250> we're<00:00:06.060> basically<00:00:06.390> going<00:00:06.779> to

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
MacBook Pro we're basically going to

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.600 
MacBook Pro we're basically going to
just<00:00:07.259> compare<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.770> design<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.099> these<00:00:08.309> things

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
just compare the design of these things

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.089 
just compare the design of these things
because<00:00:08.849> there's<00:00:09.030> no<00:00:09.179> point<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:10.099> comparing

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
because there's no point of comparing

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.499 
because there's no point of comparing
the<00:00:11.190> specs<00:00:11.460> because<00:00:11.849> they<00:00:11.969> are<00:00:12.120> different

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
the specs because they are different

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.030 
the specs because they are different
models<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:12.929> let's<00:00:13.110> go<00:00:13.230> ahead<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.440> jump<00:00:13.860> right

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
models so let's go ahead and jump right

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.490 
models so let's go ahead and jump right
into<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.599> right<00:00:15.780> off<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.960> bat<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.350> can

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
into it so right off the bat you can

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.960 
into it so right off the bat you can
tell<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> macbook<00:00:17.369> air<00:00:17.550> has<00:00:17.760> that

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
tell that the macbook air has that

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.970 
tell that the macbook air has that
aluminum<00:00:18.539> finish<00:00:18.779> around<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.320> entire<00:00:19.590> screen

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
aluminum finish around the entire screen

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.650 
aluminum finish around the entire screen
whereas<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.820> macbook<00:00:21.210> pro<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:21.600> retina

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
whereas the macbook pro with retina

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.900 
whereas the macbook pro with retina
display<00:00:22.050> has<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.830> black<00:00:23.010> finish<00:00:23.460> around<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
display has the black finish around the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.300 
display has the black finish around the
entire<00:00:24.150> screen<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:25.680> biggest<00:00:26.010> difference

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
entire screen the biggest difference

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.220 
entire screen the biggest difference
between<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.760> computers<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.750> thinnest

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
between the computers is the thinnest

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.189 
between the computers is the thinnest
and<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> 13-inch<00:00:28.920> macbook<00:00:29.519> air<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.760> 0.1<00:00:30.750> 12

1800 and there's also 220 pixels per
inch<00:01:22.400> here's<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.490> look<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> computers

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
inch here's a look at what the computers

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.480 
inch here's a look at what the computers
look<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.020> side<00:01:25.320> by<00:01:25.350> side<00:01:25.799> let's<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.430> ahead

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
look like side by side let's go ahead

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.399 
look like side by side let's go ahead
and<00:01:26.610> take<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.909> deeper<00:01:27.360> look<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> keyboards

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and take a deeper look at the keyboards

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.740 
and take a deeper look at the keyboards
on<00:01:28.560> both<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.860> these<00:01:29.130> devices<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.240> basically

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
on both of these devices so basically

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.179 
on both of these devices so basically
they<00:01:30.960> mimic<00:01:31.320> each<00:01:31.409> other<00:01:31.680> or<00:01:31.920> they're<00:01:32.040> almost

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
they mimic each other or they're almost

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
they mimic each other or they're almost
exactly<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> same<00:01:32.970> they're<00:01:33.509> both<00:01:33.659> full-size

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
exactly the same they're both full-size

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.050 
exactly the same they're both full-size
keyboard<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.950> they're<00:01:35.310> very<00:01:35.340> nice<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.880> type

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
keyboard and they're very nice to type

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.260 
keyboard and they're very nice to type
on<00:01:37.189> alright<00:01:38.189> guys<00:01:38.369> that's<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> wrap<00:01:39.030> up

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
on alright guys that's going to wrap up

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.660 
on alright guys that's going to wrap up
this<00:01:39.600> design<00:01:40.200> comparison<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.640> fun

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this design comparison but just for fun

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.910 
this design comparison but just for fun
we're<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> restart<00:01:42.930> test<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.740> see

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
we're going to do a restart test to see

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.039 
we're going to do a restart test to see
which<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.310> these<00:01:44.549> SSDs<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.659> computers

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
which of these SSDs and the computers

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.719 
which of these SSDs and the computers
are<00:01:46.200> faster<00:01:46.680> since<00:01:46.860> they<00:01:47.009> both<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.399> flash

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
are faster since they both have flash

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.609 
are faster since they both have flash
storage<00:01:48.060> let's<00:01:48.570> go<00:01:48.689> ahead<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.020> which<00:01:49.350> one

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
storage let's go ahead and see which one

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.830 
storage let's go ahead and see which one
