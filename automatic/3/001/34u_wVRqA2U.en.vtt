here really that medical advances people

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.220 
here really that medical advances people
living<00:00:40.800> longer<00:00:41.250> are<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.790> leading<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
living longer are now leading to the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.950 
living longer are now leading to the
scarcity<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.309> these<00:00:44.460> resources<00:00:45.239> farming

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960

stable supply so there's this shortage
of<00:00:59.940> domestic<00:01:00.449> milk<00:01:00.809> production<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.190> now

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
of domestic milk production and so now

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
of domestic milk production and so now
all<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.940> efforts<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.600> into<00:01:03.960> available

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
all the efforts are going into available

they had to ration butter in the run-up

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.160 
they had to ration butter in the run-up
to<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.950> Christmas<00:01:14.400> baking<00:01:14.939> season<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.630> you

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
to the Christmas baking season so you

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.240 
to the Christmas baking season so you
know<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.409> getting<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.920> pretty<00:01:17.159> scary

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
know it's getting to be a pretty scary

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.980 
know it's getting to be a pretty scary
thing<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> resource<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.570> running<00:01:18.840> out

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
thing that the resource is running out

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.200 
thing that the resource is running out
because<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.439> our<00:01:19.560> aging<00:01:20.040> populations<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.880> think

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
because of our aging populations I think

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.760 
because of our aging populations I think
it<00:01:21.360> goes<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.990> show<00:01:22.020> something<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.560> we're

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it goes to show something that we're

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.230 
it goes to show something that we're
gonna<00:01:22.950> start<00:01:23.250> seeing<00:01:23.400> more<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.850> more<00:01:23.939> all

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
country that that itself did say you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.520 
country that that itself did say you
used<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> top<00:01:33.990> powers<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
world and still they face this shortage

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.460 
world and still they face this shortage
of<00:01:37.829> food<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.729> feed<00:01:39.509> their<00:01:39.720> population<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.290> why

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
of food to feed their population and why

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
of food to feed their population and why
because<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:40.920> keep<00:01:41.100> there's<00:01:41.640> more<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.060> more

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
because we keep there's more and more

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.270 
because we keep there's more and more
and<00:01:42.360> more<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.899> us<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.470> are<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:43.979> planning

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and more of us and we are not planning

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.929 
and more of us and we are not planning
ahead<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.970> again<00:01:46.520> we<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> take

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
ahead and again we have to take

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.580 
ahead and again we have to take
priorities<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.930> there's<00:01:49.290> nothing

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
priorities I think that there's nothing

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.050 
priorities I think that there's nothing
they<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.100> leave<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.850> choose

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
they can do leave you have to choose

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.999 
they can do leave you have to choose
between<00:01:51.240> butter<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.869> milk<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
between butter and milk you have to

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.760 
between butter and milk you have to
choose<00:01:53.220> milk<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.759> know<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.600> kids<00:01:54.930> rely

choose milk you know that the kids rely

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.289 
choose milk you know that the kids rely
on<00:01:55.799> milk<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.310> much<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.610> than<00:01:56.759> butter<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
on milk so much more than butter and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.539 
on milk so much more than butter and
butter<00:01:57.869> at<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.409> end<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.250> not<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
butter at the end of it it's not that

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.149

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
important is butter anyway you know we

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.889 
important is butter anyway you know we
did<00:02:03.960> talk<00:02:04.200> here<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.649> lip<00:02:04.860> TV<00:02:05.219> about<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.329> shortage

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
did talk here on lip TV about a shortage

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.770 
did talk here on lip TV about a shortage
of<00:02:07.140> cocoa<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.220> world<00:02:08.459> we<00:02:09.360> came<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
of cocoa in the world we came to the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.420 
of cocoa in the world we came to the
conclusion<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.319> although<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:11.099> would<00:02:11.190> cry

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
conclusion that although we would cry

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.670 
conclusion that although we would cry
about<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:11.970> may<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.239> able<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.599> live<00:02:12.810> without

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
about it we may be able to live without

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.740 
about it we may be able to live without
but<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.520> know<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.730> does<00:02:14.910> seem<00:02:15.210> more<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.660> a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
but you know it does seem more of a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.470 
but you know it does seem more of a
fundamental<00:02:16.530> part<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.800> our<00:02:16.890> diet<00:02:17.220> though<00:02:17.580> it's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
fundamental part of our diet though it's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.750 
fundamental part of our diet though it's
not<00:02:18.600> just<00:02:18.930> about<00:02:19.080> baking<00:02:19.590> cakes<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:20.370> used<00:02:20.610> in

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
not just about baking cakes it's used in

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.700 
not just about baking cakes it's used in
so<00:02:20.910> many<00:02:21.090> applications<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.260> know<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.530> can

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
so many applications but you know we can

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.900 
so many applications but you know we can
use<00:02:22.860> oils<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.340> other<00:02:23.400> things<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:23.760> this

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
use oils and other things like this

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.550 
use oils and other things like this
around<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.330> it's<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.080> very<00:02:25.260> horrible

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
around it it's just a very horrible

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.140 
around it it's just a very horrible
nasty<00:02:26.070> thought<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.460> think<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.850> some<00:02:27.060> of

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
nasty thought to think that some of

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.640 
nasty thought to think that some of
these<00:02:27.210> things<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.570> we<00:02:27.720> really<00:02:28.020> take<00:02:28.440> for

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
these things that we really take for

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.980 
these things that we really take for

that has happened now partly this is due

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.030
