00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
happened and we thought four years later

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.889 
happened and we thought four years later
metric<00:01:58.860> fine<00:01:59.430> metrics<00:02:00.060> are<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.420> taught<00:02:00.719> in

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
schools in 1974 and then for some reason

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.569 
schools in 1974 and then for some reason
politicians<00:02:04.530> started<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.009> wobble

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
politicians started to wobble

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.479 
politicians started to wobble
but<00:02:05.820> then<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.450> started<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.990> do<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> mean<00:02:07.489> how

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
but then we started to do I mean how

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.740 
but then we started to do I mean how

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
how much what the liter 70 I think

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.540 
how much what the liter 70 I think
exactly<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.410> we're<00:02:17.560> halfway<00:02:17.860> there<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.370> don't

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
in bottles in in metric so how can you

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.820 
in bottles in in metric so how can you
sort<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.570> if<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.720> really<00:02:38.050> asked<00:02:38.290> watching<00:02:38.740> the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
sort of if you really asked watching the

sort of if you really asked watching the
prices<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:40.270> this<00:02:40.570> sort<00:02:40.720> of

prices on the and this sort of
evaluation<00:02:41.110> how<00:02:41.350> can<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.620> work<00:02:41.800> out<00:02:42.040> what's

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
evaluation how can you work out what's

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.520 
evaluation how can you work out what's
better<00:02:42.550> value<00:02:42.910> than<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.180> other<00:02:43.330> but<00:02:44.320> you<00:02:44.440> know

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
better value than the other but you know

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.110 
better value than the other but you know
we<00:02:44.680> do<00:02:44.860> have<00:02:45.070> this<00:02:45.220> crazy<00:02:45.520> half-and-half

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
we do have this crazy half-and-half

we do have this crazy half-and-half
system<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.260> country<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.160> is

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
system in this country and it is

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.040 
system in this country and it is
actually<00:02:48.700> not<00:02:49.330> only<00:02:49.480> causing<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> lot<00:02:50.020> of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050

it does seem so much easier to have

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.030 
it does seem so much easier to have
kilometres<00:03:58.540> yes<00:03:58.900> all<00:03:59.140> right<00:03:59.410> well<00:03:59.680> everything

kilometres yes all right well everything

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.440 
kilometres yes all right well everything
you<00:04:00.130> see<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.340> decimal<00:04:00.730> it's<00:04:00.940> tens<00:04:01.209> and

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
you see is decimal it's tens and

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.420 
you see is decimal it's tens and
hundreds<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:01.900> thousands<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:03.190> if<00:04:03.340> I

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
hundreds and thousands and and if I

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.340 
hundreds and thousands and and if I
could<00:04:03.610> get<00:04:03.910> back<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.360> the<00:04:04.540> sort<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:04.810> wobbly<00:04:05.230> bit

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
could get back to the sort of wobbly bit

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.620 
could get back to the sort of wobbly bit
as<00:04:05.470> I<00:04:05.560> said<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:05.860> 70s<00:04:06.370> we<00:04:07.120> were<00:04:07.270> going<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.540> go

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
as I said to the 70s we were going to go

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.790 
as I said to the 70s we were going to go
first<00:04:07.900> with<00:04:08.080> our<00:04:08.170> metric<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.709> the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
first with our metric and the

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.590 
first with our metric and the
Commonwealth<00:04:09.250> was<00:04:09.400> going<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.760> follow<00:04:09.940> they've

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
Commonwealth was going to follow they've

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.660 
Commonwealth was going to follow they've
actually<00:04:11.130> accelerated<00:04:12.130> they've<00:04:12.340> all<00:04:12.520> gone

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
actually accelerated they've all gone

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.550 
actually accelerated they've all gone
metric<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.720> mother<00:04:13.900> country's<00:04:14.290> hell<00:04:14.440> and

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
metric and the mother country's hell and

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.870 
metric and the mother country's hell and
so<00:04:14.740> some<00:04:14.950> people<00:04:15.070> say<00:04:15.310> well<00:04:15.459> go<00:04:15.610> the<00:04:15.730> whole<00:04:15.850> hog

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
so some people say well go the whole hog

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.160 
so some people say well go the whole hog
why<00:04:16.180> don't<00:04:16.330> we<00:04:16.390> change<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.840> side<00:04:17.020> of<00:04:17.109> the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
why don't we change to the side of the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.810 
why don't we change to the side of the
road<00:04:17.290> in<00:04:17.410> which<00:04:17.440> we<00:04:17.680> drive<00:04:17.950> our<00:04:18.400> cars

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
road in which we drive our cars
