dynamic<00:00:30.880> lighting<00:00:31.119> this<00:00:31.750> is<00:00:31.929> pretty<00:00:32.110> cool

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
dynamic lighting this is pretty cool

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.170 
dynamic lighting this is pretty cool
with<00:00:32.949> the<00:00:33.100> performance<00:00:33.489> of<00:00:33.580> kal-el<00:00:33.790> this<00:00:34.089> is

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
with the performance of kal-el this is

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.460 
with the performance of kal-el this is
the<00:00:34.269> first<00:00:34.510> time<00:00:34.690> this<00:00:34.870> is<00:00:35.019> really<00:00:35.170> feasible

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
the first time this is really feasible

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
on a mobile device now let's talk a

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.270 
on a mobile device now let's talk a
little<00:00:38.500> bit<00:00:38.650> about<00:00:38.800> what's<00:00:39.040> cool<00:00:39.250> about

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
little bit about what's cool about

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.860 
little bit about what's cool about
dynamic<00:00:39.820> lighting<00:00:40.030> first<00:00:40.510> you<00:00:40.659> can<00:00:40.780> adjust

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
dynamic lighting first you can adjust

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.990 
dynamic lighting first you can adjust
the<00:00:41.260> light<00:00:41.470> source<00:00:41.710> there<00:00:42.370> is<00:00:42.489> a<00:00:42.520> texture<00:00:42.940> on

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
the light source there is a texture on

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.340 
the light source there is a texture on
the<00:00:43.059> light<00:00:43.239> source<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.539> you<00:00:43.660> can<00:00:43.780> project<00:00:43.930> the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
the light source and you can project the

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.049 
the light source and you can project the
light<00:00:44.530> through<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:44.980> texture<00:00:45.460> onto<00:00:45.699> the

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
light through the texture onto the

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.330 
light through the texture onto the
objects<00:00:46.480> around<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:46.930> in<00:00:47.170> this<00:00:47.859> demo<00:00:48.070> you<00:00:48.219> can

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
objects around it in this demo you can

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.069 
objects around it in this demo you can
also<00:00:48.489> actually<00:00:48.760> change<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.539> light<00:00:49.690> source<00:00:49.870> so

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
also actually change the light source so

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.150 
also actually change the light source so
you<00:00:50.170> can<00:00:50.289> go<00:00:50.379> to<00:00:50.500> a<00:00:50.530> number<00:00:50.920> of<00:00:51.039> different

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
you can go to a number of different

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.830 
you can go to a number of different
balls<00:00:51.550> so<00:00:51.760> you<00:00:51.850> can<00:00:51.969> actually<00:00:52.090> see<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.629> light

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
balls so you can actually see the light

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.660 
balls so you can actually see the light
source<00:00:53.020> changing<00:00:53.649> and<00:00:53.800> everything<00:00:54.370> in<00:00:54.550> the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
source changing and everything in the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.439 
source changing and everything in the
scene<00:00:54.879> reacting<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.809> that<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.730> can<00:00:57.850> also<00:00:57.940> dim

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
scene reacting to that you can also dim

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.299 
scene reacting to that you can also dim
and<00:00:58.750> intensify<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.469> light<00:00:59.710> source<00:00:59.920> so<00:01:00.250> you

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
and intensify the light source so you

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.040 
and intensify the light source so you
can<00:01:00.489> see<00:01:00.640> more<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.059> projected<00:01:01.510> light<00:01:01.660> or

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
can see more of the projected light or

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.369 
can see more of the projected light or
less<00:01:02.530> of<00:01:02.679> it<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.910> in<00:01:04.149> a<00:01:04.239> nutshell<00:01:04.269> is<00:01:04.899> dynamic

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
less of it that in a nutshell is dynamic

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.290 
less of it that in a nutshell is dynamic
lighting<00:01:05.590> it<00:01:05.890> brings<00:01:06.160> more<00:01:06.369> life<00:01:06.640> in<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:07.060> sense

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
lighting it brings more life in a sense

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.180 
lighting it brings more life in a sense
of<00:01:07.390> interactivity<00:01:07.869> to<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.200> scene<00:01:08.470> when<00:01:09.039> your

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
of interactivity to a scene when your

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.570 
the bottom left-hand corner this is
pounding<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.810> four<00:01:44.050> cores<00:01:44.349> of<00:01:44.440> kal-el<00:01:44.739> drapes

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
pounding the four cores of kal-el drapes

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.160 
pounding the four cores of kal-el drapes
are<00:01:45.729> fully<00:01:45.940> simulated<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:46.660> as<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.929> ball<00:01:47.140> rolls

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
are fully simulated so as the ball rolls

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.710 
are fully simulated so as the ball rolls
through<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.130> drape<00:01:48.399> it<00:01:48.610> responds<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.539> way

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
through the drape it responds the way

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.710 
through the drape it responds the way
you<00:01:49.780> would<00:01:50.020> expect<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:51.119> fully<00:01:52.119> simulating

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
you would expect it to fully simulating

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.119 
you would expect it to fully simulating
the<00:01:52.780> collision<00:01:53.229> between<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:53.619> mesh<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:54.039> the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:54.129 
the collision between the mesh of the

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:57.150 
the collision between the mesh of the
drape<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.849> ball<00:01:55.349> you<00:01:56.349> can<00:01:56.470> also<00:01:56.590> see<00:01:56.890> the

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
drape and the ball you can also see the

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.729 
drape and the ball you can also see the
barrels<00:01:57.610> in<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:57.879> scene<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:59.289> barrels<00:01:59.619> are

00:01:59.729 --> 00:01:59.739 
barrels in the scene the barrels are

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:02.040 
barrels in the scene the barrels are
also<00:01:59.920> simulated<00:02:00.700> so<00:02:01.060> as<00:02:01.209> they<00:02:01.420> fall<00:02:01.690> those<00:02:01.959> are

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
also simulated so as they fall those are

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.809 
also simulated so as they fall those are
also<00:02:02.229> being<00:02:02.560> simulated<00:02:02.830> across<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.580> four

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
also being simulated across the four

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.529 
also being simulated across the four
cores<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.590> let's<00:02:05.890> try<00:02:06.099> it<00:02:06.160> on<00:02:06.280> two<00:02:06.550> cores<00:02:06.910> what

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
cores so let's try it on two cores what

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.089 
cores so let's try it on two cores what
we<00:02:07.629> can<00:02:07.750> do<00:02:07.810> in<00:02:07.899> this<00:02:07.989> demo<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.259> disabled<00:02:08.890> two

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
we can do in this demo is disabled two

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.369 
we can do in this demo is disabled two
of<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.310> cores<00:02:09.550> now<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.539> simulations<00:02:11.200> are

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
of the cores now the simulations are

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.320 
of the cores now the simulations are
happening<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:11.950> two<00:02:12.280> cores<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.879> you<00:02:13.000> can<00:02:13.180> see

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
happening on two cores and you can see

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.869 
happening on two cores and you can see
it<00:02:13.420> becomes<00:02:13.750> unplayable<00:02:14.379> very<00:02:15.310> low<00:02:15.550> frame

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
it becomes unplayable very low frame

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.430 
it becomes unplayable very low frame
rates<00:02:16.120> that's<00:02:16.569> your<00:02:16.840> experience<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.410> a

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
rates that's your experience on a

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.380 
rates that's your experience on a
dual-core

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
dual-core

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.309 
dual-core
now<00:02:19.020> let's<00:02:19.260> go<00:02:19.410> back<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.650> four<00:02:20.190> cores<00:02:21.319> smooth

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
now let's go back to four cores smooth

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.770 
now let's go back to four cores smooth
as<00:02:22.590> butter<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.490> exciting<00:02:23.970> thing<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.300> that

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
as butter the exciting thing is that

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.630 
as butter the exciting thing is that
this<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:24.930> pre-production<00:02:25.500> silicon<00:02:26.130> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
this is pre-production silicon the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.430 
this is pre-production silicon the
production<00:02:27.120> trip<00:02:27.360> will<00:02:27.600> be<00:02:27.720> twenty-five<00:02:28.290> to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
production trip will be twenty-five to

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.130 
production trip will be twenty-five to
thirty<00:02:28.650> percent<00:02:28.950> faster<00:02:29.250> than<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:30.140> now

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
thirty percent faster than this now

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.480 
thirty percent faster than this now
let's<00:02:31.319> have<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.500> little<00:02:31.650> fun<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.459> a

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
let's have a little fun this is a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.980 
let's have a little fun this is a

boxes as he bounced the ball into the
boxes<00:02:36.360> they<00:02:36.510> respond<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.140> mess<00:02:37.290> with<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.880> all

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
middle and if the box sends you over the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.240 
middle and if the box sends you over the
ledge<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.180> can<00:02:51.300> restart<00:02:51.690> as<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.020> just<00:02:52.200> saw<00:02:52.350> so

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
ledge you can restart as you just saw so

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.949 
ledge you can restart as you just saw so
once<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.610> hit<00:02:53.820> all<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.239> boxes<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> right

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
once you hit all the boxes in the right

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.199 
once you hit all the boxes in the right
order<00:02:55.200> it'll<00:02:56.190> put<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.430> back<00:02:56.700> hot<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
order it'll put you back hot in the

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.570 
order it'll put you back hot in the
middle<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.600> button<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.250> then<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.280> clown

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
middle of the button and then the clown

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.100 
middle of the button and then the clown
will<00:02:59.760> mess<00:02:59.940> with<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.269> now<00:03:00.600> it's<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.810> little<00:03:01.019> bit

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
will mess with you now it's a little bit

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.270 
will mess with you now it's a little bit
challenging<00:03:01.470> obviously<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.920> do<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.160> at

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
challenging obviously to do that at

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.009 
challenging obviously to do that at
first<00:03:02.430> because<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.940> game<00:03:03.180> after<00:03:03.630> all<00:03:03.810> so

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
first because it is a game after all so

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.690 
first because it is a game after all so
you<00:03:04.080> can<00:03:04.260> actually<00:03:04.410> go<00:03:04.680> around<00:03:05.010> you've<00:03:05.519> got

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
you can actually go around you've got

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.580 
you can actually go around you've got
barrels<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.180> interact<00:03:06.540> with<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.110> boxes

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
barrels to interact with you have boxes

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.740 
barrels to interact with you have boxes
you<00:03:07.800> have<00:03:07.920> drapes<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:09.180> lighting<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.660> the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
you have drapes the lighting in the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.320 
you have drapes the lighting in the
scene<00:03:10.100> it<00:03:11.100> sort<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.370> messes<00:03:11.760> with<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.060> as<00:03:12.180> you

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
scene it sort of messes with you as you

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.250 
scene it sort of messes with you as you
actually<00:03:12.600> do<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:12.840> demo<00:03:14.750> it's<00:03:15.750> pretty<00:03:16.019> fun

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
actually do this demo it's pretty fun

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.140 
actually do this demo it's pretty fun
and<00:03:16.380> addictive<00:03:19.340> now<00:03:20.340> there's<00:03:20.550> also<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.820> couple

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
and addictive now there's also a couple

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.880 
and addictive now there's also a couple
cheats<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.660> course<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.080> have<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.260> put<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.650> in

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
cheats of course you have to put that in

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.979 
cheats of course you have to put that in
so<00:03:23.610> there's<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.060> cheat<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.570> can<00:03:24.720> actually

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
so there's a cheat that you can actually
