00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:04.958
Now we are at Mehtap Elaidi's
backstage.

00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm sorry about my voice.

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:10.375
Since I feel better, I want to
come to the backstage...

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.708
...and make the
interview I promised.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.458
At the moment, all
models are on rehearsal.

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:17.917
Probably rehearsal
will take 15 minutes...

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:20.542
...and then we are going to make
an interview with Mrs. Mehtap.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.000
At the moment rehearsal is going on.

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:40.375
While rehearsal is going on
I wanted to...

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.625
...take a look at
Mehtap Elaidi's collections.

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:46.500
As far as I see
it has great pieces...

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.208
...and very interesting designs.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:51.750
Of course the most important thing
is, we are going to ask Mrs. Mehtap.

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:53.917
What was her inspiration
for this collection?

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:56.125
Which fabrics and
colors she used most?

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.333
I want to hear these from her.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.083
Just now Mrs. Mehtap
finished the rehearsal.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.083
And I caught her as soon
as she got here.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.750
Now I am going to ask
the question I wanted to.

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.042
Hello Mrs. Mehtap, how are you?

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.083
- Hello, we are fine, welcome.
- I'm glad. Thank you.

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:24.250
Mrs. Mehtap, when
you were in rehearsal...

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.708
...I had to chance to view your
collections but...

00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.375
...of course I want to hear from you.

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:30.417
The most important
question which I want to ask is...

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:33.708
...what was your inspiration when
you were preparing this collection?

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:36.750
It's interesting, we have two
collections.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.417
One is just consist of white shirts.
We show them on pre-collection time.

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:44.875
We departed from the
Spice Road at that one too.

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:47.167
Each shirt has one spice name.

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:51.250
We also surround the
Mehtap Elaidi collection on it.

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:53.750
So we sticked into the Spice Road...

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:57.750
...and departed from
the silhouettes...

00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.792
...from the lands of the Spice Road.

00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.625
We interpreted those silhouettes.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.375
It has skirts, caftans.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.250
Actually I thought it like...

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.750
Today Ýstanbul does the work
of the Spice Road...

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.250
...did at those times.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.875
Gets together the East and the West.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.458
That was our beginning point.

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:19.125
It's story is beautiful.
I also saw it from fabrics.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.750
At that time fibres are also...

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:23.292
Colors are from at those times,
am I right?

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:26.375
Yes, of course completely
sticking is not possible.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.542
But I don't know, we used velvet.

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:30.458
We used some thick satin.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.458
Burnt orange, in order to
feel spices.

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:37.083
We have dark blue,
black.

00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:39.875
We have khaki.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.167
We are going to watch it soon.

00:02:42.292 --> 00:02:44.458
Very exciting.
So generally...

00:02:44.542 --> 00:02:46.042
...including this collection...

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:48.958
...how would you describe
Mehtap Elaidi woman?

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:52.333
Actually Mehtap Elaidi woman...

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.125
...like to interpret
things for herself.

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:00.750
She doesn't get her codes
from others.

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:02.792
She creates her own codes
herself.

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:05.750
Of course she not outside of
the system, she is inside.

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:10.083
She likes to dress. She has
an intelectual thinking style.

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:11.833
I hope so.

00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:16.208
That gives her a different
sophisticated appearance.

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:18.875
I live with a woman like
that in my dreams.

00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:21.208
By the way it is your 15th year.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:23.000
Congratulations for that.

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:25.083
What do you feel about that?

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:27.125
Of course it is great.

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:30.958
We are trying to fit
15 years in 10 minutes.

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.167
It is really a difficult profession.

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:38.250
But it is so jolly that
in 15 years...

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:41.125
...I didn't say if once.
Because it is my second career.

00:03:41.542 --> 00:03:44.500
Every day I say "luckily".
It is really a jolly business.

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.875
I am very proud of it.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.750
I hope we will see more of it.

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.583
It's great. I am going to
ask one more question.

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.375
Do you have a fashion
trick for my followers?

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:58.792
Be yourself.
At first, recognize yourself.

00:03:59.042 --> 00:04:00.208
Be yourself.

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:02.833
Because now the era is an
interpretation era.

00:04:02.917 --> 00:04:05.708
I mean trends are not dictating
you anything.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.542
It shouldn't anyway.
You dictate the trends.

00:04:08.708 --> 00:04:11.083
I don't know I think
everybody create...

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:14.292
...his own style according to
his life style.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.493
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:18.167
Thank you. See you on parade,
Mrs. Mehtap.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.542
- Thank you.
- Bye.
