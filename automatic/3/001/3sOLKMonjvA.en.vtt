00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090

high<00:01:51.119> school<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.509> please<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
high school you please have to have a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.929 
high school you please have to have a
wonderful<00:01:53.070> every<00:01:53.220> class<00:01:53.399> most<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> time

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
wonderful every class most the time

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.600 
wonderful every class most the time
sometimes<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.290> folder<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.040> that's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
sometimes it's just a folder so that's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.280 
sometimes it's just a folder so that's
another<00:01:56.850> reason<00:01:57.060> why<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.450> waiting<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.110> go

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
another reason why I'm waiting to go

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
another reason why I'm waiting to go
back<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.619> school<00:01:58.740> shopping<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.460> because<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
back to school shopping is because I

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.880 
back to school shopping is because I
don't<00:02:00.540> really<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:00.990> using<00:02:01.350> writers<00:02:01.770> because

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
don't really like using writers because

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.160 
don't really like using writers because
they're<00:02:02.070> big<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.759> if<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.719> get<00:02:03.810> away<00:02:03.930> with

really easily but they can get destroyed

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.850 
really easily but they can get destroyed
easier<00:02:28.489> but<00:02:28.879> they're<00:02:29.120> cheaper<00:02:29.599> so<00:02:30.079> whatever

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
you will always need papers so this is

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.680 
you will always need papers so this is
just<00:02:36.650> uh<00:02:36.950> oh<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.610> is<00:02:37.819> loosely<00:02:38.060> paper<00:02:38.450> but

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
just uh oh this is loosely paper but

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.839 
just uh oh this is loosely paper but
yeah<00:02:38.930> these<00:02:39.200> are<00:02:39.260> just<00:02:39.650> wide<00:02:40.340> rules<00:02:40.640> I

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
actually like wide ruled over college

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.800 
actually like wide ruled over college
rolled<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.180> think<00:02:44.420> that's<00:02:44.540> what<00:02:44.629> it's<00:02:44.780> called

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.270 
and my let's say my English class I was
doing<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.049> color<00:03:21.230> green<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:21.739> would<00:03:22.099> have<00:03:22.250> a

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
doing the color green I would have a

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.250 
doing the color green I would have a
green<00:03:22.579> book<00:03:22.849> cover<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.209> green<00:03:23.480> binder<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.079> then
