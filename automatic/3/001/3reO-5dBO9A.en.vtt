 hello everyone this is a video tutorial I'm going to show you how to load the Free McBoot 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.680
 on the ps2 9000x DATA CODE 8D and up 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.540
 As you can see I have turned on Ps2 normally and I do not charge the Free McBoot 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:36.940
 Now I restart the Ps2 again and I press the Triangle button to load the ulaunch by means of the Mars pro GM-816HD chip which is the one I have installed in my Ps2 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.740
 after loading the ulaunch it will automatically load me the OSDSYS that modified the Free McBoot whose configuration had already done 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:51.540
 and there is this Free McBoot loaded manual mind since I see it. 230 of the bios that is what my console has does not allow it to load itself 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.180
 here as you can see my console is the SCPH-90001 Bios 230 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.260
 Well now I will show you how to configure the ulaunch to load the OSDSYS that in the Free McBoot 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.960
 well here I move the crosshead down to cancel the auto start for the Free McBoot 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.020
 good as you see in the options of buttons I have the option Default: osdsys that is not configured and the timeout that are not by default 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.400
 here we go to the option to configure 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:54.900
 now we select the default option and look for osdsys that is in the menu MISC at the end of the menu 

00:01:55.977 --> 00:01:57.977
 how do you see here 

00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:05.435
 press X or circle depending on the configuration of the ulaunch to select osdsys 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.320
 and we already have the default option configured 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:19.680
 now we go to the startup settings menu to configure `default' timeout and initial delay and set to 1 which is a second default by 10 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.460
 now let's return to return to the previous menu 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.100
 and then ok to exit and save the changes 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:45.900
 to your liking in the configuration of the buttons if you want to put the app that I have to show you that if you load the Free McBoot configure the button box to see that if the configuration works 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:55.080
 When you start the ulaunch, do not press anything in control to have the count automatically load the default option and enter the Free McBoot 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.160
 and as you can see there is the Free McBoot loaded in a Ps2 90001 with the bios 230 

00:03:02.213 --> 00:03:12.673
 here I reset the console so they can see that it is not a lie without pressing the triangle button to load the ulaunch, it does not load the Free McBoot 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.500
 now I restart again but this time I press triangle to load ulaunch and load the Free McBoot 

00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:30.615
 Remember when you turn on the LED you should not be pressing any button on the remote so that it does not stop the timeout count and load the osdsys automatically
