00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
in the urban world though I did wonder

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.110 
in the urban world though I did wonder
whether<00:02:39.560> maybe<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.069> just<00:02:40.099> cropped<00:02:40.489> up<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.879> its

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
whether maybe it just cropped up of its

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.259 
whether maybe it just cropped up of its
own<00:02:41.269> accord<00:02:41.540> which<00:02:41.900> was<00:02:42.049> a<00:02:42.080> nice<00:02:42.290> thought<00:02:42.500> but

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
own accord which was a nice thought but

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.949 
own accord which was a nice thought but
possibly<00:02:44.269> not<00:02:44.360> very<00:02:44.629> realistic<00:02:49.599> God<00:02:50.599> didn't

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.730 
I'd be interested who did it and why why
someone<00:03:15.480> planted<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.530> small<00:03:16.590> charger<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:18.440> I

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.760 

think<00:03:22.740> that<00:03:23.040> someone<00:03:23.640> might<00:03:23.910> want<00:03:24.270> to<00:03:24.470> plant<00:03:25.470> a

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
think that someone might want to plant a

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.880 
think that someone might want to plant a
small<00:03:26.580> garden<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.480> hot<00:03:28.080> hole<00:03:28.350> because

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
small garden in the hot hole because

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.010 
small garden in the hot hole because
they<00:03:29.580> might<00:03:29.760> what<00:03:30.390> might<00:03:30.540> want<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.810> make<00:03:30.960> a

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
they might what might want to make a

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.410 
they might what might want to make a
point<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.970> this<00:03:32.970> is<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> actually

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
point that this is a actually

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.050 
point that this is a actually
unnecessary<00:03:37.100> thing<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.340> took<00:03:38.580> beautifu

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
unnecessary thing that took beautifu

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.080 
unnecessary thing that took beautifu
tops<00:03:39.270> well<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.660> might<00:03:39.870> be<00:03:40.020> also<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.380> beautify

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
tops well it might be also to beautify

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.280 
tops well it might be also to beautify
the<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.360> city<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:45.150> very<00:03:45.210> pretty<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.960> I<00:03:46.080> hope

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
the the city is very pretty and I hope

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.020 
the the city is very pretty and I hope
it'll<00:03:46.590> be<00:03:46.650> less<00:03:46.920> there<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.460> it<00:03:47.640> won't<00:03:47.820> go

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
it'll be less there that it won't go

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.650 
it'll be less there that it won't go
with<00:03:48.600> absolutely<00:03:48.810> pack<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:50.210> deadly<00:03:51.210> the<00:03:51.450> length

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
with absolutely pack a deadly the length

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.870 
with absolutely pack a deadly the length
of<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.770> life<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.190> garden<00:03:53.490> would<00:03:53.640> be<00:03:53.760> the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
of the life of the garden would be the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.310 
of the life of the garden would be the
problem<00:03:54.090> expensively<00:03:54.600> more<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.990> way<00:03:55.110> it

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
problem expensively more the way it

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.380 
problem expensively more the way it
might<00:03:55.440> meet<00:03:55.650> its<00:03:55.860> end<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.460> if<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.760> was<00:03:56.910> going<00:03:57.270> to

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
might meet its end so if it was going to

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.750 
might meet its end so if it was going to
be<00:03:57.450> constantly<00:03:57.900> run<00:03:58.020> over<00:03:58.260> by<00:03:58.410> by<00:03:59.130> cars<00:03:59.430> it

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
be constantly run over by by cars it

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.590 
be constantly run over by by cars it
would<00:03:59.880> be<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> little<00:04:00.240> bit<00:04:00.390> sad<00:04:00.570> I<00:04:00.810> suppose<00:04:02.600> and

would be a little bit sad I suppose and

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.090 
would be a little bit sad I suppose and
this<00:04:03.720> were<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.960> see<00:04:04.170> is<00:04:04.320> more<00:04:04.530> visible<00:04:04.980> when

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
this were to see is more visible when
