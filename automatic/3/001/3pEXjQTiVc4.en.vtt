00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.600
 last week I talked a little bit to 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.860
 about hyperhidrosis, which is the 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.780
 excess of the sun 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.270
 and today I'll talk a little about the 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.310
 bruno and bronze which is the unpleasant odor 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.930
 southern 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.850
 we have two types of glands 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.550
 that are the glands that 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.770
 produce in the body the bands of mines 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.270
 and the bombs at little us but we go 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.460
 minions are those who are more 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.910
 diffuse of our body and they produce 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.860
 only sweat releases only water salts 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.350
 minerals that are substances that do not 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.150
 already suffering from 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.850
 apocrine that are located 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.019
 usually in the armpit scalp 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.930
 genital region 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.330
 beyond the south it also releases remains 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.010
 cell phones and cellular debris they 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.340
 can undergo decomposition by bacteria 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.320
 or fungi present on the skin and this is what 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.479
 it gives off an unpleasant odor 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.180
 besides some other factors like 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.600
 diabetes and alcohol management 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.240
 some foods like garlic onion 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.270
 pepper and some antibiotics such as 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.670
 penicillin can also be and simulate the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.540
 onset of the first dose or worsening the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.070
 painting 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.620
 So what can we do to 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.170
 avoid and improve the first 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.780
 decrease the intake of alcoholic beverage 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.810
 is to avoid the food you caused 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.870
 numerous as semmle lab chilli like 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.840
 I always told you to take a shower and 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.280
 When I leave the bath, it extinguishes. 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.290
 Properly leaving the skin dry is 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.720
 avoid leaving moisture on the skin because 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.520
 this predisposes the proliferation of 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.840
 microorganisms mainly in the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.000
 funds 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.670
 Also when you get home 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.830
 take the shoe to try to limit the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.340
 shoes always leave the attack in place 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.390
 ventilated because this already improves and 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.800
 that in relations 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.039
 underwear we have to avoid 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.200
 use synthetic material to look for 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.750
 always wear clothes that are cotton 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.600
 and if all of these measures are not 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.730
 have improved the picture is important 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.380
 that you seek the dermatologist who 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.140
 people can try treatments with creams 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.450
 that reduce sweating or evaluate a 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.940
 treatment for some fungal infection 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.940
 or bacterial infection that is related to
