00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello and welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.940
 in which we will learn to play at the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.130
 battle 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.389
 so we will start with the material 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.330
 it takes to play the battle 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.590
 so it takes a card game a game of 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.850
 cards that is composed of four 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.090
 families so hearts of the peaks of 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.619
 tiles and traces so here I take 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.550
 the truces to do a demonstration 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.470
 so for clovers then in every 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.590
 family there will be more than 13 cards in all 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.010
 so there what will be the most card 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.600
 strong 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:47.730
 then will come the king then the lady 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:58.170
 then a valet the 10th the 9th the 8th the 7th the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:01:00.899
 6 the 5th the 4th the 3rd and the 2nd so here it is 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.979
 it was in decreasing order so of 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.680
 bigger or smaller at this so this 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.570
 game 13 cards per family so very much 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.330
 4 it's fifty two so there's 52 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.100
 cards to which we can add 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.170
 because if we want to there they are 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.729
 represented this way it is 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.090
 often marked joker so as on 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.140
 this one dockers and so we get a 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.150
 game with a total of 54 cards 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.390
 so we'll mix it to explain 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.909
 the rules and so to start 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.299
 so there the cards they were 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.490
 mixed so you see hop there is more 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.000
 it does not follow each other anymore they are no longer 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.549
 in order 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.829
 so we have a pack of 54 cards 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.340
 that we will divide into two parts so 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.860
 like that we distribute them because the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.310
 battle is a game that is played at two 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.759
 facts do not have to 3 finally he can play 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.250
 three but hey it's more complicated 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.969
 teach us how to play two flops 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.969
 enter 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.060
 so here we get two packets for 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.209
 two players so these two players have 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.800
 each one a package then the battle 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.270
 we will learn as I told you 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.640
 just now I will present the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.010
 cards in descending order of 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.090
 croissants of which class being the most 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.370
 strong and the 2 being the weakest and the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.600
 joker bah obviously there it's all 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.900
 cards all the cards so that's fine 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.640
 to be a completely random game so 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.220
 for example someone hop there he goes out 1 2 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.830
 and this one is 1.3 so therefore 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.120
 chance makes this player win because 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:03.019
 that he pulled out 1 3 and the other 1/2 so the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.269
 3 being stronger than 2 the player who 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.480
 is here will win so both 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.280
 cards that will set aside or 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.690
 anywhere you can do this again 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.130
 after 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.130
 so here it's still the right player 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:27.079
 again and we proceed as follows 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.299
 so that's what the only other 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.730
 kevin player and and so on so 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.410
 until we reach the end of the case 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.870
 the end we will end up with about 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.750
 this is going to be the last cards 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.130
 here and last two cards by 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.640
 example to for the returns up on a 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.989
 than align and once none of the 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.150
 two players there cards 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.120
 as for playing in support of cards he 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.980
 take the package he has accumulated and there 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.109
 it depends if you want to continue playing 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.150
 taken up package is returned and the 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:03.139
 we start to return the cards or 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.450
 so we stop and start counting 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:09.470
 the cards so there are some 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.120
 half a little bit more and that's 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.280
 whoever has the most cards that has 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.560
 won and we can redo a game 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.639
 and so on 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.030
 so then there is another case of 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.340
 figure where for example 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.310
 for example there is a 4 here is 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.600
 the other player also comes out a 4 so they 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.100
 are like these two players 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.870
 take out the same card 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.180
 here it's a 4 it could be 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.080
 any other map so this 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.690
 that they will do is that they will 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.430
 ask a face down card like those 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.229
 this and they go to return another one and 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.410
 here and there it is this player who won 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:51.500
 so they pocket all the cards and 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.210
 he was lining up so he won the six cards 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.190
 instead of two or four 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:01.669
 so that's when a part 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.900
 stops when for example when 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.490
 player won all the cards so 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.639
 imagine that a last player is 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.630
 as if at home the last as at the 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.580
 last player card that is found 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.830
 right here 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.280
 the other they return their cards 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.200
 hop hop so this player to win ap 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.750
 they prevent cards like this player 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.580
 who was here he has no more map 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.889
 and well it is therefore the one who has 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.440
 all the cards that won in the 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.350
 where we continue to play at the end 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.150
 of his package so thank you for having followed 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.680
 this all Ariane now you know 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.680
 play battle and thank you
