00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.430
 even with the political independence of 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.040
 1822 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.260
 production still revolved around the 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.840
 slave labor and the interests 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.410
 economic and political 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.860
 divided the opinions with the abdication of 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.520
 Dom Pedro 1, the circle of the 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.559
 popular shakes which is reflected in the 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.760
 case of little slave rebellion 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.700
 mentioned 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.700
 but also very important occurred 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.720
 in the parish of carrancas current mines 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.820
 in general frowns that dominated almost 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.030
 all south of minas gerais 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:13.340
 there was a slave revolt on the day 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.550
 13 of May of 1833 that generated a climate of 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.840
 panic in nearby places and even in 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.750
 further away 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.649
 the revolt began in the farm field 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.750
 joyful 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.080
 belonging to gabriel francisco 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.250
 who was deputy and member of the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.610
 an important family on that day. 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.950
 slaves killed the son of junqueira 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.250
 called by the young man's slaves 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.770
 who took care of his father's farm because of 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.650
 of their political activities 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.840
 according to the statements pointed out 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.380
 revolt was led by a slave 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.920
 called Ventura Girl who had great 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.200
 leadership and influence over the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.070
 other slaves of the farm 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.590
 tired of living in inhuman conditions 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.240
 according to the case, the slaves had to 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.950
 intention to kill the whites of 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.530
 carrancas and seize their properties 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.950
 so the rebellion started on the farm 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.400
 gladly went to farm 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.790
 neighboring beautiful cross where more slaves 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.519
 they joined the rebellion convinced 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.280
 slaves who were on the farm doing the 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.600
 even making us pregnant 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.590
 the wish was to say finish 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.560
 most powerful in the region but the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.920
 failed when the reliable slave 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.500
 warned the farm family good garden 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.550
 who retaliated successfully 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.790
 another very significant factor were 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.370
 the political disputes articulated by the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.480
 divergence of interests between 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.470
 restorers and the liberals who 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.870
 space in the social scene of the time 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.990
 so with the victory of gabriel francisco 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.620
 junqueira in the election for general deputy 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:17.230
 in 1831 created resentment in the region 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.680
 so the wind and the girl appear as 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.920
 leader of slaves linked to francisco 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.400
 white silvestre belonging to the group 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.070
 restorers who in turn had 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.040
 political interests 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.130
 family junqueira signaling the real 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.790
 motive rather than sympathy with the cause 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.870
 of slaves, however this articulation 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.570
 de ventura mina and francisco silvério 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.970
 would be to kill the whites and 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.300
 make slaves free 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.060
 the result of the criminal 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.780
 sentenced to death by hanging 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.420
 several slaves on other farms 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.880
 involved were convicted until 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.280
 whipped or were acquitted 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.920
 inside he died in combat as the 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.270
 francisco silvério was acquitted by 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.320
 lack of evidence 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.220
 in their involvement by concluding 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.220
 cruelty to
