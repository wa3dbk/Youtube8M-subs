00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.339
 Hello, my name is hungry. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.900
 and prepare tea 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:15.849
 but in chile 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.330
 it is eaten with all bread biscuits meat 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.320
 tomato lettuce salad is just 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.720
 I even eat it 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.230
 instead the ingredients are the 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.230
 following 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.349
 t 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.920
 all right 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.920
 t 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.190
 first thing I have to do is cut 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.470
 all our ingredients the tomato the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.170
 onion and the chili in cubes and the 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.380
 cilantro the smallest team too 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.360
 in garlic a secret to garlic for 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.309
 People who misplace him have to 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.200
 split in half and take out half that 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:04.890
 in the middle once that sale is 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:11.870
 take out the tomato 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:15.360
 and then first we add the onion 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:19.020
 who placed all the onions though 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.970
 I do not know how strong against light 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.619
 have security already then I 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.290
 I prefer to go adding little and go 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.110
 Trying the same as chili will choose more 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.290
 all portal people can 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:34.130
 considered very spicy after eating 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.130
 already then we go 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.720
 we see 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.260
 color for good 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.220
 maybe we are or are not here below 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.940
 but because we do not like cilantro you 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.940
 gives the color 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.540
 and if it's coming back 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.340
 the most important 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:28.030
 of pp is tomato tomato quality 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.900
 very very green but it's not worth it 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.900
 why 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.069
 then the ideal is to find a tomato 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.280
 as mature as possible and that the reddest 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.560
 the more mature one considered that here is the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.360
 pp 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.360
 also next to the young 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.020
 also never 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.010
 the second most important also of 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.930
 pere is that the seasoning and is very important 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.110
 the amount of the child that one throws the 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.030
 mind do not try a baby and it's very 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.730
 development has all the ingredients 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:13.519
 the rancor but the bayern in the children of 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.760
 outside color that such pepper to the 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.760
 Pepper 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.430
 until salt because the onion sucks a lot 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.810
 Salt 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.810
 and also oregano 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.760
 you also have to pour oil more or 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.760
 minus one tablespoon of 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.480
 and the other thing that comes out a lot too 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.940
 people are not lemon juice and 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.600
 logically in fact one two or three 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.130
 lemons 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:55.160
 and also obviously always trying 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.160
 and the texture of how it is there 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.150
 if they are always watching out a bit of 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.150
 onion 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.510
 a little 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.510
 and then 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.019
 they are not going to try us 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.560
 if it is where it is 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.010
 and passing the child 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:49.680
 matters by the amount of blood and 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.680
 more lemons 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.690
 A) Yes 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.870
 and only thing to go testing how they have 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.650
 interest that I like to be very strong 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.650
 and the tasty 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.430
 and what 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.020
 wants more or less equated the 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.020
 colors texture 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.590
 we are really 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:31.190
 the difference is 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:34.190
 between more or less the big difference a 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.290
 poor as a gender apart from tomato 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.660
 is the amount of the child that we are 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.389
 our town is just a thing of 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.550
 taste and of you also decoration to me 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.230
 it seems from which primer you give 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.660
 wants to throw mostly onion and 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.310
 say good this has been all for today 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.830
 we have our pc and we finish 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.410
 Now let's wait a little bit with my 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.720

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.060
