00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
and 17 is one plus 7 which adds up to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920 
and 17 is one plus 7 which adds up to
eight<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.580> we're<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:20.970> an<00:00:21.090> eight<00:00:21.359> universal

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
eight and we're in an eight universal

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.890 
eight and we're in an eight universal
year<00:00:22.260> all<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.240> 2015<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> number<00:00:24.869> is

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
year all of 2015 so the number is

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.470 
year all of 2015 so the number is
doubling<00:00:25.529> up<00:00:25.680> today<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.580> anytime<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.150> number

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
doubling up today so anytime the number

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.769 
doubling up today so anytime the number
eight<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:28.220> magnified<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.330> more

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
eight is magnified you have more

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.440 
eight is magnified you have more
confidence<00:00:31.410> more<00:00:31.830> strength<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:33.030> overcome

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
confidence more strength to overcome

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.020 
confidence more strength to overcome
obstacles<00:00:33.780> or<00:00:34.440> deal<00:00:34.800> with<00:00:35.040> unexpected<00:00:35.340> events

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
obstacles or deal with unexpected events

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.750 
obstacles or deal with unexpected events
which<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.750> will<00:00:37.050> experience<00:00:37.770> today<00:00:38.129> at<00:00:38.489> some

which you will experience today at some

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
which you will experience today at some
point<00:00:39.090> because<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.750> full<00:00:39.989> date<00:00:40.260> adds<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
point because the full date adds up to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.310 
point because the full date adds up to
23<00:00:41.550> which<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.879> five<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.210> that's<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.870> pivot

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
23 which is five and that's the pivot

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.229 
23 which is five and that's the pivot
number<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> shift<00:00:44.190> number<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
number in the shift number the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.889 
number in the shift number the
unexpected<00:00:45.840> events<00:00:46.170> number<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.190> number

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
unexpected events number so this number

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.529 
unexpected events number so this number
23<00:00:48.899> 5<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> 17<00:00:49.559> 8<00:00:49.800> basically<00:00:50.610> means<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.239> can

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
23 5 and 17 8 basically means you can

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.529 
23 5 and 17 8 basically means you can
expect<00:00:51.899> anything<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.620> happen<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.760> doors<00:00:54.300> are

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
expect anything to happen that doors are

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.889 
expect anything to happen that doors are
wide<00:00:54.780> open<00:00:55.640> 23<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> Royal<00:00:57.120> Star<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.690> line

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
wide open 23 is the Royal Star the line

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.680 
wide open 23 is the Royal Star the line
which<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.260> all<00:00:58.500> about<00:00:58.770> courage<00:00:59.180> 17<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.329> 8<00:01:00.510> which
