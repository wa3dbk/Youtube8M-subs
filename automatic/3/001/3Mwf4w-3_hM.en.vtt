00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
detractions from this were just the fact

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.390 
interested in having something for my
knife<00:02:02.500> luckily<00:02:03.500> both<00:02:03.800> scales<00:02:04.100> turned<00:02:04.310> out

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
knife luckily both scales turned out

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.640 
knife luckily both scales turned out
great<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.850> being<00:02:05.660> said<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.960> is<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.110> completely

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
great that being said it is a completely

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.290 
great that being said it is a completely
different<00:02:06.980> type<00:02:07.280> of<00:02:07.310> material<00:02:07.550> to<00:02:07.880> be<00:02:07.970> working

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
different type of material to be working

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.900 
different type of material to be working
with<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:08.750> mean<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.560> gums<00:02:09.890> up<00:02:10.129> when<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.459> gets<00:02:10.489> hot

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
with I mean it gums up when it gets hot

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.179 
with I mean it gums up when it gets hot
if<00:02:11.599> you're<00:02:11.780> sanding<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.260> too<00:02:12.440> quickly<00:02:12.709> if

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:13.189 
if you're sanding it too quickly if

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.420 
if you're sanding it too quickly if
you're<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:14.030> know<00:02:14.090> when

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
you're you know when

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.770 
you're you know when
cutting<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:14.909> a<00:02:14.939> cutting<00:02:15.269> disc<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.629> got

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
cutting in with a cutting disc you got

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.229 
cutting in with a cutting disc you got
to<00:02:15.870> go<00:02:16.049> slow<00:02:16.379> if<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.739> heats<00:02:16.950> up<00:02:17.159> it<00:02:17.760> gets<00:02:17.909> gummy

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
to go slow if it heats up it gets gummy

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.630 
to go slow if it heats up it gets gummy
it<00:02:18.450> burns<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:19.079> mean<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.349> some<00:02:19.860> nasty<00:02:20.430> fumes

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
it burns I mean it's some nasty fumes

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.009 
it burns I mean it's some nasty fumes
some<00:02:21.000> nasty<00:02:21.450> dust

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
some nasty dust

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.910 
some nasty dust
oh<00:02:22.909> yeah<00:02:23.909> it<00:02:24.239> frays<00:02:24.689> easy<00:02:25.170> when<00:02:25.799> you're

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
oh yeah it frays easy when you're

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.240 
oh yeah it frays easy when you're
drilling<00:02:26.159> so<00:02:26.579> you<00:02:26.670> got<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:26.939> go<00:02:27.060> slow<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:28.650> mean

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
drilling so you got to go slow I mean

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.460 
drilling so you got to go slow I mean
it's<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.459> finicky<00:02:29.790> material<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.480> takes<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.870> you

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
it's a finicky material it takes a you

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.710 
it's a finicky material it takes a you
know<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.590> think<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.920> got<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.099> 1500<00:02:33.090> grit<00:02:33.209> finish<00:02:33.569> on

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
know I think I got a 1500 grit finish on

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.390 
know I think I got a 1500 grit finish on
it<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.049> it's<00:02:34.769> definitely<00:02:35.099> not<00:02:35.189> in<00:02:35.250> high

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
it it's it's definitely not in high

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.390 
it it's it's definitely not in high
polish<00:02:36.049> but<00:02:37.049> it's<00:02:37.200> it's<00:02:37.409> definitely<00:02:38.280> very

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
polish but it's it's definitely very

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.099 
polish but it's it's definitely very
nice<00:02:38.640> um<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:38.909> can<00:02:39.030> see<00:02:39.209> it's<00:02:39.359> it's<00:02:39.540> reflective

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
nice um you can see it's it's reflective

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.119 
nice um you can see it's it's reflective
and<00:02:40.230> when<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.349> give<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.709> little<00:02:40.920> close-up

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
and when I give you a little close-up

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.750 
and when I give you a little close-up
it's<00:02:41.519> it's<00:02:41.909> gonna<00:02:42.060> be<00:02:42.180> even<00:02:42.269> more<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:43.189> it<00:02:44.189> feels

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
it's it's gonna be even more so it feels

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.819 
it's it's gonna be even more so it feels
I<00:02:45.180> mean<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.480> feels<00:02:45.689> like<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.989> premium<00:02:46.319> material

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
I mean it feels like a premium material

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.830 
I mean it feels like a premium material
that's<00:02:46.980> for<00:02:47.159> sure<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.609> mean<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.150> solid<00:02:48.629> but<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
that's for sure I mean it's solid but it

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.129 
that's for sure I mean it's solid but it
has<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.290> slightly<00:02:49.769> soft<00:02:50.930> texture<00:02:51.930> to

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
has that that slightly soft texture to

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.740 
has that that slightly soft texture to
it<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.709> little<00:02:53.280> bit<00:02:53.400> grippy<00:02:53.819> not<00:02:54.030> not<00:02:54.329> super

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
it a little bit grippy not not super

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.720 
it a little bit grippy not not super
grippy<00:02:55.019> but<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.290> not<00:02:55.440> like<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:56.220> know<00:02:56.310> glass

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
grippy but it's not like you know glass

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.869 
grippy but it's not like you know glass
smooth<00:02:57.510> either<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:59.269> yeah<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.569> there<00:03:01.049> you<00:03:01.109> go

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
smooth either so yeah so there you go

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.869 
smooth either so yeah so there you go
speed<00:03:02.879> safe<00:03:03.120> fully<00:03:03.450> functional<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.609> did<00:03:05.609> not

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
speed safe fully functional I did not

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.610 
speed safe fully functional I did not
use<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.209> liner<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.810> time<00:03:07.019> so<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.230> carved<00:03:07.530> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
use a liner this time so I carved the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.789 
use a liner this time so I carved the
speed<00:03:07.889> safe<00:03:08.129> right<00:03:08.489> into<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.379> scale<00:03:10.379> itself

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
speed safe right into the scale itself

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.830 
speed safe right into the scale itself
you<00:03:13.799> know<00:03:13.920> if<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.280> go<00:03:14.760> five<00:03:14.939> six<00:03:14.970> six<00:03:15.359> is<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.569> knife

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
you know if a go five six six is a knife

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.030 
you know if a go five six six is a knife
that<00:03:15.989> you're<00:03:16.139> interested<00:03:16.319> in<00:03:16.560> decking<00:03:16.950> out

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
that you're interested in decking out

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.569 
that you're interested in decking out
and<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.849> want<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> pattern<00:03:18.449> on<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:19.340> on<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
and you want a pattern on the on the

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.890 
and you want a pattern on the on the
scale<00:03:20.879> we'll<00:03:21.030> probably<00:03:21.150> have<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.419> put<00:03:21.629> a<00:03:21.660> liner

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
scale we'll probably have to put a liner

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.879 
scale we'll probably have to put a liner
in<00:03:22.079> it<00:03:22.109> to<00:03:22.650> accommodate<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:24.739> torsion<00:03:25.739> bar

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
in it to accommodate the torsion bar

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.659 
in it to accommodate the torsion bar
cutout<00:03:27.319> but<00:03:28.319> yeah<00:03:28.829> I<00:03:29.010> mean<00:03:29.069> we'll<00:03:29.310> talk<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.579> out

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
cutout but yeah I mean we'll talk it out

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.270 
cutout but yeah I mean we'll talk it out
we'll<00:03:29.819> figure<00:03:29.970> out<00:03:30.060> details<00:03:30.620> this<00:03:31.620> was<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.799> dark

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
we'll figure out details this was a dark

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.270 
we'll figure out details this was a dark
blue<00:03:32.750> twill<00:03:33.750> which<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.859> glass<00:03:36.109> fiber<00:03:37.280> type

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
blue twill which is a glass fiber type

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.819 
blue twill which is a glass fiber type
material<00:03:38.790> similar<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.150> carbon<00:03:39.599> fiber<00:03:39.840> but

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
material similar to carbon fiber but

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.210 
material similar to carbon fiber but
it's<00:03:40.949> more<00:03:41.099> like<00:03:42.139> yeah<00:03:43.139> woven<00:03:43.530> glass<00:03:43.650> fibers

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.059 

there<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.430> lighter<00:03:47.879> blue<00:03:48.120> twill<00:03:48.680> which<00:03:49.680> I

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
there is a lighter blue twill which I

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.589 
there is a lighter blue twill which I
mean<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.459> really<00:03:50.699> light<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.329> can<00:03:51.479> see

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
mean it's really light this you can see

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.759 
mean it's really light this you can see
I<00:03:51.629> mean<00:03:51.810> it's<00:03:51.930> it's<00:03:52.139> kind<00:03:52.319> of<00:03:52.349> like<00:03:52.409> an<00:03:52.590> ocean

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
I mean it's it's kind of like an ocean

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.930 
I mean it's it's kind of like an ocean
blue<00:03:53.359> super<00:03:54.359> reflective<00:03:54.889> it<00:03:55.889> is<00:03:56.099> contoured<00:03:56.760> so

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
blue super reflective it is contoured so

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.699 
blue super reflective it is contoured so
like<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.180> slight<00:03:57.449> round<00:03:57.750> contour<00:03:58.349> this<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.590> the

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
like a slight round contour this is the

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.920 
like a slight round contour this is the
flat<00:03:58.949> part<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.310> then<00:03:59.459> it's<00:03:59.639> got<00:03:59.909> a<00:03:59.940> long<00:04:00.569> bevel

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
flat part and then it's got a long bevel

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.009 
flat part and then it's got a long bevel
in<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.079> long<00:04:01.260> bevel

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019

asked<00:04:09.859> for<00:04:10.159> it<00:04:10.249> but<00:04:10.400> it's<00:04:10.879> a<00:04:10.939> nice<00:04:11.090> knife<00:04:11.359> I

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:11.719 
asked for it but it's a nice knife I

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.270 
asked for it but it's a nice knife I
think<00:04:12.260> this<00:04:12.379> really<00:04:12.530> just<00:04:12.680> kinda<00:04:12.920> shows<00:04:13.129> it

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
think this really just kinda shows it

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.640 
think this really just kinda shows it

something<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.039> learned<00:04:16.220> how<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.370> do<00:04:16.579> this<00:04:16.699> week

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
something I learned how to do this week

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.240 
something I learned how to do this week
he<00:04:17.660> asked<00:04:18.199> if<00:04:18.289> I<00:04:18.380> would<00:04:18.500> include<00:04:18.739> a<00:04:18.859> lock<00:04:19.039> bar

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
he asked if I would include a lock bar

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.510 
he asked if I would include a lock bar
stabilizer<00:04:20.470> never<00:04:21.470> for<00:04:21.919> some<00:04:22.070> reason<00:04:22.400> thought

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
stabilizer never for some reason thought

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.700 
stabilizer never for some reason thought
about<00:04:22.729> doing<00:04:23.030> that<00:04:23.199> and<00:04:24.199> it<00:04:24.349> really<00:04:24.500> wasn't

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
about doing that and it really wasn't

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.710 
about doing that and it really wasn't
difficult<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:27.039> good<00:04:28.039> look<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.520> just<00:04:29.449> out<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:29.599> a

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
difficult a good look so just out of a

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.999 
difficult a good look so just out of a
little<00:04:29.900> piece<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.259> scrap<00:04:30.560> that<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.830> had

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
little piece of the scrap that I had

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.800 
little piece of the scrap that I had
left<00:04:31.479> there<00:04:32.479> is<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.690> lock<00:04:33.199> bar<00:04:33.560> stabilizer

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
left there is a lock bar stabilizer

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.170 
left there is a lock bar stabilizer
heavy<00:04:35.810> pimpin<00:04:36.199> and<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:37.550> James<00:04:37.789> Brown<00:04:38.030> on<00:04:38.060> the

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
heavy pimpin and it James Brown on the

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.850 
heavy pimpin and it James Brown on the
background<00:04:38.539> goddamn<00:04:40.509> yeah<00:04:41.509> so<00:04:42.259> I<00:04:42.470> think<00:04:42.590> it

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
background goddamn yeah so I think it

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.850 
background goddamn yeah so I think it
actually<00:04:43.280> flips<00:04:43.520> better<00:04:44.180> now<00:04:44.449> than<00:04:44.780> when<00:04:44.990> and

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
actually flips better now than when and

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.290 
actually flips better now than when and
then<00:04:46.070> with<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.280> factory<00:04:46.669> scale<00:04:46.940> I<00:04:46.970> mean<00:04:47.180> it

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
then with the factory scale I mean it

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.360 
then with the factory scale I mean it
had<00:04:47.419> a<00:04:47.449> nice<00:04:47.720> heavy<00:04:47.990> flip<00:04:48.289> to<00:04:48.470> it<00:04:48.590> but<00:04:48.770> this

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
had a nice heavy flip to it but this

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.360 
had a nice heavy flip to it but this
thing<00:04:49.550> is<00:04:49.639> really<00:04:49.940> really<00:04:50.150> smooth<00:04:50.770> and<00:04:51.770> I<00:04:52.070> had

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
thing is really really smooth and I had

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.159 
thing is really really smooth and I had
the<00:04:52.550> torsion<00:04:53.030> bar<00:04:53.150> out<00:04:53.389> of<00:04:53.539> my<00:04:53.630> knife<00:04:53.840> for<00:04:54.139> a

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
the torsion bar out of my knife for a

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.870 
the torsion bar out of my knife for a
week<00:04:54.380> too<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.889> had<00:04:55.130> it<00:04:55.250> with<00:04:55.400> a<00:04:55.460> torsion<00:04:55.849> bar

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
week too so I had it with a torsion bar

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.249 
week too so I had it with a torsion bar
for<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.150> week<00:04:56.300> without<00:04:56.479> a<00:04:56.599> torsion<00:04:56.960> bar<00:04:56.990> for<00:04:57.229> a

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
for a week without a torsion bar for a

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:57.670 
for a week without a torsion bar for a
week

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
week

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.260 
week
it's<00:04:58.160> an<00:04:58.250> incredibly<00:04:58.610> similar<00:04:58.820> knife<00:04:59.090> either

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
it's an incredibly similar knife either

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.820 
it's an incredibly similar knife either
way<00:04:59.509> it<00:04:59.630> really<00:04:59.750> doesn't<00:05:00.110> need<00:05:00.139> that<00:05:00.349> torsion

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
way it really doesn't need that torsion

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.129 
way it really doesn't need that torsion
bar<00:05:00.979> but<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:01.880> know<00:05:02.000> teach<00:05:02.270> their<00:05:02.509> own<00:05:02.539> this

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
bar but you know teach their own this

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.899 
bar but you know teach their own this
one's<00:05:03.349> working<00:05:06.280> so<00:05:07.280> you<00:05:07.310> can<00:05:07.490> see<00:05:07.639> I'll<00:05:07.789> show

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
one's working so you can see I'll show

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.909 
one's working so you can see I'll show
you<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.090> difference<00:05:08.419> in<00:05:08.539> mine<00:05:08.780> I<00:05:09.050> also<00:05:09.530> have

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
you the difference in mine I also have

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.210 
you the difference in mine I also have
the<00:05:10.159> silver<00:05:10.370> twill<00:05:10.729> I<00:05:11.000> also<00:05:12.009> contoured<00:05:13.009> this

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
the silver twill I also contoured this

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.180 
the silver twill I also contoured this
scale<00:05:13.960> very<00:05:14.960> much<00:05:15.169> similar<00:05:15.500> to<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.830> scale<00:05:16.159> I

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
scale very much similar to the scale I

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.760 
scale very much similar to the scale I
mean<00:05:16.370> they're<00:05:17.169> sisters<00:05:19.210> except<00:05:20.680> lanyards<00:05:21.680> are

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
mean they're sisters except lanyards are

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.279 
mean they're sisters except lanyards are
slightly<00:05:22.039> different<00:05:22.539> did<00:05:23.539> a<00:05:23.599> barrel<00:05:23.840> lanyard

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
slightly different did a barrel lanyard

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.790 
slightly different did a barrel lanyard
on<00:05:24.380> his<00:05:24.650> I<00:05:24.889> did<00:05:25.039> a<00:05:26.889> flat<00:05:27.889> or<00:05:28.039> not<00:05:28.190> on<00:05:28.639> mine

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
on his I did a flat or not on mine

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.100 
on his I did a flat or not on mine

if<00:05:38.030> I<00:05:38.270> can<00:05:38.479> get<00:05:38.659> you<00:05:38.780> good<00:05:39.080> look<00:05:39.470> at<00:05:39.590> this<00:05:39.770> when

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
if I can get you good look at this when

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.890 
if I can get you good look at this when
I<00:05:40.190> do<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.550> the<00:05:40.580> pictures<00:05:41.330> afterwards<00:05:41.659> just

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
I do the the pictures afterwards just

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.629 
I do the the pictures afterwards just
see<00:05:42.050> it<00:05:42.139> a<00:05:42.169> lot<00:05:42.289> better<00:05:42.500> for<00:05:43.099> some<00:05:43.280> reason<00:05:43.550> I

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
see it a lot better for some reason I

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.129 
see it a lot better for some reason I
haven't<00:05:43.940> been<00:05:44.090> able<00:05:44.180> to<00:05:44.300> get<00:05:44.479> a<00:05:44.509> good<00:05:44.810> dark

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
haven't been able to get a good dark

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.170 
haven't been able to get a good dark
acid<00:05:45.680> edge<00:05:45.860> but<00:05:46.130> it's<00:05:46.250> it's<00:05:46.789> almost<00:05:46.909> kind<00:05:47.120> of

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
acid edge but it's it's almost kind of

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.920 
acid edge but it's it's almost kind of
better<00:05:47.330> this<00:05:47.449> way<00:05:47.630> it's<00:05:47.810> like<00:05:47.840> a

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
better this way it's like a

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.450 
better this way it's like a
concealed-carry<00:05:48.440> style<00:05:49.039> I<00:05:49.130> mean<00:05:49.280> you<00:05:49.370> don't

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
concealed-carry style I mean you don't

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.920 
concealed-carry style I mean you don't
really<00:05:49.580> see<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.000> pattern<00:05:50.150> until<00:05:50.539> you<00:05:50.630> look<00:05:50.780> up

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
really see the pattern until you look up
