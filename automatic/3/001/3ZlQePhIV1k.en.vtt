00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.470
 I'm really interested in getting to 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.990
 my original weight that was 72 kilos 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.540
 Now that I've been here for quite some time 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:37.380
 weight over and the truth is that they are 88 95 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.870
 out there and I went in mainly because 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.360
 we went to an event and a lady 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.590

 tatiana and the child voltio I stayed 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.500
 seeing and saying oh it's like tatiana 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.180
 but a little fat I got into the challenge the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.010
 healthy weight good mainly my 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.860
 Mom was the one who suggested me and invited me to 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.090
 that I put myself first for health and 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.100
 truth is that I was a high athlete 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.810
 performance many years and went down and up 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.610
 a lot of weight because also like that 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.590
 a lot of exercise I have tried all the 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.540
 diets and well after thrashing it 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.550
 and get a lot of internet we decided to give 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.500
 the chance to kÃ¡rbala and see how we 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.300
 they go to this healthy weight challenge 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.760
 to see in 30 days if you I will win 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.860
 very good friends and the premise of this of 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.780
 this challenge is to help people who have 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.580
 a healthy weight and has a period of 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.410
 30 days so that the person who achieves 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.120
 discipline yourself take the food of the 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.980
 best possible way with rubber 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.690
 staff that you are going to have here is the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.000
 person who is going to win this amazing 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.500
 healthy weight challenge and we want to say 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.570
 the basis of how it will perform 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.430
 because in reality we not only reward 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.690
 the people who weigh the most because it is not 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.590
 a competition between all we are going to 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.540
 take it out in a way 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.560
 proportional to your own weight 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.380
 I want to mention that if a person 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.209
 weigh 100 kilos and only 10 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.530
 kilos this would be talking about that the 10 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.010
 percent of your weight is what is 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.350
 going down 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.070
 if a person weighs 50 kilos and falls 6 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.330
 kilos 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.850
 we would be talking about the lowering of the 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.830
 11% proportional of your weight however 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.450
 if we did it for kilos, the 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.459
 person who went down to 10 kilos but in this 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.750
 challenge is not awarded to the person who most 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.150
 low kilos but the person who 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.950
 proportionally lost more with his 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.970
 own weight so that we are 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.160
 sure that there will be a winner 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.739
 extraordinary the results are going to 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.450
 be extraordinary and in this challenge all
