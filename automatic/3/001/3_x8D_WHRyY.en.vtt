 games and m2 was still a dvd 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:48.790
 of mario bros the film that is postal 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.590
 mario bros the film was released by framing 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.479
 in front when I saw the first time 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.220
 I was young and I loved it 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.710
 but if I had to describe it with a 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.080
 look more current ben probably that 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.700
 I demolish him is also mario who is 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.530
 played by bob hoskins who is 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.560
 unfortunately passed away this year on 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.130
 buzz bob site and here is luigi who has not 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.679
 mustache 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.539
 yeah history side we know that what has 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.520
 annihilated the dinosaurs it's the fall 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.020
 of a comet on earth but in this movie 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.720
 there everything comet ah by the way 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.860
 it's creating two parallel universes 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.330
 our universe that we know well and 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.130
 the universe of dinosaurs 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.710
 in this second universe it's the king 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.660
 coupat which directs the king cuts to sebha 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.500
 to the horizons of which you are in the process of 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.910
 tell me that it's his daughter's eye to 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.430
 the princess daisy who is a 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.319
 archaeologist who digging in the open 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.630
 a way to move from a universe to 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.250
 the other the basic purpose is to bring together the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.380
 two universes in order to become king 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.300
 of absolutely everything but the only way to 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.020
 to do that is to gather the pieces of 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.090
 the meteorite 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.980
 the problem for buzzer is that daisy 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.450
 to a piece in his possession 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.150
 so he's doing everything he can to 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.069
 he did not pdesi with lapierre while 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.900
 Mario and Luigi Tam to bring her back healthy and 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.950
 except by hand the film was done 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.569
 demolish 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.520
 probably because we compare it too 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.069
 to video games but if we try to 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.410
 more compare them bah I think that's 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.750
 remains a decent film but no more 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.150
 because there is probably just mario 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.010
 and yoshi that it really looks like 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.510
 conclusion if you are curious you 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.280
 can look at the fai but must 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.280
 especially not expect during the year 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.809
 [Music] 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.410
 mailing 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.870
 what to say of post is a film that 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.569
 is inspired by the violent and very vulgar 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.250
 postal game 2 that made controversy and who 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.200
 has been banned in several countries 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.000
 go on we get along to get 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.160
 to vanner from countries like France and 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.079
 germany 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.049
 it takes something anyway 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.690
 and yes I'm you I'm a bad guy 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.060
 rascals and I played this game little 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.340
 after its release and I can you 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.459
 confirm it's gratuitous violence 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.889
 but if that was the way it would be 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.630
 again but no the game is not satisfied 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.730
 to be only violent there is also 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.109
 homophobic racist and presents the 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.750
 animal cruelty 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.870
 the movie meanwhile paid as the game 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.030
 violent vulgar and pay attention to your eyes 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.590
 it's not for everyone yes 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.570
 I laughed but just after I 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.700
 felt almost guilty if the son of 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.740
 mario bros was shattered by the 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.380
 postal critics was simply 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.970
 atomized bomber it's when the 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.530
 movie stuff is about going to steal a 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.300
 cargo of more phallus-shaped 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.130
 then that ends on the george 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.900
 w.bush frolicking hand in hand 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.360
 with oussama ben laden on a background of 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.789
 nuclear bombing but that says 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.330
 long not seriously look at post 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.860

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.240
