00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
hearts I've come up with what I call the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.800 
hearts I've come up with what I call the
fast<00:03:04.110> forward<00:03:05.010> technique<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.360> put<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.600> in

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
fast forward technique and I put that in

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.660 
fast forward technique and I put that in
the<00:03:06.900> magic<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.290> making<00:03:07.500> up<00:03:07.740> system<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.430> it's<00:03:08.550> a

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
the magic of making up system and it's a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.540 
the magic of making up system and it's a
healing<00:03:09.060> technique<00:03:09.840> we're<00:03:10.590> kind<00:03:11.490> of

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
healing technique we're kind of

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.030 
healing technique we're kind of
compressed<00:03:12.090> time<00:03:12.510> down<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.260> go<00:03:13.590> through

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
compressed time down so you go through

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.660 
compressed time down so you go through
the<00:03:14.970> healing<00:03:15.360> process<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:17.070> can<00:03:17.190> do<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.489> a

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
the healing process you can do that in a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.180 
the healing process you can do that in a
matter<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.970> hours<00:03:18.239> rather<00:03:19.200> than<00:03:19.350> taking<00:03:19.769> the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
matter of hours rather than taking the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.710 
matter of hours rather than taking the
matter<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.580> months<00:03:20.790> or<00:03:21.000> years<00:03:21.209> because<00:03:21.480> one<00:03:21.690> of

of<00:06:57.729> making<00:06:57.939> up<00:06:58.149> system<00:06:58.659> I<00:06:58.869> use<00:06:59.319> a<00:06:59.589> deeper

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:00.189 
of making up system I use a deeper

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:02.999 
of making up system I use a deeper
healing<00:07:00.639> process<00:07:01.209> called<00:07:01.899> the<00:07:02.079> fast<00:07:02.349> forward

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:03.009 
healing process called the fast forward
