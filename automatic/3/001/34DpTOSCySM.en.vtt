00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
just did something slightly wrong this

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.250 
just did something slightly wrong this
the<00:00:34.829> cleaver<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.690> down<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.899> rock<00:00:37.230> there

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the cleaver is down on that rock there

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.380 
the cleaver is down on that rock there
in<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.739> pool<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.950> emulsion<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.000> tug<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
in a pool of emulsion you can tug it

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.869 
in a pool of emulsion you can tug it
normally<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:41.070> comes<00:00:41.309> up<00:00:41.430> saying<00:00:41.579> cleaver

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
normally and it comes up saying cleaver

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.760 
normally and it comes up saying cleaver
if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.149> press<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> lipstick<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.379> because

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
if you press the lipstick but because

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.350 
if you press the lipstick but because

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
can't talk any weapon for some reason I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
can't talk any weapon for some reason I
just<00:00:48.270> can't<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.530> i'll<00:00:49.710> show<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> steps

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
just can't but i'll show you the steps

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.510 
just can't but i'll show you the steps
anyway<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.930> hopefully<00:00:51.930> should<00:00:52.020> work<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
anyway and hopefully should work so the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.350 
anyway and hopefully should work so the
first<00:00:53.699> thing<00:00:53.760> you're<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> want<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.270> do

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
first thing you're going to want to do

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930 
first thing you're going to want to do
is<00:00:54.600> go<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> emulsion<00:00:55.500> spawn<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.550> that's

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
is go to the emulsion spawn so that's

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.080 
is go to the emulsion spawn so that's
here<00:00:57.710> one<00:00:58.710> half<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> map<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.699> completely

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
here one half of the map is completely

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.529 
here one half of the map is completely
covered<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> emulsion<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.550> others<00:01:02.730> on

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
covered in emulsion and the others on

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
covered in emulsion and the others on
the<00:01:03.629> other<00:01:03.780> side<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.140> all<00:01:04.920> grass<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.549> it's

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the other side is all grass and it's

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.770 
the other side is all grass and it's
just<00:01:05.939> totally<00:01:06.150> normal<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.659> pretty

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
just totally normal so it's pretty

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.420 
just totally normal so it's pretty
obvious<00:01:07.080> which<00:01:07.200> side<00:01:07.380> switch<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.250> sides

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
obvious which side switch but this sides

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.660 
obvious which side switch but this sides
the<00:01:08.549> emotional<00:01:08.850> side<00:01:08.970> anyway<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:10.979> what

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the emotional side anyway and then what

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.450 
the emotional side anyway and then what
you<00:01:11.700> want<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.330> obviously<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you want to do is obviously this is the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.660 
you want to do is obviously this is the
force<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.030> nature<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.580> these

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
force of nature and so there are these

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.109 
force of nature and so there are these
rain<00:01:17.939> effects<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.460> what<00:01:20.460> dogs<00:01:20.670> ain't<00:01:20.880> figured

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
rain effects so what dogs ain't figured

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.770 
rain effects so what dogs ain't figured
out<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.020> shoot<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.409> gutter

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
out was the if you shoot this gutter

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.870 
out was the if you shoot this gutter
then<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.070> see<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.610> moved

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
then there you just see that it's moved

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.040 
then there you just see that it's moved
and<00:01:27.150> now<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.659> water<00:01:27.900> paused<00:01:28.259> on

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
and now the water paused on

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.170 
and now the water paused on
onto<00:01:30.830> this<00:01:30.920> emulsion<00:01:32.230> so<00:01:33.910> you<00:01:34.910> can<00:01:35.030> see<00:01:35.150> that

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
onto this emulsion so you can see that

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.850 
onto this emulsion so you can see that
makes<00:01:35.480> quite<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.780> bright<00:01:36.110> visual<00:01:36.440> effects<00:01:36.770> so

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
makes quite a bright visual effects so

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.500 
makes quite a bright visual effects so
it's<00:01:37.010> pretty<00:01:37.220> obvious<00:01:37.460> that<00:01:37.490> we've<00:01:38.390> done

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
it's pretty obvious that we've done

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.720 
it's pretty obvious that we've done
something<00:01:38.780> there<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.070> that's<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.310> first<00:01:40.460> one

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
something there so that's the first one

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.260 
something there so that's the first one
and<00:01:40.910> then<00:01:41.330> there<00:01:41.480> are<00:01:41.540> a<00:01:41.570> few<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.930> these<00:01:43.270> so

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
and then there are a few of these so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.710 
and then there are a few of these so
just<00:01:44.560> so<00:01:45.560> just<00:01:45.740> up<00:01:45.950> from<00:01:46.280> that<00:01:47.000> one<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.570> first

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
just so just up from that one the first

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.220 
just so just up from that one the first
one<00:01:47.870> just<00:01:48.140> up<00:01:48.650> here<00:01:49.330> there's<00:01:50.330> another<00:01:50.660> touch

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
one just up here there's another touch

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.990 
one just up here there's another touch
of<00:01:51.260> emotion<00:01:51.650> on<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.770> floor<00:01:52.010> and<00:01:52.220> there's

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
of emotion on the floor and there's

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.780 
of emotion on the floor and there's
another<00:01:53.180> gutter<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:53.840> we<00:01:54.830> shoot<00:01:55.070> this<00:01:55.190> on<00:01:55.370> there

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
another gutter so we shoot this on there

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.150 
another gutter so we shoot this on there
we<00:01:55.970> go<00:01:57.670> it's<00:01:58.670> down<00:01:58.910> and<00:01:59.320> i<00:02:00.320> think<00:02:00.590> i<00:02:00.740> think<00:02:00.770> that

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
we go it's down and i think i think that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.310 
we go it's down and i think i think that
triggers<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:01.970> earthquake<00:02:02.480> doesn't

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
triggers the earthquake doesn't

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.990 
triggers the earthquake doesn't
earthquake<00:02:03.620> every<00:02:03.800> time<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.010> do<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.160> I<00:02:04.430> don't

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
earthquake every time you do it I don't

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.220 
earthquake every time you do it I don't
know<00:02:05.060> didn't<00:02:05.510> notice<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:05.750> before<00:02:05.870> but<00:02:06.170> that

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
know didn't notice that before but that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.169 
know didn't notice that before but that
happened<00:02:06.530> twice<00:02:06.680> in<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.890> row<00:02:07.010> so<00:02:07.220> I<00:02:07.250> surely

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
happened twice in a row so I surely

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.840 
happened twice in a row so I surely
that's<00:02:08.390> got<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.720> be<00:02:08.840> something<00:02:09.260> to<00:02:09.440> do<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.850> go

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
that's got to be something to do that go

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:24.730 
that's got to be something to do that go
to<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.030> next<00:02:11.120> one<00:02:15.490> over<00:02:16.490> here

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.710 

there<00:02:25.370> we<00:02:25.460> go<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.090> got<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.300> shoot<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.600> on

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
there we go so you got to shoot it on

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.570 
there we go so you got to shoot it on
the<00:02:26.840> left<00:02:27.080> hand<00:02:27.200> side<00:02:27.260> there<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.860> then<00:02:28.460> it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
the left hand side there and then it

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.070 
the left hand side there and then it
paws<00:02:28.790> down<00:02:29.090> yeah<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:29.870> definitely

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
paws down yeah and that definitely

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.950 
paws down yeah and that definitely
triggers<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.530> earthquake<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.480> there's<00:02:32.900> a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
triggers the earthquake so there's a

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.000 
triggers the earthquake so there's a
quake<00:02:33.140> every<00:02:33.350> time<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.560> do<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.860> know

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
quake every time you do it so you know

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.960 
quake every time you do it so you know
you've<00:02:34.130> done<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.340> right<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.850> can

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
you've done it right and you can

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.000 
you've done it right and you can
physically<00:02:35.360> see<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:36.710> water<00:02:36.890> dripping

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
physically see the water dripping

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.130 
physically see the water dripping
dripping<00:02:37.550> down<00:02:37.700> anyway<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.720> that's<00:02:38.900> three

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
dripping down anyway so that's three

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.610 
dripping down anyway so that's three
done<00:02:39.970> then<00:02:41.200> if<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.350> remember<00:02:42.590> correctly

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
done then if I remember correctly

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.600 
done then if I remember correctly
there's<00:02:43.040> one<00:02:43.190> up<00:02:43.310> here<00:02:43.930> yeah<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.610> there's

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
there's one up here yeah so there's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.760 
there's one up here yeah so there's
another<00:02:46.760> patch<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.120> emulsion<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.770> there's

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
another patch of emulsion and there's

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.860 
another patch of emulsion and there's
another<00:02:49.010> gutter

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.680 

there<00:02:54.440> we<00:02:54.500> go<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.730> another<00:02:55.940> earthquake<00:02:58.690> all

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
there we go and another earthquake all

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.600 
there we go and another earthquake all
right<00:02:59.810> so<00:02:59.959> now<00:03:00.049> what<00:03:00.200> we<00:03:00.290> want<00:03:00.379> to<00:03:00.500> do<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.830> we

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
want to go down here towards the boom

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:14.110 
want to go down here towards the boom
sha<00:03:08.090> area<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:11.200> does<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.409> trough<00:03:13.129> there<00:03:13.430> what

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
and now we can see the actual cleaver

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.580 
and now we can see the actual cleaver
right<00:03:21.409> there<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:23.930> where<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.290> got<00:03:24.470> to

you can now see the cleaver so we know
we're<00:03:41.269> pretty<00:03:41.420> close<00:03:41.629> and<00:03:41.930> I'm<00:03:42.849> you<00:03:43.849> can't

grab it from up there I tried going up
there<00:03:45.829> and<00:03:46.010> looking<00:03:46.760> down<00:03:46.909> and<00:03:47.209> there's<00:03:47.329> just

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450

no way to grab it so there is from up

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.110 
no way to grab it so there is from up
here<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:51.230> can<00:03:51.379> see<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.709> outline<00:03:51.799> of<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.190> but

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
here you can see the outline of it but

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.539 
here you can see the outline of it but
you<00:03:53.209> can't<00:03:53.480> quite<00:03:53.659> get<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:54.220> now<00:03:55.220> what<00:03:55.430> we<00:03:55.519> need

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
you can't quite get it now what we need

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.449 
you can't quite get it now what we need
to<00:03:55.760> do<00:03:55.879> is<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:57.140> fire<00:03:57.349> the<00:03:57.590> hammer<00:03:57.739> of<00:03:57.829> dawn<00:03:57.919> into

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
to do is to fire the hammer of dawn into

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.339 
to do is to fire the hammer of dawn into
the<00:03:58.549> emulsion<00:03:58.910> pool<00:03:59.060> which<00:03:59.630> as<00:03:59.870> I<00:03:59.959> said<00:03:59.989> I

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
the emulsion pool which as I said I

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:01.690 
the emulsion pool which as I said I
actually<00:04:00.500> did<00:04:00.769> that<00:04:00.889> last<00:04:01.010> night<00:04:01.099> but<00:04:01.459> I<00:04:01.489> did

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
actually did that last night but I did

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.870 
actually did that last night but I did
it<00:04:01.819> before<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.389> cleaver<00:04:02.660> was<00:04:02.959> revealed<00:04:03.519> so<00:04:04.519> I

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
it before the cleaver was revealed so I

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.089 
it before the cleaver was revealed so I
tried<00:04:05.359> it<00:04:05.540> before<00:04:06.079> you<00:04:06.319> could<00:04:06.620> see<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.889> flavor

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
tried it before you could see the flavor

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.819 
tried it before you could see the flavor
and<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.790> did<00:04:07.910> nothing<00:04:08.410> so<00:04:09.410> that<00:04:09.739> was

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
and it did nothing so that was

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.860

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
careful not to drop this cleaver

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.400 
careful not to drop this cleaver
otherwise<00:06:39.450> it<00:06:39.750> just<00:06:39.780> becomes<00:06:40.110> a<00:06:40.260> regular

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
otherwise it just becomes a regular

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.530 
otherwise it just becomes a regular
clever<00:06:40.770> also<00:06:41.640> I've<00:06:41.730> read<00:06:41.940> but<00:06:42.270> I'm<00:06:42.330> not<00:06:42.450> going

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
clever also I've read but I'm not going

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.210 
clever also I've read but I'm not going
to<00:06:42.600> risk<00:06:42.750> dropping<00:06:42.930> it<00:06:43.170> I'm<00:06:43.830> gonna<00:06:43.920> have<00:06:44.070> some

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
to risk dropping it I'm gonna have some

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.500 
to risk dropping it I'm gonna have some
fun<00:06:44.250> with<00:06:44.460> it<00:06:45.410> so<00:06:46.850> it<00:06:47.850> doesn't<00:06:47.910> waste<00:06:48.240> time<00:06:48.360> oh

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
fun with it so it doesn't waste time oh

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.360 
fun with it so it doesn't waste time oh
if<00:06:48.630> you<00:06:48.690> swing<00:06:48.900> it<00:06:48.930> just<00:06:49.410> without<00:06:49.650> hitting<00:06:49.950> so

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
if you swing it just without hitting so

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.980 
if you swing it just without hitting so
you'd<00:06:50.520> have<00:06:50.550> to<00:06:50.730> worry<00:06:50.850> about<00:06:50.940> that<00:06:53.420> so<00:06:54.420> let's

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
you'd have to worry about that so let's

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.340 
you'd have to worry about that so let's
kill<00:06:55.170> some<00:06:55.290> grooves<00:06:55.500> with<00:06:55.590> that<00:06:57.080> so<00:06:58.080> it<00:06:58.230> seems

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
kill some grooves with that so it seems

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.290 
kill some grooves with that so it seems
pretty<00:06:58.620> powerfully<00:06:59.310> I<00:07:01.910> don't<00:07:02.910> know<00:07:02.970> how<00:07:03.180> good

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
pretty powerfully I don't know how good

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.240 
pretty powerfully I don't know how good
it<00:07:03.360> is<00:07:03.450> against<00:07:04.050> some<00:07:04.560> bigger<00:07:04.740> enemies<00:07:05.040> but

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250 
it is against some bigger enemies but

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.920 
it is against some bigger enemies but
simply<00:07:05.880> tearing<00:07:06.180> these<00:07:06.270> guys<00:07:06.480> up<00:07:06.630> and<00:07:06.780> now<00:07:06.870> you

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
simply tearing these guys up and now you

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.090 
simply tearing these guys up and now you
can<00:07:07.080> see<00:07:07.230> it's<00:07:07.380> counting<00:07:07.740> towards<00:07:07.950> the

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 
can see it's counting towards the

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.770 
can see it's counting towards the
achievement<00:07:08.270> even<00:07:09.270> though<00:07:09.360> I've<00:07:09.450> only<00:07:09.540> got

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 
achievement even though I've only got

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.120 
achievement even though I've only got
one<00:07:09.810> controller<00:07:10.350> santak<00:07:10.530> so<00:07:10.860> you<00:07:10.950> can<00:07:11.070> get

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130 
one controller santak so you can get

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.330 
one controller santak so you can get
this<00:07:11.280> achievement<00:07:11.400> by<00:07:11.820> yourself<00:07:12.150> and<00:07:12.770> I<00:07:13.770> the

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 
this achievement by yourself and I the

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.680 
this achievement by yourself and I the
cleaver<00:07:14.640> doesn't<00:07:14.910> respond<00:07:15.300> i<00:07:15.330> don't<00:07:15.540> believe

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
cleaver doesn't respond i don't believe

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.900 
cleaver doesn't respond i don't believe
but<00:07:16.230> the<00:07:17.130> way<00:07:17.250> I'm<00:07:17.340> going<00:07:17.460> to<00:07:17.550> do<00:07:17.640> is<00:07:17.730> I'm<00:07:17.850> just

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910

going<00:07:18.000> to<00:07:18.120> restart<00:07:18.330> a<00:07:18.600> couple<00:07:18.870> of<00:07:18.930> times<00:07:19.140> it's

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.830 
going to restart a couple of times it's

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.730 
going to restart a couple of times it's
going<00:07:20.100> to<00:07:20.160> take<00:07:20.250> the<00:07:20.430> foot<00:07:20.580> realms

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.570
