and<00:02:05.869> but<00:02:06.650> it's<00:02:06.860> even<00:02:07.220> better<00:02:07.400> than<00:02:07.909> that

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
and but it's even better than that

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.419 
and but it's even better than that
there's<00:02:08.330> some<00:02:08.450> slightly<00:02:08.750> thicker<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.530> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
there's some slightly thicker and the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.429 
there's some slightly thicker and the
Sigma<00:02:10.789> was<00:02:10.970> like<00:02:11.150> okay<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.599> quality<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.319> the

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
Sigma was like okay the quality of the

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.830 
Sigma was like okay the quality of the
handles<00:02:12.829> and<00:02:12.950> everything<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.430> very<00:02:13.879> very

this is the VCC pro deluxe 825 and it's
like<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.770> small<00:02:47.310> blending<00:02:47.970> brush<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.420> had

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
like a small blending brush I had

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.550 
like a small blending brush I had
originally<00:02:48.780> thought<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.440> would<00:02:49.530> be

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
originally thought that it would be

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.770 
originally thought that it would be
quite<00:02:49.770> like<00:02:50.010> my<00:02:50.190> Sigma<00:02:50.580> e-40<00:02:51.150> which<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.630> that

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
quite like my Sigma e-40 which is that

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.750 
quite like my Sigma e-40 which is that
one<00:02:51.960> there<00:02:51.990> but<00:02:52.380> as<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.500> can<00:02:52.680> see<00:02:52.800> it's<00:02:53.460> a<00:02:53.580> lot

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
one there but as you can see it's a lot

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
one there but as you can see it's a lot
smaller<00:02:55.190> but<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:56.370> really<00:02:56.790> really<00:02:57.120> perfect

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
smaller but it's really really perfect

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.570 
smaller but it's really really perfect
this<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.260> actually<00:02:58.680> too<00:02:59.010> big<00:02:59.250> now<00:02:59.430> I've

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
this is actually too big now I've

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.640 
this is actually too big now I've
decided<00:02:59.850> after<00:03:00.330> using<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.720> one<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.410> one<00:03:01.620> is

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
decided after using this one this one is

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.670 
decided after using this one this one is
just<00:03:01.980> too<00:03:02.280> big<00:03:02.520> it's<00:03:02.850> great<00:03:03.150> for<00:03:03.360> like<00:03:03.680> really

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
just too big it's great for like really

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.130 
just too big it's great for like really
really<00:03:05.070> blending<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:06.030> really<00:03:06.510> blending<00:03:06.960> but

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
really blending like really blending but

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.530 
really blending like really blending but
I<00:03:07.170> think<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.620> might<00:03:07.830> actually<00:03:08.150> save<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.180> for

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
I think I might actually save it for

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.120 
I think I might actually save it for
more<00:03:09.930> like<00:03:10.140> highlighting<00:03:10.710> and<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:10.920> kind<00:03:11.100> of

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
more like highlighting and that kind of

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.830 
more like highlighting and that kind of
thing<00:03:11.370> from<00:03:11.820> now<00:03:11.970> on<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.540> have<00:03:12.600> this

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
thing from now on I that I have this

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.720 
thing from now on I that I have this
brush<00:03:13.140> because<00:03:13.460> this<00:03:14.460> is<00:03:14.610> much<00:03:14.970> more<00:03:16.730> precise

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
brush because this is much more precise

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.150 
brush because this is much more precise
brush<00:03:18.000> it's<00:03:18.620> beautiful<00:03:19.680> again<00:03:19.890> it's<00:03:20.100> just

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
brush it's beautiful again it's just

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.110 
brush it's beautiful again it's just
washed<00:03:20.490> that's<00:03:20.730> what<00:03:20.880> looks<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.090> bit<00:03:21.120> mad<00:03:21.840> but

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
washed that's what looks a bit mad but

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.410 
washed that's what looks a bit mad but
brilliant<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.270> brush<00:03:25.460> the<00:03:26.460> next<00:03:26.760> one<00:03:26.910> then<00:03:27.090> is

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
brilliant the brush the next one then is

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.750 
brilliant the brush the next one then is

night<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:40.680> very<00:03:40.860> my<00:03:40.980> god<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.160> wasn't

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
night to be very my god I wasn't

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.360 
night to be very my god I wasn't
entirely<00:03:41.760> sure<00:03:41.880> what<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.270> do<00:03:42.420> ders<00:03:42.630> but<00:03:43.410> I'm

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
entirely sure what to do ders but I'm

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.920 
entirely sure what to do ders but I'm
using<00:03:44.790> my<00:03:49.190> contour<00:03:50.190> brush<00:03:50.400> from<00:03:50.930> Real

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
using my contour brush from Real

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.450 
using my contour brush from Real
Techniques<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.800> found<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.130> these<00:03:53.250> were

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
Techniques and I found that these were

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.070 
Techniques and I found that these were
quite<00:03:53.700> similar<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.420> that's<00:03:54.690> kind<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:54.930> what

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
quite similar so that's kind of what

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.730 
quite similar so that's kind of what
I've<00:03:55.200> been<00:03:55.230> using<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.620> for<00:03:55.650> my<00:03:56.190> coloring<00:03:56.760> and

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
I've been using it for my coloring and

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.870 
I've been using it for my coloring and
again<00:03:58.740> it's<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.980> lovely<00:03:59.130> little<00:03:59.370> brush<00:03:59.670> it's

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
again it's a lovely little brush it's

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.250 
again it's a lovely little brush it's
not<00:04:00.030> my<00:04:00.180> favorite<00:04:00.570> of<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.780> brushes<00:04:00.990> because

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
not my favorite of the brushes because

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.950 
not my favorite of the brushes because
it's<00:04:01.560> quite<00:04:01.770> stiff<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.660> it's<00:04:03.660> just<00:04:03.840> been

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.050 
it's quite stiff and it's just been
washable<00:04:04.710> it<00:04:04.830> is<00:04:04.980> quite<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.580> stiff<00:04:05.910> little

and I would be will know them now and

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.250 
and I would be will know them now and
that<00:05:05.980> I've<00:05:06.100> tried<00:05:06.370> a<00:05:06.400> few<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.750> I<00:05:07.900> know<00:05:07.960> that

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
that I've tried a few and I know that

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.990 
that I've tried a few and I know that
you<00:05:08.830> probably<00:05:09.010> have<00:05:09.280> already<00:05:09.460> heard<00:05:09.640> of<00:05:09.850> them

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
you probably have already heard of them

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.850 
you probably have already heard of them
but<00:05:10.150> just<00:05:10.270> in<00:05:10.450> case<00:05:10.480> you<00:05:10.690> hadn't<00:05:11.020> I<00:05:11.200> thought<00:05:11.830> I

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
but just in case you hadn't I thought I

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.620 
but just in case you hadn't I thought I
would<00:05:12.040> just<00:05:12.160> put<00:05:12.640> that<00:05:12.790> I<00:05:12.820> third<00:05:13.120> they<00:05:13.300> do<00:05:13.450> ship

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
would just put that I third they do ship

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.560 
would just put that I third they do ship
internationally<00:05:13.750> as<00:05:14.350> well<00:05:14.380> as<00:05:14.650> far<00:05:14.830> as<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:14.950> know

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
internationally as well as far as I know

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.240 
internationally as well as far as I know
so<00:05:16.570> worth<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.230> try<00:05:17.410> they're<00:05:17.620> an<00:05:17.680> awful<00:05:18.070> lot

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
so worth the try they're an awful lot

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.250 
so worth the try they're an awful lot
cheaper<00:05:18.550> than<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:19.480> likes<00:05:19.660> of<00:05:19.780> segments<00:05:20.230> that

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
cheaper than the likes of segments that

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.020 
cheaper than the likes of segments that
are<00:05:20.380> in<00:05:20.500> lace<00:05:20.650> especially<00:05:20.830> for<00:05:21.310> postage<00:05:21.730> first

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
are in lace especially for postage first

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.080 
are in lace especially for postage first
in<00:05:22.150> Ireland<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:23.250> definitely<00:05:24.250> definitely<00:05:24.760> look

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
in Ireland so definitely definitely look

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.790 
in Ireland so definitely definitely look
