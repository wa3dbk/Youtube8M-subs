00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
help the fashion industry to take the

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.999 
help the fashion industry to take the
ring<00:00:23.040> road<00:00:23.360> it's<00:00:24.360> not<00:00:24.869> always<00:00:25.080> easy<00:00:25.230> it's

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
ring road it's not always easy it's

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.130 
ring road it's not always easy it's
sometimes<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.640> needs<00:00:27.029> lots<00:00:27.270> of<00:00:27.449> investments

sometimes it needs lots of investments
but<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.320> think<00:00:28.590> most<00:00:28.860> of<00:00:29.039> all<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.520> makes

but I think most of all it makes

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.110 
but I think most of all it makes
information<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.550> education<00:00:32.550> about<00:00:32.790> how<00:00:33.059> to
