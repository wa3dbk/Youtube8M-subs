00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
you know you can't always catch them

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.030 
you know you can't always catch them
sometimes<00:02:25.799> they<00:02:25.950> will<00:02:26.220> just<00:02:26.250> get<00:02:26.879> away<00:02:27.530> but<00:02:28.530> I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
sometimes they will just get away but I

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.869 
sometimes they will just get away but I
tried<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:29.970> analyze<00:02:30.329> that<00:02:30.540> footage<00:02:31.609> like<00:02:32.609> when

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
tried to analyze that footage like when

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.160 
tried to analyze that footage like when
I<00:02:32.909> reached<00:02:33.180> back<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.599> net<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:36.180> tried<00:02:37.019> to

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
I reached back to the net and I tried to

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.449 
I reached back to the net and I tried to
think<00:02:37.409> you<00:02:37.620> know<00:02:37.739> did<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.010> give<00:02:38.189> him<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.340> little

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
think you know did I give him a little

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.530 
think you know did I give him a little
too<00:02:38.670> much<00:02:38.849> slack

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
too much slack

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.979 
too much slack
which<00:02:40.319> might<00:02:40.560> allow<00:02:40.829> that<00:02:41.299> line<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.540> go<00:02:42.659> around

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
which might allow that line to go around

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.610 
which might allow that line to go around
their<00:02:43.200> sharp<00:02:43.859> Gill<00:02:44.159> plates<00:02:44.900> but<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.170> think<00:02:46.470> I

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
their sharp Gill plates but I think I

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.599 
their sharp Gill plates but I think I
did<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.400> pretty<00:02:47.489> good<00:02:47.849> job<00:02:47.909> there<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.599> keeping

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
did a pretty good job there of keeping

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.339 
did a pretty good job there of keeping
pressure<00:02:50.609> on<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.909> fish<00:02:51.209> while<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.900> reached

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
pressure on the fish while I reached

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:19.020 
pressure on the fish while I reached
back<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.220> net

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.620 

you<00:03:20.030> know<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.540> also<00:03:20.960> wondered<00:03:21.380> if<00:03:21.880> my<00:03:22.880> wheel

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
you know I I also wondered if my wheel

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.310 
you know I I also wondered if my wheel
didn't<00:03:24.110> lock<00:03:24.290> up<00:03:25.090> towards<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.240> end<00:03:26.390> there<00:03:26.660> you

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
didn't lock up towards the end there you

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.860 
didn't lock up towards the end there you
noticed<00:03:27.650> at<00:03:28.130> one<00:03:28.370> point<00:03:28.610> there<00:03:29.420> was<00:03:29.540> plenty<00:03:29.750> of

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
noticed at one point there was plenty of

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.750 
noticed at one point there was plenty of
drag<00:03:30.200> getting<00:03:30.590> pulled<00:03:30.860> off<00:03:31.070> by<00:03:31.100> this<00:03:31.400> big<00:03:31.850> fish

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
drag getting pulled off by this big fish

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.490 
drag getting pulled off by this big fish
but<00:03:34.760> then<00:03:34.970> towards<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.420> end<00:03:35.510> when<00:03:36.230> he<00:03:36.260> goes

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
but then towards the end when he goes

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.970 
but then towards the end when he goes
around<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.890> front<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.280> boat<00:03:38.680> he<00:03:39.680> starts

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
around the front of the boat he starts

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.180 
around the front of the boat he starts
taking<00:03:40.160> off<00:03:40.490> and<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:42.140> rod<00:03:42.350> bends<00:03:42.650> over<00:03:42.830> really

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
taking off and the rod bends over really

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.020 
taking off and the rod bends over really
hard<00:03:43.750> but<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:45.410> seems<00:03:45.740> like<00:03:46.010> no<00:03:46.610> line<00:03:46.850> is

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
hard but it seems like no line is

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.810 
hard but it seems like no line is
getting<00:03:47.240> pulled<00:03:47.450> out<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:47.990> I<00:03:48.740> wonder<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.670> means

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
getting pulled out and I wonder it means

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.940 
getting pulled out and I wonder it means
sometimes<00:03:50.470> your<00:03:51.470> drag<00:03:52.780> kind<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:54.080> real<00:03:54.620> hard

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
sometimes your drag kind of is real hard

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.630 
sometimes your drag kind of is real hard
to<00:03:55.130> just<00:03:55.640> start<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.440> then<00:03:57.440> it'll<00:03:57.890> free<00:03:58.220> up<00:03:58.250> if

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
to just start and then it'll free up if

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.620 
to just start and then it'll free up if
those<00:03:59.120> uh<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.840> don't<00:04:00.500> know<00:04:00.620> those<00:04:00.800> little<00:04:01.010> LOD

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
those uh I don't know those little LOD

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.199 
those uh I don't know those little LOD
disks<00:04:02.630> inside<00:04:03.080> there<00:04:03.380> are<00:04:03.590> all<00:04:04.550> gunky<00:04:05.000> or

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
disks inside there are all gunky or

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.370 
disks inside there are all gunky or
something<00:04:07.750> that's<00:04:08.750> actually<00:04:08.900> my<00:04:09.230> main

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
something that's actually my main

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.750 
something that's actually my main
suspicion<00:04:10.040> that<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.340> real<00:04:10.520> wasn't

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
suspicion that the real wasn't

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.050 
suspicion that the real wasn't
lubricated<00:04:11.390> enough<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.709> drag<00:04:13.520> disks

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
lubricated enough and the drag disks

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.180 
lubricated enough and the drag disks
kind<00:04:14.810> of<00:04:14.930> locked<00:04:15.140> up<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:15.620> see<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:15.890> fish<00:04:16.070> is

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
kind of locked up you see the fish is

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.640 
kind of locked up you see the fish is
pulling<00:04:16.340> really<00:04:16.640> hard<00:04:16.760> there<00:04:17.359> I<00:04:17.570> feel<00:04:18.500> I'm

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
pulling really hard there I feel I'm

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.420 
pulling really hard there I feel I'm
pulling<00:04:18.950> hard<00:04:19.130> so<00:04:19.310> I<00:04:19.340> grabbed<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:19.820> rod<00:04:20.090> and

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
pulling hard so I grabbed the rod and

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.159 
pulling hard so I grabbed the rod and
the<00:04:22.430> reels<00:04:22.700> not<00:04:22.880> giving<00:04:23.120> any<00:04:23.240> line<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.810> when

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
the reels not giving any line and when

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.310 
the reels not giving any line and when
he<00:04:24.260> pulls<00:04:24.530> really<00:04:24.830> hard<00:04:25.010> there<00:04:25.250> boom<00:04:26.320> instead

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
he pulls really hard there boom instead

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.450 
he pulls really hard there boom instead
of<00:04:27.410> giving<00:04:27.620> line<00:04:28.040> it<00:04:28.790> breaks<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.330> leader

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.260 

I<00:04:32.930> also<00:04:33.930> thought<00:04:34.199> actually<00:04:34.530> used<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:35.270> heavier

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
I also thought actually used a heavier

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.730 
I also thought actually used a heavier
line<00:04:36.889> or<00:04:37.889> at<00:04:38.069> least<00:04:38.250> leader<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:39.389> had<00:04:39.780> 20<00:04:40.440> pound

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
line or at least leader I had 20 pound

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.370 
line or at least leader I had 20 pound
no<00:04:41.099> I<00:04:41.370> had<00:04:41.610> 15<00:04:42.090> pound<00:04:42.389> braided<00:04:42.660> line<00:04:42.960> on<00:04:43.169> there

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
no I had 15 pound braided line on there

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.740 
no I had 15 pound braided line on there
and<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:44.520> braided<00:04:44.729> line<00:04:45.000> didn't<00:04:45.300> break<00:04:45.479> but

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
and the braided line didn't break but

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.379 
and the braided line didn't break but
the<00:04:46.349> leader<00:04:46.590> did<00:04:46.919> and<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.639> had<00:04:47.789> 20<00:04:48.150> pound

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
the leader did and I had 20 pound

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.400 
the leader did and I had 20 pound
fluorocarbon<00:04:49.110> leader<00:04:49.680> on<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:51.690> that<00:04:51.930> was<00:04:52.169> the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
fluorocarbon leader on and that was the

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:00.330 
fluorocarbon leader on and that was the
weak<00:04:52.560> link<00:04:52.860> in<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.069> chain

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.219 

so<00:05:01.340> I<00:05:01.699> guess<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.479> question<00:05:03.070> is<00:05:05.080> what<00:05:06.080> do<00:05:06.169> you

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
so I guess the question is what do you

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.580 
so I guess the question is what do you
guys<00:05:06.410> think<00:05:06.740> I<00:05:06.949> could<00:05:07.370> have<00:05:07.460> done<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:08.590> maybe

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
guys think I could have done to maybe

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.439 
guys think I could have done to maybe
get<00:05:09.860> this<00:05:10.010> fish<00:05:10.220> to<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.430> boat<00:05:10.460> it's

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
get this fish to the boat it's

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.270 
get this fish to the boat it's
unfortunate<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.110> I<00:05:12.229> lost<00:05:12.470> him<00:05:12.680> and<00:05:12.860> that

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
unfortunate that I lost him and that

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.710 
unfortunate that I lost him and that
could<00:05:13.460> have<00:05:13.550> been<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:14.720> fish<00:05:14.930> of<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.110> lifetime<00:05:15.139> I

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
could have been the fish of a lifetime I

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.180 
could have been the fish of a lifetime I
estimated<00:05:17.720> that<00:05:18.020> snook<00:05:18.530> was<00:05:18.680> probably<00:05:18.979> around

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
estimated that snook was probably around

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.620 
estimated that snook was probably around
50<00:05:19.639> inches<00:05:19.970> long<00:05:21.729> give<00:05:22.729> or<00:05:22.850> take<00:05:23.090> it<00:05:23.270> was<00:05:23.389> just

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
50 inches long give or take it was just

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.530 
50 inches long give or take it was just
a<00:05:23.690> monster<00:05:24.139> of<00:05:24.560> a<00:05:24.650> fish<00:05:24.889> I<00:05:25.790> don't<00:05:26.330> think<00:05:26.449> the

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
a monster of a fish I don't think the

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.210 
a monster of a fish I don't think the
footage<00:05:26.750> that<00:05:26.870> I<00:05:27.050> got<00:05:27.260> did<00:05:27.470> it<00:05:27.590> any<00:05:27.740> justice

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
footage that I got did it any justice

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.800 
footage that I got did it any justice
and<00:05:28.430> I<00:05:28.790> wish<00:05:28.970> I<00:05:29.060> could<00:05:29.240> have<00:05:29.330> held<00:05:29.510> that<00:05:29.660> thing

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
and I wish I could have held that thing

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.340 
and I wish I could have held that thing
up<00:05:29.960> too<00:05:30.110> to<00:05:30.800> show<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:31.040> guys<00:05:31.600> but<00:05:32.600> I'll<00:05:33.169> keep

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
up too to show you guys but I'll keep

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.310 
up too to show you guys but I'll keep
trying<00:05:33.590> hopefully<00:05:34.310> I'll<00:05:34.430> get<00:05:34.580> them<00:05:34.729> again<00:05:34.940> and

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
trying hopefully I'll get them again and

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.469 
trying hopefully I'll get them again and

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
if you can leave a comment below I'd

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.120 
if you can leave a comment below I'd
appreciate<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.169> let<00:05:39.350> me<00:05:39.380> know<00:05:39.470> what<00:05:39.620> you<00:05:39.979> think

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
appreciate it let me know what you think

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.879 
appreciate it let me know what you think
I<00:05:40.280> could<00:05:40.460> have<00:05:40.550> done<00:05:40.699> differently<00:05:40.760> I<00:05:41.740> mean<00:05:42.740> I

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
I could have done differently I mean I

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.100 
I could have done differently I mean I
don't<00:05:42.949> want<00:05:43.160> to<00:05:43.220> use<00:05:43.479> gigantic<00:05:44.479> tackle<00:05:45.020> all

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
don't want to use gigantic tackle all

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.170 
don't want to use gigantic tackle all
the<00:05:45.229> time<00:05:45.440> because<00:05:45.680> I<00:05:45.770> don't<00:05:45.949> find<00:05:46.639> fish<00:05:46.970> like

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
the time because I don't find fish like

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.439 
the time because I don't find fish like
that<00:05:47.210> very<00:05:47.570> often<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:49.090> not<00:05:50.090> only<00:05:50.210> would<00:05:50.419> it

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
that very often and not only would it

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.450 
that very often and not only would it
take<00:05:50.630> some<00:05:50.780> of<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:50.930> sport<00:05:51.289> away<00:05:51.500> from<00:05:51.710> it<00:05:51.860> but

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
take some of the sport away from it but

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.060 
take some of the sport away from it but
I<00:05:53.240> also<00:05:54.229> wonder<00:05:54.470> if<00:05:54.650> you're<00:05:54.740> going<00:05:54.830> to<00:05:54.919> catch

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
I also wonder if you're going to catch

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.469 
I also wonder if you're going to catch
less<00:05:55.400> fish<00:05:55.669> if<00:05:55.910> you<00:05:56.030> have<00:05:56.150> this<00:05:56.330> giant<00:05:56.780> line<00:05:56.930> on

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
less fish if you have this giant line on

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.570 
less fish if you have this giant line on
because<00:05:59.479> maybe<00:05:59.690> the<00:05:59.870> fish<00:06:00.050> would<00:06:00.229> see<00:06:00.470> it<00:06:00.590> more

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
because maybe the fish would see it more

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.520 
because maybe the fish would see it more
often<00:06:01.940> or<00:06:02.479> maybe<00:06:02.720> you<00:06:02.930> think<00:06:03.080> I<00:06:03.229> should<00:06:03.380> just

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
often or maybe you think I should just

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.810 
often or maybe you think I should just
start<00:06:03.740> using<00:06:03.950> like<00:06:04.190> a<00:06:04.220> thirty<00:06:04.580> pound

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
start using like a thirty pound

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.300 
start using like a thirty pound
fluorocarbon<00:06:05.240> leader<00:06:05.750> instead<00:06:06.110> of<00:06:06.770> the<00:06:07.039> 20

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
fluorocarbon leader instead of the 20

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.600 
fluorocarbon leader instead of the 20
pound<00:06:07.550> stuff<00:06:08.200> so<00:06:09.200> I<00:06:09.650> actually<00:06:09.979> did<00:06:10.310> that<00:06:10.430> today

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
pound stuff so I actually did that today

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.550 
pound stuff so I actually did that today
and<00:06:11.060> I'm<00:06:11.150> going<00:06:11.780> to<00:06:11.870> go<00:06:11.960> out<00:06:12.110> if<00:06:12.289> the<00:06:12.380> weather

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
and I'm going to go out if the weather

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.200 
and I'm going to go out if the weather
allows<00:06:12.650> and<00:06:13.870> try<00:06:14.870> my<00:06:15.050> hand<00:06:15.229> again<00:06:16.030> see<00:06:17.030> if<00:06:17.060> I

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
allows and try my hand again see if I

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.510 
allows and try my hand again see if I
can<00:06:17.360> find<00:06:17.539> that<00:06:17.720> monster<00:06:18.289> out<00:06:18.740> here<00:06:19.310> on<00:06:19.430> the

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
can find that monster out here on the

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.570 
can find that monster out here on the
flats<00:06:20.050> so<00:06:21.050> let<00:06:21.500> me<00:06:21.590> know<00:06:21.680> what<00:06:21.770> you<00:06:21.889> think<00:06:22.039> what

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
flats so let me know what you think what
