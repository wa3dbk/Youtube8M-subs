00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
at the radio beacon so what I'm going to

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.720 
at the radio beacon so what I'm going to
do<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.049> I'm<00:00:13.170> going<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.500> talk<00:00:13.799> about<00:00:13.950> each

little thing that you can do with the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.350 
little thing that you can do with the
radio<00:00:16.680> beacon<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.190> also<00:00:17.550> demonstrate<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.240> for

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
radio beacon and also demonstrate it for

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.359 
radio beacon and also demonstrate it for
you<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.660> you've<00:00:18.779> got<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> clear<00:00:19.350> view<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.650> how<00:00:20.310> to

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
you so you've got a clear view of how to

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.550 
you so you've got a clear view of how to
use<00:00:20.610> the<00:00:20.730> radio<00:00:20.850> beacon<00:00:21.270> first<00:00:22.230> thing<00:00:22.410> we're

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
use the radio beacon first thing we're

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.259 
use the radio beacon first thing we're
going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.130> select<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.789> Recon<00:00:24.119> class

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
going to do is select the Recon class

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.790 
going to do is select the Recon class
that's<00:00:24.570> what<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:24.929> and<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.619> this

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
that's what it is and you have this

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.259 
that's what it is and you have this
right<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.250> beginning<00:00:26.339> so<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:26.880> not<00:00:27.029> like

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
right at the beginning so it's not like

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.939 
right at the beginning so it's not like
you<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.599> unlock<00:00:27.929> it<00:00:27.990> we're<00:00:28.679> going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.859> go

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
you have to unlock it we're going to go

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.279 
you have to unlock it we're going to go
ahead<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.279> set<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.210> open<00:00:30.240> now<00:00:31.080> if

ahead and set it out in the open now if

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.220 
ahead and set it out in the open now if
the<00:00:31.439> radio<00:00:31.710> beacon<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.369> out<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.000> open<00:00:33.230> what

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the radio beacon is out in the open what

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.610 
the radio beacon is out in the open what
you<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.500> do<00:00:34.650> is<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.670> will<00:00:35.850> parachute<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.840> on

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
you can do is you will parachute in on

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.490 
you can do is you will parachute in on
the<00:00:38.280> radio<00:00:38.579> beacon<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.870> we're<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.350> go

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the radio beacon so we're going to go

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.170 
the radio beacon so we're going to go
ahead<00:00:40.590> we're<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> select<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.820> Recon

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
ahead we're going to select the Recon

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.569 
ahead we're going to select the Recon
class<00:00:42.449> again<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.010> respawn<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.430> what

class again and respawn in and what

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.760 
class again and respawn in and what
you're<00:00:44.699> going<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.000> notice<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.719> once<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.649> get

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
you're going to notice is once we get

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.160 
you're going to notice is once we get
down<00:00:46.949> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> ground<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.239> radio<00:00:48.539> beacon<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
down on the ground the radio beacon is

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.750 
down on the ground the radio beacon is
no<00:00:49.440> longer<00:00:49.739> there<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.699> if<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.600> spawn<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.219> lay

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
no longer there so if you spawn and lay

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.180 
no longer there so if you spawn and lay
down<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.969> beacon<00:00:54.269> you<00:00:54.840> die<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.559> respawn<00:00:55.980> as

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
down a beacon you die and you respawn as

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.849 
down a beacon you die and you respawn as
a<00:00:56.489> recon<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:58.140> radio<00:00:58.469> beacon

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
a recon the radio beacon

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.220 
a recon the radio beacon
will<00:00:59.129> disappear<00:00:59.820> all<00:01:00.269> right<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.690> let's<00:01:00.929> try<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
will disappear all right so let's try it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.509 
will disappear all right so let's try it
again<00:01:01.350> we're<00:01:01.620> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.920> ahead<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.309> send

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
again we're going to go ahead and send

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.820 
again we're going to go ahead and send
it<00:01:02.640> out<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> open<00:01:03.149> once<00:01:03.780> more<00:01:04.050> but<00:01:04.589> this

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
it out in the open once more but this

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.680 
it out in the open once more but this
time<00:01:05.129> we're<00:01:05.400> actually<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.120> choose<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
time we're actually going to choose a

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.570 
time we're actually going to choose a
different<00:01:07.140> class<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.680> what<00:01:08.220> you're<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.550> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
different class and what you're going to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.150 
different class and what you're going to
see<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:09.480> spawn<00:01:09.750> beacon<00:01:10.170> will<00:01:10.620> remain

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
see is that the spawn beacon will remain

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.050 
see is that the spawn beacon will remain
there<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.940> what<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.020> lot<00:01:13.050> of<00:01:13.230> times<00:01:13.800> we<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.490> as

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
there so what a lot of times we do as

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.140 
there so what a lot of times we do as
far<00:01:15.120> as<00:01:15.480> a<00:01:15.510> team<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:16.410> will<00:01:16.830> throw<00:01:17.490> down<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.910> radio

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
far as a team we will throw down a radio

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.600 
far as a team we will throw down a radio
beacon<00:01:18.540> get<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> good<00:01:19.530> spawn<00:01:19.830> point<00:01:20.190> in<00:01:20.370> a<00:01:20.430> good

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
beacon get a good spawn point in a good

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.030 
beacon get a good spawn point in a good
location<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.300> then<00:01:21.750> select<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.380> different<00:01:22.800> kit

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
location and then select a different kit

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.730 
location and then select a different kit
that<00:01:23.580> spawn<00:01:23.940> beacon<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.600> remain<00:01:25.140> there<00:01:25.440> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that spawn beacon will remain there the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.650 
that spawn beacon will remain there the
entirety<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.700> game<00:01:27.000> as<00:01:27.150> long<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.570> not

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
entirety of the game as long as it's not

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.110 
entirety of the game as long as it's not
destroyed<00:01:28.110> or<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.440> long<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.890> don't<00:01:29.310> spawn

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
destroyed or as long as you don't spawn

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.470 
destroyed or as long as you don't spawn
back<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> Recon<00:01:31.230> class<00:01:31.410> so<00:01:32.160> that's<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
back in as a Recon class so that's the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.680 
back in as a Recon class so that's the
deal<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:34.140> being<00:01:34.410> outside<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:36.240> other<00:01:36.450> deal

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
deal with being outside the other deal

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.930 
deal with being outside the other deal
is<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.380> radio<00:01:37.650> beacon<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.190> that<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.790> can

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
is with the radio beacon is that you can

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.760 
is with the radio beacon is that you can
go<00:01:39.090> inside<00:01:39.690> a<00:01:39.750> building<00:01:40.230> and<00:01:40.410> lay<00:01:40.560> down<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
go inside a building and lay down the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.250 
go inside a building and lay down the
radio<00:01:41.070> beacon<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.910> do<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.390> then<00:01:43.110> you

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
radio beacon and if you do that then you

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.800 
radio beacon and if you do that then you
will<00:01:43.350> actually<00:01:43.830> spawn<00:01:44.130> inside<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.390> building

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
will actually spawn inside the building

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.350 
will actually spawn inside the building
so<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.860> both<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.160> their<00:01:47.700> advantages<00:01:47.910> and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so you both have their advantages and

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.760 
so you both have their advantages and
disadvantages

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770

you<00:01:50.070> might<00:01:50.550> have<00:01:50.640> seen<00:01:50.820> my<00:01:51.000> last<00:01:51.030> video<00:01:51.510> where

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you might have seen my last video where

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.500 
you might have seen my last video where
I<00:01:51.840> actually<00:01:52.050> used<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:53.040> outside<00:01:53.730> where<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> was

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
I actually used it outside where I was

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.270 
I actually used it outside where I was
able<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.810> parachute<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.470> behind<00:01:55.890> enemy<00:01:56.070> lines

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
able to parachute in behind enemy lines

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.040 
able to parachute in behind enemy lines
sneak<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:56.940> behind<00:01:56.970> them<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.390> works<00:01:57.750> great

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
sneak up behind them that works great

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.860 
sneak up behind them that works great
but<00:01:58.710> also<00:01:58.920> using<00:01:59.580> it<00:01:59.700> inside<00:02:00.150> a<00:02:00.180> building<00:02:00.540> also

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
but also using it inside a building also

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.230 
but also using it inside a building also
works<00:02:01.590> great<00:02:02.220> so<00:02:02.250> what<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.790> want<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.090> as

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
works great so what you want to do as

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.170 
works great so what you want to do as
far<00:02:03.450> as<00:02:03.480> a<00:02:03.660> few<00:02:03.840> tips<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:04.590> remember<00:02:04.820> lay<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.030> out

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
far as a few tips to remember lay it out

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.510 
far as a few tips to remember lay it out
near<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.050> objectives<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.039> works<00:02:08.310> in

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
near the objectives and this works in

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.360 
near the objectives and this works in
rush<00:02:08.970> or<00:02:09.300> conquest<00:02:09.950> whether<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.190> are

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
rush or conquest whether you are

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.270 
rush or conquest whether you are
attacking<00:02:11.879> or<00:02:12.239> defending<00:02:12.590> both<00:02:13.590> have<00:02:14.099> you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
attacking or defending both have you

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.039 
attacking or defending both have you
close<00:02:14.579> up<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.969> the<00:02:15.000> action<00:02:15.359> and<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.689> get<00:02:15.870> you

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
close up to the action and can get you

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:16.910 
close up to the action and can get you
back<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.409> there<00:02:16.620> and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
back in there and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.250 
back in there and
really<00:02:17.190> turn<00:02:17.400> around<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.790> game<00:02:18.020> it's<00:02:19.020> also

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
great on conquest especially like on

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.990 
great on conquest especially like on
really<00:02:22.800> tight<00:02:23.069> condensed<00:02:23.580> math<00:02:23.760> like

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000

not going to really pay attention and

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.670 
not going to really pay attention and
realize<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.600> maybe<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.080> have<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> beacon<00:03:10.500> in

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
realize that maybe you have a beacon in

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
realize that maybe you have a beacon in
there<00:03:10.890> because<00:03:11.130> you've<00:03:11.280> got<00:03:11.430> multiple

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
there because you've got multiple

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.110 
there because you've got multiple
entrances<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.840> exits<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.190> get<00:03:14.850> out

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
entrances and exits that you can get out

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.210 
entrances and exits that you can get out
of<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.959> building<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.530> can<00:03:16.709> really<00:03:17.040> use

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
of that building so you can really use

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.130 
of that building so you can really use
this<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.549> sneak<00:03:17.790> around<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.540> give<00:03:18.750> yourself

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
this to sneak around and give yourself

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.380 
this to sneak around and give yourself
an<00:03:19.230> advantage<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.860> your<00:03:20.100> team<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.850> win<00:03:21.120> on
