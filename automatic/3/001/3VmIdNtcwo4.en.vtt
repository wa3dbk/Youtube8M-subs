edge<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.280> there's<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.000> surface<00:01:30.240> area

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
edge is that there's the surface area

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.840 
edge is that there's the surface area
that<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> head<00:01:31.259> has<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.920> sit<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.430> shell<00:01:32.670> is

punchy tone and the sustain is not too
long<00:03:53.130> so<00:03:53.520> it's<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:54.060> don't<00:03:54.180> need<00:03:54.420> any<00:03:54.600> kind<00:03:54.840> of

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
long so it's you don't need any kind of

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.990 
long so it's you don't need any kind of
dampening<00:03:55.410> at<00:03:56.070> least<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.370> don't<00:03:56.430> think<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.820> do

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
dampening at least I don't think you do

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.940 
dampening at least I don't think you do
and<00:03:57.270> it's<00:03:57.510> just<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.870> got<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.020> great<00:03:58.290> tonal

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
and it's just you got a great tonal

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.010 
and it's just you got a great tonal
difference<00:03:59.250> between<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.640> Tom's<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.870> have

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
difference between the Tom's and I have

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.270 
difference between the Tom's and I have
the<00:04:01.110> snare<00:04:01.290> wires<00:04:01.410> off<00:04:01.650> right<00:04:01.860> now<00:04:01.980> obviously

the snare wires off right now obviously

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.710 
the snare wires off right now obviously

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
so you can kind of hear the pitch of

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:17.620 
so you can kind of hear the pitch of
everything<00:04:04.110> they<00:04:04.410> really<00:04:04.770> go<00:04:04.890> together<00:04:05.040> well
