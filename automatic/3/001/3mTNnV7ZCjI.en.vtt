00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
this is John Mendez with expert village

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.769 
this is John Mendez with expert village
I'm<00:00:04.380> going<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:05.040> mix<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:06.180> resin<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.690> the

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
I'm going to mix the resin and the

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.589 
I'm going to mix the resin and the
hardener<00:00:07.820> for<00:00:09.769> the<00:00:10.769> enamel<00:00:11.370> for<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> frame

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
hardener for the enamel for the frame

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.340 
hardener for the enamel for the frame
and<00:00:14.780> like<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.900> said<00:00:15.960> before<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:17.460> enamel<00:00:18.000> is

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
and like I said before the enamel is

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.650 
and like I said before the enamel is
when<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.470> mix<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.770> resin<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> hardener<00:00:20.699> plus

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
when you mix a resin and a hardener plus

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.800 
when you mix a resin and a hardener plus
a<00:00:22.020> pigment<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.130> then<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.000> bake<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.449> then<00:00:24.689> it

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
a pigment and then you bake it then it

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.250 
a pigment and then you bake it then it
becomes<00:00:25.080> an<00:00:25.230> enamel<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.699> equal<00:00:27.150> parts

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.110 

sometimes<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.590> pour<00:00:31.830> them<00:00:32.009> out<00:00:32.130> by<00:00:32.790> sight

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
sometimes you can pour them out by sight

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.150 
sometimes you can pour them out by sight
or<00:00:33.390> by<00:00:33.540> measuring<00:00:33.989> cup<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.920> use

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
or by measuring cup but I like to use

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.819 
or by measuring cup but I like to use
eyedroppers<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:37.020> way<00:00:37.230> you're<00:00:37.410> not<00:00:37.440> using

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
eyedroppers this way you're not using

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.250 
eyedroppers this way you're not using
too<00:00:38.460> much<00:00:38.760> because<00:00:39.090> whatever<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.690> don't<00:00:39.989> use

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
too much because whatever you don't use

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.680 
too much because whatever you don't use
is<00:00:40.620> gonna<00:00:40.829> cure<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:42.300> you've<00:00:42.450> wasted

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
is gonna cure and then you've wasted

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.979 
is gonna cure and then you've wasted
product<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:44.010> all<00:00:44.160> about<00:00:44.370> keeping<00:00:44.989> your

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
product so it's all about keeping your

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.369 
product so it's all about keeping your
costs<00:00:46.230> down<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.070> what<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.180> take<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
costs down so what I do is I take the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.569 
costs down so what I do is I take the
eye<00:00:49.410> dropper<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.219> fill<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:51.239> up<00:00:52.280> try<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.340> get

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
eye dropper and I fill one up try to get

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
eye dropper and I fill one up try to get
as<00:00:53.670> much<00:00:53.879> excess<00:00:54.390> off<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.809> off<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.680> as

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
as much excess off of off of it as

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.979 
as much excess off of off of it as
possible

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.950 

and<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.760> one<00:01:00.940> is<00:01:01.090> our<00:01:01.210> hardener<00:01:01.660> so<00:01:01.870> it

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
and this one is our hardener so it

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.209 
and this one is our hardener so it
doesn't<00:01:02.230> matter<00:01:02.350> which<00:01:02.590> one<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:02.890> start<00:01:02.950> with

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
doesn't matter which one you start with

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.750 
doesn't matter which one you start with
and<00:01:03.969> I<00:01:04.030> just<00:01:04.269> drop<00:01:04.510> in<00:01:04.809> as<00:01:05.740> many<00:01:05.950> drops<00:01:06.340> as<00:01:06.610> I

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
and I just drop in as many drops as I

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.410 
and I just drop in as many drops as I
want

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.609 

we'll<00:01:12.690> go<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.170> four

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
we'll go with four

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.190 
we'll go with four
and<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:17.060> want<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:17.359> keep<00:01:17.539> this<00:01:17.810> in<00:01:17.869> the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
and you want to keep this in the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.520 
and you want to keep this in the
hardener<00:01:18.649> because<00:01:19.070> if<00:01:19.219> you<00:01:19.340> use<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:21.350> other

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
hardener because if you use the other

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.859 
hardener because if you use the other
one<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:22.070> resin<00:01:22.399> with<00:01:22.759> it<00:01:22.969> in<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.659> same

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
one the resin with it in the same

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.349 
one the resin with it in the same
eyedropper<00:01:24.469> they'll<00:01:24.770> fuse<00:01:25.069> together<00:01:25.850> it'll

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
eyedropper they'll fuse together it'll

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.749 
eyedropper they'll fuse together it'll
just<00:01:26.780> Columbo<00:01:27.200> because<00:01:28.009> it'll<00:01:28.219> start<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.490> cure

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
just Columbo because it'll start to cure

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.730 
just Columbo because it'll start to cure
right<00:01:28.969> away<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:29.990> can<00:01:30.140> use<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.439> new

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
right away so you can use a new

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.209 
right away so you can use a new
eyedropper<00:01:31.750> for<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.619> resin<00:01:34.689> and<00:01:36.039> we'll<00:01:37.039> get

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
eyedropper for the resin and we'll get

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.279 
eyedropper for the resin and we'll get
four<00:01:37.520> drops<00:01:37.819> out<00:01:38.030> of<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:38.569> you'll<00:01:39.109> have

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
four drops out of that and you'll have

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:46.110 
four drops out of that and you'll have
an<00:01:39.409> equal<00:01:39.709> part

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.190 

and<00:01:47.120> you'll<00:01:47.390> want<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.720> mix<00:01:47.870> that<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.700> use<00:01:49.700> a

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
and you'll want to mix that I use a

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.950 
and you'll want to mix that I use a
wooden<00:01:51.200> stick

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.039 

and<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.560> mix<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.460> that

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and just mix that up like that

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.840 
and just mix that up like that
and<00:01:58.530> there<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:59.159> resin<00:01:59.700> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and there you have your resin and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.179 
and there you have your resin and
hardener
