00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.840
 insufficient insulation leads to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.580
 formation of thermal bridges that in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.320
 winter period increase 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.840
 further heat dispersion 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.700
 and in the summer they transmit more 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.340
 quickly the external heat 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.290
 inside the house the coat 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.930
 maintains wall temperatures 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.210
 perimeter on milder values ​​generating 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.250
 so an active thermal mass that 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.470
 positively influences the answer 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.630
 inertial of the building in addition to reducing 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.970
 heat loss the coat 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.940
 makes the behavior of the virtuous 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.309
 wall on the whole seasonal cycle in 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.530
 summer increasing the external insulation 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.449
 considerably decreases the influx of 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.059
 heat that would force you to use it 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.070
 intensive of air conditioners in 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.380
 winter the walls protected from the cold 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.050
 outside from the coat can establish 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.690
 thermal exchanges almost exclusively with 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.760
 the internal environment heated la 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.100
 compact and well shaved surface of the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.090
 coat is the ideal background because 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.810
 lite the ceramic material of only 3.5 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.940
 available in 27 colors divided into 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.710
 eight series technical features 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.170
 combined with aesthetic features 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.660
 of unique beauty make the slabs 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.850
 dycker lite perfectly suitable for the 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:41.910
 realization of systems coatings 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.530
 of coat certainly carli the system is 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.810
 a thermal insulation system a 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
 coat with microventilation that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.780
 thanks to the special mattress 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.410
 patented promotes drainage 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.390
 aeration and decoupling the

 system has a footprint of 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.620
 about 23 mm plus the thickness of the panel 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.540
 insulating 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.700
 before proceeding with the installation 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.820
 check the flatness of the wall 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.670
 in the raw state spread the adhesive 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.750
 directly on the insulating panel 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.970
 proceed with the installation of the panel 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.190
 insulator and wait for the layer to 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.590
 adhesive used is completely 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.810
 matured following the instructions of the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.880
 manufacturer lay a layer of 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.520
 glue and proceed with drowning 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.790
 there were mats passed by 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.160
 high down proceed with the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.500
 tessellation of the mat by spreading 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.950
 then another layer of glue for the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.290
 filling position the profile of 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.570
 base and leave to dry 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.820
 after a proper drying spread a 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.590
 another layer of adhesive proceed to 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.480
 drown the joint network and 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.600
 conclude this phase with shaving 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.030
 final check the flatness of the

 filling the joints and cleaning 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.160
 final there was carli the system is 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.100
 consisting of the following components
