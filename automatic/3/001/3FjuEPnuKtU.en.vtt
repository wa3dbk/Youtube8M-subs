and everybody in agreement that's right
ed<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:58.920> course<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.399> everybody<00:00:59.730> agrees<00:01:00.329> all

ed of course not everybody agrees all

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.460 
ed of course not everybody agrees all
the<00:01:00.840> time

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.980 

so<00:01:05.160> once<00:01:05.340> we<00:01:05.490> decide<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.480> do<00:01:06.630> we

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
so once we decide what we want to do we

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.290 
so once we decide what we want to do we
start<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.560> illustrator<00:01:08.250> maps<00:01:08.580> we'll<00:01:09.000> start

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
start to do illustrator maps we'll start

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.140 
start to do illustrator maps we'll start
to<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.570> basic<00:01:10.110> layouts<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.770> our<00:01:10.890> editor<00:01:11.150> just

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
to do basic layouts in our editor just

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.360 
to do basic layouts in our editor just
so<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.390> could<00:01:12.570> get<00:01:12.690> a<00:01:12.750> feel<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.440> scale<00:01:13.830> if

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
so we could get a feel for the scale if

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.730 
so we could get a feel for the scale if
it<00:01:14.610> looks<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.030> from<00:01:15.510> a<00:01:15.600> gamers<00:01:16.020> perspective

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it looks right from a gamers perspective

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.490 
it looks right from a gamers perspective
and<00:01:17.010> just<00:01:17.610> try<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.120> an<00:01:18.300> idea<00:01:18.690> for<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> kind

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
and just try to get an idea for the kind

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
and just try to get an idea for the kind
of<00:01:19.680> spaces<00:01:20.280> we're<00:01:20.490> gonna<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.060> deal<00:01:21.270> with

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
of spaces we're gonna have to deal with

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.290 
of spaces we're gonna have to deal with
we'll<00:01:22.410> start<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> gather<00:01:23.010> resource<00:01:23.640> material

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
we'll start to gather resource material

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.810 
we'll start to gather resource material
and<00:01:24.480> other<00:01:24.600> art<00:01:25.070> but<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.190> next<00:01:26.460> biggest<00:01:26.640> thing

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and other art but the next biggest thing

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.930 
and other art but the next biggest thing
that<00:01:27.060> happens<00:01:27.510> is<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.960> our<00:01:28.110> concepts

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
that happens is going to be our concepts

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.340 
that happens is going to be our concepts
that's<00:01:29.940> going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.330> give<00:01:30.540> us<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.810> roadmap<00:01:31.080> for

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that's going to give us a roadmap for

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.960 
that's going to give us a roadmap for
the<00:01:31.680> zone<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.490> give<00:01:32.670> us<00:01:32.790> our

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the zone it's going to give us our

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.290 
the zone it's going to give us our
colors<00:01:33.450> or<00:01:33.780> textures<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:35.280> our<00:01:35.400> trees<00:01:35.760> rocks

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
colors or textures what our trees rocks

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.330 
colors or textures what our trees rocks
and<00:01:36.630> things<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.350> look<00:01:37.500> like

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.280 

so<00:01:43.909> once<00:01:44.030> we<00:01:44.210> have<00:01:44.299> a<00:01:44.329> good<00:01:44.570> idea<00:01:44.689> from<00:01:45.140> our

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
so once we have a good idea from our

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.170 
so once we have a good idea from our
concepts<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:46.070> can<00:01:46.220> start<00:01:46.520> building<00:01:47.000> all<00:01:47.119> of

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
concepts we can start building all of

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.330 
concepts we can start building all of
these<00:01:47.420> little<00:01:47.869> items<00:01:48.140> trees<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:48.920> rocks<00:01:49.040> and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
these little items trees and rocks and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.249 
these little items trees and rocks and
what-have-you<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.060> our<00:01:50.450> exterior<00:01:50.810> level

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
what-have-you and our exterior level

00:01:51.259 --> 00:02:01.270 
what-have-you and our exterior level
designers<00:01:51.740> will<00:01:52.070> start<00:01:52.340> building<00:01:52.880> this<00:01:53.000> up

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.310 

it's<00:02:01.850> important<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.360> remember<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.810> every

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
it's important to remember that every

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.620 
it's important to remember that every
zone<00:02:03.530> we've<00:02:03.800> ever<00:02:04.070> done<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:04.550> Wow<00:02:04.730> has<00:02:05.270> been

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
zone we've ever done in Wow has been

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.690 
zone we've ever done in Wow has been
done<00:02:05.900> by<00:02:06.170> hand<00:02:06.500> everything<00:02:07.220> has<00:02:07.310> been<00:02:07.430> placed

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
done by hand everything has been placed

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.940 
done by hand everything has been placed
by<00:02:07.940> hand<00:02:07.970> every<00:02:08.420> tile<00:02:08.720> set<00:02:09.050> is<00:02:09.200> painted<00:02:09.710> and

by hand every tile set is painted and

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.270 
by hand every tile set is painted and
almost<00:02:10.820> all<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.420> items<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.110> zone<00:02:12.350> were

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
almost all of the items in the zone were

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.510 
almost all of the items in the zone were
created<00:02:13.880> for<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.480> zone<00:02:14.590> all<00:02:15.590> based<00:02:16.040> on<00:02:16.370> the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
created for that zone all based on the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:24.970 
created for that zone all based on the
color<00:02:16.730> concept

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.790

and<00:02:39.629> some<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.049> reasons<00:02:40.470> why<00:02:40.650> wow<00:02:40.920> looks<00:02:41.250> so

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
and some of the reasons why wow looks so

and some of the reasons why wow looks so
much<00:02:41.730> better<00:02:42.030> now<00:02:42.329> than<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.200> did<00:02:43.470> when<00:02:43.680> we

much better now than it did when we

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.819 
much better now than it did when we
first<00:02:44.099> shipped<00:02:44.930> it's<00:02:45.930> important<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.409> realize

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
first shipped it's important to realize

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
kind of put them together one of the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.449 
kind of put them together one of the
biggest<00:02:54.329> things<00:02:54.569> is<00:02:54.959> what<00:02:55.739> we<00:02:55.829> call<00:02:56.010> detail

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
biggest things is what we call detail

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.490 
biggest things is what we call detail
doodads<00:02:56.909> and<00:02:57.269> they're<00:02:57.599> like<00:02:57.750> little<00:02:57.930> grasses

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
doodads and they're like little grasses

and<00:02:58.680> things<00:02:58.859> we<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.159> put<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.579> ground<00:03:00.620> well

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
and things we can put in the ground well

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.759 
and things we can put in the ground well
currently<00:03:01.859> we<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.970> draw<00:03:03.180> many<00:03:03.510> more<00:03:03.870> detail

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
currently we can draw many more detail

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
could when we first shipped the game we

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.300 
could when we first shipped the game we
even<00:03:17.970> have<00:03:18.349> environment<00:03:19.349> textures<00:03:19.889> we<00:03:20.129> can

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
even have environment textures we can

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.250 
even have environment textures we can
paint<00:03:20.549> right<00:03:20.849> onto<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.239> ground<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.780> reflect

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
paint right onto the ground that reflect

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.539 
paint right onto the ground that reflect

the sky what you're seeing here is one

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.399 
the sky what you're seeing here is one
of<00:03:26.639> my<00:03:26.670> favorite<00:03:27.150> newer<00:03:27.329> features<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:28.349> is

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
of my favorite newer features this is

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.520 
of my favorite newer features this is
called<00:03:28.769> vertex<00:03:29.340> shading<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.569> lets<00:03:30.900> us<00:03:31.109> tint

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
called vertex shading this lets us tint

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.039 
called vertex shading this lets us tint
and<00:03:31.769> color<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.400> textures<00:03:32.909> in<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.599> way<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.959> was

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
and color the textures in a way that was

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.750 
and color the textures in a way that was
never<00:03:34.290> possible<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:35.099> tile<00:03:35.340> sets<00:03:35.670> alone

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
never possible the tile sets alone

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.350 
never possible the tile sets alone
as<00:03:37.209> some<00:03:37.480> before<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.080> apples

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.790 

but<00:03:44.930> probably<00:03:45.170> one<00:03:45.410> of<00:03:45.440> our<00:03:45.590> biggest

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
but probably one of our biggest

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.800 
but probably one of our biggest
improvements<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:46.670> saw<00:03:46.850> this<00:03:47.030> morning<00:03:47.240> is<00:03:47.630> our

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
okay but it never quite fit the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.960 
okay but it never quite fit the
painterly<00:03:53.240> look<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.690> wow<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:55.340> is<00:03:55.670> our<00:03:55.820> new

as<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:03.230> can<00:04:03.410> see<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:04.069> washes<00:04:04.700> up<00:04:04.880> on<00:04:05.060> shore<00:04:05.110> it

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
as you can see it washes up on shore it

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.230 
as you can see it washes up on shore it
distorts<00:04:06.740> objects<00:04:07.250> below<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.670> surfaces<00:04:08.120> that

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
distorts objects below the surfaces that

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.840 
distorts objects below the surfaces that
even<00:04:08.569> reflects<00:04:09.020> the<00:04:09.230> sky<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:09.890> not<00:04:10.340> only<00:04:10.610> is

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
even reflects the sky and not only is

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.240 
even reflects the sky and not only is
this<00:04:10.970> a<00:04:11.030> great<00:04:11.390> improvement<00:04:11.720> for<00:04:12.709> the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
this a great improvement for the
