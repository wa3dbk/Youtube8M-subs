00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.250
 undergraduate medical education should seek to cover the whole of 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.069
 underlying content the knowledge and skills you must possess as a doctor 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.069
 regardless of your professional orientation 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.860
 in this ambit 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.300
 We consider it important to use different teaching resources 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.840
 available in 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.020
 lario work 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.570
 laboratories inc and experience 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.960
 we will exhibit on this occasion the use of animal pools used as 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.640
 civilian human tissue 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.770
 in this case 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.000
 and he and particular 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.560
 teaching 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.520
 basic suture techniques 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.949
 they will represent different types of injuries and traumatisms 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.769
 that will put the students in front of different problematic situations to 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.800
 solve 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 with this video 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.650
 We hope to demonstrate convincingly the great utility and boxes that this resource 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.650
 education has shown after years of Castro experience 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.030
 the purpose of the application of this educational methodology 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.350
 it is to mention the future professional in a more common situation in the 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.440
 medical practice 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.470
 as is the execution of basic suture techniques 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.580
 elementary surgical tool that the student should handle properly 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.670
 during hospital practices in the sixth and seventh year of his career 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.480
 there are several types of suture 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.890
 these can be classified according to different criteria 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.429
 according to your stay 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.290
 according to the planes that cover 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.890
 according to the teacher 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.050
 and in this video not only karen particularly the last 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.100
 classification 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.300
 according to its continuity 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.810
 discontinuous 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.360
 within the points your continuous joseph unemployed we will have 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.680
 simple separate point 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.099
 and in them and in three points continued united we will find 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.379
 simple sunyer came up with last tips 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.379
 and suture entry 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.879
 to perform a suture we will specify the following 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.799
 minor surgery box 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.219
 sterile saval 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.219
 latex gloves them 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.090
 it must be taken into account that the suture threads must comply with the following 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.749
 Requirements 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.049
 sterility resistance 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.509
 flexibility to fascinate son and club security 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:41.509
 have a constant diameter 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.389
 It's smooth, it's easy 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.079
 knot firmly 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.439
 cause minimal tissue reaction 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.719
 have a predictable behavior 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.909
 and be economic 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.159
 the sites used in a suture 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.009
 can be grouped into two broad categories 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.549
 absorbable and non-absorbable 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.439
 at the same time 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.029
 The absorbable materials according to their origin can be 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:07.129
 natural pos inter 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.220
 among them stand out simple caputo 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.319
 synthetics are those made from polymers 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.569
 synthetic 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.840
 as an example we find 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.790
 polydactyly 910 whose trademark is the country 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.319
 and the sadón poliduct 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.549
 the mavs orbi a month are those that are not hydrolyzed judiciarios by the 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.109
 tissues 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.499
 so they are permanent 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.499
 in turn it can be multifilament monkey 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.589
 It is about high strength materials 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:45.769
 According to its origin it can be natural or synthetic 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.890
 the natural ones can be made of plant material 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.269
 like cotton or linen 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.909
 silk animal 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.590
 Homini Erario as being stainless steel 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.269
 hospital wire 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.269
 among the synthetic ones stand out 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:00.850
 polyethylene 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.969
 and polypropylene delivered 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:08.180
 then began by describing the technique of discontinuous sutures 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.879
 we call discontinuous sutures those that achieve approximation of the edges 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.029
 of the situation 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.139
 by placing points both separately 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.560
 In general, this type of suture has the following advantages. The case is 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.719
 complain loose his nose sitting it did not influence his remains the suture 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:29.200
 leave less amount of foreign bodies in my life 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.809
 therefore there is minor and julie &amp; julia 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:35.899
 the space between the stitches allows the drainage of abscesses and 

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:37.039
 bruises 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.149
 If there is tension in the suture due to inflammation, it is possible 

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:44.499
 solve it by extracting the whole world 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.219
 as soon as its advantages we must mention 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:51.080
 its biggest drawback is replacing more pending jobs 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.729
 and they are less the first executive 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.319
 within suture its continuous is distinguished first 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.749
 the simple point separated by being the technique its simplest basic cigar 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:02.860
 to perform 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.379
 At first Lérida's lips should be perfectly visualized 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.320
 to be able to be 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.610
 taken with an act in san mamés lose 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.749
 so that the needle can fulfill one as another fiction of the Cape referendums 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.380
 then proceed to the past needle through these engines what 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.879
 that can be done in one all time 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.669
 what will depend on the skill of the operator and the material used 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.600
 the needle must always be in the direction of the 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.630
 tip in order to produce the least possible damage to the shivering tissue 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.840
 traction tears can be done with both hands with the 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.319
 plastic clips as with the same spokesperson 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.999
 now we will proceed to make the announcement 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:49.270
 Although this can be done manually with instruments, we prefer the 

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:54.580
 second for being safer and more precise in this case the knot of lessons the simple 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.740
 to do it 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.270
 First the long end of the book is attached to the needle 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.050
 around the peace spokesman with two rounds 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.939
 that is to say 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:06.270
 they perform a double the roast over par 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.150
 with the portal is attached to the loose end and the ends are stretched to think the 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.509
 world in the same sense in which it was closed 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.650
 the same procedure is repeated 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.520
 in the opposite direction and with a smile 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.159
 on two more occasions to fix on me 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.319
 They stretch both out to cut the thread will be 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.710
 leaving this way 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.029
 two extremes 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:29.629
 as for the position 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.129
 everyone will try that 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.529
 2 always has indicators 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.090
 and not directly on it 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.319
 in order to avoid situations you 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:42.729
 situation that could give 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:43.580
 also 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.260
 must be taken into account in the walls, although they must be followed 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.319
 required 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:53.249
 they should not read too much as it would produce marks a correct 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:54.849
 performance efe 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.309
 julien plus or cut 

00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:01.539
 in this sense if you consider that a good functioning of the structure being 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.349
 the hand a sealed envelope 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:07.139
 avoiding that the same one is present the spill the spilled stolen 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:10.880
 we must bear in mind that it is not the situation 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.800
 the first stitch should be placed in half the length 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:19.580
 as directorial painted and the following points in the middle of each 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.770
 successive field 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.259
 of right is true 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:25.520
 well the points that were placed similarly 

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:29.989
 the next stitches will be applied within the maximum separation that 

00:07:29.989 --> 00:07:33.240
 consent a good face 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.240
 in which cases spit make a separate point 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.370
 being the simplest point to do this makes it universal 

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.900
 that is to say, it can be applied to almost all kinds of pathways while abstract sanz 

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.179
 irregular or with ties 

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:52.319
 It is used in both superficial and deep tissues but its use 

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:57.319
 is justified especially in planes of resistance for example wounds empiel and 

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:57.999
 aponeurosis
