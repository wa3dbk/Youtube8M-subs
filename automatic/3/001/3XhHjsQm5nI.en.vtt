color<00:07:05.770> that<00:07:05.890> I<00:07:06.040> saw<00:07:06.340> was<00:07:06.750> like<00:07:07.750> I<00:07:07.900> said<00:07:08.760> caramel

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:09.760 
color that I saw was like I said caramel

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.410

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:13.420 
and this is in a car cappuccino and I

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.020 
and this is in a car cappuccino and I
didn't<00:07:13.690> see<00:07:13.930> a<00:07:14.250> cappuccino<00:07:15.250> so<00:07:15.520> I<00:07:15.550> figured

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:22.510 
that maybe it's a match close to each

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.930 
that maybe it's a match close to each
other<00:07:23.400> so<00:07:24.540> this<00:07:25.540> is<00:07:25.720> it<00:07:25.930> you<00:07:26.080> guys<00:07:26.850> thank<00:07:27.850> you
