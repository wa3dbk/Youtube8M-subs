00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.440
 You can witness complicated losing 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.640
 which on the left since the how will 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.949
 always in the description and I stand 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.279

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.560
 So it is that I now just want 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.599
 now all the factions and then comes 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.910
 also soon with an update that often ago 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.710
 here before the snake but a 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.469
 few pictures you can look at and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.899
 yes here I am downloading it 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.570

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.239
 the latest video then on the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.760
 page because download now and the content 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.220
 should not start automatically here 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.650
 get it 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.450
 and then he just stood up to save 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.600
 this is how the strong one did it 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.510
 automatically so and then you should do so 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.140
 a file here is right there 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.350
 just twice 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.710
 Doubleclick is not only natural 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.710
 sure 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.750
 and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.750
 because it took a while 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.799
 if someone has only a few years 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.799
 public stop completely normal 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.130
 then i could just go to mac 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.860
 because he puts you the best desktop 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.360
 Shock has and these are both here 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.810

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.520

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.479

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:13.450

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:15.040
