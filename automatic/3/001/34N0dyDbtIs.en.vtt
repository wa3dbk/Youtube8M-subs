because<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.830> focal<00:02:12.250> point<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.700> closer<00:02:14.670> so

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
because the focal point is closer so

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.770 
because the focal point is closer so
once<00:02:15.940> you've<00:02:16.030> taken<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.360> out<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.600> can<00:02:16.630> throw

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
once you've taken it out you can throw

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.360 
once you've taken it out you can throw
this<00:02:17.050> away<00:02:19.440> I'll<00:02:20.440> pick<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.650> up<00:02:20.769> later<00:02:20.830> don't

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
this away I'll pick it up later don't

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.900 
this away I'll pick it up later don't
worry<00:02:23.070> you're<00:02:24.070> gonna<00:02:24.190> need<00:02:24.430> some<00:02:24.550> insulation

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
worry you're gonna need some insulation

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.770 
worry you're gonna need some insulation
tape<00:02:25.180> now<00:02:25.360> as<00:02:25.480> well<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:27.480> focusing<00:02:28.480> on<00:02:28.630> that

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
tape now as well so focusing on that

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.009 
tape now as well so focusing on that
right<00:02:30.510> bog-standard<00:02:31.510> insulation<00:02:32.350> tape<00:02:34.019> takes

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
right bog-standard insulation tape takes

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.520 
right bog-standard insulation tape takes
them<00:02:35.170> off<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.489> long<00:02:38.250> okay<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:41.380> then

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
them off but this long okay you then

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.110 
them off but this long okay you then
fold<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.040> half<00:02:42.070> it's<00:02:42.550> hard<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.790> do<00:02:42.940> this

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
fold it in half it's hard to do this

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.640 
fold it in half it's hard to do this
with<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:46.540> basically<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.230> fold<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.590> half

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
with but basically you fold it in half

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.180 
with but basically you fold it in half
okay<00:02:48.060> until<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.180> produces<00:02:49.600> something<00:02:49.810> like

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.270 

that<00:02:54.190> okay<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:56.140> then<00:02:56.290> cut<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.500> half<00:02:56.739> circle<00:02:56.980> out

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
that okay you then cut a half circle out

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.690 
that okay you then cut a half circle out
of<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.489> out<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.330> one<00:02:58.480> side<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.400> then<00:03:00.550> when

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
of it out of the one side so then when

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.190 
of it out of the one side so then when
you<00:03:00.790> open<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.209> back<00:03:01.360> up<00:03:01.420> again<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.900> makes<00:03:02.050> a

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
you open it back up again it makes a

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.570 
you open it back up again it makes a
hole<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.769> middle<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.100> insulation

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
hole in the middle of the insulation

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.250 
hole in the middle of the insulation
tape<00:03:03.700> unless<00:03:04.269> you're<00:03:04.450> really<00:03:04.540> talented<00:03:04.810> and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
tape unless you're really talented and

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.509 
tape unless you're really talented and
you<00:03:05.320> can<00:03:05.440> actually<00:03:05.560> cut<00:03:05.830> a<00:03:05.860> hole<00:03:06.070> with<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.340> knife

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
you can actually cut a hole with a knife

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.880 
you can actually cut a hole with a knife
that's<00:03:07.239> fine<00:03:07.450> but<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:08.650> should<00:03:08.769> produce

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
that's fine but you should produce

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.460 
that's fine but you should produce
something<00:03:09.220> like<00:03:09.489> this<00:03:09.640> okay

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.370 

so<00:03:12.950> then<00:03:13.100> what<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.310> do<00:03:13.400> then<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:15.110> that<00:03:15.170> you

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
so then what you do then is that you

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.720 
so then what you do then is that you
place<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.770> over<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:17.480> lens<00:03:19.810> like<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:21.730> okay

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
place it over the lens like this okay

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.510 
place it over the lens like this okay
gently<00:03:23.270> press<00:03:26.770> ok<00:03:27.770> so<00:03:27.860> then<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.190> lens<00:03:28.370> is

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
gently press ok so then the lens is

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.170 
gently press ok so then the lens is
actually<00:03:28.880> in<00:03:31.510> in<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.690> insulation<00:03:33.170> tape<00:03:33.290> okay

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
actually in in the insulation tape okay

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.030 
actually in in the insulation tape okay
and<00:03:35.180> now<00:03:35.360> here<00:03:35.540> comes<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.840> fun<00:03:36.080> bit<00:03:36.290> now

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
and now here comes the fun bit now

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.560 
and now here comes the fun bit now
remember<00:03:37.460> the<00:03:37.550> results<00:03:37.880> that<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.030> see<00:03:38.360> from

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
remember the results that you see from

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.630 
remember the results that you see from
this<00:03:39.020> one<00:03:39.260> they're<00:03:40.190> going<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> be<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.460> lot<00:03:40.610> more

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
this one they're going to be a lot more

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.250 
this one they're going to be a lot more
magnified<00:03:41.210> than<00:03:41.450> what<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.720> would<00:03:41.960> for<00:03:42.170> the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
a matter of sticking the lens over this

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.070 
a matter of sticking the lens over this
lens<00:04:10.070> like<00:04:10.280> that<00:04:10.490> okay<00:04:13.750> so<00:04:14.750> i<00:04:14.780> get<00:04:14.959> in<00:04:15.020> the

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
lens like that okay so i get in the

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.360 
lens like that okay so i get in the
right<00:04:15.230> position<00:04:15.560> without<00:04:15.680> actually<00:04:16.070> being

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
right position without actually being

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.860 
right position without actually being
able<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.640> see<00:04:16.790> what<00:04:16.940> i'm<00:04:17.030> doing<00:04:18.459> okay

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.240 

alright<00:04:22.870> that's<00:04:23.259> not<00:04:23.440> in<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.650> perfect<00:04:24.220> position

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
alright that's not in a perfect position

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.710 
alright that's not in a perfect position
but<00:04:24.789> it<00:04:24.940> will<00:04:25.030> be<00:04:25.060> enough<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.419> give<00:04:25.539> you<00:04:25.599> an

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
but it will be enough to give you an

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.050 
but it will be enough to give you an
idea<00:04:26.879> nice<00:04:27.879> and<00:04:28.060> then<00:04:28.150> once<00:04:28.300> you've<00:04:28.389> stuck<00:04:28.690> it

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
idea nice and then once you've stuck it

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
fingerprints okay oh and there's a bit

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.040 
fingerprints okay oh and there's a bit
of<00:04:46.419> fluffy<00:04:46.780> I<00:04:46.810> didn't<00:04:47.080> see<00:04:47.199> that<00:04:47.229> sorry<00:04:49.050> but

lens the focal point is going to be a

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.990 
lens the focal point is going to be a
lot<00:04:57.639> shorter<00:04:59.430> you<00:05:00.430> know<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:00.789> you're<00:05:00.909> never

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
lot shorter you know so you're never

lot shorter you know so you're never
going<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.300> be<00:05:01.360> at<00:05:01.449> the<00:05:01.539> gate<00:05:01.690> yeah<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:01.840> this

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
going to be at the gate yeah I this

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.189 
going to be at the gate yeah I this
close<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.830> actual<00:05:02.919> lens<00:05:03.220> okay<00:05:03.900> if<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:05.080> do

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
close to the actual lens okay if you do

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.360 
close to the actual lens okay if you do
your<00:05:05.409> mobile<00:05:05.650> phone<00:05:05.680> is<00:05:05.919> going<00:05:06.009> to<00:05:06.099> be<00:05:06.190> stuck

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
your mobile phone is going to be stuck

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.089 
your mobile phone is going to be stuck
to<00:05:06.400> your<00:05:06.580> eye<00:05:07.440> it's<00:05:08.440> about<00:05:10.680> it's<00:05:11.680> about<00:05:11.740> two

to your eye it's about it's about two

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:13.529 
to your eye it's about it's about two
millimeters<00:05:12.310> from<00:05:12.699> the<00:05:12.880> lens<00:05:13.030> at<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.240> moment

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
millimeters from the lens at the moment

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.540 
millimeters from the lens at the moment
my<00:05:13.630> fingers<00:05:14.020> so<00:05:14.830> that's<00:05:15.009> where<00:05:15.159> you<00:05:15.250> can<00:05:15.340> see

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:23.580 
my fingers so that's where you can see
my<00:05:15.729> fingerprints<00:05:16.300> all<00:05:16.719> right<00:05:19.139> thank<00:05:22.409> you<00:05:23.409> some

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
my fingerprints all right thank you some

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:30.779 
my fingerprints all right thank you some
better<00:05:25.500> yeah<00:05:26.500> right<00:05:29.219> trust<00:05:30.219> me<00:05:30.340> my<00:05:30.370> fingers

better yeah right trust me my fingers

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.089 
better yeah right trust me my fingers
look<00:05:31.509> relatively<00:05:31.900> clean<00:05:32.289> but<00:05:32.560> obviously<00:05:32.919> when

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
look relatively clean but obviously when

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.550 
look relatively clean but obviously when
you're<00:05:33.190> looking<00:05:33.460> in<00:05:33.550> between<00:05:34.560> your

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
you're looking in between your

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.820 
you're looking in between your
fingerprints<00:05:37.650> it's<00:05:38.650> not<00:05:38.860> quite<00:05:39.099> as<00:05:39.279> nice<00:05:40.830> you

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
fingerprints it's not quite as nice you

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.379 
fingerprints it's not quite as nice you
think<00:05:42.039> that's<00:05:42.219> bad<00:05:42.340> if<00:05:42.610> she<00:05:42.699> sees<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:43.210> should

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
think that's bad if she sees you should

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:51.330 
think that's bad if she sees you should
see<00:05:43.539> some<00:05:43.779> stuff

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.839 

ok

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.699 

so<00:05:55.449> this<00:05:55.569> is<00:05:55.599> simply<00:05:56.020> how<00:05:56.110> to<00:05:56.169> do<00:05:56.379> with<00:05:56.469> just<00:05:56.649> a

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:56.709 
so this is simply how to do with just a

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:59.189 
so this is simply how to do with just a
macro<00:05:57.009> lens<00:05:57.189> and<00:05:57.459> things<00:05:57.580> like<00:05:57.729> that<00:05:58.080> if<00:05:59.080> you

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 
macro lens and things like that if you

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.019 
macro lens and things like that if you
find<00:05:59.439> a<00:05:59.559> flat<00:05:59.770> lens<00:05:59.949> rather<00:06:00.309> than<00:06:00.459> a<00:06:00.520> dome<00:06:00.789> lens

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:01.029 
find a flat lens rather than a dome lens

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:02.850 
find a flat lens rather than a dome lens
then<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.869> focal<00:06:02.199> point<00:06:02.229> is<00:06:02.499> a<00:06:02.529> little<00:06:02.740> bit

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
then the focal point is a little bit

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.010 
then the focal point is a little bit
further<00:06:03.069> away<00:06:03.279> and<00:06:03.399> allows<00:06:03.819> you<00:06:03.999> to<00:06:04.179> do<00:06:04.330> your

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
further away and allows you to do your

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.639 
further away and allows you to do your
eyes<00:06:05.339> um<00:06:06.339> I<00:06:07.050> wouldn't<00:06:08.050> even<00:06:08.139> think<00:06:08.259> I'd<00:06:08.559> be

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:08.649 
eyes um I wouldn't even think I'd be

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:10.019 
eyes um I wouldn't even think I'd be
able<00:06:08.740> to<00:06:08.830> do<00:06:08.949> my<00:06:09.099> ailleurs<00:06:09.399> to<00:06:09.580> be<00:06:09.669> honest<00:06:09.879> I

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:10.029 
able to do my ailleurs to be honest I

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:23.580 
able to do my ailleurs to be honest I
laughs<00:06:10.209> as<00:06:10.360> he

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.370 

no<00:06:24.810> it's<00:06:25.810> too<00:06:25.930> close<00:06:26.170> so<00:06:27.960> if<00:06:28.960> you<00:06:29.050> need<00:06:29.170> to<00:06:29.260> know

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
no it's too close so if you need to know

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.750 
no it's too close so if you need to know
any<00:06:29.530> questions<00:06:30.120> who<00:06:31.120> answers<00:06:31.540> rather<00:06:32.760> and

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
any questions who answers rather and

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.400 
any questions who answers rather and
then<00:06:34.030> let<00:06:34.180> me<00:06:34.300> know<00:06:34.330> but<00:06:34.660> generally<00:06:35.080> if<00:06:35.320> you

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
then let me know but generally if you

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.110 
then let me know but generally if you
just<00:06:35.650> follow<00:06:36.040> the<00:06:36.220> procedure<00:06:36.550> of<00:06:36.730> taking<00:06:37.030> the

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
just follow the procedure of taking the

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.190 
just follow the procedure of taking the
lens<00:06:37.300> out<00:06:37.540> of<00:06:37.720> the<00:06:38.080> DVD<00:06:38.440> player<00:06:38.620> CD<00:06:38.950> player

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
lens out of the DVD player CD player

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.540 
lens out of the DVD player CD player
using<00:06:41.200> the<00:06:41.260> insulation<00:06:41.710> tape<00:06:41.830> method<00:06:42.070> or<00:06:42.400> you

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
using the insulation tape method or you

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.010 
using the insulation tape method or you
can<00:06:42.700> use<00:06:42.730> a<00:06:42.880> mobile<00:06:43.090> phone<00:06:43.420> case<00:06:43.660> and<00:06:43.870> drill<00:06:43.990> a

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
can use a mobile phone case and drill a

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.260 
can use a mobile phone case and drill a
hole<00:06:44.110> and<00:06:44.560> then<00:06:45.310> just<00:06:45.490> glue<00:06:45.730> the<00:06:45.910> the<00:06:46.120> actual

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
hole and then just glue the the actual

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.430 
hole and then just glue the the actual
lens<00:06:46.570> in<00:06:46.810> in<00:06:47.410> the<00:06:48.040> right<00:06:48.190> place<00:06:48.400> obviously<00:06:49.440> now

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
lens in in the right place obviously now

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.040 
lens in in the right place obviously now
all<00:06:50.620> works<00:06:50.830> the<00:06:50.950> same<00:06:50.980> but<00:06:51.400> it's<00:06:52.360> a<00:06:52.480> really

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
all works the same but it's a really

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.720 
all works the same but it's a really
good<00:06:53.260> way<00:06:53.380> of<00:06:53.410> actually<00:06:53.680> taking<00:06:54.010> macro<00:06:54.370> shots

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:54.730 
good way of actually taking macro shots

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.370 
good way of actually taking macro shots
of<00:06:54.910> things<00:06:55.120> you<00:06:55.420> know<00:06:55.540> there's<00:06:56.020> only<00:06:56.080> last

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
of things you know there's only last

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.640 
of things you know there's only last
month<00:06:56.470> I<00:06:56.710> actually<00:06:56.860> took<00:06:57.690> photos<00:06:58.690> of<00:06:58.720> spiders

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
month I actually took photos of spiders

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.450 
month I actually took photos of spiders
eggs<00:06:59.860> and<00:07:00.330> you<00:07:01.330> know<00:07:01.450> a<00:07:01.680> fruit<00:07:02.680> fly<00:07:02.830> head<00:07:03.220> and

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
eggs and you know a fruit fly head and

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.530 
eggs and you know a fruit fly head and
all<00:07:03.550> that<00:07:03.730> sort<00:07:03.880> of<00:07:03.970> stuff<00:07:04.030> you<00:07:04.270> know<00:07:04.390> it<00:07:04.510> just

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:04.540 
all that sort of stuff you know it just

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.150 
all that sort of stuff you know it just
depends<00:07:04.960> how<00:07:05.020> interested<00:07:05.650> you<00:07:05.680> out<00:07:05.830> about<00:07:06.010> it
