and<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.659> Drobo<00:00:03.840> at<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.110> same<00:00:04.290> time<00:00:04.529> but<00:00:04.650> I'm

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
and the Drobo at the same time but I'm

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.010 
and the Drobo at the same time but I'm
going<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.920> try<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.640> this<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.750> first

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
going to try and this is the first

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.129 
going to try and this is the first
generation<00:00:07.259> Drobo<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.670> pretty<00:00:08.940> heavy<00:00:09.150> this

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
generation Drobo it's pretty heavy this

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.810 
generation Drobo it's pretty heavy this
one<00:00:10.380> does<00:00:10.559> not<00:00:10.590> have<00:00:10.740> any<00:00:11.040> drives<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.730> I'm

actually going to set the mic down here

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.080 
actually going to set the mic down here
hopefully<00:00:15.900> that's<00:00:16.430> gonna<00:00:17.430> pick<00:00:17.699> up<00:00:17.880> good

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
hopefully that's gonna pick up good

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
has a magnetic front on it and you can

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.519 
has a magnetic front on it and you can
see<00:00:25.949> all<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> drive<00:00:26.609> bays<00:00:26.910> here<00:00:27.449> these<00:00:28.289> are

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529

here's the transformer in the court and
so<00:00:34.440> forth<00:00:35.329> it<00:00:36.329> would<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> good<00:00:37.020> doorstop

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
so forth it would make a good doorstop

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.760 
so forth it would make a good doorstop
make<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> good<00:00:39.180> doorstop<00:00:39.469> make<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> good

thing was unmounting on me then we had

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.969 
thing was unmounting on me then we had

the computer and then it would be good
for<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.689> while<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.259> then<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> would<00:01:52.740> be

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
for a while and then it would be

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.830 
for a while and then it would be
inconsistent<00:01:55.159> doesn't<00:01:56.159> give<00:01:56.460> confidence<00:01:56.880> ok

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
inconsistent doesn't give confidence ok

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.050 
inconsistent doesn't give confidence ok
so<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.110> would<00:01:58.259> stay<00:01:58.710> away<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.490> I'm<00:01:59.549> going<00:01:59.939> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
so I would stay away and I'm going to

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.660 
so I would stay away and I'm going to
stay<00:02:00.270> away<00:02:00.299> from<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.810> Drobo<00:02:01.049> from<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
stay away from the Drobo from now on and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.310 
stay away from the Drobo from now on and
I'll<00:02:02.909> tell<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.240> what<00:02:03.420> I'm<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.899> using

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
I'll tell you what I'm going to be using

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.080 
I'll tell you what I'm going to be using
I've<00:02:04.469> got<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:05.070> device<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.909> it's

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
I've got this little device that it's

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.029 
I've got this little device that it's
called<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.360> Voyager<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.350> can<00:02:07.530> put<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> hard

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
called a Voyager so you can put the hard

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.880 
called a Voyager so you can put the hard
drive<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.170> use<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
drive in and you can use it just like a

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.350 
drive in and you can use it just like a
regular<00:02:11.099> hard<00:02:11.550> drive<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.180> not

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
regular hard drive and it's not

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.320 
regular hard drive and it's not
proprietary<00:02:12.750> you

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
proprietary you

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.760 
proprietary you
