00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.680
 hi to all these guys today we get 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.309
 found for a tutorial in French 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.559
 so how do you save your screen on 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.270
 a mac and how to save your 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.000
 ipod or iphone iphone screen so 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.060
 of ios devices so first of all 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.609
 to record my screen mac I use 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.410
 the screenflow application so this is a 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.640
 application that will allow you so 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.439
 as I just said of course 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.559
 to record your screen but also 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.700
 to actually record everything there is 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.270
 on your screen in every 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.910
 applications 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.510
 it seems interfere ago 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.440
 apps that feels a bit chuggy 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.120
 I prefer to say it so it's for 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.370
 the screen then to save the screen 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.670
 an iphone is a little more not 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.649
 complicated but you have to know the method 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.730
 so just on your iphone 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.070
 ipad or ipod 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.850
 you will double click on the key 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.230
 space 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.439
 so as you know you're going 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.900
 have the media menu so you 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.850
 will see all the souls that are going on 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.860
 you go to the very left on the very left 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.350
 all the left where they are and there 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.790
 you see a small airplay icon you 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.640
 press you find your device 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.119
 so in man in this case and macbook 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.970
 pro from tom may ap ap ap 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.439
 and so here you see the screen of my 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.040
 iphone i start you in munich 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.299
 the double stick left and left and 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.119
 here is the little icon 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.380
 so you just have to do that for 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.540
 can see the trick after good if you 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.840
 want to record videos by 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.329
 game example what is it that me 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.369
 personally I use after I think 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.979
 that you can resize that's not 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.560
 like that, that's fine, that's fine 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.229
 I'm going to leave that so that's all 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.549
 what you need 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.719
 I'll tell you goodbye 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.060
 because in fact I am a little bit 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.549
 pressed m 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.920
 and so I told you everything so 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.920
