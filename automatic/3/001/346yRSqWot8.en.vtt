00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hey guys it is running back five and in

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.679 
hey guys it is running back five and in
today's<00:00:02.340> video<00:00:02.550> I'll<00:00:02.909> be<00:00:02.939> showing<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.480> on<00:00:03.659> how

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
today's video I'll be showing you on how

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.869 
today's video I'll be showing you on how
to<00:00:03.840> make<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.290> sticky<00:00:04.650> piston<00:00:05.100> door<00:00:05.310> the

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
to make the sticky piston door the

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.639 
to make the sticky piston door the
reason<00:00:06.180> why<00:00:06.299> I'm<00:00:06.420> remaking<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.290> because

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
reason why I'm remaking this is because

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.290 
reason why I'm remaking this is because
the<00:00:07.799> sticky<00:00:08.130> pistons<00:00:08.550> came<00:00:08.820> out<00:00:08.970> officially

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
the sticky pistons came out officially

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.419 
the sticky pistons came out officially
on<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.759> Minecraft<00:00:11.759> Update<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.679> circuit

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
on the Minecraft Update and the circuit

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.490 
on the Minecraft Update and the circuit
is<00:00:14.580> much<00:00:14.880> more<00:00:15.120> compact<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:16.109> what<00:00:16.260> we're<00:00:16.379> going

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
is much more compact so what we're going

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.230 
is much more compact so what we're going
to<00:00:16.529> do<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.890> start<00:00:17.130> off<00:00:17.279> by<00:00:17.430> making<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.820> three

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
to do is start off by making the three

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.109 
to do is start off by making the three
and<00:00:18.480> then<00:00:19.289> go<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:19.710> two<00:00:20.070> three<00:00:20.279> four<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and then go one two three four and

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.050 
and then go one two three four and
another<00:00:21.660> three<00:00:22.080> hi<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.789> looks<00:00:23.939> exactly

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
another three hi so it looks exactly

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.990 
another three hi so it looks exactly
like<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:25.340> now<00:00:26.340> we're<00:00:26.609> gonna<00:00:26.730> place<00:00:26.970> one

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
like that now we're gonna place one

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.060 
like that now we're gonna place one
block<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> middle<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> one<00:00:28.560> block<00:00:28.800> there

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
block in the middle and one block there

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.630 
block in the middle and one block there
this<00:00:29.250> time<00:00:30.500> one<00:00:31.500> block<00:00:31.710> there<00:00:32.009> one<00:00:32.250> block<00:00:32.520> in

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
this time one block there one block in

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.630 
this time one block there one block in
the<00:00:32.730> middle<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:34.050> end<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.980> block<00:00:35.219> that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the middle and you end as the block that

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
the middle and you end as the block that
you<00:00:35.790> want<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.120> use<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> door<00:00:36.930> I'm<00:00:37.350> gonna

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
you want to use for the door I'm gonna

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.160 
you want to use for the door I'm gonna
make<00:00:38.010> them<00:00:38.340> let's<00:00:39.239> make<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.450> lapis<00:00:39.899> lazuli<00:00:41.030> and

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
make them let's make it lapis lazuli and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.569 
make them let's make it lapis lazuli and
as<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> door<00:00:43.469> will<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:44.100> I'm<00:00:44.309> gonna<00:00:44.489> make

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
as a door will be here I'm gonna make

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.600 
as a door will be here I'm gonna make
the<00:00:44.910> frame<00:00:45.180> here<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.710> can't<00:00:46.980> see<00:00:47.190> all<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the frame here so you can't see all the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.220 
the frame here so you can't see all the
sticky<00:00:47.940> pistons<00:00:52.280> like<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.969> at<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> moment

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
sticky pistons like so and at the moment

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
sticky pistons like so and at the moment
the<00:00:55.289> sticky<00:00:55.590> pistons<00:00:56.010> aren't<00:00:56.460> touching<00:00:56.699> this

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the sticky pistons aren't touching this

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.279 
the sticky pistons aren't touching this
block<00:00:57.360> yet<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:59.300> the<00:01:00.300> pistons<00:01:01.050> are

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
block yet so now as the pistons are

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.810 
block yet so now as the pistons are
gonna<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> mean<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> Pistons<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
gonna be I mean not the Pistons the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.270 
gonna be I mean not the Pistons the
pressure<00:01:03.120> plates<00:01:03.480> are<00:01:03.660> gonna<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.159> are

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
pressure plates are gonna be here so are

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.030 
pressure plates are gonna be here so are
we<00:01:05.400> gonna<00:01:05.549> dig<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> trenches<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.659> yep<00:01:07.040> need

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
we gonna dig the trenches out yep need

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.270 
we gonna dig the trenches out yep need
turn<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.460> sound<00:01:08.820> down<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> bit<00:01:10.130> okay<00:01:11.130> it's

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.850 
turn that sound down a bit okay it's
going<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.939> I'm<00:01:12.750> gonna<00:01:12.900> turn<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
going like that I'm gonna turn it up a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.200 
going like that I'm gonna turn it up a
bit<00:01:13.890> long<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.760> hear<00:01:15.000> it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
bit long so I can hear it

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.360 
bit long so I can hear it
okay<00:01:17.210> now<00:01:17.750> dig<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.290> one<00:01:18.410> under<00:01:18.680> there<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.070> put

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
okay now dig the one under there and put

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.300 
okay now dig the one under there and put
a<00:01:19.400> redstone<00:01:19.850> torch<00:01:20.560> do<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.710> same<00:01:21.980> on<00:01:22.160> this

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
a redstone torch do the same on this

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.600 
a redstone torch do the same on this
side

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
side

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.320 
side
dig<00:01:23.360> there<00:01:23.540> put<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.810> redstone<00:01:24.020> torch<00:01:24.910> now<00:01:25.910> dig

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
dig there put a redstone torch now dig

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.370 
dig there put a redstone torch now dig
this<00:01:26.630> one<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.260> it's<00:01:27.410> two<00:01:27.710> down<00:01:28.900> all<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.170> way<00:01:30.320> to

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
this one so it's two down all the way to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.920 
this one so it's two down all the way to
the<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.830> already<00:01:31.190> stone<00:01:31.460> one<00:01:31.670> make<00:01:32.630> sure<00:01:32.660> you

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
the of already stone one make sure you

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.010 
the of already stone one make sure you
can<00:01:33.080> get<00:01:33.230> out<00:01:33.410> and<00:01:34.360> then<00:01:35.360> under<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.780> pressure

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
can get out and then under the pressure

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.620 
can get out and then under the pressure
plates<00:01:36.350> we're<00:01:36.830> gonna<00:01:36.980> put<00:01:37.280> two<00:01:37.640> gap<00:01:37.910> then

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
plates we're gonna put two gap then

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.660 
plates we're gonna put two gap then
regredi<00:01:39.080> stone<00:01:39.500> out<00:01:39.820> along<00:01:40.820> here<00:01:41.120> to<00:01:41.300> this<00:01:41.840> one

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
regredi stone out along here to this one

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.219 
regredi stone out along here to this one
along<00:01:43.670> here<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:45.050> this<00:01:45.170> one<00:01:45.230> and<00:01:46.030> then<00:01:47.229> redstone

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
along here to this one and then redstone

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.560 
along here to this one and then redstone
here<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.950> here<00:01:49.700> now<00:01:50.540> both<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:50.870> these<00:01:51.110> will

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
here and here now both of these will

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.490 
here and here now both of these will
extrude<00:01:53.570> again<00:01:54.050> extrude<00:01:54.979> if<00:01:55.160> it<00:01:55.310> yep<00:01:56.260> good<00:01:57.260> I'm

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
extrude again extrude if it yep good I'm

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.450 
extrude again extrude if it yep good I'm
just<00:01:58.690> lost<00:01:59.690> for<00:02:00.020> words<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.560> would<00:02:00.619> say<00:02:02.229> now<00:02:03.460> if

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
just lost for words I would say now if

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.540 
just lost for words I would say now if
you've<00:02:04.610> done<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:04.760> right<00:02:04.910> it<00:02:05.270> will<00:02:05.390> work<00:02:06.550> maybe

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
you've done it right it will work maybe

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.100 
you've done it right it will work maybe
you<00:02:07.700> want<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:07.940> put<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.240> pressure<00:02:08.479> plates<00:02:08.810> one

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
you want to put the pressure plates one

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.960 
you want to put the pressure plates one
more<00:02:09.320> out<00:02:09.530> since<00:02:09.920> it's<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.340> bit<00:02:10.490> of<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.670> delay<00:02:10.940> on

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
more out since it's a bit of a delay on

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.290 
more out since it's a bit of a delay on

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
the bottom ones don't know why that is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.790 
the bottom ones don't know why that is
and<00:02:14.300> now<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.380> side<00:02:19.060> as<00:02:20.709> we're<00:02:21.709> gonna

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
and now for this side as we're gonna

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.460 
and now for this side as we're gonna
have<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.070> pressure<00:02:22.310> plates<00:02:22.640> here<00:02:23.350> put<00:02:24.350> them

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
have the pressure plates here put them

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.070 
have the pressure plates here put them
in<00:02:24.590> here<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:25.010> then<00:02:25.910> put<00:02:26.120> redstone<00:02:26.330> under<00:02:26.840> here

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
in here and then put redstone under here

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.590 
in here and then put redstone under here
you<00:02:28.070> can<00:02:28.220> have<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.489> all<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.209> or<00:02:29.390> just

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
you can have it all like that or just

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.120 
you can have it all like that or just
one<00:02:29.840> line<00:02:30.080> I'm<00:02:30.290> gonna<00:02:30.440> have<00:02:30.530> one<00:02:30.680> line<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.070> I

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
one line I'm gonna have one line so I

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.470 
one line I'm gonna have one line so I
can<00:02:31.310> get<00:02:31.430> back<00:02:31.550> out<00:02:36.640> there<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:37.670> go<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.330> a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
can get back out there you go that is a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.720 
can get back out there you go that is a
sticky<00:02:38.750> piston<00:02:39.260> door<00:02:39.440> it's<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.739> much<00:02:40.010> much<00:02:40.400> much

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
sticky piston door it's a much much much

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.570 
sticky piston door it's a much much much
smaller<00:02:41.360> much<00:02:42.200> much<00:02:42.440> more<00:02:42.680> smaller<00:02:43.010> design

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
smaller much much more smaller design

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.610 
smaller much much more smaller design
than<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.269> other<00:02:44.450> sticky<00:02:44.900> piston<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
than the other sticky piston on the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.530 
than the other sticky piston on the
sticky<00:02:45.950> piston<00:02:46.340> mod<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:46.880> yeah<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.330> is<00:02:47.360> it

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
sticky piston mod so yeah that is it

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.160 
sticky piston mod so yeah that is it
