00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:03.959
 sandy petra hiroaki to the office because I'm very worried about you 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.380
 I see that you still do not speak languages ​​yet you have plenty of time in 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.349
 this church 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.999
 casually pastor I am also a little worried but it is that neither the 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:14.059
 congregation 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.210
 I see that you tell the congregation to speak languages ​​to everyone at the same 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.619
 time however the scriptures say that they should only speak two or maximum 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.939
 three at a time and that one by one 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.349
 mérida sam and sandy how should I run the church 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.070
 I just tell you what the scriptures say about languages 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.790
 in the apostle Paul's letter to the Corinthians he says that some 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.840
 language unknown if it is for two pigeons 3 and per turn and an interpreter 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.120
 however, you encourage everyone to speak at the same time because this process 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.220
 pastor if the bible says it should be done by phone 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.190
 look sandy of that spirit of tongues is present I minister of the gift for 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.830
 what did I fall for the congregation 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.510
 In addition, if they do not receive the gift of languages ​​it is because they have not received the help of the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.510
 holy spirit and that's what I want you to be filled with the spirit 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.209
 the Lord Jesus Christ will be full of the spirit admitted and without measure 

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:03.759
 however, that they did not speak languages ​​is not for the artist and the bible 

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:07.180
 says the also deceased of the spirit of god from the womb of his mother 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 sandy because you always oppose what is established in the church 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.110
 it's not me I had everything 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 are the scriptures that he opposes and invites the whole congregation 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.910
 do the same 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.300
 say the scriptures that without the interpreter one should shut up 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.630
 and in those of deluding and never interpreting any of their languages ​​or 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.750
 those of anyone in the congregation 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.270
 However, knowing that nobody interprets them, they continue saying that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.310
 speak in tongues 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.730
 months is obeying the scriptures 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.490
 sandy people need to have something to believe in to be able to motivate being in 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.000
 church 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.860
 the scriptures are not enough 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.920
 to which you are proposing 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.190
 I am not opposed to the andy scriptures 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.130
 but pastor 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.780
 because he tells people to speak the language when there is nobody 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.720
 interpreter 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.600
 because there are different kinds of language 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.900
 and those are the private language between us and god so that the devil does not 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.590
 know what we are talking about 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.570
 but if you yourself do not know what you are talking about as the devil is going to know 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.670
 the word says it 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.490
 and if the trumpet speaks or uncertain who is perceived for the battle 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.270
 what is the use of speaking without understanding besides pastor Pablo says that the church 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.590
 he preferred to speak five words with his understanding to teach also 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.329
 other than 10 thousand words in an unknown language 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.599
 Sandy, you're making me nervous 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.709
 also pastor 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.659
 they say first of Corinthians 14 22 that the languages ​​are reviewed not to the 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.379
 Believers if I unbelievers plus prophecy not to unbelievers if I 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.969
 believers and the languages ​​that they practice in the church are not of testimony any 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.790
 incredulous because there is no interpreter for proof that God is 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.039
 there as editor pablo think that we are crazy 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.349
 if we are crazy it is for Christ 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.269
 if you are 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.360
 We all say that but this is true madness and I am 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.399
 worrying 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.639
 that's why you do not speak yet in tongues 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.490
 I will look at the pastor because those are not the languages ​​of the Bible 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.310
 the languages ​​in the bible were languages ​​is more day that we follow here in the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.060
 tell me to have a pastor if we have the gift of tongues in the church because 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.420
 the brother who can be a missionary to the Chinese we have to send money so that 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.029
 study the chinese language 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.459
 they do not have that on top that the church had 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.380
 seoane I must take care of him 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.219
 we'll talk another time 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.159
 he always detests me
