logged pink cat and stealth cat those
are<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.420> only<00:01:42.540> cats<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:42.990> unlocked<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.380> far

but<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.579> will<00:01:44.909> admit<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.329> easier<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.750> play<00:01:45.930> on

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.230 
but I will admit it's easier to play on
iPads<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.189> kind<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.579> challenging<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.030> play<00:01:48.180> on

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
iPads it's kind of challenging a play on

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.340
