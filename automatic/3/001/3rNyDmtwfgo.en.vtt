00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.829 
daredevil born again storyline I'm not
sure<00:00:14.370> if<00:00:14.460> he's<00:00:14.610> showing<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:14.969> anywhere<00:00:15.599> else

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
sure if he's showing up anywhere else

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.519 
sure if he's showing up anywhere else
since<00:00:16.160> I<00:00:17.160> think<00:00:17.460> he<00:00:17.730> was<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.029> ultimate<00:00:18.990> Captain

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
since I think he was in ultimate Captain

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.160 
since I think he was in ultimate Captain
America<00:00:20.270> but<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.300> don't<00:00:21.510> know<00:00:21.600> if<00:00:21.689> he's<00:00:21.869> showing

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
America but I don't know if he's showing

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560 
America but I don't know if he's showing
up<00:00:22.320> since<00:00:22.590> born<00:00:22.890> again<00:00:23.180> one<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> really

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
up since born again one of the really

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.120 
up since born again one of the really
interesting<00:00:24.600> things<00:00:25.230> that's<00:00:25.470> that's<00:00:25.680> done<00:00:25.980> in

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
interesting things that's that's done in

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.609 
interesting things that's that's done in
this<00:00:26.570> it<00:00:27.570> seems<00:00:27.810> like<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.170> minor<00:00:28.349> note

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
this it seems like a really minor note

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.660 
this it seems like a really minor note
but<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.859> want<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> bring<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> don't

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
but I want to bring it up so I don't

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.709 
but I want to bring it up so I don't
forget<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:31.040> nuke<00:00:32.059> clearly<00:00:33.059> still<00:00:33.390> served

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
forget is that nuke clearly still served

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.370 
forget is that nuke clearly still served
in<00:00:33.930> Vietnam<00:00:35.149> but<00:00:36.149> they've<00:00:36.329> changed<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
in Vietnam but they've changed it to a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.080 
in Vietnam but they've changed it to a
fictional<00:00:37.800> war<00:00:38.780> what<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> mean<00:00:40.020> by<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.200> is

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
fictional war what I mean by that is

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.270 
fictional war what I mean by that is
obviously<00:00:42.090> they<00:00:42.300> can't<00:00:42.600> say<00:00:43.079> he<00:00:43.440> served<00:00:44.040> in

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
obviously they can't say he served in

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.040 
obviously they can't say he served in
Vietnam<00:00:44.420> because<00:00:45.800> that<00:00:46.800> was<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> long<00:00:47.370> time<00:00:47.670> ago

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
Vietnam because that was a long time ago

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.850 
Vietnam because that was a long time ago
like<00:00:49.050> forty<00:00:49.530> years<00:00:49.829> ago<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:51.079> it's<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.230> fictional

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
like forty years ago so it's a fictional

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.740 
like forty years ago so it's a fictional
it's<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.640> fictional<00:00:53.969> war<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> fictional

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
it's a fictional war in a fictional

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.020 
it's a fictional war in a fictional
location<00:00:57.590> but<00:00:58.590> everything<00:00:59.010> he<00:00:59.160> talks<00:00:59.820> about

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
location but everything he talks about

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.209 
location but everything he talks about
everything<00:01:00.420> he<00:01:00.480> says<00:01:00.809> about<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.289> war<00:01:01.559> it's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
everything he says about that war it's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.910 
everything he says about that war it's
clearly<00:01:02.879> Vietnam<00:01:03.539> which<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.680> thought<00:01:04.799> was

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
clearly Vietnam which I thought was

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.090 
clearly Vietnam which I thought was
interesting<00:01:05.330> as<00:01:06.330> opposed<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.409> maybe<00:01:07.740> trying

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
interesting as opposed to maybe trying

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.090 
interesting as opposed to maybe trying
to<00:01:08.220> update<00:01:08.340> him<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.240> making<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:11.040> know

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
to update him and making it you know

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.560 
to update him and making it you know
like<00:01:11.220> an<00:01:11.369> Iraq<00:01:11.670> thing<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.240> something<00:01:12.510> like

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
like an Iraq thing or something like

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.630 
like an Iraq thing or something like
that<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.439> think<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:13.770> actually<00:01:14.159> rather

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that and I think that's actually rather

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
that and I think that's actually rather
smart<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.979> what<00:01:18.140> what<00:01:19.140> Remender<00:01:19.409> wants

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
smart because what what Remender wants

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.920 
smart because what what Remender wants
to<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.159> them<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.520> think<00:01:20.909> fits<00:01:21.420> better<00:01:21.630> with

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
to do with them I think fits better with

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.460 
to do with them I think fits better with
a<00:01:21.960> Vietnam<00:01:22.560> type<00:01:23.009> war<00:01:23.340> than<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.509> current<00:01:25.259> wars

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a Vietnam type war than the current wars

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
a Vietnam type war than the current wars
we<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.740> going<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.310> right<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:29.240> this<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
we have going on right now this is a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.640 
we have going on right now this is a
really<00:01:31.290> really<00:01:32.090> interesting<00:01:33.090> book<00:01:33.270> because

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
really really interesting book because

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.510 
really really interesting book because
it's<00:01:34.650> called<00:01:34.950> nuke<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:36.650> about<00:01:37.650> new<00:01:38.009> kind

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it's called nuke and it's about new kind

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.649 
it's called nuke and it's about new kind
of<00:01:39.200> but<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.380> such<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> strange<00:01:41.340> story<00:01:42.619> because

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
of but it's such a strange story because

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.179 
of but it's such a strange story because
obviously<00:01:45.659> kept<00:01:46.170> America<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:46.649> back<00:01:46.920> from

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
obviously kept America is now back from

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.940 
obviously kept America is now back from
dimension<00:01:47.610> Z<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.509> he's<00:01:48.720> been<00:01:49.020> there<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.740> ten

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
dimension Z but he's been there for ten

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.380 
dimension Z but he's been there for ten
years<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.170> he's<00:01:52.170> lost<00:01:52.470> his<00:01:52.740> son<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.390> his

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
years and he's lost his son and his

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.670 
years and he's lost his son and his
fiancee<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.409> he<00:02:01.530> gets

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
fiancee and so this is like like he gets

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.469 
fiancee and so this is like like he gets
back<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.219> then<00:02:02.430> he<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.729> immediately<00:02:03.060> goes

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
back and then he just immediately goes

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.200 
back and then he just immediately goes
into<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> mission<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.920> Falcons<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.549> too<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
into a mission and Falcons there too and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.109 
into a mission and Falcons there too and
Zola's<00:02:06.990> daughter<00:02:07.920> has<00:02:08.250> come<00:02:08.550> back<00:02:08.729> with<00:02:08.940> them

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
Zola's daughter has come back with them

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.119 
Zola's daughter has come back with them
and<00:02:09.840> there's<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.050> lot<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.200> fun<00:02:10.410> stuff<00:02:10.560> with<00:02:10.830> her

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
and there's a lot of fun stuff with her

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.790 
and there's a lot of fun stuff with her
and<00:02:11.370> her<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.090> adjusting

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
and her kind of adjusting

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.600 
and her kind of adjusting
but<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:15.030> interesting<00:02:15.210> because<00:02:16.610> Remender

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
but it's interesting because Remender

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.960 
but it's interesting because Remender
essentially<00:02:18.390> sets<00:02:18.870> up<00:02:22.280> like<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.730> almost

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
essentially sets up like a like a almost

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.670 
essentially sets up like a like a almost
like<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.210> Regenesis<00:02:24.780> for<00:02:24.990> Captain<00:02:25.650> America

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
like a Regenesis for Captain America

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.850 
like a Regenesis for Captain America
like<00:02:26.520> now<00:02:26.700> he's<00:02:27.060> once<00:02:27.720> again<00:02:27.900> unmanned<00:02:28.590> out<00:02:28.770> of

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
like now he's once again unmanned out of

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
you would think that the immediate next

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.300 
you would think that the immediate next
storyline<00:03:15.270> would<00:03:15.450> be<00:03:15.600> about<00:03:16.590> cap<00:03:16.950> kind<00:03:17.190> of

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
storyline would be about cap kind of

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.040 
storyline would be about cap kind of
dealing<00:03:17.670> with<00:03:17.700> being<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.180> man<00:03:18.360> at<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.510> time<00:03:18.780> and

dealing with being a man at a time and
there's<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.890> little<00:03:20.130> bit<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.489> but<00:03:20.670> it's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
there's a little bit of that but it's

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.660 
there's a little bit of that but it's
also<00:03:21.030> very<00:03:21.510> much<00:03:21.720> like<00:03:21.890> well<00:03:22.890> I've<00:03:23.040> kind<00:03:23.520> of
