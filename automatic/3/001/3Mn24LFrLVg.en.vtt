the top coat i find that the maybelline
one<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.269> works<00:00:24.449> ok<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> purpose<00:00:25.500> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
one it works ok for the purpose it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.220 
one it works ok for the purpose it
doesn't<00:00:25.920> stain<00:00:26.130> my<00:00:26.160> nails<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.000> acts<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.199> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
doesn't stain my nails and it acts as a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.990 
doesn't stain my nails and it acts as a
base<00:00:28.439> coat<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.800> protects<00:00:29.160> my<00:00:29.369> actual<00:00:29.820> nail

base coat and protects my actual nail
from<00:00:30.269> staining<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.480> just<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.750> color

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
from staining so this is just a color

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.389 
from staining so this is just a color
that<00:00:34.110> I'm<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> use<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.829> tutorial

that I'm going to use for the tutorial
and<00:00:35.579> sash<00:00:36.300> feet<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.840> really<00:00:37.500> recommend<00:00:37.680> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and sash feet I really recommend this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.090 
and sash feet I really recommend this
some<00:00:38.940> people<00:00:39.149> who<00:00:39.270> are<00:00:39.360> allergic<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:40.100> toluene

some people who are allergic to toluene

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.310 
some people who are allergic to toluene
might<00:00:41.670> not<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.480> might<00:00:42.690> not<00:00:42.840> work<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.260> you

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
but for a vast majority of people this

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
but for a vast majority of people this
is<00:00:45.809> probably<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.350> best<00:00:46.890> goat<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.579> hands

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910

is probably the best goat like hands
down<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> best<00:00:49.140> faster<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> topcoats

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that so okay let's get started so I

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.939 
that so okay let's get started so I
already<00:00:57.510> painted<00:00:57.989> my<00:00:58.199> nails<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> base

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
already painted my nails with the base

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.889 
already painted my nails with the base
coat<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.460> let<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.760> dry<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.510> want<00:01:00.809> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
coat and I let it dry so you want to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.240 
coat and I let it dry so you want to
make<00:01:00.930> sure<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> base<00:01:01.680> coat<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.039> dry

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
make sure that the base coat is dry

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.560 
make sure that the base coat is dry
before<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.730> actually<00:01:02.910> start<00:01:03.120> applying

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
before you actually start applying

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.870 
before you actually start applying
polish<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.290> otherwise<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.369> starts

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
polish because otherwise it starts

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.420 
polish because otherwise it starts
bubbling<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:06.960> weird<00:01:07.350> patterns<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
bubbling and you get weird patterns and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.660 
bubbling and you get weird patterns and
stuff<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.790> your<00:01:08.909> nails<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.450> nobody<00:01:09.869> wants<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
stuff on your nails so nobody wants that

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.190 
stuff on your nails so nobody wants that

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.020 
happy-go-lucky from there up and away
collection<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:17.340> much<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.880> what

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
collection so pretty much this is what

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.179 
collection so pretty much this is what
you're<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.170> scrape<00:01:19.770> off<00:01:19.950> as

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you're going to do you scrape off as

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.490 
you're going to do you scrape off as
much<00:01:20.430> access<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.229> have

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
much access as you can so you have

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.580 
much access as you can so you have
probably<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.400> much<00:01:23.580> polish<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.530> on<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
probably that much polish on your on the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.160 
probably that much polish on your on the
brush<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:26.610> you're<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> start

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
brush and then you're going to start

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.330 
brush and then you're going to start
from<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.299> close<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> cuticles<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.619> your

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
from as close to the cuticles as your

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.249 
from as close to the cuticles as your
nail<00:01:32.520> bed<00:01:32.759> goes<00:01:33.000> all<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.900> you're<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.079> going

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
nail bed goes all and you're just going

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.830 
nail bed goes all and you're just going
to<00:01:34.350> swipe<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.340> brush<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.150> pretty<00:01:36.659> much

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to swipe the brush like that pretty much

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.700 
to swipe the brush like that pretty much
three<00:01:37.229> even<00:01:37.619> strokes<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:40.229> first<00:01:40.470> coat<00:01:40.680> is

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
three even strokes and the first coat is

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.730 
three even strokes and the first coat is
probably<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.280> pretty<00:01:41.340> streaky<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
probably going to be pretty streaky and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.910 
probably going to be pretty streaky and
you<00:01:43.740> want<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.009> remove<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:44.549> lint<00:01:47.840> fabulous<00:01:48.920> so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
you want to remove all lint fabulous so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.289 
you want to remove all lint fabulous so
it's<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> little<00:01:50.670> streaky<00:01:51.149> which

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
it's going to be a little streaky which

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.880 
it's going to be a little streaky which
