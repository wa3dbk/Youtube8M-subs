hi<00:00:00.299> my<00:00:00.510> name<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.690> Michael<00:00:01.199> Raines<00:00:01.350> and<00:00:01.620> I'm

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hi my name is Michael Raines and I'm

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.770 
hi my name is Michael Raines and I'm
with<00:00:01.860> expert<00:00:01.890> village<00:00:02.639> we're<00:00:03.389> also<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.720> to

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
with expert village we're also going to

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.749 
with expert village we're also going to
be<00:00:03.870> running<00:00:04.080> 12<00:00:04.440> volts<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:04.890> current<00:00:04.950> through

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
be running 12 volts of current through

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.419 
be running 12 volts of current through
it<00:00:05.790> at<00:00:06.770> well<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:08.040> lot<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.519> amps<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.450> amps<00:00:09.870> are

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
it at well a lot of amps the amps are

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.650 
it at well a lot of amps the amps are
basically<00:00:11.429> controlled<00:00:12.000> by<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.240> amount<00:00:12.509> of

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
basically controlled by the amount of

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.140 
basically controlled by the amount of
electrolyte<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:13.920> put<00:00:14.160> into<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.910> water

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
electrolyte that we put into the water

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.080 
electrolyte that we put into the water
but<00:00:16.139> we'll<00:00:16.500> get<00:00:16.710> into<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:17.850> bit

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
but we'll get into that in a little bit

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.820 
but we'll get into that in a little bit
we<00:00:19.020> need<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.439> now<00:00:19.619> add<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.640> gauge<00:00:21.119> set<00:00:21.830> what

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
we need to now add on a gauge set what

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.250 
we need to now add on a gauge set what
do<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:22.980> say<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.869> it's<00:00:24.869> one<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.199> these

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
do you say that is it's one of these

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.950 
do you say that is it's one of these
little<00:00:25.500> units<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.400> course<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.939> made<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.420> custom

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
little units of course I made it custom

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.460 
little units of course I made it custom
now<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.300> an<00:00:31.080> air<00:00:31.230> flow

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
now what we have here is an air flow

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.700 
now what we have here is an air flow
meter<00:00:31.610> from<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.730> welding<00:00:33.030> machine<00:00:33.559> what<00:00:34.559> we

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
meter from a welding machine what we

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.610 
meter from a welding machine what we
also<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.160> here<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> volt<00:00:36.090> gauge<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.690> an

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
also have here is a volt gauge and an

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.170 
also have here is a volt gauge and an
amp<00:00:37.800> gauge<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.550> want<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.910> know<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.149> our

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
amp gauge we want to know what our

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.970 
amp gauge we want to know what our
voltages<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> know<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:40.920> our

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
voltages we want to know what our

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.709 
voltages we want to know what our
amperage<00:00:41.430> dries<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.360> kill<00:00:42.600> her

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
amperage dries so we don't kill her

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.560 
amperage dries so we don't kill her
battery<00:00:43.140> or<00:00:43.500> overheat<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.280> system<00:00:45.030> if<00:00:45.210> we're

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
battery or overheat the system if we're

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.200 
battery or overheat the system if we're
drawing<00:00:45.809> too<00:00:46.050> many<00:00:46.230> amps<00:00:46.760> amps<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> killer

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
drawing too many amps amps is the killer

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.389 
drawing too many amps amps is the killer
here<00:00:48.570> not<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.050> volts<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.829> now<00:00:52.160> we're<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
here not the volts so now we're going to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.549 
here not the volts so now we're going to
take<00:00:53.579> our<00:00:53.760> tube<00:00:54.090> from<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> air<00:00:54.750> flow<00:00:55.550> and

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
take our tube from the air flow and

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.740 
take our tube from the air flow and
we're<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.980> put<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> into<00:00:59.730> our<00:00:59.760> bubbler

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.950 

now<00:01:03.750> we're<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> take<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> two<00:01:04.619> leads

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.010 

remember<00:01:09.960> red<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.500> positive<00:01:11.720> black<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
remember red is positive black is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.969 
remember red is positive black is
negative<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.810> we<00:01:15.810> use<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.259> course<00:01:16.500> stainless

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
negative and we use of course stainless

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.609 
negative and we use of course stainless
steel<00:01:17.189> nuts<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:18.270> put<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:18.689> together<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.270> now

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
steel nuts to put it all together so now

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.690 
steel nuts to put it all together so now
we<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.650> our<00:01:22.830> electrical<00:01:23.430> hookups<00:01:25.700> all

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
we have our electrical hookups all

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
we have our electrical hookups all
together<00:01:27.119> nicely<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:29.180> then<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.360> our<00:01:30.390> other

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
together nicely and then with our other

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.850 
together nicely and then with our other
two<00:01:30.990> leads<00:01:32.780> pretty<00:01:33.780> thick<00:01:34.049> wire<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.530> hard<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
two leads pretty thick wire it's hard to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.240 
two leads pretty thick wire it's hard to
handle<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.820> looks<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.600> little<00:01:36.750> awkward<00:01:37.320> so

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
handle so it looks a little awkward so

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.310 
handle so it looks a little awkward so
these<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.820> connected<00:01:39.420> now<00:01:39.990> we're<00:01:40.140> going<00:01:40.259> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
these are connected now we're going to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.580 
these are connected now we're going to
take<00:01:40.439> our<00:01:40.500> negative<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.159> positive<00:01:42.170> put<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
take our negative and positive put it to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.510 
take our negative and positive put it to
our<00:01:43.890> battery<00:01:44.630> that's<00:01:45.630> right<00:01:45.869> clip<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.070> here

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
our battery that's right clip it on here

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.300 
our battery that's right clip it on here
oh<00:01:49.040> look<00:01:50.119> we<00:01:51.119> got<00:01:51.360> voltage<00:01:51.979> showing<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.070> again

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
oh look we got voltage showing you again

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.260 
oh look we got voltage showing you again
unplug<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.450> plug<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:55.590> back<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.820> 12<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
unplug it plug it back in we have 12 and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.600 
unplug it plug it back in we have 12 and
a<00:01:57.329> half<00:01:57.360> volts<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.530> good<00:01:58.710> battery<00:01:58.979> it's

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
a half volts it's a good battery it's

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.969 
a half volts it's a good battery it's
what<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.000> need<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.469> well<00:02:01.680> why<00:02:01.799> did

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
what we need as you can see well why did

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.679 
what we need as you can see well why did
i<00:02:02.040> hook<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.909> thing's<00:02:03.149> not<00:02:03.210> even<00:02:03.329> full

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
i hook it up the thing's not even full

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.690 
i hook it up the thing's not even full
of<00:02:03.810> water<00:02:04.020> yet<00:02:04.290> well<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:05.100> need<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> test<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
of water yet well we need to test the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.160 
of water yet well we need to test the
system<00:02:06.119> make<00:02:06.299> sure<00:02:06.420> our<00:02:06.450> connections<00:02:07.049> are

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
system make sure our connections are

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.729 
system make sure our connections are
right<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:08.209> voltage<00:02:09.209> no<00:02:10.200> current<00:02:10.470> we

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
right we have voltage no current we

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.870 
right we have voltage no current we
shouldn't<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.160> current<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.550> don't<00:02:11.580> have

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
shouldn't have current we don't have

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.310 
shouldn't have current we don't have
solution<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.600> our<00:02:13.410> tanks<00:02:13.830> yet<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:14.760> now<00:02:15.290> we<00:02:16.290> have

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
solution in our tanks yet so now we have

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.890 
solution in our tanks yet so now we have
our<00:02:16.470> connections<00:02:17.100> now<00:02:17.880> we<00:02:17.940> need<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.450> put<00:02:18.750> some

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
our connections now we need to put some

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.350 
our connections now we need to put some
electrolyte<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.620> here<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.550> our<00:02:20.790> aqueous

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
electrolyte in here in our aqueous

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.920 
electrolyte in here in our aqueous
solution<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.620> technical<00:02:23.040> term<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.660> we<00:02:24.660> need

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
solution the technical term and we need

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.500 
solution the technical term and we need
to<00:02:24.960> fire<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.860> see<00:02:26.030> how<00:02:27.030> much<00:02:27.210> current

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
to fire it up and see how much current

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.570 
to fire it up and see how much current
we<00:02:27.660> draw<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:28.170> don't<00:02:28.800> want<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> draw<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> lot<00:02:29.460> of

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
we draw we don't want to draw a lot of

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.310 
we draw we don't want to draw a lot of
current<00:02:29.850> 15<00:02:30.690> amps<00:02:31.020> per<00:02:31.200> unit<00:02:32.090> but<00:02:33.140> you'll<00:02:34.140> have

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
current 15 amps per unit but you'll have

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.280 
current 15 amps per unit but you'll have
to<00:02:34.380> wait<00:02:34.560> for<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.980> next<00:02:35.220> one
