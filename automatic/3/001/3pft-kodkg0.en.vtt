00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.330 

so<00:00:10.700> now<00:00:10.879> I'm<00:00:11.000> ready<00:00:11.180> to<00:00:11.330> export<00:00:12.110> my<00:00:12.289> meshes<00:00:12.740> so

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
so now I'm ready to export my meshes so

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.160 
so now I'm ready to export my meshes so
I'm<00:00:13.430> going<00:00:13.549> to<00:00:13.580> start<00:00:13.850> with<00:00:14.029> my<00:00:14.270> low<00:00:14.660> res<00:00:14.869> mesh

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
I'm going to start with my low res mesh

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.109 
I'm going to start with my low res mesh
this<00:00:15.529> is<00:00:15.709> the<00:00:16.010> mesh<00:00:16.309> I'm<00:00:16.460> going<00:00:16.640> to<00:00:16.730> import

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
this is the mesh I'm going to import

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.880 
this is the mesh I'm going to import
into<00:00:17.359> painter<00:00:17.900> and<00:00:18.140> that<00:00:18.380> I'll<00:00:18.560> be<00:00:18.590> working

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
into painter and that I'll be working

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.760 
into painter and that I'll be working
with<00:00:19.130> in<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:19.520> texturing<00:00:19.939> process<00:00:20.320> so<00:00:21.320> here<00:00:21.590> I

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
with in the texturing process so here I

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.400 
with in the texturing process so here I
have<00:00:21.800> all<00:00:22.520> of<00:00:22.700> my<00:00:22.850> mesh<00:00:23.030> parts<00:00:23.390> selected<00:00:24.230> and

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
have all of my mesh parts selected and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.710 
have all of my mesh parts selected and
I'm<00:00:24.770> going<00:00:25.010> to<00:00:25.039> go<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:25.430> file<00:00:25.820> export<00:00:26.300> selection

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
I'm going to go to file export selection

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.820 
I'm going to go to file export selection
and<00:00:27.350> I<00:00:28.220> choose<00:00:28.520> FBX<00:00:29.210> as<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.510> option<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.110> so

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
and I choose FBX as the option and so

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.109 
and I choose FBX as the option and so
here<00:00:31.010> we're<00:00:31.130> going<00:00:31.160> to<00:00:31.369> call<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:31.730> sci-fi

export<00:01:53.450> my<00:01:53.840> low<00:01:54.049> resolution<00:01:54.680> mesh<00:01:55.210> so<00:01:56.210> next<00:01:56.420> up

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
export my low resolution mesh so next up

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.840 
export my low resolution mesh so next up
I<00:01:56.810> would<00:01:57.110> export<00:01:57.590> my<00:01:57.799> high<00:01:58.009> resolution<00:01:58.610> so

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
I would export my high resolution so

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.670 
I would export my high resolution so
we'll<00:01:59.000> just<00:01:59.150> come<00:01:59.299> over<00:01:59.420> here<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.810> our<00:02:00.350> high

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
we'll just come over here to our high

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.370 
we'll just come over here to our high
resolution<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.520> we'll<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.600> enable<00:02:03.229> this

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
resolution and we'll just enable this

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.980 
resolution and we'll just enable this
and<00:02:03.710> we'll<00:02:04.040> just<00:02:04.220> select<00:02:04.610> all<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.630> mesh

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
and we'll just select all of the mesh

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.139 
and we'll just select all of the mesh
parts<00:02:06.350> here<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.520> here<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:07.820> can<00:02:07.909> see<00:02:08.119> all

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
parts here and so here you can see all

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.050 
parts here and so here you can see all
the<00:02:08.420> parts<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:09.229> are<00:02:09.739> highlighted<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.399> then

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
the parts that are highlighted and then

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.399 
the parts that are highlighted and then
in<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:11.299> case<00:02:11.510> we<00:02:11.720> would<00:02:11.810> do<00:02:11.959> export

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
in this case we would do export

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.530 
in this case we would do export
selection<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.129> I'm<00:02:13.639> going<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.790> save<00:02:14.029> this<00:02:14.269> as

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
selection and I'm going to save this as

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.559 
selection and I'm going to save this as

my sci-fi container hi I'm going to turn

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.500 
my sci-fi container hi I'm going to turn

off<00:02:18.629> in<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.019> case<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:19.950> I'm<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.069> going

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
off in this case and here I'm just going

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.770 
off in this case and here I'm just going
to<00:02:20.340> make<00:02:20.489> sure<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.849> have<00:02:21.090> smoothing

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
to make sure that I have smoothing

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.330 
to make sure that I have smoothing
groups<00:02:21.989> enabled<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.650> here<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.129> would<00:02:23.310> just

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
groups enabled and here I would just

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.100 
groups enabled and here I would just
export<00:02:23.879> out<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.090> high-resolution<00:02:24.450> mesh<00:02:24.959> I

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
export out the high-resolution mesh I

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.179 
export out the high-resolution mesh I
already<00:02:25.319> have<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:25.650> I'll<00:02:25.829> just<00:02:25.860> click

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
already have it so I'll just click

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.270 
already have it so I'll just click
cancel<00:02:27.049> finally<00:02:28.049> what<00:02:28.560> we're<00:02:28.680> going<00:02:28.799> to<00:02:28.920> do<00:02:29.040> is

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
cancel finally what we're going to do is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.429 
cancel finally what we're going to do is
covered<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.030> previous<00:02:30.390> video<00:02:30.959> we<00:02:31.019> also

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
covered in the previous video we also

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.569 
covered in the previous video we also
have<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.879> ID<00:02:33.590> mesh<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.799> we<00:02:34.920> want<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.159> export

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
have this ID mesh that we want to export

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.449 
have this ID mesh that we want to export
so<00:02:36.120> here<00:02:36.629> let<00:02:36.810> me<00:02:36.840> just<00:02:37.250> hide<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
so here let me just hide the

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.690 
so here let me just hide the
high-resolution<00:02:38.849> so<00:02:39.690> here<00:02:39.870> we<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:40.110> our<00:02:40.349> ID

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
high-resolution so here we have our ID

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.830 
high-resolution so here we have our ID
we<00:02:41.700> would<00:02:41.819> just<00:02:42.000> select<00:02:42.120> all<00:02:42.450> these<00:02:42.599> mesh

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
we would just select all these mesh

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.410 
we would just select all these mesh
parts<00:02:43.200> here<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.590> now<00:02:44.190> we'll<00:02:44.430> do<00:02:44.640> export

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
parts here and now we'll do export

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.360 
parts here and now we'll do export
selection<00:02:45.690> once<00:02:46.019> again<00:02:46.409> this<00:02:46.890> time<00:02:47.190> we'll

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
selection once again this time we'll

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.699 
selection once again this time we'll
call<00:02:47.549> this<00:02:47.760> sci-fi<00:02:48.390> container<00:02:49.019> underscore<00:02:49.530> ID

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
call this sci-fi container underscore ID

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.740 
call this sci-fi container underscore ID
again<00:02:50.400> I'm<00:02:50.760> going<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:50.940> leave<00:02:51.060> triangulate<00:02:51.569> off

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
again I'm going to leave triangulate off

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.599 
again I'm going to leave triangulate off
and<00:02:52.079> I<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.500> have<00:02:52.680> smoothing<00:02:53.099> groups<00:02:53.340> and

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
and I just have smoothing groups and

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.599 
and I just have smoothing groups and
then<00:02:54.239> we'll<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.569> export<00:02:55.109> this<00:02:55.409> guy<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.950> that

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
then we'll just export this guy and that

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.860 
then we'll just export this guy and that
will<00:02:56.730> give<00:02:56.849> us<00:02:56.879> all<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.299> meshes<00:02:57.599> we're<00:02:57.750> going

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
will give us all the meshes we're going

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.849 
will give us all the meshes we're going
to<00:02:57.930> use<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:58.349> our<00:02:58.650> substance<00:02:59.129> painter<00:02:59.280> project
