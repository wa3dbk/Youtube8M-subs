there<00:04:07.420> are<00:04:09.000> color<00:04:10.000> polettis<00:04:10.930> on<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.560> right

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.770 

and<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.310> pretty<00:04:18.699> much<00:04:18.910> dead

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
and it is pretty much dead

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.210 
and it is pretty much dead
let's<00:04:20.079> select<00:04:20.289> everything<00:04:20.889> and<00:04:21.280> delete<00:04:23.220> again

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
let's select everything and delete again

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.060 
let's select everything and delete again
I'm<00:04:24.729> not<00:04:24.940> saying<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.360> this<00:04:26.169> application<00:04:26.590> is

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
I'm not saying that this application is

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.640 
I'm not saying that this application is
better<00:04:27.310> than<00:04:27.669> flash<00:04:28.000> but<00:04:28.479> it's<00:04:28.780> quite<00:04:29.050> similar

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
better than flash but it's quite similar

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.770 
better than flash but it's quite similar
in<00:04:29.860> terms<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.520> usability<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:34.090> first<00:04:34.389> software

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
in terms of usability the first software

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.460 
in terms of usability the first software
application<00:04:35.440> we<00:04:35.530> are<00:04:35.620> going<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.010> talk<00:04:36.250> is

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
application we are going to talk is

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.250 
application we are going to talk is
called<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:39.660> pencil<00:04:41.729> it's<00:04:42.729> fairly<00:04:43.060> similar<00:04:43.600> to<00:04:44.229> a

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
called a pencil it's fairly similar to a

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.689 
called a pencil it's fairly similar to a
previous<00:04:44.770> ones<00:04:45.510> but<00:04:46.860> it<00:04:47.860> offers<00:04:48.340> more

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
previous ones but it offers more

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.879 
previous ones but it offers more
simplified<00:04:49.510> interface<00:04:51.090> we<00:04:52.090> have<00:04:52.410> some<00:04:53.410> basic

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
simplified interface we have some basic

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:01.950 
simplified interface we have some basic
tools<00:04:54.130> here<00:04:56.490> which<00:04:57.490> are<00:04:59.910> fairly<00:05:00.910> common<00:05:01.599> in

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
tools here which are fairly common in

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:16.129 
tools here which are fairly common in
many<00:05:04.800> drawing<00:05:05.800> and<00:05:07.229> animating<00:05:08.229> software

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.020 

okay<00:05:17.139> so<00:05:17.199> we<00:05:17.469> have<00:05:17.710> a<00:05:17.740> pencil<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:19.409> brush<00:05:20.409> and<00:05:21.030> the

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
okay so we have a pencil a brush and the

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:30.450 
okay so we have a pencil a brush and the
pen<00:05:22.419> tools

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.460 

clear<00:05:31.460> our<00:05:31.789> screen<00:05:32.150> by<00:05:32.419> pressing<00:05:32.960> this<00:05:33.530> button

as<00:05:35.920> you<00:05:36.070> can<00:05:36.190> see<00:05:36.520> in<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.240> box<00:05:37.450> below<00:05:37.780> it<00:05:38.850> is<00:05:39.850> a

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
as you can see in the box below it is a

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:49.410 
as you can see in the box below it is a
timeline

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.670 

let's<00:05:50.830> talk<00:05:51.830> about<00:05:52.010> the<00:05:52.370> key

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
let's talk about the key

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.640 
let's talk about the key
how<00:05:52.860> to<00:05:52.919> use<00:05:53.310> them<00:05:53.580> okay<00:05:54.150> so<00:05:54.180> that's<00:05:54.960> wrong<00:05:55.320> is

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
how to use them okay so that's wrong is

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.090 
how to use them okay so that's wrong is
is<00:05:56.130> something<00:05:56.699> very<00:05:57.150> common<00:05:58.520> okay<00:05:59.550> it's<00:05:59.789> a

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
is something very common okay it's a

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.760 
is something very common okay it's a
strange-looking<00:06:02.100> stickman<00:06:02.940> okay<00:06:03.330> so<00:06:03.389> we<00:06:03.870> do

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
strange-looking stickman okay so we do

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.210 
strange-looking stickman okay so we do
it<00:06:04.919> and<00:06:05.280> now<00:06:06.240> let's<00:06:06.600> press<00:06:06.870> DK<00:06:07.830> on<00:06:08.039> our

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
it and now let's press DK on our

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.460 
it and now let's press DK on our
keyboard<00:06:08.729> in<00:06:09.509> order<00:06:09.660> to<00:06:10.080> go<00:06:10.259> to<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:10.889> second

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
keyboard in order to go to the second

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:20.529 
keyboard in order to go to the second
frame<00:06:14.300> and<00:06:15.889> let's<00:06:16.889> press<00:06:17.360> Enter

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.420 

okay<00:06:21.539> so<00:06:21.600> as<00:06:22.139> you<00:06:22.259> can<00:06:22.380> see<00:06:22.440> it<00:06:22.740> turned<00:06:23.070> grey

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
okay so as you can see it turned grey

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.490 
okay so as you can see it turned grey
because<00:06:23.970> it<00:06:24.810> shows<00:06:25.110> us<00:06:25.139> that<00:06:25.919> our<00:06:27.259> drawing<00:06:28.259> is

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
because it shows us that our drawing is

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.550 
because it shows us that our drawing is
in<00:06:28.860> a<00:06:28.949> previous<00:06:30.979> frame<00:06:33.050> it's<00:06:34.050> an<00:06:34.229> onion

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
in a previous frame it's an onion

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.089 
in a previous frame it's an onion
skinning<00:06:36.919> okay

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
skinning okay

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:47.370 
skinning okay
so<00:06:38.400> let's<00:06:38.970> draw<00:06:39.210> the<00:06:39.270> second<00:06:39.840> one

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.690 

we<00:06:47.920> do<00:06:48.250> it<00:06:48.460> and<00:06:48.760> let's<00:06:49.540> see<00:06:50.220> how<00:06:51.220> it<00:06:51.490> looks<00:06:51.820> like

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
we do it and let's see how it looks like

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.230 
we do it and let's see how it looks like
as<00:06:54.700> you<00:06:54.850> can<00:06:55.030> see<00:06:56.220> there<00:06:57.220> are<00:06:57.400> two<00:06:57.580> different

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
as you can see there are two different

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:06.020 
as you can see there are two different
frames<00:06:59.010> let's<00:07:00.010> launch<00:07:01.620> and<00:07:02.620> see<00:07:02.830> how<00:07:03.100> it<00:07:03.250> looks

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.350 

as<00:07:07.030> you<00:07:07.120> can<00:07:07.270> see<00:07:07.420> it<00:07:07.690> is<00:07:07.870> not<00:07:08.020> repeated<00:07:09.180> but<00:07:10.180> if

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
as you can see it is not repeated but if

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.130 
as you can see it is not repeated but if
we<00:07:10.480> want<00:07:10.750> to<00:07:11.790> repeat<00:07:12.790> an<00:07:13.060> empower<00:07:13.450> animation

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.140 
we want to repeat an empower animation

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.470 
we want to repeat an empower animation
press<00:07:14.440> this<00:07:14.650> button<00:07:14.890> and<00:07:15.280> then<00:07:15.610> again<00:07:16.090> press

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:16.480 
press this button and then again press

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
play button as you can see it's a fairly

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.320 
play button as you can see it's a fairly
simple<00:07:23.190> animation<00:07:24.190> just<00:07:24.550> to<00:07:24.700> show<00:07:24.940> you<00:07:25.000> the

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
simple animation just to show you the

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.780 
simple animation just to show you the
functionality<00:07:26.430> okay<00:07:27.430> and<00:07:27.640> in<00:07:28.060> the<00:07:29.790> lower

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790 
functionality okay and in the lower

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.580 
functionality okay and in the lower
right<00:07:31.660> corner<00:07:31.900> you<00:07:32.800> see<00:07:33.100> a<00:07:33.340> number<00:07:34.380> 12<00:07:35.380> right

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:35.590 
right corner you see a number 12 right

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.490 
right corner you see a number 12 right
now<00:07:35.620> it's<00:07:35.980> a<00:07:36.130> frames<00:07:36.520> per<00:07:36.850> second<00:07:37.330> if<00:07:37.930> we<00:07:38.020> make

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.500 
now it's a frames per second if we make

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:45.920 
now it's a frames per second if we make
it<00:07:40.170> bigger<00:07:41.170> then<00:07:41.950> we<00:07:42.690> will<00:07:43.690> get<00:07:43.870> our<00:07:44.260> animation

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:45.930 
it bigger then we will get our animation

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:52.770 
it bigger then we will get our animation
to<00:07:46.930> work<00:07:47.170> faster<00:07:49.170> but<00:07:50.170> it<00:07:50.520> doesn't<00:07:51.520> mean<00:07:51.780> that

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:52.780 
to work faster but it doesn't mean that

00:07:52.780 --> 00:08:03.960 
to work faster but it doesn't mean that
it<00:07:53.140> will<00:07:53.410> look<00:07:53.830> better

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:03.970 

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.360
