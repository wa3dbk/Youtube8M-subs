00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
piping in their next step is to put the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.580 
piping in their next step is to put the
pipes<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> science<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.840> his<00:01:06.990> helmets<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
pipes on the science of his helmets and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:20.460 
pipes on the science of his helmets and
fill<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> lot<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> gaps

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.300 

alright<00:01:21.280> so<00:01:21.580> this<00:01:21.730> is<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.890> is<00:01:23.950> how<00:01:24.160> it

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
alright so this is the this is how it

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.340 
alright so this is the this is how it
looks<00:01:24.340> some<00:01:24.640> transform<00:01:25.120> oh<00:01:26.010> I<00:01:27.960> could<00:01:28.960> put<00:01:29.230> the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
looks some transform oh I could put the

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.370 
looks some transform oh I could put the
head<00:01:29.470> in<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.940> could<00:01:34.150> much<00:01:34.360> easier<00:01:34.690> use<00:01:34.990> my

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
head in and I could much easier use my

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.230 
head in and I could much easier use my
hand<00:01:35.620> with<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.400> big<00:01:36.580> bandaid<00:01:36.970> on<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:39.240> yeah

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
hand with the big bandaid on it and yeah

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.240 
hand with the big bandaid on it and yeah
so<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:40.570> would<00:01:40.690> fit<00:01:40.840> on<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:40.990> inside<00:01:41.350> I<00:01:41.680> don't

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
so that would fit on the inside I don't

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.490 
so that would fit on the inside I don't
have<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.400> chest<00:01:42.730> piece<00:01:42.940> yet<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.510> don't<00:01:44.260> haven't

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
have the chest piece yet I don't haven't

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.970 
have the chest piece yet I don't haven't
started<00:01:44.800> then<00:01:44.980> yet<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:47.620> can<00:01:47.710> see<00:01:47.860> this

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
started then yet as you can see this

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.880 
started then yet as you can see this
fits<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.400> over<00:01:48.640> here<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.960> little<00:01:50.230> gap<00:01:50.530> over

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
fits in over here this little gap over

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.370 
fits in over here this little gap over
here<00:01:51.310> which<00:01:51.460> I'm<00:01:51.610> going<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.030> widen<00:01:52.300> just<00:01:53.229> to

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
here which I'm going to widen just to

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.540 
here which I'm going to widen just to
mimic<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.830> little<00:01:54.070> bit<00:01:54.190> what<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.400> dance

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
mimic a little bit what the dance

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.670 
mimic a little bit what the dance
project<00:01:54.790> did<00:01:55.170> also<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.200> think<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:56.530> might<00:01:56.650> be

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
project did also I think it might be

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.430 
project did also I think it might be
cool<00:01:56.979> if<00:01:57.160> I<00:01:57.280> could<00:01:57.340> fit<00:01:57.869> powermaster<00:01:58.869> prions

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
cool if I could fit powermaster prions

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.250 
cool if I could fit powermaster prions
headed<00:01:59.950> next<00:02:00.690> although<00:02:01.690> that's<00:02:01.900> not<00:02:01.960> what<00:02:02.170> i'm

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
headed next although that's not what i'm

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.620 
headed next although that's not what i'm
going<00:02:02.290> for<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.910> for<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.119> flaps<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.510> will

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
going for it and for the flaps that will

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.760 
going for it and for the flaps that will
fit<00:02:04.780> down<00:02:04.930> in<00:02:05.110> here<00:02:06.869> again<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:08.350> think<00:02:08.679> it'd<00:02:08.740> be

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
fit down in here again I think it'd be

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.100 
fit down in here again I think it'd be
cool<00:02:09.009> if<00:02:09.070> I<00:02:09.250> could<00:02:09.310> have<00:02:09.580> him<00:02:10.000> somehow<00:02:10.840> in

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
cool if I could have him somehow in

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.420 
cool if I could have him somehow in
there<00:02:11.260> but<00:02:11.590> that's<00:02:11.770> just<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:12.040> gimmick<00:02:12.190> and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
there but that's just a gimmick and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.699 
there but that's just a gimmick and
maybe<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:12.730> want<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.090> might<00:02:13.390> not<00:02:14.290> even<00:02:14.350> pull

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
maybe I want to you might not even pull

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.330 
maybe I want to you might not even pull
that<00:02:14.830> off<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:17.350> i'll<00:02:17.500> go<00:02:17.620> with<00:02:17.740> Chancellor

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
that off so i'll go with Chancellor

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.520 
that off so i'll go with Chancellor
understood<00:02:18.640> anything<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.660> that's<00:02:19.990> something

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
understood anything so that's something

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.890 
understood anything so that's something
