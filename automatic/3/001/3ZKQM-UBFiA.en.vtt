00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.370
 today he had the pick szeged and welcome to 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.629
 the review of mpc 7 if we are here 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.280
 remember that your videos are not for 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.870
 demonstrate skills but to see 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.880
 How will function the hands of a wimp 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.900
 average as I am, they are equally 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.700
 here do not forget to comment with the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.669
 next weapon they would like to see later or 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.079
 with the word of the day that is book without 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.119
 more and more we start with the chair of the 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.649
 mpp 7 the mp if it is in real life or 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.140
 rather in Mersin before this 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.550
 They say they do not know if you say no German no 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.320
 be German is a submachine gun 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.600
 manufactured by the company are created with 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.550
 obviously in the country of germany since 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.070
 the year of 2001 uses ammunition 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.780
 specific for this weapon the 4.6 by 30 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.309
 millimeters combining a bullet 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.530
 small caliber with the ability to 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.530
 pierce armor thing that not many 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.660
 bullets type 9 millimeters can make 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.280
 now 15 shots of 950 shots per 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.019
 minute like the game like 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.690
 they get to be in banfield 3 they 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.659
 get once you get to 34 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.640
 thousand points in cooperative in terms of its 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.469
 damage model is pretty low though 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.539
 nothing otherworldly enough controllable 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.890
 20 points of damage at a maximum distance 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.280
 of 12 meters is to say a death of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.700
 five shots 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.890
 11.2 damage after 46 meters 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.869
 that is to say a death of 9 shots the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.159
 moral of this is do not go long 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.650
 distance are going to finish all your 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.479
 charger the design the mobility that 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.420
 so much of the screen I like the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.680
 design is compact is the reason why 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.600
 which can make them in real life 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.280
 it is quite mobile they are going to move very 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.110
 easily and move from one place to 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.000
 another and as to the space occupied by 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.530
 the screen is not too much is more 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.180
 even the pompom at a glance though 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.070
 go to play shooting from the hip 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.560
 and they will not have any problem 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.119
 recharge is 2.4 seconds relatively 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.830
 slow though you practically do not feel 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.080
 that's clear talking about when still 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.280
 bullets remain in the charger if they run out 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.619
 all his bullets including that of the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.509
 chamber are 2.6 seconds so that 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.580
 I ventured nothing is to say go without fear if 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.380
 one more bullet is finished no no there will be 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.700
 problem with point two seconds the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.369
 firing rate is done just like the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.119
 Real life of 950 shots per minute 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.580
 turning it into your machine gun 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.830
 fastest of the game only exceeded 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.140
 the reflection rose to fame 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.750
 Bullet speed is 390 meters above 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.239
 second and it's so bad that I should tell you 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.650
 in comparison if you grab a 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.410
 assault rifle and they put a suppressor 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.390
 more or less it 's the same 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.250
 of bullet with suppressor here has no 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.320
 suppressor and it has 390 meters about 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.120
 second is to say quite slow another 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.130
 reason more why not use it to 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.350
 long distance please not the 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.090
 shots are only automatic and 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.920
 Semi-automatic do not use 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.570
 semiautomatic for the love of what more 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.910
 amen and the iron mine is 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.530
 relatively little obstructive only 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.200
 that there are two drawbacks the pattern of 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.630
 shot that although it is controllable is a 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.850
 little annoying even aim with the look 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.260
 of iron since sometimes his enemies 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.510
 they are going to be covered by the movement 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.190
 of the weapon also the flash that comes out 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.380
 at the end of the barrel can also be a 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.660
 problem about visibility 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.150
 with the iron look any look goes 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.320
 to go well does not obstruct the view too much 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.970
 if you shoot from the hip 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.160
 spoke the shooting pattern has a 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.470
 point 12 up is almost nothing 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.610
 very controllable the pattern shoot towards 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.950
 top point 45 by point 45 on one side 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.930
 of the other this however is not difficult 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.730
 of driving I must say that there are other 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.070
 weapons much more difficult to handle than 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.200
 this one but it's pretty annoying to point 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.270
 and trying to be precise from the sight 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.950
 this weapon is why I 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.709
 I recommend always shoot 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.440
 and again if you guessed it, avoid the 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.330
 medium and long distance battles if 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.910
 they had doubt how bad the pattern of 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.910
 shot of the first bullet is two points 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.860
 twice worse is to say two and a half almost 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.470
 times worse than the firing pattern that 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.290
 I just mentioned the point 5 Accuracy 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.700
 from the sight and 1.0 from the hip is 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.989
 say if you expose a laser sight go 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.730
 to have 5 points from the hip of 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.980
 point 5 from the sight as long as 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.620
 do not move if they move obviously they go 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.019
 to have less precision moving from 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.060
 the hip that moving and pointed 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.709
 from the look in that sense if you put a 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.900
 He looks at laser and he knows how to handle himself and 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.970
 stop before firing they will have 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.680
 the same precision from the hip that 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.230
 from the look and they will have better 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.670
 mobility better reaction time and 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.440
 especially not going to have to deal with 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.180
 the shooting pattern so strange that 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.769
 so this weapon is going to give you a 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.900
 rating of 4 slices of pizza 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.500
 about 4 if it does not have too much damage 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.269
 and it may be that 20 bullets the charger 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.729
 standard are a little annoying the 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.740
 put an extended charger and the 950 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.389
 bullets per minute that shoots that makes 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.710
 that this weapon is perfect for combat 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.520
 melee especially if you guys 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.930
 point 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.150
 to the chest and they end up shooting the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.860
 last bullets in the head what is going to 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.599
 make it much more effective in 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.550
 melee combat so the 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.530
 configuration that I recommend is 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.509
 the sight of your preference a laser sight 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.669
 and also the extended charger that 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.169
 it's a necessity and here's the review 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.970
 if it was useful or they liked the video 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.069
 can give a rating to the video 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.750
 if they are bears around here see the channel if 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.069
 they get to subscribe or if not follow me 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.659
 on social networks facebook twitter 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.740
 in the description and some videos that 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:56.389
 have not seen in the next screen 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.389
 interactive we'll see you in the next
