00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.930
 hello i'm just falling i'm 18 years old 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.829
 old and well below the theme of water 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.650
 we are here now with my first 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.329
 race in hockenheim in june i am in 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.930
 England has my top 4 license 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.730
 passed 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.730
 Now it's serious 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 Bremen 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.830
 deceived 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.830
 lingen 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.570
 at the first run the wheels have 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.040
 crazy and a bit too much 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.270
 power done but not me 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.740
 again on the pedal we wanted one 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.729
 little material already the weekend 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.890
 was still a long time and then the team has 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.930
 the first time at the big show 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.970
 screwed we have that really great 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.789
 we have very west one and a half 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.539
 So I'm world class 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.690
 very proud of her 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.240
 we did that sensationally and 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.090
 on the second run we had in july 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.460
 Lying there had a fuel a little leak 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.390
 and then the nitro comes out of it and the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.210
 For safety reasons , states have 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.259
 did they tell me yes, yes 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.429
 not rather not we do not want there 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.910
 three hours after the trackside 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.680
 clean and then I had to drive 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.500
 we push everything back the 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.819
 all work was unfortunately for nothing but 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.890
 we looked ahead on the 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.920
 Saturday and hope that we as yet 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.170
 qualify a bit better 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.650
 and unfortunately did not work either 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.790
 we voted out a bit again 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.700
 too much power back on the track 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.049
 pressed but I knew then still in 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.910
 fourth qualifying ronda yes go now 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.799
 seriously that my last chance now 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.840
 if i go into smoke then i go 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.010
 away from the pedal and again on it me 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.780
 it has to go now 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.600
 everything will probably explode 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.739
 but I had to do that and then it came 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.410
 as you thought 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.090
 i first went up in smoke on the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.820
 page drifted to the right 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.140
 steered again on the pedal gone 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.070
 and have also got dogs and blaze 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.810
 The first time around me is that for me 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.549
 really a motor is so exploded and 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.120
 then you make yourself then again 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:11.340
 thoughts control the beautiful bomb 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.599
 but now look forward to forward 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.610
 so we might have another two 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.830
 We can find sponsors so that we can 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.900
 travel to england and then september 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.230
 show what we already mean 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.920
 Vision is now in the semifinal press 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.000
 her thumbs now 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.000
 now it is going to be fine 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.750
 the track workers have a great job 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.340
 made for months already on the rubber 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.890
 gluing on it again a layer live 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.170
 on it again rubber and huge 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.269
 Compliment the route was great 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.130
 everything would probably not have 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.229
 be so good but they have us completely 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.940
 convinces really sensational one 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.350
 It also looks fast on the times 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.720
 Yesterday with the hydrogen 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.130
 42 new tracks have been added since 28 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.139
 years would be that you at the nitrolympx 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.210
 not done yet and you can see that 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:35.220
 that the good work has done and 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.320
 yes again we have the action 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.910
 unfortunately we have that was our mistake 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.650
 of the setup settings have the 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.940
 from the track the track was great 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.020
 at the quarter mile it has me 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.410
 the shoes undressed 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.910
 So really sensational and we have 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.580
 a bit too much power packed up 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.110
 and then I felt like she did 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.940
 I've never gone up in smoke mine 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.340
 Wheels have never gone crazy like this 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.250
 with such a pot at the license went 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.570
 everything was perfect we had every run 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.940
 everything was just right 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.919
 it went straight was just 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.229
 always fast and now i have 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.479
 realized how the problems are there 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.979
 it feels like when you look at the 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.419
 wheels spin when you go back 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.190
 suddenly a meter high in the air 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.130
 if it is suddenly no age 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.449
 man flames and secures me already 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.449
 little different from supercomm 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.699
 we want to know more can 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.770
 my facebook pages race driver there 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.940
 I always get news and we'll see each other 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.940
 at drag day
