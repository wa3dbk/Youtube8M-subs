00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 just like us there are many 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.319
 Aztec productions that started 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.960
 just a new dream one of them is a 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.790
 program that in its title speaks a lot in 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.930
 the confidence you have in your 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.590
 participants 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.620
 if you can 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.620
 I do not think you can but if you can dance 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.500
 well this great project has a 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:33.120
 great driver and I say it because I 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.739
 The smiles of Mexico arrive here 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.739
 still rituals 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.940
 the smile of mexico before we did not have 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.820
 smile 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.220
 we had angelic girlfriend maria we had 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.280
 luxury that is dad the coke we had 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.829
 bonbon that Wednesday but smile no 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.750
 We had that father after a 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.970
 time to meet the participants 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.320
 who specifically sent some 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.409
 kisses to the camera 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:08.130
 - La Rioja who apparently took a look 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.130
 to another cameraman the wise occasions 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.650
 all right 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.510
 until dwindling 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.890
 after that we met the family 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.380
 guest who has a very role 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.310
 important in the program in this case 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.310
 they were the lyceums 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.240
 I already told you that it has become the 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.550
 only I was going to talk there they are 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.590
 interrupting is already bringing me all 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.390
 what a shame with the people who are 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.369
 seeing the truth listen to me what they 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.290
 I say I know about this on TV later 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.020
 it was time to know the dynamics 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.570
 that the truth sounds simple enough all 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.060
 night of our 95 talents dance with 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.310
 your partner the two couples with the most 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.340
 jury score are faced in a 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.920
 dance duel the family chooses and goes to 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.649
 the weekly final the lowest score 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.239
 It is sentenced is sentenced 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.729
 will face on Sunday against a 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.260
 applicant in the weekly final 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.260
 a flight to death 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.930
 this the joke is that they are going to dance 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.599
 everything is treated at the end of the day as 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.090
 he did not even read that he went that the 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.579
 greña and I say it literally but 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.329
 explain to me what is that that is seen thrown 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.329
 there with hair 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.070
 precisely this was one of the things 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.440
 that we have polished critical this and its rare 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.050
 facial expression is to open both in the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.090
 mouth like fish or it got stuck 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.130
 the jaw or so is his way of walking 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.110
 for life and sensual according to them 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.390
 today the boy has that cream in mind 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.820
 in this program as in all if you are 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.280
 half suitcase to someone else can get 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.010
 to replace t in the case of Andrea Martí 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.850
 was challenged by German jerotich that according to 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.130
 he is an actor but according to the production he is 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.570
 next actor wannabe there says 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.570
 believe I'm sorry but 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.390
 in the production ones hear what 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.700
 minimal barbarians releases an actor position 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.440
 beginner or budding actor something like that 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.140
 argument to define who stayed in the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.720
 competition and aylín mujica made her of 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.080
 too much emotion for my taste had 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.070
 very long we have decided 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.070
 Square 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.670
 of dance if you can 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:49.330
 is for 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.080
 the resolution to the duel 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.770
 a 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.960
 to be in the competition the other 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.940
 is going to go to his house or to have dinner at his best 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.590
 I do not know maybe before going to his house 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.430
 come to dinner with someone 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:07.420
 and the other one stays here 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.420
 participating andrea 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.270
 and how sad I am , now it's not just 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.030
 aspiring actor is also aspiring 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.430
 to dancer man geez but let's move on 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.160
 much more pleasant news because in 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.610
 this program is participating shirts 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.610
 red 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.090
 the woman who can write many 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.000
 forms some weird and a little ridiculous 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:39.220
 a beautiful young talent that seems 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.350
 a candle to a candle now that said 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.130
 rare to see let's see how the flame moves 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.130
 there was the worshipers 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.770
 I think it fell short because 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:59.680
 this is not a candle that is a Syrian 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:08.800
 a candelabrum a campfire a flamethrower 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:08.800
 a walking dragon
