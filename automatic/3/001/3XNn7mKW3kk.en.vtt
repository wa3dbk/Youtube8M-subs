modernity I think it means after the
modern<00:03:38.190> but<00:03:39.190> aren't<00:03:39.400> we<00:03:39.430> always<00:03:39.669> in<00:03:40.090> the

that<00:04:21.450> science<00:04:21.930> can<00:04:22.110> tell<00:04:22.260> us<00:04:22.290> everything

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
that science can tell us everything

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.830 
that science can tell us everything
there<00:04:23.070> is<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.370> know<00:04:23.400> about<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.910> world<00:04:24.150> we<00:04:24.690> no

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
there is to know about the world we no

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.250 
there is to know about the world we no
longer<00:04:24.870> trust<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:26.220> is<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:27.840> trying<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.080> say

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
longer trust that is it trying to say

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.020 
longer trust that is it trying to say
that<00:04:29.120> rationalism<00:04:30.980> isn't<00:04:31.980> as<00:04:32.130> rational<00:04:32.430> as<00:04:32.850> we

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
that rationalism isn't as rational as we

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.420 
that rationalism isn't as rational as we
thought<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.420> was<00:04:33.650> isn't<00:04:34.650> as<00:04:34.740> true<00:04:35.070> as<00:04:35.280> we

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
thought it was isn't as true as we

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.830 
thought it was isn't as true as we
thought<00:04:35.640> it<00:04:35.670> was<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.060> so<00:04:36.180> somehow<00:04:36.390> we<00:04:36.510> have<00:04:36.810> to

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
thought it was and so somehow we have to

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.440 
thought it was and so somehow we have to
get<00:04:37.200> beyond<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.340> that's<00:04:38.940> what<00:04:39.120> post

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
get beyond that and that's what post

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.870 
get beyond that and that's what post
modernity<00:04:40.290> is<00:04:40.610> pointing<00:04:41.610> towards<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.380> mean<00:04:43.380> you

modernity is pointing towards I mean you

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.900 
modernity is pointing towards I mean you
you<00:04:44.880> see<00:04:45.180> this<00:04:46.130> you<00:04:47.130> see<00:04:47.160> this<00:04:47.430> today<00:04:47.670> in

you see this you see this today in
phrases<00:04:48.240> like<00:04:48.800> truth<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:50.040> relative<00:04:50.390> right

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
phrases like truth is relative right

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.660 
phrases like truth is relative right
well<00:04:51.990> that's<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.260> truth<00:04:52.650> statement<00:04:53.340> about<00:04:53.610> the

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
well that's a truth statement about the

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.030 
well that's a truth statement about the
relativity<00:04:54.330> of<00:04:54.510> truth<00:04:54.960> it's<00:04:55.290> this<00:04:55.580> it's<00:04:56.580> this

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
relativity of truth it's this it's this

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.320 
relativity of truth it's this it's this
truth<00:04:59.040> is<00:04:59.190> relative<00:04:59.370> as<00:04:59.700> a<00:04:59.730> statement<00:05:00.210> that

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
truth is relative as a statement that

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.130 
truth is relative as a statement that
kind<00:05:00.570> of<00:05:01.670> collapses<00:05:02.670> upon<00:05:02.850> itself<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.780> you

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
kind of collapses upon itself and you

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.990 
kind of collapses upon itself and you
will<00:05:04.260> also<00:05:04.440> hear<00:05:04.680> another<00:05:04.890> one<00:05:05.130> like<00:05:05.370> there<00:05:05.850> is

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
will also hear another one like there is

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.090 
will also hear another one like there is
no<00:05:06.180> meaning<00:05:06.450> in<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.900> world<00:05:07.170> well<00:05:07.830> that's<00:05:08.010> a

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
no meaning in the world well that's a

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.710 
no meaning in the world well that's a
meaningful<00:05:08.520> statement<00:05:08.880> about<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.510> lack<00:05:09.690> of

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
meaningful statement about the lack of

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.140 
meaningful statement about the lack of
meaning<00:05:10.260> in<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.500> world<00:05:10.710> and<00:05:10.950> so<00:05:11.130> it's<00:05:11.820> this

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
meaning in the world and so it's this

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.990 
meaning in the world and so it's this
kind<00:05:12.450> of<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.870> collapses<00:05:13.530> on<00:05:13.680> itself<00:05:13.710> again<00:05:14.370> so

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
kind of it collapses on itself again so

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.100 
kind of it collapses on itself again so
where<00:05:15.480> do<00:05:15.810> we<00:05:16.020> find<00:05:16.790> truth<00:05:17.790> and<00:05:18.210> meaning<00:05:18.630> in

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
where do we find truth and meaning in

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.760 
where do we find truth and meaning in
the<00:05:19.920> postmodern<00:05:20.370> world<00:05:20.990> how<00:05:21.990> are<00:05:22.170> we<00:05:22.290> going<00:05:22.500> to

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
the postmodern world how are we going to

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.760 
the postmodern world how are we going to
find<00:05:23.040> this<00:05:23.930> well<00:05:24.930> I<00:05:24.960> think<00:05:25.080> that<00:05:25.320> these<00:05:25.500> are

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
find this well I think that these are

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.670 
find this well I think that these are
some<00:05:26.430> of<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.580> same<00:05:27.000> issues<00:05:27.630> that<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.530> people

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
some of the same issues that the people

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.710 
some of the same issues that the people
who<00:05:28.860> are<00:05:28.950> writing<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.520> Bible<00:05:29.940> are<00:05:30.120> trying<00:05:30.450> to

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
who are writing the Bible are trying to

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.850 
who are writing the Bible are trying to
deal<00:05:30.930> with<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:32.340> postmodern<00:05:33.180> world<00:05:33.240> really

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
deal with the postmodern world really

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.400 
deal with the postmodern world really
isn't<00:05:34.860> bringing<00:05:35.130> us<00:05:35.370> anything<00:05:35.670> new<00:05:36.410> it's

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
isn't bringing us anything new it's

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.080 
isn't bringing us anything new it's
struggling<00:05:37.770> with<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.370> same<00:05:38.400> issues<00:05:39.060> that

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
struggling with the same issues that

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.450 
struggling with the same issues that
humans<00:05:39.600> have<00:05:39.750> always<00:05:39.930> struggled<00:05:40.530> with<00:05:40.830> and

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
humans have always struggled with and

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.570 
humans have always struggled with and
maybe<00:05:42.330> there<00:05:42.630> is<00:05:42.750> some<00:05:42.990> guidance<00:05:43.470> with<00:05:44.310> in

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
maybe there is some guidance with in

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.560 
maybe there is some guidance with in
science<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.650> also<00:05:46.650> within<00:05:47.370> our<00:05:47.970> sacred

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
science and also within our sacred

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.120 
science and also within our sacred
traditions<00:05:49.280> so<00:05:51.230> that's<00:05:52.230> kind<00:05:52.440> of<00:05:52.500> how<00:05:52.680> that's

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
traditions so that's kind of how that's
