generation so much more quickly than you

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.600 
generation so much more quickly than you
think

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
think

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.720 
think
into<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.390> place<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.870> actually<00:02:53.650> shifting<00:02:54.550> the
