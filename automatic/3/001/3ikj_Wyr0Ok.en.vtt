00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
a new screen has been fitted and there's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.200 
a new screen has been fitted and there's
pretty<00:00:45.690> much<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.649> two<00:00:46.860> cases<00:00:47.129> really<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
pretty much one of two cases really the

pretty much one of two cases really the
can<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.510> fixed<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> can't<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.350> fixed

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
can be fixed or it can't be fixed

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.529 
can be fixed or it can't be fixed
what<00:00:50.579> are<00:00:50.670> trying<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> find<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.449> the

what are trying to find out what the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.689 
what are trying to find out what the
problem<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.020> that's<00:00:52.199> causing<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.920> then

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
problem is that's causing it and then

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.490 
problem is that's causing it and then
we'll<00:00:53.850> move<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.180> I've<00:00:54.660> opened<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.260> now

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590 
things I'm gonna be sold of this and
desalted<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.370> battery<00:01:02.850> well<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.329> point

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
desalted the battery well just a point

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.230 
desalted the battery well just a point
on<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.500> batch<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.830> actually<00:01:06.170> that's<00:01:07.170> there

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
on the batch we actually that's there

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.960 
on the batch we actually that's there
isn't<00:01:09.240> soldered<00:01:09.840> down<00:01:10.049> properly<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
isn't soldered down properly so that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.260 
isn't soldered down properly so that
could<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> white<00:01:13.380> screen<00:01:13.970> what<00:01:14.970> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
could because in the white screen what I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.740 
could because in the white screen what I
want<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.909> what<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> want<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> achieve<00:01:18.330> by

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
want to do what I want to achieve by

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.310 
want to do what I want to achieve by
just<00:01:19.680> lifting<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.930> looking<00:01:21.930> at<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
just lifting this up is looking at the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.310 
just lifting this up is looking at the
end<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:24.920> digitizer<00:01:26.780> cable<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> reason<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
end of the digitizer cable the reason is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.580 
end of the digitizer cable the reason is
I<00:01:28.650> could<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.009> showed<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
I could have showed you on this but so

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.200 
I could have showed you on this but so
it<00:01:31.650> looks<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.310> cable<00:01:33.180> has<00:01:33.240> been<00:01:33.479> cut<00:01:34.170> up

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
it looks like the cable has been cut up

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.090 
it looks like the cable has been cut up
there's<00:01:36.210> sort<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:38.520> padded<00:01:39.000> earth<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:40.100> blocks

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
there's sort of a padded earth in blocks

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.420 
there's sort of a padded earth in blocks
on<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> spacer<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.840> end<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.430> that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
on a spacer on the end of this that

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.480 
on a spacer on the end of this that
should<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.790> there<00:01:45.079> that<00:01:46.079> has<00:01:47.040> been<00:01:47.220> known<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
should be there that has been known to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.240 
should be there that has been known to
cause<00:01:47.850> white<00:01:48.119> screens<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.840> isn't<00:01:49.200> there<00:01:49.470> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
cause white screens if it isn't there so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.800 
cause white screens if it isn't there so
I<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.299> there<00:01:51.600> are

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
I just want to see if it is there are

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.110 
I just want to see if it is there are
knots<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.409> then

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
knots and then

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.230 
knots and then
we'll<00:01:53.380> reassemble<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.650> iPods<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.520> hopefully

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
we'll reassemble the iPods and hopefully

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.900 
we'll reassemble the iPods and hopefully
see<00:01:56.300> it<00:01:56.480> we're<00:01:56.600> looking<00:01:56.930> at<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:58.130> connection<00:01:58.820> a

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
see it we're looking at the connection a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.120 
see it we're looking at the connection a
little<00:01:59.120> more<00:01:59.240> detail<00:01:59.720> I<00:01:59.990> see<00:02:00.800> with<00:02:00.920> my<00:02:00.980> own

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
little more detail I see with my own

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.290 
little more detail I see with my own
eyes<00:02:01.400> that<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:03.230> block<00:02:03.740> is<00:02:04.070> there<00:02:04.460> you

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
eyes that the block is there you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.620 
eyes that the block is there you
probably<00:02:05.450> can't<00:02:05.750> see<00:02:05.870> it<00:02:06.050> from<00:02:06.910> this<00:02:07.910> view<00:02:08.330> but

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
probably can't see it from this view but

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.090 
probably can't see it from this view but
if<00:02:08.720> we<00:02:08.810> look<00:02:08.960> at<00:02:09.110> this<00:02:09.380> it'd<00:02:10.100> been<00:02:10.369> worth<00:02:10.580> the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
if we look at this it'd been worth the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.580 
if we look at this it'd been worth the
digitizer<00:02:13.100> connector<00:02:13.730> connects<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.840> come

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
digitizer connector connects to come

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.310 
digitizer connector connects to come
down<00:02:15.830> here<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:17.000> there's<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.270> very<00:02:17.450> small<00:02:17.990> part

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
down here and there's a very small part

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.120 
down here and there's a very small part
just<00:02:19.310> sort<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.550> hanging<00:02:19.820> down<00:02:20.000> coming<00:02:20.570> below

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
just sort of hanging down coming below

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.700 
just sort of hanging down coming below
the<00:02:22.130> bottom<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.900> connector<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.620> was

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
the bottom of the connector and that was

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.100 
the bottom of the connector and that was
the<00:02:24.860> actual<00:02:25.160> block<00:02:25.370> itself<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.720> that's<00:02:26.840> all

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
the actual block itself so that's all

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.580 
the actual block itself so that's all
good

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
good

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.060 
good
I've<00:02:28.340> noticed<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.600> rear-facing<00:02:30.410> camera

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
I've noticed that the rear-facing camera

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.130 
I've noticed that the rear-facing camera
here<00:02:31.250> has<00:02:31.400> become<00:02:31.550> disconnected<00:02:32.180> from<00:02:32.630> the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
here has become disconnected from the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.320 
here has become disconnected from the
main<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:34.280> I'll<00:02:34.430> get<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.730> connected<00:02:35.240> again

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
main but I'll get that connected again

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.900 
main but I'll get that connected again
and<00:02:36.080> then<00:02:36.500> I'm<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:36.680> gonna<00:02:36.890> reassemble<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
and then I'm just gonna reassemble the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.460 
and then I'm just gonna reassemble the
iPod<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.540> hopefully<00:02:38.960> we'll<00:02:39.110> see<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.290> working

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
iPod and hopefully we'll see it working

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.270 
iPod and hopefully we'll see it working
all<00:02:39.770> right<00:02:39.950> we've<00:02:40.130> got<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.600> power<00:02:41.600> on<00:02:41.780> volume

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
all right we've got the power on volume

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.040 
all right we've got the power on volume
circuit<00:02:43.280> soldered<00:02:43.790> down<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.300> but<00:02:44.990> the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
circuit soldered down that but the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.960 
circuit soldered down that but the
battery<00:02:45.410> soldered<00:02:45.800> down<00:02:45.920> here<00:02:46.250> we're<00:02:46.850> gonna

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
battery soldered down here we're gonna

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.840 
battery soldered down here we're gonna
put<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.240> silver<00:02:47.510> plate<00:02:47.720> back<00:02:47.990> in<00:02:48.200> next<00:02:48.650> and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
put the silver plate back in next and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.880 
put the silver plate back in next and
got<00:02:49.850> things<00:02:50.060> connected<00:02:50.570> up<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.900> see<00:02:51.470> whether

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
got things connected up to see whether

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.680 
got things connected up to see whether
the<00:02:52.220> Y<00:02:52.310> screen<00:02:52.580> has<00:02:52.790> got<00:02:52.940> everything<00:02:53.180> screwed

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
the Y screen has got everything screwed

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.540 
the Y screen has got everything screwed
down<00:02:53.960> now<00:02:54.170> for<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.410> silver<00:02:54.800> plate<00:02:55.040> as<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.340> can

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
down now for the silver plate as you can

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.630 
down now for the silver plate as you can
see<00:02:55.760> all<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.890> correct<00:02:57.890> screws<00:02:58.250> are<00:02:58.489> in<00:02:58.550> the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
see all the correct screws are in the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.760 
see all the correct screws are in the
correct<00:02:58.910> places<00:02:59.200> I'm<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.380> gonna<00:03:00.470> put<00:03:00.680> this

correct places I'm just gonna put this

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.100 
correct places I'm just gonna put this
screen<00:03:01.070> into<00:03:01.370> position<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.030> then<00:03:02.840> we'll<00:03:02.989> move

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
screen into position and then we'll move

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.479 
screen into position and then we'll move
on<00:03:03.260> yeah<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.650> here<00:03:03.770> we<00:03:03.860> are<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.100> moment<00:03:04.220> of

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
truth I'm just gonna switch it on right

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.790 
truth I'm just gonna switch it on right
Y<00:03:10.820> screen<00:03:11.239> straight<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.959> Y<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.440> nothing's

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
Y screen straight to Y so nothing's

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.940 
Y screen straight to Y so nothing's
changed<00:03:13.400> yet<00:03:14.050> I'm<00:03:15.050> just<00:03:15.200> gonna<00:03:15.350> leave<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.770> for

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
I'll put into charge I'm just trying to

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.560 
I'll put into charge I'm just trying to
find<00:03:28.850> out<00:03:29.090> what<00:03:29.390> state<00:03:30.350> it<00:03:30.620> saying<00:03:30.950> was<00:03:31.730> in<00:03:31.940> his

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
find out what state it saying was in his

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.380 
find out what state it saying was in his
half<00:03:32.780> his<00:03:33.709> own<00:03:33.920> as<00:03:34.130> any<00:03:34.340> charging<00:03:34.910> because<00:03:37.390> as

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
half his own as any charging because as

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.280 
half his own as any charging because as
you<00:03:38.510> might<00:03:38.630> have<00:03:38.750> seen<00:03:38.930> there<00:03:39.140> when<00:03:39.260> I

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
you might have seen there when I

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.430 
you might have seen there when I
switched<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.709> on<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:41.060> screen<00:03:41.540> went<00:03:41.750> off<00:03:41.989> I

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
switched it on the screen went off I

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.110 
switched it on the screen went off I
press<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.130> power<00:03:43.310> button<00:03:43.340> then<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:43.940> came<00:03:44.060> back

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
press the power button then it came back

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.680 
press the power button then it came back
on<00:03:44.510> now<00:03:45.470> they<00:03:46.459> should<00:03:46.790> have<00:03:46.880> just<00:03:46.910> if<00:03:47.480> there

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
on now they should have just if there

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.000 
on now they should have just if there
was<00:03:47.780> enough<00:03:47.959> power<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.380> battery<00:03:48.530> for

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
was enough power in the battery for

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.890 
was enough power in the battery for
example<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:50.120> should<00:03:50.180> have<00:03:50.450> just<00:03:50.720> switched

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
example you should have just switched

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.740 
example you should have just switched
down<00:03:52.060> like<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.090> said<00:03:53.300> I've<00:03:53.360> got<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.540> into<00:03:53.750> charge

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
down like I said I've got it into charge

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.900 
down like I said I've got it into charge
I've<00:03:54.870> heard<00:03:55.230> no<00:03:55.740> charge<00:03:56.160> inside<00:03:56.430> at<00:03:56.820> the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
I've heard no charge inside at the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:05.350 
I've heard no charge inside at the
moment<00:03:57.300> if<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.410> do<00:03:58.470> that<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:01.530> reacts<00:04:03.560> stays<00:04:04.560> on

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
moment if I do that it reacts stays on

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.780 
moment if I do that it reacts stays on
and<00:04:06.360> I'm<00:04:06.480> guessing<00:04:06.750> it's<00:04:06.870> going<00:04:06.960> to<00:04:07.050> go<00:04:07.200> up

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
and I'm guessing it's going to go up

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.940 
and I'm guessing it's going to go up
there<00:04:08.790> we<00:04:08.880> go<00:04:09.290> okay<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.320> I'm<00:04:10.530> just<00:04:10.590> trying<00:04:10.800> to

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
there we go okay so I'm just trying to

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.220 
there we go okay so I'm just trying to
decide<00:04:11.280> what<00:04:11.550> state<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.390> in<00:04:12.600> right<00:04:13.200> now<00:04:15.230> so

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
decide what state it's in right now so

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.479 
decide what state it's in right now so
I'm<00:04:16.290> just<00:04:16.320> gonna<00:04:16.500> leave<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.830> on<00:04:16.860> to<00:04:17.010> charge<00:04:17.250> for

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
I'm just gonna leave it on to charge for

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.420 
I'm just gonna leave it on to charge for
now<00:04:18.049> see<00:04:19.049> if<00:04:19.110> it'll<00:04:19.290> switch<00:04:19.590> I'm<00:04:19.860> sick<00:04:20.100> or<00:04:20.250> make

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
now see if it'll switch I'm sick or make

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.090 
now see if it'll switch I'm sick or make
any<00:04:20.610> noises<00:04:20.820> like<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.269> charge<00:04:21.540> noise<00:04:22.070> so<00:04:23.070> I

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
any noises like the charge noise so I

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.760 
any noises like the charge noise so I
know<00:04:23.430> exactly<00:04:23.970> where<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.360> is<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:24.990> then<00:04:25.440> we'll

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
know exactly where it is and then we'll

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.010 
know exactly where it is and then we'll
move<00:04:25.920> on<00:04:26.100> we've<00:04:26.790> got<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:26.940> bit<00:04:27.120> development<00:04:27.780> here

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
move on we've got a bit development here

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.800 
move on we've got a bit development here
the<00:04:28.590> white<00:04:29.280> screen<00:04:29.610> we<00:04:29.880> see<00:04:30.060> now<00:04:30.270> that's<00:04:30.480> just

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
the white screen we see now that's just

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.260 
the white screen we see now that's just
come<00:04:31.050> on<00:04:31.230> on<00:04:32.190> its<00:04:32.400> own<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:34.080> think<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:35.270> iPhone

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
come on on its own so I think the iPhone

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.010 
come on on its own so I think the iPhone
is<00:04:36.390> now<00:04:36.690> switching<00:04:37.230> on<00:04:38.540> after<00:04:39.540> habit<00:04:39.810> enough

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
is now switching on after habit enough

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.500 
is now switching on after habit enough
charging<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.590> battery<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.280> looks<00:04:41.490> like<00:04:41.580> the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
charging a battery so it looks like the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.490 
charging a battery so it looks like the
battery<00:04:43.020> was<00:04:43.140> probably<00:04:43.440> flat<00:04:45.350> now<00:04:46.350> we're

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
battery was probably flat now we're

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.430 
battery was probably flat now we're
switching<00:04:46.590> on<00:04:47.010> I'm<00:04:48.000> gonna<00:04:48.090> see<00:04:48.420> what<00:04:49.230> happens

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
switching on I'm gonna see what happens

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.810 
switching on I'm gonna see what happens
I'm<00:04:49.710> still<00:04:49.890> gonna<00:04:50.010> leave<00:04:50.160> it<00:04:50.310> for<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.460> few<00:04:50.520> more

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
I'm still gonna leave it for a few more

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.070 
I'm still gonna leave it for a few more
minutes<00:04:52.520> just<00:04:53.520> wait<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.360> Y<00:04:54.480> screen<00:04:54.780> goes

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
minutes just wait to the Y screen goes

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.510 
minutes just wait to the Y screen goes
off<00:04:56.420> and<00:04:57.420> then<00:04:57.750> yep<00:04:58.440> okay<00:04:58.919> so<00:04:58.980> that's<00:04:59.400> the

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
off and then yep okay so that's the

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.880 
off and then yep okay so that's the
charge<00:04:59.790> in<00:05:00.030> tone<00:05:00.270> as<00:05:00.480> well<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:01.590> no<00:05:01.770> the

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
charge in tone as well so no the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.359 
charge in tone as well so no the
speakers<00:05:02.280> okay

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:05.369 

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:10.140 

ice-creams<00:05:06.369> has<00:05:06.610> changed<00:05:06.969> a<00:05:07.059> little<00:05:07.270> bit

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.080 

so<00:05:10.840> with<00:05:11.229> that<00:05:13.110> okay<00:05:14.110> so<00:05:14.169> I've<00:05:14.470> just<00:05:14.880> slid<00:05:15.880> it

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
so with that okay so I've just slid it

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.390 
so with that okay so I've just slid it
to<00:05:16.240> unlock<00:05:16.419> as<00:05:16.960> well<00:05:17.199> so<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.590> digitizer<00:05:18.130> can

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
to unlock as well so the digitizer can

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.910 
to unlock as well so the digitizer can
feel<00:05:20.190> wanna<00:05:21.190> press<00:05:21.580> it<00:05:22.229> there<00:05:23.229> we<00:05:23.440> go

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
things work up to now it's just a wire

screen that we need to get rid of so I'm

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.100 
screen that we need to get rid of so I'm
gonna<00:05:36.760> try<00:05:37.000> a<00:05:37.030> couple<00:05:37.240> of<00:05:37.389> recess<00:05:37.720> don't<00:05:37.990> know

caused it now I'm not too sure it's one
of<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.120> most<00:05:49.300> frustrating<00:05:49.450> things<00:05:49.990> are<00:05:50.410> only

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
of the most frustrating things are only

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.700 
of the most frustrating things are only
not<00:05:52.060> knowing<00:05:52.450> the<00:05:52.780> Cask<00:05:53.020> if<00:05:53.320> you<00:05:53.410> need<00:05:53.560> the

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
not knowing the Cask if you need the

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.940 
not knowing the Cask if you need the
cards<00:05:54.010> you<00:05:54.130> can<00:05:54.340> probably<00:05:55.380> fix<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.560> problem

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
cards you can probably fix the problem

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.380 
cards you can probably fix the problem
or<00:05:57.660> avoid<00:05:58.660> it<00:05:58.840> happening<00:05:58.960> in<00:05:59.919> the<00:06:00.040> first<00:06:00.190> place

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
or avoid it happening in the first place

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.470 
or avoid it happening in the first place

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
what that reset does I'm not too sure

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.730 
what that reset does I'm not too sure
but<00:06:23.979> at<00:06:24.460> the<00:06:24.550> same<00:06:24.700> time<00:06:25.000> I'm<00:06:25.120> not<00:06:25.240> too<00:06:25.419> sure

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
but at the same time I'm not too sure

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.140 
but at the same time I'm not too sure
what's<00:06:26.740> actually<00:06:27.100> caused<00:06:27.310> this<00:06:27.550> Y<00:06:27.820> screen

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
what's actually caused this Y screen

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.469 
what's actually caused this Y screen
I've<00:06:28.419> tried<00:06:28.660> three<00:06:28.900> different<00:06:29.020> screens<00:06:30.479> in

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
I've tried three different screens in

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.690 
I've tried three different screens in
the<00:06:31.630> mean<00:06:31.780> time<00:06:32.050> as<00:06:32.260> well<00:06:32.440> and<00:06:32.830> it's<00:06:33.010> still<00:06:33.430> not

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
the mean time as well and it's still not

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.300 
the mean time as well and it's still not
working<00:06:33.910> so<00:06:34.660> with<00:06:35.590> that<00:06:35.800> it<00:06:35.950> looks<00:06:36.130> like<00:06:36.280> a

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
working so with that it looks like a

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.159 
working so with that it looks like a
graphics<00:06:36.820> hardware<00:06:36.970> problem<00:06:37.690> somewhere

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
graphics hardware problem somewhere

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.860 
graphics hardware problem somewhere
inside<00:06:39.130> the<00:06:39.340> main<00:06:39.520> bar<00:06:39.790> and<00:06:40.450> something<00:06:40.840> like

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
inside the main bar and something like

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.040 
inside the main bar and something like
that<00:06:41.340> unfortunately<00:06:42.340> can't<00:06:42.550> be<00:06:42.729> fixed<00:06:43.050> so

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
that unfortunately can't be fixed so

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.990 
that unfortunately can't be fixed so
with<00:06:44.350> that<00:06:44.560> there's<00:06:44.770> nothing<00:06:44.950> more<00:06:45.580> than<00:06:45.910> we

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
with that there's nothing more than we
