reading and yeah so these are just going

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.550 
reading and yeah so these are just going

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.170 
so and not really the full matches
they'll<00:00:26.160> probably<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.580> next<00:00:26.730> week's<00:00:27.029> episode

they'll probably be next week's episode
and<00:00:27.599> I'll<00:00:27.660> probably<00:00:27.900> alternate<00:00:28.529> through<00:00:29.279> that

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
last goal wasn't the 79th minute because

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.219 
last goal wasn't the 79th minute because
this<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.570> we<00:02:03.570> had<00:02:03.689> they<00:02:03.780> come<00:02:03.930> back<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.200> a
