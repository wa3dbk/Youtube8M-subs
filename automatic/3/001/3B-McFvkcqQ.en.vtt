Congress<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.440> president<00:02:05.860> in<00:02:05.950> 1999<00:02:06.700> and

Congress and the president in 1999 and

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.820 
Congress and the president in 1999 and
my<00:02:07.420> guess<00:02:07.630> is<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:07.870> Barney<00:02:08.320> Frank<00:02:08.530> has<00:02:08.679> not

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
my guess is that Barney Frank has not

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.160 
my guess is that Barney Frank has not
read<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.130> report<00:02:09.490> because<00:02:10.060> after<00:02:10.600> studying

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
read the report because after studying

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.870 
read the report because after studying
the<00:02:11.260> issue<00:02:11.440> for<00:02:11.860> two<00:02:12.010> years<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.520> spending

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
the issue for two years and spending

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.000 
the issue for two years and spending
five<00:02:13.120> million<00:02:13.420> dollars<00:02:13.930> doing<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.470> we

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
five million dollars doing so we

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.770 
five million dollars doing so we
concluded<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.790> internet<00:02:16.209> gambling<00:02:16.570> should

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
concluded that internet gambling should

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.390 
concluded that internet gambling should
be<00:02:16.900> prohibited<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.590> fact<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.040> was<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.250> only

be prohibited in fact it was the only

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.190 
be prohibited in fact it was the only
form<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.850> gambling<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.810> Commission

decided should be prohibited he and that

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.300 
decided should be prohibited he and that
is<00:02:22.690> because<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.470> predatory<00:02:23.920> form<00:02:24.190> of
