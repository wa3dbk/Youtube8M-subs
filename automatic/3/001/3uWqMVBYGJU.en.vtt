00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.029
 more video here at stay gold with 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.330
 the unboxing of the iphone 5 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.460
 now it's starting to be fun yes I would 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.469
 say we start directly and that 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.000
 of course we have the iphone 5 in 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.680
 black in the 32gb version and what we do 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.109
 Of course, seeing us directly is direct 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.060
 this time the whole is the whole 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.189
 packing in black so have at the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.670
 black version completely in black 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.009
 nothing at all knows and the package on 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.190
 every case has become bigger so much 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.059
 worse so nice packaging of course 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:46.079
 Also something special and already 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:47.059
 her first way off and that's how we have it 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.800
 iphone 5 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:55.739
 of course a little bit longer 4 inches 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.430
 display and often lighter in each case 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.379
 So you have noticed that directly 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.589
 pretty cool 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.670
 so first to the side and yes what 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.760
 we see right here is that the new ones 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.159
 spots in any case, even in your own 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.280
 packaging are so to speak in the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.770
 Packaging as if he buys the extra 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.479
 also pretty cool then look later 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.430
 of course even more accurate 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:31.229
 power adapter and the lightning cable with 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:37.320
 I also connect the new dock directly 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:40.229
 let's have a moment so that new 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.170
 Wires cable is really pretty 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.119
 quite small the connection could you 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.360
 not quite so before seeing so 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.020
 really small so you can too 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.020
 your place 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.350
 or call her pence now I am 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.840
 Do not want to be so sure anymore 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.530
 we can quickly look it up 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.570
 are your house, I was really okay 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.430
 so we look first I'm more of the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.270
 Master in things for the first time 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:17.920
 open up because I do not want to be here 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:20.480
 but now so short time to wind up 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.860
 and here we have the new airports 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.180
 with remote control of course because of that 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.510
 the shape of her interesting in any case 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.800
 from there is definitely a review if 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.170
 I'm a bit long 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.330
 the new ones have tested their couch 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.270
 have power adapters we have now 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.150
 of course the iphone came to me for a moment 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.700
 to the innards what we here so one 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.610
 Of course, instructions have that again 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.080
 small cultural rausholen the sim card 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.870
 nano we have now here in the 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.140
 side in it no longer the micro sim and 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.459
 the usual operations of course 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.510
 like the iphone too in the long run 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.730
 because they are a bit too 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.200
 bigger than usual 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.080
 and of course apple stickers that are allowed 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.959
 not missing 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.400
 we come to the iphone itself what he yes 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.860
 the highlight of the pack is and 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.500
 would not bring us the whole thing 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.180
 I 'll take the film off and on 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.489
 looked at all this a bit 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.010
 yes as I said completely black so too 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.600
 The frame is no longer in silver 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.700
 kept but now completely black 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.019
 The sim cards have that too 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.049
 Shrunk a bit because it only 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.670
 Nor is the nanosilver down here 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.049
 have with the dock connector the too 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.239
 pretty small as I said 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.130
 for the lightning joined the 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.420
 headphone jack it is also down and 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.640
 not up here is only 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.150
 the power button will be on the side 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.580
 the barium buttons and the newsweek and 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.530
 yes camera of course behind and the 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.120
 split back really makes one 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.239
 Hammer impression that I have her up 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.470
 now only seen on the photos 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.090
 but it looks really pretty cool 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.800
 made up very high 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.410
 the impression here, too 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.200
 One can only say that you have completed 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.200
 very well done and yes I'm happy 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.360
 Also many more videos like the review 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.680
 tests of the camera or no idea of ​​the 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.980
 first start so there really is 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.629
 Of course, some accessories also come 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.129
 and yes, if you want to see it all 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.970
 then I would be glad if you were there 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:19.340

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.630

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.220
 unboxing from the iphone 5 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.790
