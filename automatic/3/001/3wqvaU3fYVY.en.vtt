Bluetooth music receiver and I've

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.150 
Bluetooth music receiver and I've
connected<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.530> vehicle<00:00:13.950> power

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
connected this to the vehicle power

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.420 
connected this to the vehicle power
adapter<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:15.179> my<00:00:15.480> car<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.340> connected<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
adapter in my car and connected the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.240 
adapter in my car and connected the
micro<00:00:17.789> USB<00:00:17.820> connection<00:00:18.840> I've<00:00:19.410> also<00:00:19.619> connected

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
micro USB connection I've also connected

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.730 
micro USB connection I've also connected
a<00:00:20.490> couple<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.029> RCA<00:00:21.750> leads<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.320> left<00:00:22.529> and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
a couple of RCA leads here left and

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.060 
a couple of RCA leads here left and
right<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.699> cable<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.960> split<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.680> then

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
right and this cable is split and then

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.009 
right and this cable is split and then
it<00:00:26.189> emerges<00:00:26.849> into<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.359> wire<00:00:27.570> at<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.840> other

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
it emerges into one wire at the other

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.299 
it emerges into one wire at the other
end<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> standard<00:00:29.070> 3.5<00:00:29.599> millimeter<00:00:30.599> jack

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
end is a standard 3.5 millimeter jack

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.000 
end is a standard 3.5 millimeter jack
and<00:00:32.309> that's<00:00:32.460> connected<00:00:32.759> into<00:00:33.270> my<00:00:33.540> car<00:00:34.380> stereo

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and that's connected into my car stereo

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.970 
and that's connected into my car stereo
so<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.210> I'm<00:00:36.420> currently<00:00:36.780> set<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.290> or

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
so you can see I'm currently set as or

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.240 
so you can see I'm currently set as or
so<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.670> takes<00:00:38.910> sound<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.660> through<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.800> Orcs

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
so it takes sound in through the Orcs

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.310 
so it takes sound in through the Orcs
connection<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.420> I've<00:00:42.510> connected<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
connection and I've connected up to the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.670 
connection and I've connected up to the
VM<00:00:43.890> 10<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.370> give<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> slightly<00:00:45.059> different

may not have bluetooth installed in it

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.100 
may not have bluetooth installed in it
mine<00:00:52.590> has<00:00:52.920> bluetooth<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> nifty

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
mine has bluetooth but this is a nifty

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.590 
mine has bluetooth but this is a nifty

using<00:01:20.329> NFC<00:01:20.630> OneTouch<00:01:21.290> pairing<00:01:21.829> you<00:01:22.490> can<00:01:22.670> see

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
using NFC OneTouch pairing you can see

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.950 
using NFC OneTouch pairing you can see
it's<00:01:22.909> connecting<00:01:25.149> and<00:01:26.149> now<00:01:26.360> it's<00:01:26.540> coming<00:01:26.750> out

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
it's connecting and now it's coming out

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.580 
it's connecting and now it's coming out
of<00:01:27.610> my<00:01:28.610> car<00:01:28.970> stereo<00:01:29.299> system<00:01:29.869> so<00:01:30.170> I<00:01:30.229> can<00:01:30.409> turn

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
of my car stereo system so I can turn

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.130 
of my car stereo system so I can turn
the<00:01:30.710> volume<00:01:30.740> up<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:35.600> I<00:01:35.689> could<00:01:35.869> potentially

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
the volume up and I could potentially

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.499 
the volume up and I could potentially
watch<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.860> video<00:01:37.070> back<00:01:37.369> I<00:01:37.700> could<00:01:38.149> mount<00:01:38.360> this

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
watch the video back I could mount this

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.779 
watch the video back I could mount this
up<00:01:38.750> now<00:01:39.530> this<00:01:39.679> could<00:01:39.950> work<00:01:40.189> for<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:40.580> whole

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
up now this could work for a whole

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.340 
up now this could work for a whole
variety<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:41.390> things<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:44.630> I<00:01:44.659> said<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:45.020> could<00:01:45.200> be

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
variety of things so I said it could be

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.669 
variety of things so I said it could be
for<00:01:45.710> navigation<00:01:46.780> for<00:01:47.780> voice<00:01:47.960> calls<00:01:48.289> it<00:01:48.500> might

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
for navigation for voice calls it might

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.010 
for navigation for voice calls it might
be<00:01:48.799> a<00:01:48.830> safer<00:01:49.280> way<00:01:49.429> of<00:01:49.729> dealing<00:01:50.360> with<00:01:50.479> things

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
be a safer way of dealing with things

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.620 
be a safer way of dealing with things
now<00:01:51.860> I've<00:01:52.340> Amit<00:01:52.700> Lee<00:01:52.819> got<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.030> bit<00:01:53.209> of<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.360> crude

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
now I've Amit Lee got a bit of a crude

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.350 
now I've Amit Lee got a bit of a crude
setup<00:01:54.170> here<00:01:54.440> at<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.100> moment<00:01:55.520> it's<00:01:55.729> just<00:01:56.090> wide

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
setup here at the moment it's just wide

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.230 
setup here at the moment it's just wide
in<00:01:56.630> all<00:01:57.140> loose<00:01:57.530> but<00:01:57.950> if<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:58.490> did<00:01:58.640> a<00:01:58.670> neat<00:01:58.909> setup

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
in all loose but if you did a neat setup

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.230 
in all loose but if you did a neat setup
you<00:01:59.539> could<00:01:59.720> put<00:01:59.929> this<00:02:00.049> behind<00:02:00.440> your<00:02:01.009> dash<00:02:01.240> in

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
you could put this behind your dash in

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.719 
you could put this behind your dash in
your<00:02:02.450> glove<00:02:02.659> box<00:02:02.740> potentially<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:04.490> pair

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
your glove box potentially and just pair

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.059
