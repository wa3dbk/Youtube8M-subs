00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.279
 this video today is about the audio 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 Technica struggles go 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.250
 these are studio headphones and they want to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.760
 We'll take a closer look today 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.760
 look at 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.460
 you get this headphone for 159 euro 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.899
 At Tormann I have her white 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.089
 Of course, there is also a version 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.590
 like a black for the black r 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.239
 the good thing about the headphones is simple 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.309
 that you can spend a lot for the low price 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.399
 A lot of headphones you get has one 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:35.440
 Transmission range from 15 heart up to 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.659
 28,000 heart and in sound pressure of 99 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.339
 decibel that means that every kind 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:40.899
 really good music 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.820
 If you can only enjoy it now from 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.530
 to pay down also reads it is so 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.300
 that the headphones are so incredibly comfortable 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.280
 are that you could sleep in it like that 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.629
 At least sometimes I'm worried about it 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.699
 the ears really very soft and 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.259
 Also on your head so that you open 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.549
 a long bus ride for example or 

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:56.680
 if you just have it in front of the computer 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.930
 longer has really without it too 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.670
 can remember a long time to hear the music 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.930
 problems many white headphones it is 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.489
 that it will not be bigger anymore 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.720
 Fits fit but that is not here 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.970
 problem i think it 's even relative 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.470
 stylish solved you have such a small 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.799
 Metal rail with small reef inside 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.210
 in it 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.250
 and you can still do that on both sides 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.450
 really big on the other 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.040
 the ear can be really in 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.600
 every possible direction turns that 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.520
 means there it fits again then 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.810
 any head many will now 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.189
 maybe say that then around 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.170
 it rattles but it is not 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.940
 krabat less than the plastic beach 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.530
 that they are also plastic 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.850
 headphones but still they are like me 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.409
 find them much better 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.670
 Assembled and as soon as you open the 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.680
 the head did not move anyway 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.000
 more of the sound quality too 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.340
 it really benefits the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.900
 gilded jack down to what we 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.060
 here, too, have a big one here 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.580
 housing and then a small spring 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.350
 around this tricky point the likes 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.270
 let's go with such headphones 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.830
 this is prevented while I 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.180
 now with me a little rust underneath 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.560
 I do not know where it comes from 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.360
 i had the headphones maybe 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.979
 once outside and now it is here 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 somehow rust down even if possible 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.040
 Damage caused by this huge connection 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.450
 changed down because it excites me every 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.369
 Let's see if I have the iphone with one 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.869
 case user and music can because wants 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.909
 that does not have to be case 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.400
 lose weight or the iphone one ran 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.049
 to listen to music and find that 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.759
 I sometimes get extremely annoyed 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.110
 Generally there are headphones in two 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.030
 different variants how do we have 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.310
 the m5 is the variant of it with a 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.290
 cleared cable resulting in up to three 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.230
 ten long lets there is one more 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.939
 fts variant for djs where is that 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.170
 Cable has just also it is so 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.489
 it does not isolate those stupid ones 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.840
 Christel makes sounds when you do that 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.489
 cable rubbing against each other or 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.959
 somehow twisted or something 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.530
 All this leads to the fact that the 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.850
 sound quality so mega good 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.470
 is that you prefer the headphones 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.300
 Do not want to settle if you music 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.980
 hears or that no longer at all 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.930
 would like to have music through speakers 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.910
 because in the songs really everything 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.800
 Heard there are details I never had before 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.720
 has also heard with other headphones 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.640
 which thereby become clear the 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.260
 Frequency range of headphones is bigger 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.120
 as the human ear can perceive 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.770
 and that makes it possible for the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.450
 songs that really have more frequencies 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.260
 Names as they actually hear these 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.000
 get across 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.010
 So everyone's worth really good 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.660
 sound quality has and not just 1000 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.250
 euro in the bag should fly around 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.840
 to share these do not resort to the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.430
 cheap beats headphones than the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.690
 sound quality really terrible then 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.250
 I thank you as always for seeing 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.080
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.830
 See you in the next video 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.830
 look there
