00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.440 
eBay - I guess but you know the unit's
themselves<00:01:34.920> aren't<00:01:35.400> very<00:01:35.729> expensive<00:01:36.299> it's

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
themselves aren't very expensive it's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.380 
themselves aren't very expensive it's
the<00:01:36.570> shipping<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.409> makes<00:01:37.799> them<00:01:38.009> more

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
the shipping that that makes them more

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.219

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.930 
I think the dates on them I've seen like
75<00:03:02.830> -<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.400> think<00:03:03.580> 95<00:03:04.390> was<00:03:04.630> it<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.870> saw<00:03:05.080> one<00:03:05.290> but<00:03:05.940> you

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
75 - I think 95 was it I saw one but you

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.610

think there was a couple different

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.240 
think there was a couple different
manufacturers<00:03:10.720> but<00:03:10.989> they<00:03:11.230> all<00:03:11.680> are<00:03:11.860> made<00:03:12.100> to

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250
