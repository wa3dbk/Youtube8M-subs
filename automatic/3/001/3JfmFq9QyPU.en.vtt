00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
 how about friends welcome to mechanics 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:10.610
 plus now let's refine union 2 liters 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.610
 16 bands 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.830
 that we need our spare parts 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.789
 four spark plugs that here are here is 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.359
 our 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.789
 bovine are two coils in one you are 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.559
 call a bovine set our filter 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:33.050
 of air that goes here is round and big 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:35.449
 petrol filter in this is a filter 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.159
 regulator if they realize in the rail of 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:42.409
 injectors we do not have any regulator 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.390
 only a hose goes in is a 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.149
 regulatory filter that goes inside the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.899
 gasoline tank is rare that it 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:57.070
 need to change that regulator is very 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.070
 expensive is worth 50 dollars from above 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.960
 so what do we need with 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.409
 surgeries 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.890
 our filter a liquid to wash 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.460
 our 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.460
 acceleration body we need can 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.320
 be our multimeter to check the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.320
 resistance of spark plug changes 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.320
 our rattle 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.970
 to remove spark plugs an extension 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.600
 our five-eighth die 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.040
 to remove the spark plugs our screwdriver 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.330
 a can make this screwdriver what 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.030
 only one that has 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.850
 cap is a power and 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.080
 screwdriver 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:52.160
 God our spark plug gauge 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.190
 and our adapter to be able to connect 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:00.070
 the buoy as well as our voice and our 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.070
 liquid lava directors like 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.710
 our pressurized mount to wash the 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.630
 true acceleration body 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.050
 they realize it 's all we need 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.050
 and air from our compressor
