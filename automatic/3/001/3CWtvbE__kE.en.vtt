00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.810
 nutrients are molecules 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.760
 we get in the diet 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.650
 whether to make molecules 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.839
 useful for our body or art 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.639
 to get energy 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.139
 we will speak more particularly 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.330
 today micronutrients 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.820
 that is, fats, carbohydrates and 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.200
 proteins for a description more 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.990
 complete lipids you can go 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.910
 see the video 12 points to whom and on this 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.370
 youtube channel but I could tell you 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.650
 that the most important lipids this 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.649
 are traits to sylvie his roles that one 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.289
 also called triglycerides and 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.719
 phospholipids so that's a little bit of that 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.039
 which will be question in the videos that 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.480
 will follow along with the others 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:49.059
 features other categories 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:51.019
 as for carbohydrates they are molecules 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.030
 if we first talk about monos 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.949
 saccharides these are molecules that 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.739
 contains at least one carbon group 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.749
 he lifted Sept. 12 ie 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.479
 it's to forget 01 carbon hey yeah 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:10.159
 then the others because the ban of the chain 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:14.229
 unverified carbon 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.229
 an alcon group at h 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.439
 which means if we have a carbonnel and 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.109
 all the other good ones who have highs 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:29.619
 and down we have an empirical formula 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.619
 general which corresponds to ch2o 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.590
 for all saccharide and ayman evils 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.470
 sayyed are the basic constituents of 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.240
 polysaccharides and of course also 10 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.340
 at 15 between the buses we do not 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.150
 oligosaccharides that are formed of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.140
 a few words # 5 void for 1/4 and 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.780
 of you can go see the videos 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.190
 in the section at the 12 points of the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.320
 third category of micronutrients 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.000
 are the proteins the proteins are 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.330
 polymers that are made up like 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.890
 alpha amino acid base unit so 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.890
 then the basic units 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.140
 are the alpha acids mined them to 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:34.189
 saidal famine and have like a formula 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:36.439
 general this where we at an end m 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.379
 terminal one end it's terminal 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.239
 then on the carbon that is in the middle in 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.530
 a young side that can be many 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.390
 things that can be very very varied 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.859
 sometimes it's only hydrocarbon 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.220
 sometimes we have heteros waiting for the 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.319
 chain 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.030
 the reason we call these 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.709
 human trials sees x-tones acid 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.030
 then see why we call it 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.389
 of amine because of course eyes a 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.970
 amine 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.889
 so why is it called famine room 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.720
 and because you know when we 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.780
 starts to number from the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.760
 main function the carbon that just 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.959
 next to the main carbon in a 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.480
 some form of nomenclature on 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.849
 call it alpha carbon 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.379
 otherwise we could have also numbered according to 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.879
 the nomenclature with which you are 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.950
 perhaps more familiar ie 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.819
 number 10 e carbon the home this carbon 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.889
 the 2 when we would call this type of 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.349
 structure e and 7 th synonymous with access dale 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.349
 farm in and the 2.1 million to sin 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.810
 because it is on carbon 2 that we have 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.590
 mine or on carbon at a time 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.590
 we were better
