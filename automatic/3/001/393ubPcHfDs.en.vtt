00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
 it 

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.950
 it 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.340
 the one everyone these cribs write 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.739
 jauzion find themselves for a new 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.079
 glitch video on blog like the in 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.789
 semi mode so it'll be a led on the 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.859
 map rays so to start you 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.989
 need one away you will need two 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.730
 thrusters to start you go 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.610
 start your party on rules and 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.870
 you will build the thruster 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.940
 so once that's over you'll go 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.739
 return to the peace of w and you go 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.360
 already take the first thruster that 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.790
 you have in hand and you go on 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.170
 place in front of the rock 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.579
 there after you go ask your 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.980
 milk that passes you the second 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.510
 propeller and you will take the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.339
 first thruster in traction of the rock 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.710
 so normally if everything goes well 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.879
 he will propel you on the rock 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.920
 once on the rock you go 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.899
 take the second booster and you 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.960
 put it in front of the card 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.160
 once they make the plug 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.619
 you will take the thruster 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.929
 enormously and propels you on the plug 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.940
 so once here you will be totally 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:16.250
 invincible and it will create a huge 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.130
 anti zombies barriers just behind 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.390
 behind the wall their prey has them 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.579
 more sleeves possible I you 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.070
 advises to have a booster and even 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.360
 to be at 4/4 you just place the 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.700
 second thruster at the top of the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.530
 stairs for whom for whom propels them 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.189
 the zombies why who kills you because 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.719
 that there will be zombies from the window 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.399
 in stairs and zombies from the 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.469
 window down the stairs that 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.090
 can come on you so I'll you 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.350
 advise to take the dead keys and 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.890
 to place it just behind 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.240
 and the same for thrusters then there 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.740
 you can make the most runs 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.049
 possible but you can paralyzed 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.509
 sleeves to infinity because with the sli was 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.100
 with special forgiveness tears you can 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.140
 not make a whole round because it is 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.240
 too much spawn or rap there will have been 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.670
 two years but who will come on the 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.350
 liquid so that they all die for 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.939
 I hope this glitch video 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.960
 you will have liked and I would tell you the 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.960
 next a video walk
