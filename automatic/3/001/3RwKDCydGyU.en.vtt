00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.840 
because the odds for a straight victory
as<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.320> very<00:02:01.649> very<00:02:02.009> little<00:02:02.369> your

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
as we know is very very little your

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
as we know is very very little your
riders<00:02:03.210> average<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.719> value<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.200> backing

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
riders average the value here backing

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.560 
riders average the value here backing
the<00:02:04.710> straight<00:02:05.009> victory<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:06.030> Barcelona

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the straight victory the Barcelona

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.839 
the straight victory the Barcelona
winning<00:02:06.750> half<00:02:07.079> time<00:02:07.350> full<00:02:07.680> time<00:02:07.710> that's<00:02:08.069> 1.5

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
winning half time full time that's 1.5

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.729 
winning half time full time that's 1.5
now<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> know<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:10.080> don't<00:02:10.259> generally<00:02:10.500> go<00:02:10.709> for

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
now I know we don't generally go for

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.619 
now I know we don't generally go for
bets<00:02:11.099> as<00:02:11.280> low<00:02:11.459> as<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.879> but<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.390> Barcelona

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
bets as low as that but it's Barcelona

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.720 
bets as low as that but it's Barcelona
winning<00:02:14.629> half-time<00:02:15.019> full-time<00:02:15.469> price<00:02:15.680> 1.5<00:02:16.340> do

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730

that<00:03:39.500> whatever<00:03:39.949> team<00:03:40.489> they<00:03:40.669> are<00:03:40.760> playing<00:03:41.030> it's

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
that whatever team they are playing it's

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.759 
that whatever team they are playing it's
it's<00:03:42.139> risky<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.769> put<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:44.389> put<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.659> bet<00:03:44.900> Barcelona
