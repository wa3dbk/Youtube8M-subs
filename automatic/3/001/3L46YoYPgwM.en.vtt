 Hello everyone and welcome to 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.180
 doctissimo in your show mom 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.940
 instruction for children from 6 to 16 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.010
 years is mandatory for some 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.920
 parents choose and educational system 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.070
 alternative a dad and a mom come 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.070
 bear witness 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.220
 paul hello you are the mother of sacha 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.320
 who is 4 years old and of charlie elliott who 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.460
 are 14-month-old twins and you have 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.789
 enrolled your daughter was born in a 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.430
 montessori school yes patrick welcome 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.769
 you are the father of mathieu and marion 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.150
 who are respectively 11 and 9 years old and 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.710
 when your children were two and four 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.280
 years ago you went around 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.110
 africa 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.530
 and since they have lived most of 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.690
 their distance education to jo about 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.820
 thirty thousand children aged six to sixteen 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.030
 do not go to school every morning 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.610
 represents about 0 3% of them 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.500
 this is the case of your patrick children you 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.239
 went to mauritania with them when 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.829
 you came back you tried to 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.320
 to school in a classical school in 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.729
 France and then you have opted for the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.880
 it was not able to you the system 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.110
 French simply we are traveling 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.240
 a lot with children on the one hand 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.009
 so there is first a practical function 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.240
 then when they were in high school 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.009
 French in nouakchott 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.840
 I was in a very good school in 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.149
 which in fact it lends itself very well and 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.530
 we considered that education that 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.720
 was made by this school were 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.340
 excellent that we returned to France 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.180
 simply we did not find everything to 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.130
 makes the same conditions 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.570
 but what did you like in 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.250
 the French school is not a criticism 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.400
 on the institution was simply I 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.970
 think there are schools or sometimes that 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.070
 is better 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.420
 or just simply try on a 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.000
 teacher we love or do not like 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.040
 good 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.190
 it's just that we're actually trying to 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.260
 adapt according to the school we 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.150
 will find paul you have not even tried 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.400
 a traditional educational system you 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.660
 when you were pregnant and as to 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.150
 girls were small you searched 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.860
 a house next to a montessori school 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.979
 because you knew that anyway 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.670
 it would not integrate a system 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.200
 traditional educational 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.900
 so what is the specificity of this 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.770
 school the idea is to accompany 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.870
 the child to respect him for example the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.760
 classes are mixed the kids are 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.160
 all mixed between 3 and 6 years ago there is 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.450
 not the first year second year at 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.250
 3rd kindergarten because the children 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.650
 learn a lot between them the big ones 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.940
 love to teach little ones 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.820
 little ones like to learn from 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.380
 great there are a lot of exercises from 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.970
 work they call it really we 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.400
 always remains in this perspective of 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.380
 alone to accompany the child to 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.640
 that he learns to do alone the child he 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.860
 is curious by nature he wants 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.959
 to learn by nature so the idea is 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.340
 to let him go to those towards this 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.130
 which interests him without necessarily 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.410
 lead and why do you think a school 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.950
 montessori respond better to your 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.470
 expectations 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.060
 not necessarily that montessori it could 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.380
 to be a nerve fall finally there are 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.420
 other alternative schools of auzances 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.970
 other alternative teachings that 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.680
 are interesting after montessori I 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.560
 thought it sticked better ah ah ah 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.299
 our way of being so so that's it 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.799
 it is sure montessori that our 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.670
 choice went pisi too 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.049
 certainly in schools 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.549
 alternative one that is the most 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.280
 present and therefore most easily 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.000
 findable in france in ile de france 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.079
 particularly 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.340
 but how does it go on a daily basis 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.280
 Basque it's an organization 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.950
 incredible to give education to his 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.150
 kids it's a lot of time it's 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.920
 a lot of time I go there 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.430
 nearly three hours a day but 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.890
 on the other hand we work globally 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.330
 more flexible than at school by 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.910
 example month the courses that I give these 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.560
 recipes around 11am and around 17 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.180
 hours because I saw that it was at 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.130
 that moment that mathieu learn the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.670
 the best we do about three hours 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.200
 per day 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.390
 but on the other hand work almost all 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.650
 the days of the week and it's not 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.390
 too difficult do not follow classes 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.730
 because that's okay he's in sixth 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.630
 but after that when we go to math 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.870
 4th is complicated for you I hope 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.769
 than me among the things I 'm trying to 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.260
 working with matthieu has 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.700
 clearly made autonomy so 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.830
 I hope that when he is in 4th he will have 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.780
 a little bit of autonomy and who can 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.150
 working alone then the question we 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.350
 arises inevitably when we talk about cned 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.260
 for children this is the question of 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.060
 sociability it misses him not to 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.209
 not have classmates at your 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.650
 son one can do kids can 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.810
 to socialize outside of school is 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.150
 a bit like saying to adults the 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.770
 socialization is necessarily the work 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.430
 but good apart from that on a daily basis 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.690
 anyway he makes friends in fact 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.510
 in his sports activities and 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.970
 artistic and montessori it stops at 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.950
 cm2 you thought about following 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.570
 for me what is interesting about 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.770
 montessori is that it takes things 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.030
 children really in early childhood 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.870
 so to bring them some 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.520
 some supports that will keep 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.280
 finally all the rest of the schooling 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.740
 so beautiful will join a school system 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.720
 traditional but it may be 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.130
 better armed as to go into a system 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.539
 traditional will have to adapt 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.950
 I do not know maybe she 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.390
 will fit very well maybe he will 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.880
 will take a year to adapt 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.919
 it's expensive yes that against 8 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.420
 clearly it's a sacrifice even one 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.640
 Can say 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.990
 we are in a school less 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.940
 dear island of France and we are already 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.930
 not far from 600 euros per month out of 10 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.790
 month so yes yes it's a hit 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.760
 really important and you think that 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.710
 mathieu will do all his schooling thanks to 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.280
 you with the cned no it's not this is 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.190
 not likely 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.840
 I do not think so if we have the opportunity 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.060
 to go to an alternative school on 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.650
 will not go what it is 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.240
 actually schools that attach themselves 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.640
 think outside the outside of 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.910
 know how to develop the personality of 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.190
 children is super important to me 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.270
 and the teenagers I saw that they 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.520
 were out of those schools were 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.410
 actually rather balanced people 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.320
 and that there was a will in general 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.610
 to return to the classical system 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.980
 he had a willingness to work that 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.750
 kim who hit me you go 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.220
 by the cned for the education of your 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.050
 children but at some point your 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.420
 girl preferred to go to school 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.430
 why did it happen 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.050
 do we have to adapt to the children we 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.560
 our daughter was struggling we had 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.060
 bad to do him the lessons with the cned 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.710
 simply do not believe that 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.050
 because we are the parent is going to be a good 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.940
 professor it works with my son that 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.740
 even works very well with my son with 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.810
 my daughter that was it was complicated and 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.470
 and then she is she needed to get 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.050
 find anyway in a 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.480
 environment with his girlfriends 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.920
 so we simply adapted the 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.270
 does your daughter get schooled 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.300
 in a classic system that you have a 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.430
 little reconciled with the system 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.470
 but me if my daughter is happy I 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.710
 am also I would not consider it 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:39.380
 bad schools especially just 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.450
 there it is more suited to marion so very 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.300
 well like that but I know that mathieu 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:47.000
 he has a way of working he is 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.350
 fast he has a lot of memory when he 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.330
 go to school he gets bored very quickly 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.880
 and in fact they not only he goes 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.820
 wasting time but but other 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.140
 apart he takes he takes bad 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.940
 paths ultimately when a child 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.740
 bored in class that does not give 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.510
 good results in general your twins 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.830
 are 14 years old today you think the 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.780
 register to ride smiles also and 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.310
 well we hope for now I am 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.810
 on parental leave so obviously that 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.580
 makes a hole in the budget too when
