so same structure yeah so just copy
exactly<00:01:49.960> what<00:01:50.260> I'm<00:01:50.350> doing<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:50.830> then<00:01:50.950> you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
exactly what I'm doing and then you

00:01:51.010 --> 00:02:01.310 
exactly what I'm doing and then you
should<00:01:51.400> have<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:53.970> dispenser<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.799> thing<00:01:57.130> done

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:10.460 

he<00:02:02.320> said

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.750 

right<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:11.650> that's<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:12.010> social<00:02:12.220> structure<00:02:12.640> you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
right so that's the social structure you

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.710 
right so that's the social structure you
need<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:14.080> then<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.760> all<00:02:15.970> for<00:02:16.180> sure<00:02:16.569> my

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
need and then this is all for sure my

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.040 
need and then this is all for sure my
just<00:02:16.930> really<00:02:17.200> quickly<00:02:17.940> they<00:02:18.940> here<00:02:19.180> Benson<00:02:19.930> I

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
just really quickly they here Benson I

just really quickly they here Benson I
don't<00:02:20.170> know<00:02:20.230> why<00:02:20.380> got<00:02:20.560> another<00:02:20.830> one<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.450> I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
don't know why got another one just so I

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.640 
don't know why got another one just so I
don't<00:02:22.569> get<00:02:22.780> there's<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.050> chickens<00:02:23.440> running

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650

don't get there's a chickens running
around<00:02:23.769> everywhere<00:02:24.160> cuz<00:02:24.430> that's<00:02:24.640> just

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
around everywhere cuz that's just

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.949 
around everywhere cuz that's just
annoying

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
annoying

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.930 
annoying
cuz<00:02:26.830> I'll<00:02:26.950> be<00:02:27.040> using<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:27.370> world<00:02:27.610> for<00:02:27.790> like

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
cuz I'll be using this world for like

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:36.930 
cuz I'll be using this world for like
other<00:02:28.150> videos<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:35.220> see<00:02:36.220> ya<00:02:36.310> for<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.580> redstone

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
other videos so see ya for the redstone

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.630 
other videos so see ya for the redstone
wiring<00:02:37.420> part<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.260> I'm<00:02:39.130> gonna<00:02:39.340> start<00:02:39.580> off

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
wiring part of it I'm gonna start off

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.910 
wiring part of it I'm gonna start off
with<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.819> lever<00:02:40.090> here<00:02:40.420> now<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.260> thing<00:02:41.620> with

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
with a lever here now the thing with

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.100 
with a lever here now the thing with
this<00:02:41.980> saw<00:02:42.400> circuit<00:02:42.940> as<00:02:43.420> you'll<00:02:43.720> know<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:43.989> this

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
this saw circuit as you'll know is this

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.600 
this saw circuit as you'll know is this
lever<00:02:44.380> is<00:02:44.560> currently<00:02:44.980> in<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.250> off<00:02:45.370> position

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
lever is currently in the off position

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.509 
lever is currently in the off position
and<00:02:46.150> now<00:02:46.780> it's<00:02:46.930> in<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.110> on<00:02:47.230> position<00:02:47.519> with

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
and now it's in the on position with

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.670 
and now it's in the on position with
this<00:02:48.730> circuit<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.630> even<00:02:50.260> though<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.410> looks

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
this circuit that even though it looks

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.470 
this circuit that even though it looks
like<00:02:50.769> it's<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.100> off<00:02:51.250> position<00:02:51.330> for<00:02:52.330> this

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
like it's in the off position for this

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.509 
like it's in the off position for this
particular<00:02:53.200> circuit<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.860> that's<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.370> on

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
particular circuit that that's in the on

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.970 
particular circuit that that's in the on
position<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:55.530> now<00:02:56.530> it's<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.890> off

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
position and now it's in the off

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.690 
position and now it's in the off
position<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.209> saw<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:59.019> opposite<00:02:59.700> scene

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
position so you saw the opposite scene

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.020 
position so you saw the opposite scene
of<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.910> redstone<00:03:01.470> they're<00:03:02.970> there<00:03:03.970> they're

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030
