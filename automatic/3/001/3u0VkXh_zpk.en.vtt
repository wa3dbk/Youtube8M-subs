wanting<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.269> know<00:00:15.389> which<00:00:15.660> diagnostic<00:00:16.289> tools

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
wanting to know which diagnostic tools

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.349 
wanting to know which diagnostic tools
will<00:00:16.740> actually<00:00:17.100> cover<00:00:17.310> certain<00:00:17.640> systems<00:00:18.210> on

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
will actually cover certain systems on

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.960 
will actually cover certain systems on
their<00:00:18.539> x-type<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.830> main<00:00:20.010> systems<00:00:20.460> being<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
their x-type the main systems being the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.070 
their x-type the main systems being the
engine<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.750> ABS<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.150> restraints

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
engine the ABS the with the restraints

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.410 
engine the ABS the with the restraints
airbag<00:00:25.470> system<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.550> transmission

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
airbag system and the transmission

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.660 
airbag system and the transmission
control<00:00:27.930> system<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.800> what<00:00:28.980> I'm<00:00:29.070> gonna<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.429> here

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
control system so what I'm gonna do here

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.150 
control system so what I'm gonna do here
is<00:00:29.970> just<00:00:30.029> go<00:00:30.720> through<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> X<00:00:31.289> type<00:00:31.529> menu<00:00:31.920> on

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
is just go through the X type menu on

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.120 
is just go through the X type menu on
the<00:00:32.340> diagnostic<00:00:32.969> tool<00:00:33.149> here<00:00:33.680> just<00:00:34.680> hopefully

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
the diagnostic tool here just hopefully

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.860 
the diagnostic tool here just hopefully
you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.370> see<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:35.730> I'm<00:00:35.820> doing<00:00:36.090> here<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.690> X

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
you can see what I'm doing here so the X

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.040 
you can see what I'm doing here so the X
type<00:00:37.879> starting<00:00:38.879> from<00:00:39.120> 2001<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.020> 2003<00:00:42.050> so

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
type starting from 2001 to 2003 so

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.049 
type starting from 2001 to 2003 so
manually<00:00:43.559> select<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.520> giving<00:00:44.789> us<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
manually select and it's giving us the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.549 
manually select and it's giving us the
option<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.690> were<00:00:45.989> plugged<00:00:46.230> into<00:00:46.379> the

option if we were plugged into the
vehicle<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.190> would<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.180> diagnose<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
vehicle that is would be to diagnose the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.990 
vehicle that is would be to diagnose the
engine<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> transmission<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:50.250> ABS<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.879> the

system okay we'll go to 2004 to 2008
models<00:00:58.789> now<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.969> asking<00:01:00.270> us<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.719> select<00:01:01.079> our

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
models now it's asking us to select our

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.520 
models now it's asking us to select our
specific<00:01:02.219> engine<00:01:02.640> module<00:01:03.290> but<00:01:04.290> I'm<00:01:04.379> just

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
specific engine module but I'm just

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
specific engine module but I'm just
gonna<00:01:04.650> select<00:01:04.979> any<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.180> see

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
gonna select any one here as you can see

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
gonna select any one here as you can see
we've<00:01:06.479> got<00:01:06.510> engine<00:01:07.070> transmission<00:01:08.070> this

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
we've got engine transmission this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.710 
we've got engine transmission this
vehicle<00:01:08.970> obviously<00:01:09.270> has<00:01:09.420> two<00:01:09.570> different

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
vehicle obviously has two different

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.700 
vehicle obviously has two different
types<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.320> ABA<00:01:11.070> ABS<00:01:11.580> system<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.710> select

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
types of ABA ABS system so just select

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.200 
types of ABA ABS system so just select
them<00:01:13.860> they're<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> correct<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> then

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
them they're the correct one and then

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.820 
them they're the correct one and then
we've<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> restraints<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> air<00:01:16.500> value

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
we've got the restraints the air value

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.399 
we've got the restraints the air value
again<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:18.270> we'll<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.170> go<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
again there and then we'll just go and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.969 
again there and then we'll just go and
check<00:01:19.710> one<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> diesel<00:01:20.369> engines<00:01:21.890> there<00:01:22.890> we

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
check one of the diesel engines there we

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:23.510 
check one of the diesel engines there we
go

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
go

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.969 
go
this<00:01:23.880> time<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.390> covering<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> engine<00:01:25.409> abs

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this time it's covering the engine abs

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.840 
this time it's covering the engine abs
and<00:01:26.280> restraints<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> airbag<00:01:27.420> system<00:01:28.850> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
and restraints the airbag system and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.069 
and restraints the airbag system and
then<00:01:30.030> 2008<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.930> 2009<00:01:31.500> models<00:01:32.689> let's<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.900> go

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
then 2008 to 2009 models let's just go

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.600 
then 2008 to 2009 models let's just go
through<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> look<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.280> go

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
through and have a look there we go

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.370 
through and have a look there we go
sometimes<00:01:36.360> obviously<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.290> it

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
sometimes obviously as you can see it

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.670 
sometimes obviously as you can see it
depends<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.860> which<00:01:38.100> particular<00:01:39.680> control

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
depends on which particular control

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.530 
depends on which particular control
module<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.970> actually<00:01:42.750> installed<00:01:44.360> so<00:01:45.360> that's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
module is actually installed so that's

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.210 
module is actually installed so that's
the<00:01:45.689> engine<00:01:45.990> cover<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.380> transmissions<00:01:46.979> cover

is covered at the bottom there as well

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.090 
is covered at the bottom there as well
and<00:01:53.509> once<00:01:54.509> again<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:55.470> check<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> different

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
and once again just check a different

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
know which particular module is in your

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.150 
know which particular module is in your
vehicle<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:07.110> way<00:02:07.290> you'll<00:02:07.469> find<00:02:07.740> out<00:02:07.890> quickly

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
vehicle the way you'll find out quickly

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.889 
vehicle the way you'll find out quickly
is<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.819> by<00:02:08.940> basically<00:02:09.360> if<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.539> select

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
is but just by basically if you select

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.830 
is but just by basically if you select
that<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.470> can't

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
that one and you can't

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.140 
that one and you can't
connection<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:12.400> chances<00:02:12.760> are<00:02:12.849> you<00:02:12.970> going<00:02:13.090> to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
connection the chances are you going to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.300 
connection the chances are you going to
be<00:02:13.239> able<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.390> check<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:14.560> try<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.950> other<00:02:15.190> one

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
be able to check they try the other one

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.880 
be able to check they try the other one
then<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:15.580> will<00:02:15.730> get<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:15.970> connection<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.860> that

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
then you will get a connection so that

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.759 
then you will get a connection so that
is<00:02:18.160> up<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.849> 2009<00:02:19.660> model<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.500> that's<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
is up to the 2009 model so that's the

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:21.509 
is up to the 2009 model so that's the
Jaguar<00:02:21.129> x-type

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
Jaguar x-type

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.920 
Jaguar x-type
as<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.819> can<00:02:21.940> see<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.120> does<00:02:22.300> cover<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.690> lot<00:02:22.840> of

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
as you can see it does cover a lot of

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.650 
as you can see it does cover a lot of
other<00:02:23.050> drag<00:02:23.830> us<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.190> well<00:02:24.370> but<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.330> main<00:02:25.480> thing

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
other drag us as well but the main thing

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.390 
other drag us as well but the main thing
is<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.989> will<00:02:26.200> cover<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.560> main<00:02:26.860> systems

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
is that it will cover the main systems

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.309 
is that it will cover the main systems
