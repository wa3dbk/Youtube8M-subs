00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.840
 hello everyone I'm rock and I give them the 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.100
 Welcome to this new testing video 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.950
 in this opportunity I am going to show you 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.530
 how can they complete the fourth mission 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.450
 of this event the queen in which 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.300
 we will have to face peking 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.589
 is a level 30 scum then for 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.140
 can find we have to come to 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.359
 venus and we will have to get to the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.880
 location of the citadel if they do not know 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.919
 where is the citadel was simply 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.560
 follow the path I'm taking 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.900
 so that they can obviously arrive and be 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.399
 pretty simple and once we arrived 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.699
 here the only thing we have to do is 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.440
 wait a bit and well basically this 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.030
 it's like an event of the sabers of 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.559
 we have to wait for them and it's a 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.840
 event that is activated by time 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.430
 then you can spend about six or more 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.769
 minutes while they are activated so 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.149
 take the opportunity to do missions for 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.160
 make contracts meanwhile 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.929
 the sphere and they basically have to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.780
 wait here below in the part of the 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:00.239
 left, a message appears that says 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.969
 that there is a pack of lurking wolves 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.530
 then already once that 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.120
 message, the enemies will arrive 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.040
 in a ship and they arrive 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.510
 several waves of enemies then go 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.070
 to meet with 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.870
 first it hits you with some enemies that 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.940
 bring these cannons that are being used 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.530
 just eliminate fast and try 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.300
 to grab it great as fast 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.130
 possible because only two arrive 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.200
 second age are normal enemies that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.180
 they will not have much trouble the third 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.740
 surge are invisible enemies like that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.020
 have a little care because I do not know 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.490
 they see very well and finally they would be 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.330
 the enemies next to the final boss who already 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.460
 it would be then px that as I told you is a 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.320
 scum that is level 30 if they want 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.210
 see how to kill the other enemies that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.680
 is one here in dogs and two on earth 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.210
 be it chance or they have not killed us anymore 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.470
 well down here in the description of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.510
 this video I'm going to leave the videos 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.070
 where he will show you the location of 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.140
 where can you obviously find these 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.760
 good final bosses something that they 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.770
 I advise you to try to complete 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.080
 these missions with colleagues or with 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.640
 friends because I do not say it's 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.990
 impossible not obviously not impossible 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.880
 do it alone but if it's going to be very 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.100
 difficult so I recommend that you 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.450
 try to do it with your team or if not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.030
 have a team then try 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.590
 get people with whom they can play 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.780
 well basically that's just 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.470
 they have to kill all the enemies and 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.320
 already once they reach the end 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.210
 try to give it with all the power that 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.070
 they have with their super with ammunition 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.290
 heavy because as I told you it's a 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.850
 slag level 28 I was wrong to 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.950
 I said at first that it was at level 30 but 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.140
 it really is a level 28 scum how 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.460
 are watching here in the video 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.630
 basically it has been done it has to have 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.940
 beware of your attacks 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.420
 kill them as quickly as possible and then 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.690
 simply the idea is to eliminate it I do not 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.220
 is that they eliminate him as soon as they kill him 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.500
 a message will also appear 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.390
 down on the part on the left that 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.130
 says they have a key to why 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.510
 they have to look for a chest so 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.250
 I searched for the surroundings are going to 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.350
 find a chest that is common to the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.209
 fallen but they will identify it because 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.340
 has a light a glow around 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.600
 yellow or green color and with this then 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.370
 you know what that chest is 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.890
 basically when we open it have a 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.810
 possibility of winning what would be said in 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.320
 peculiar records also if we have 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.970
 luck in legend dramas and well what 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.670
 that we will always receive what would be 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.680
 synthetic refills of weighing or 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.080
 special ammunition and also flowers 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.870
 spiritual in some occasions we are going to 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.610
 receive a new item 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.220
 we will only be able to achieve that 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.709
 hopefully it's called the key to 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.480
 treasure of the queen this item only 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.120
 we will be able to use it when it leaves 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.830
 the tlc of the house of words before I do not 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.909
 we will be able to use so if the 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.040
 they get to receive simply because 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:38.190
 saving and they will use it as much 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.720
 complete in all the activities of the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.120
 prison of the elderly and mates 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.280
 obviously to all the enemies then 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.409
 Well basically there is the way to power 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.510
 find px and obviously delete it 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.459
 so I hope you liked the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.590
