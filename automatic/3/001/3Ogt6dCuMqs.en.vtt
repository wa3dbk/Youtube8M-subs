got all kinds the detail I think it even
has<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.189> numbers<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.759> tachometers<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:03.659> on

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
has the numbers to tachometers one on

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.020 
has the numbers to tachometers one on
the<00:02:03.899> right<00:02:04.219> digital<00:02:05.219> display<00:02:05.520> doesn't<00:02:05.759> come

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
the right digital display doesn't come

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.699 
the right digital display doesn't come
on<00:02:06.180> obviously<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:07.069> pretty<00:02:08.069> amazing<00:02:08.640> detail

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
on obviously but pretty amazing detail

looks<00:02:18.070> like<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.370> back<00:02:18.580> wheel<00:02:18.880> because<00:02:19.540> they

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
looks like the back wheel because they

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.040 
looks like the back wheel because they
just<00:02:19.990> have<00:02:20.230> them<00:02:20.470> on<00:02:21.780> forget<00:02:22.780> what<00:02:22.900> they<00:02:23.020> call

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
that I always go bad on these but that

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.550 
that I always go bad on these but that
was<00:02:26.110> pretty<00:02:26.350> sloppy<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:28.750> matter<00:02:29.080> just<00:02:29.440> on

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.260 
was pretty sloppy this matter just on
one<00:02:29.650> side<00:02:29.920> seeing<00:02:30.220> take<00:02:30.400> your<00:02:30.580> wheel<00:02:30.790> off<00:02:31.030> you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
one side seeing take your wheel off you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.880 
one side seeing take your wheel off you
know<00:02:31.420> you're<00:02:31.990> doing<00:02:32.200> intense<00:02:32.530> your<00:02:32.680> rights

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
know you're doing intense your rights

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.500 
know you're doing intense your rights
and<00:02:33.100> whatnot<00:02:33.550> it's<00:02:34.420> got<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.630> kickstand

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
and whatnot it's got a kickstand

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.420 
and whatnot it's got a kickstand
but<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.600> kickstand<00:02:38.050> does<00:02:38.440> not<00:02:38.980> seem<00:02:39.400> to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
but the kickstand does not seem to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.090 
but the kickstand does not seem to
deploy<00:02:40.080> it's<00:02:41.080> always<00:02:41.470> in<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.710> up<00:02:41.860> position

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
deploy it's always in the up position

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.820 
deploy it's always in the up position
this<00:02:42.640> one<00:02:42.910> does<00:02:44.730> universal<00:02:45.730> type<00:02:45.910> stand<00:02:46.830> so

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
this one does universal type stand so

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.990 
this one does universal type stand so
there<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.370> go<00:02:48.460> stick<00:02:49.360> out<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.720> dirt<00:02:49.870> bike<00:02:51.000> got

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
there you go stick out the dirt bike got

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.820 
there you go stick out the dirt bike got
this<00:02:52.120> one<00:02:52.360> because<00:02:52.450> I've<00:02:52.780> had<00:02:53.350> enough<00:02:53.710> of

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
this one because I've had enough of

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:11.460 
this one because I've had enough of
these<00:03:08.940> looking<00:03:09.940> at<00:03:10.090> it's<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.510> Sierra<00:03:10.810> 450<00:03:11.350> or
