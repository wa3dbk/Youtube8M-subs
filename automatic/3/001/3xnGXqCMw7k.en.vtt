00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
face up in inverness that tried to

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.140 
face up in inverness that tried to
scramble<00:00:04.920> an<00:00:05.190> egg<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.460> hair<00:00:05.670> days<00:00:05.940> and

scramble an egg and hair days and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.049 
scramble an egg and hair days and
realized<00:00:06.509> that<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.930> following<00:00:07.490> perhaps<00:00:08.490> was

I'm<00:00:15.960> going<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.170> shove<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.529> into<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.430> toe<00:00:17.699> of

I'm going to shove it into the toe of
the<00:00:18.330> kill<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.869> I'm<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> try<00:00:19.680> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
the kill so I'm going to try and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.650

for such iniquity called centripetal
force<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.119> we<00:00:27.119> tried<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.480> before<00:00:27.599> just

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
force and we tried that before just

force and we tried that before just
didn't<00:00:28.199> work<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.619> think<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> problem<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.429> it

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
didn't work I think the problem was it

didn't work I think the problem was it
didn't<00:00:29.789> hurdle<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.660> know<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:30.810> I'm

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
didn't hurdle for what we know so I'm

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.139 
didn't hurdle for what we know so I'm
going<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.230> keep<00:00:31.380> twirling<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:32.640> imagine<00:00:33.090> a

minute<00:00:38.629> I'm<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> try<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.469> hope<00:00:40.980> that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
minute I'm going to try and hope that

for five minutes next stitch of my plan

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.119 
for five minutes next stitch of my plan
is<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.670> take<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.210> would<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:51.899> hot<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.890> egg

is to take that would it be hot the egg

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.459 
is to take that would it be hot the egg

going to leave it for just a few little
minutes<00:00:57.350> welcome<00:00:58.350> back<00:00:58.469> again<00:00:59.840> right<00:01:00.840> it's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
minutes welcome back again right it's

time to figure out if this is actually
worked<00:01:04.549> one<00:01:05.549> egg<00:01:06.140> potentially<00:01:07.140> scrambled<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
worked one egg potentially scrambled I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.310 
worked one egg potentially scrambled I
guess<00:01:08.760> we're<00:01:08.970> only<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> know<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:10.200> we

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
guess we're only going to know when we

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.820 
guess we're only going to know when we
crack<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.590> open<00:01:12.290> hold<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.979> second<00:01:15.830> let's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
crack it open hold on one second let's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.760 
crack it open hold on one second let's
see<00:01:17.509> if<00:01:18.509> indeed<00:01:20.450> this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.509> what<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.110> shell<00:01:22.500> is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
see if indeed this is what the shell is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.109 
see if indeed this is what the shell is
really<00:01:23.369> tightly<00:01:24.240> stuck<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:26.540> one<00:01:27.540> second

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
really tightly stuck on there one second

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.929 
really tightly stuck on there one second
almost<00:01:30.119> done<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.110> peeling<00:01:31.700> I'm<00:01:32.700> not

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
almost done and the peeling I'm not

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.030 
almost done and the peeling I'm not
entirely<00:01:33.240> sure<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.049> has<00:01:34.530> worked<00:01:34.890> but

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
entirely sure if this one has worked but

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.249 
entirely sure if this one has worked but
we're<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> find<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:35.820> when<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.990> cut

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we're all going to find out when we cut

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.200 
we're all going to find out when we cut
the<00:01:37.710> egg<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.759> another<00:01:38.909> hashtag

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the egg is this gonna be another hashtag

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.590 
the egg is this gonna be another hashtag
fail<00:01:40.250> but<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.430> find<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> guess<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.360> so

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
fail but to find out I guess this is so

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.230 
fail but to find out I guess this is so
exciting<00:01:43.520> extra<00:01:44.520> specially<00:01:45.090> good<00:01:45.270> fun<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
exciting extra specially good fun and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.569 
exciting extra specially good fun and
we're<00:01:48.240> almost<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:49.310> who<00:01:50.310> knew<00:01:50.549> that

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
we're almost there who knew that

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.920 
we're almost there who knew that
watching<00:01:51.030> an<00:01:51.119> egg<00:01:51.240> bean<00:01:51.450> field<00:01:51.689> could<00:01:51.869> be

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
watching an egg bean field could be

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.520 
watching an egg bean field could be
sorted<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> net<00:01:52.979> one<00:01:53.250> second

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.020 

if<00:01:59.530> this<00:01:59.740> indeed<00:01:59.950> has<00:02:00.370> been<00:02:00.610> more<00:02:00.850> successful

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
if this indeed has been more successful

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.500 
if this indeed has been more successful
have<00:02:01.690> I<00:02:01.840> or<00:02:02.530> have<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.770> know<00:02:02.980> it<00:02:03.420> scrambled<00:02:04.420> an

have I or have I know it scrambled an
egg<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:07.090> shell<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:11.070> think<00:02:12.070> it's<00:02:12.190> fair<00:02:12.370> to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
egg in and shell I think it's fair to

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.670 
egg in and shell I think it's fair to
say<00:02:12.520> that<00:02:13.650> has<00:02:14.650> actually<00:02:14.800> happened<00:02:16.680> no

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
say that has actually happened no

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.770 
say that has actually happened no
visible<00:02:18.550> yolk<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.680> all<00:02:21.780> beautifully

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
visible yolk this is all beautifully

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.960 
visible yolk this is all beautifully
shower<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.790> ready<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:26.380> enjoy<00:02:26.760> one<00:02:27.760> egg
