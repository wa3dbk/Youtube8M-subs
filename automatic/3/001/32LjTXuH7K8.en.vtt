two of them that way we get the liner
stuck<00:01:47.380> down<00:01:47.590> good<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:47.950> tight<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.600> we<00:01:49.750> can

before we started running water and

before we started running water and
speed<00:01:57.190> all<00:01:57.430> of<00:01:57.550> our<00:01:57.640> seams<00:01:57.970> are<00:01:58.270> lined<00:01:58.300> up<00:01:58.630> in

our corner our cuts are right on the

our corner our cuts are right on the
money<00:02:01.510> that<00:02:01.960> way<00:02:02.530> we<00:02:02.680> know<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.860> liner<00:02:03.190> is

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
money that way we know the liner is

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.500 
money that way we know the liner is
squared<00:02:04.180> in<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.600> full<00:02:04.870> not<00:02:05.229> twisted<00:02:06.510> no

squared in the full not twisted no

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.020 
squared in the full not twisted no
wrinkle<00:02:07.960> that's<00:02:08.679> really<00:02:09.130> well<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:12.820> we're

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
wrinkle that's really well it so we're

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.050 
wrinkle that's really well it so we're
starting<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.140> do<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.500> cut<00:02:14.770> in<00:02:14.950> for<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.310> step

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.390 

just<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.270> typical<00:02:20.170> step<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.830> an<00:02:20.950> in-ground

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
just the typical step on an in-ground

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.590 
just the typical step on an in-ground
pool<00:02:21.990> walk<00:02:22.990> in<00:02:23.260> fiberglass<00:02:23.709> step<00:02:24.570> got<00:02:25.570> a

pool walk in fiberglass step got a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.630 
pool walk in fiberglass step got a
rubber<00:02:25.900> gasket<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.890> underneath<00:02:27.190> that

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
rubber gasket that is underneath that

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.600 
rubber gasket that is underneath that
liner<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:29.110> liner<00:02:29.350> as<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.830> can<00:02:29.980> see<00:02:30.190> runs<00:02:30.430> all

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
liner the liner as you can see runs all

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.650 
liner the liner as you can see runs all
the<00:02:30.640> way<00:02:30.760> across<00:02:31.950> once<00:02:32.950> we<00:02:33.130> put<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.550> strip<00:02:34.480> on

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
the way across once we put this strip on

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.470 
the way across once we put this strip on
here<00:02:35.070> get<00:02:36.070> everything<00:02:36.340> set<00:02:36.910> with<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.150> groove

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
here get everything set with this groove

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.500 
here get everything set with this groove
and<00:02:37.750> tightened<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.550> then<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.730> liner<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.180> cut

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
and tightened in then the liner is cut

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:57.410 
and tightened in then the liner is cut
out<00:02:40.690> on<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.140> inside<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.739> strip

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.929 

well<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.599> other<00:02:58.719> reasons<00:02:59.200> why<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.709> we<00:02:59.939> do

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
well the other reasons why that we do

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.759 
well the other reasons why that we do
the<00:03:01.540> two<00:03:01.780> back<00:03:02.370> use<00:03:03.370> two<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:03.670> them<00:03:04.590> because<00:03:05.590> it

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
the two back use two of them because it

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.190 
the two back use two of them because it
pulls<00:03:06.010> our<00:03:06.189> liner<00:03:06.400> down<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.030> tight<00:03:07.359> that<00:03:07.689> we

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
pulls our liner down so tight that we

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.399 
pulls our liner down so tight that we
can<00:03:08.469> go<00:03:08.680> ahead<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:09.040> cut<00:03:09.250> these<00:03:09.430> step<00:03:09.879> thing

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
can go ahead and cut these step thing

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.199 
can go ahead and cut these step thing
you<00:03:11.409> can<00:03:11.590> see<00:03:11.859> that<00:03:12.069> seam<00:03:12.430> right<00:03:12.459> there<00:03:12.760> on<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
you can see that seam right there on the

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.530 
you can see that seam right there on the
bottom<00:03:13.659> is<00:03:13.980> dead<00:03:14.980> against<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.519> floor<00:03:15.819> there

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
bottom is dead against the floor there

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.009 
bottom is dead against the floor there
is<00:03:16.720> no<00:03:16.930> stretch<00:03:17.349> there<00:03:18.599> you<00:03:19.599> know<00:03:19.720> when<00:03:19.900> the

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
is no stretch there you know when the

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.099 
is no stretch there you know when the
water<00:03:20.230> starts<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.769> fill<00:03:21.069> that<00:03:21.250> it's<00:03:21.609> already

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
water starts to fill that it's already

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.649 
water starts to fill that it's already
completely<00:03:23.109> in<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.500> plate<00:03:24.180> not<00:03:25.180> going<00:03:25.510> to

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
completely in the plate not going to

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.619 
completely in the plate not going to
stretch<00:03:26.049> out<00:03:26.349> and<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:27.730> end<00:03:27.909> up<00:03:28.090> pulling<00:03:28.359> out

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
stretch out and to end up pulling out

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.509 
stretch out and to end up pulling out
after<00:03:29.049> we<00:03:29.170> cut<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.500> other<00:03:29.799> section<00:03:30.310> of<00:03:30.400> this

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
after we cut the other section of this

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.789 
after we cut the other section of this
liner<00:03:30.849> out<00:03:33.689> so<00:03:34.689> that<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:35.019> one<00:03:35.260> advantage<00:03:35.349> to

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
liner out so that is one advantage to

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.550 
liner out so that is one advantage to
using<00:03:36.159> the<00:03:36.459> two<00:03:36.669> back<00:03:36.989> because<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.109> stuck<00:03:38.379> the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
using the two back because it stuck the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.030 
using the two back because it stuck the
liner<00:03:38.739> down<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.340> tight<00:03:40.409> we<00:03:41.409> all<00:03:41.530> have<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.859> wait

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
liner down so tight we all have to wait

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.690 
liner down so tight we all have to wait
for<00:03:42.310> water<00:03:42.549> we<00:03:43.510> do<00:03:43.689> our<00:03:43.840> cutting

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.200 

cut<00:03:49.270> down<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.660> inside<00:03:50.080> of<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.319> strip<00:03:51.210> across

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
cut down the inside of the strip across

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.100 
cut down the inside of the strip across
the<00:03:52.810> bottom

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.960 

that's<00:03:58.110> how<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.380> actually<00:03:58.620> cut<00:03:59.070> out<00:03:59.100> around<00:03:59.400> a

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
that's how you actually cut out around a

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:10.190 
that's how you actually cut out around a
walk<00:04:00.900> in<00:04:01.140> fiberglass<00:04:01.530> step

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.600 

got<00:04:11.200> water<00:04:11.440> going<00:04:11.770> into<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.070> pool<00:04:12.310> now

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
got water going into the pool now

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:24.930 
got water going into the pool now
poppers<00:04:13.600> fill<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.020> up

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.230 

now<00:04:25.540> have<00:04:25.750> our<00:04:25.780> water<00:04:26.550> that's<00:04:27.550> up<00:04:27.820> into<00:04:28.150> our

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240
