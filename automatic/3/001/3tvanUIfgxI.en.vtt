00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.659
 it was the debutants day today yes 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.170
 exactly 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.340
 many injured and there chaos but the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.139
 watch youth and they usually still have 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.580
 not debited so quite large grandma's 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.440
 debutants I think 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.120
 but the youth that the future yes I hope 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.920
 well i go i think if you would 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.300
 look at today and at the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.859
 youth education of utrecht rooms anyway 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.060
 so expect to venture 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.980
 it turned on a bit last week 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.760
 the in the air your debut today was it 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.369
 as far as when 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.750
 fishnet because I already bank last week 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.900
 sit before you play today 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.099
 I was told last week 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.530
 you short he was injured 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.969
 and training had come to me 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 you are the first choice in principle 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.550
 going to play so actually I knew 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.280
 the Wednesday or Tuesday Tuesday postma 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.289
 it was two Wednesday and I saw that 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.840
 in a basic player show but very nice 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.370
 how is then already know what i asked for 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.780
 her of the steps how is he this week 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.100
 in his yes you notice that he what 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.510
 there is tense then 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.739
 then the other logical course how 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.350
 you that we have experienced the run 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.190
 to the game but I think yes I was 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.660
 not even that tense 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.920
 actually me 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.480
 we disappeared together because it is good 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.170
 of course much higher level the course 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.760
 puncture by elianne youth in a1 and it 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.460
 Year levels go higher than you are in 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.659
 basically won a little awkward though 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.860
 boy not tense and i just have 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.570
 try to do my own thing i am 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.009
 not 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.830
 don't risk him too much just one 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.840
 play a little on safe so yes just one 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.090
 little mega in the level no no no 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.409
 I really don't think so many special things 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.970
 were already soccer players 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.409
 she comes after such a fun science rush 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.810
 have not opposed enough in the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.509
 youth but yes such good pointers nuenen 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.790
 what was it like to play for him because one 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.659
 made a move to 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.400
 incredible movement admits you it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.470
 equally difficult for you how was it the rest 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.420
 of the match and start is of course 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.640
 spoiling i never really mean such 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.659
 played striker 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.890
 and i saw you starting it one too 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.720
 little green a few minutes you like that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.920
 it all just goes a little late 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.750
 but but i think i get to the ten 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.460
 tenth minute 15th minute is good 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.200
 picked up as a team 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.250
 I think better 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.540
 and when it is actually good to go right 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.930
 that he once nice action mechanisms 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.189
 I can't do much else for the promotion 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.930
 it can go crazy for the moment 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.729
 moment for the selection under 17 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.780
 wk 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.759
 all those boys there don't have one yet 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.950
 debut in the whole vision you fall 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.120
 then just got out and this you grab your chance 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.860
 yes that's right 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.989
 hedge a blessing in disguise was me 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.819
 that that is nice it is a pity 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.950
 of course that you do n't go to it 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.590
 eating houses blow up moment just tells 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.430
 that is also part of football principle 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.260
 He knows you will come back to you 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.970
 try to do it and luckily I can 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.280
 agree with first vote 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.780
 so may I also quite fun as players 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.310
 You were allowed to join that tropez 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.840
 he came for you in the team a gave you 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.430
 the compliments you 've done well 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.810
 what about you from him 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.280
 i found yo good he play against us 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.230
 own thing juice actually always good 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.909
 so adieu drove good constant factor 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.260
 exactly constant factor 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.879
 1 more thing to say yes of course still 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.140
 not so good what kind of play are you? 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.390
 may we expect from you the coming 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.739
 what you can expect from years 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.329
 no reason then i should try 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.859
 just hard to work hard and green 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.739
 best just keep going i hope 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.659
 that you play the stolen child first and 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.670
 I am and yes defend well 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.620
 play football or try playing football 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.659
 find a solution 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.829
 and yes for solid I can still learn something 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.200
 I think it's my biggest there 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.849
 body steps but do I have to 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.500
 just hard at work and it 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.060
 playing football is a good thing but me 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.409
 ben tamara are you now i hear inside 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.390
 especially young Turks and you are normal 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.489
 new so all the time but so fast 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.169
 possibly such 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.030
 as well as soon as possible better 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.980
 of course 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.840
 it's a day you'll never forget 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.989
 that your debut in the premier league how went 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.480

 yes she is very happy with my debut yes me 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.049
 I think I played well 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.579
 learning moment but I will take you to 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.739
 the next match that code that go 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.660
 but we are very happy with the but 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.280
 so level level league still right 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.410
 against topper vitesse 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.510
 yes so we are very proud with that right away 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.849
 it is a high level 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.799
 yes of course it all goes smoothly 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.599
 faster than you are used to but on 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.790
 quickly join in alone then you have to 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.349
 of course, think ahead faster 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.750
 then that you're used to 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.970
 so a level certainly high but yes me too 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.919
 that more to follow if you are not one 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.030
 little tired because you have the ek under 17 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.949
 played three matches at the back door 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.970
 Thursday evening heading back to it 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.019
 what all 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.209
 yes i hope i can compete a lot 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.859
 plays the ek yes unfortunately lately 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.329
 did not get through a group of heavy 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.459
 she came home around midnight on Sunday evening 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.769
 twelve then Friday by girder with 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.120
 first had to train and you are off 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.709
 the one moment all this is with it 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.840
 maybe a tough but beautiful moment 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.829
 is that a lot of energy, the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.440
 roller coaster 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.810
 yes exactly so you can oh yes 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.640
 yes we didn't know you that well then 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.050
 what can you expect from the de 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.790
 in other words, we have some in the coming years 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.660
 for player we bring i am 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.010
 right back 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.080
 yes but quality is mainly 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.090
 I am very defensive afterwards 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.920
 We are happy to be doing it to lose weight 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.450
 but that is not the most important task 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.100
 defend the city 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.780
 I hope yes that much he still is 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.330
 consequence and fc utrecht one that is the dream 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.710

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.870
 maybe already 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.880
 they the neighborhood do n't worry too much about it 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.890
 and of course we go together 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.840

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.650
 really a lot together or had about it 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.630
 spoken and yes it would be lived 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.160
 actually it is perhaps the best 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.170

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.580

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.610
 as a monument and now for the coming years 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.590
 when are you a full-fledged basic player 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.120

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.540
 and so on in a heap so fast 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.430
 possible to come first but 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.280

 chance of the trainer among the last 5 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.570
 minutes to fall in so that was nice 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.430

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.050
 forward player so we i am more 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.910
 the binding man usually you are from the 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.990
 the connections the line in the team 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.250
 the connection in that 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.960
 little glue yes yes this day so only one 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.530
 times you debut this you never go 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.060
 to forget 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.130
 I will never forget no is one 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.990
 moment for it delivers so I had you 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.420
 this is forever the infirmary 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.340
 of course very full at utrecht and is 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.690
 so the chance for you to debit 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.850
 how do you look at your chances for next 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.940
 year to possibly buy in 10 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.080
 Well then two new trainers are coming 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.430
 I don't know what my chances are 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.380
 exam just need proof in the 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.640
 preparation and from there I call 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.770
 to close 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.810

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.670
 then a very old yes that's right but yes 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.970
 everyone has their own path, I say 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.800
 always 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.560
 and it is not a fan early going 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.210
 where you end I always say so yes that 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.760
 is my motto 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.680
 team players come the furthest yes exactly 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.710
 indeed they sometimes say so buy 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.710
