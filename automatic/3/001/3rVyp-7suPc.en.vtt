00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
lot of control because it's very hard to

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.740 
lot of control because it's very hard to
move<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.410> hips<00:00:25.850> as<00:00:26.850> you<00:00:27.030> take<00:00:27.210> your<00:00:27.330> lunch<00:00:27.510> so

move the hips as you take your lunch so
first<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.080> all<00:00:28.140> let's<00:00:28.770> learn<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.430> take<00:00:29.580> a

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
first of all let's learn to just take a

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.100 
first of all let's learn to just take a
simple<00:00:29.970> lunch<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.420> mean<00:00:30.720> I'm<00:00:30.900> sure<00:00:32.750> but<00:00:33.750> for

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
simple lunch I mean I'm sure but for

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.869 
simple lunch I mean I'm sure but for
this<00:00:34.379> most<00:00:34.650> specifically<00:00:35.250> walk<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:35.850> foot

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
this most specifically walk one foot

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.970 
this most specifically walk one foot
flat<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.020> want<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> do<00:00:37.379> it<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.650> the<00:00:37.770> slide

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
flat and we want to do it on the slide

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.960 
flat and we want to do it on the slide
so<00:00:38.400> one<00:00:39.239> foot<00:00:39.480> flat<00:00:39.900> forward<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.520> back

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
so one foot flat forward and the back

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.479 
so one foot flat forward and the back
foot<00:00:42.300> will<00:00:42.450> be<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> toe<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.280> front

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
foot will be on the toe so the front

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.430 
foot will be on the toe so the front
foot<00:00:44.730> really<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.630> stabilizes

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
foot really is the one that stabilizes

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.620 
foot really is the one that stabilizes
you<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.190> one<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> back<00:00:48.410> is<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.920> be

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
you the one in the back is going to be

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.090 
you the one in the back is going to be
lifted<00:00:51.630> because<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.200> would<00:00:52.350> allow<00:00:52.710> for<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
lifted because that would allow for a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.360 
lifted because that would allow for a
knee<00:00:53.489> motion<00:00:54.110> which<00:00:55.110> will<00:00:55.350> eventually<00:00:56.130> allow

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
knee motion which will eventually allow

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.280 
knee motion which will eventually allow
for<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.640> hip<00:00:56.760> motion<00:00:56.969> okay<00:00:57.540> so<00:00:58.020> make<00:00:58.260> sure

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
for the hip motion okay so make sure

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.110 
for the hip motion okay so make sure
that<00:00:58.649> whatever<00:00:58.829> front<00:00:59.399> foot<00:00:59.610> you<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.969> which

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120

the<00:01:43.770> hip<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.369> drop<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.090> remember<00:01:45.479> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the hip to do that drop so remember you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.940 
the hip to do that drop so remember you
your<00:01:45.900> drop<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> lot<00:01:46.799> smaller

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
your drop is going to be a lot smaller

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.310 
your drop is going to be a lot smaller
than<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.549> you've<00:01:47.700> done<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.570> know<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:49.080> way

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
than if you've done it you know this way

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.429 
than if you've done it you know this way
okay<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.580> your<00:01:51.090> knee<00:01:51.329> can't<00:01:51.720> move<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.140> much

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
okay so your knee can't move that much

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.469 
okay so your knee can't move that much
you<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.220> when<00:01:53.460> your<00:01:53.610> knee<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.820> closer<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
you know when your knee is closer to the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.760 
you know when your knee is closer to the
other<00:01:54.689> when<00:01:54.810> your<00:01:54.960> foot<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.140> closer<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
other when your foot is closer to the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.530 
other when your foot is closer to the
other<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.729> big<00:01:57.000> range<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.479> motion

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
other one you have a big range of motion

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.649 
other one you have a big range of motion
in<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.680> knee<00:01:58.829> when<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.310> back<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.240> range<00:02:00.479> of

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
in the knee when it's back the range of

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.170 
in the knee when it's back the range of
motion<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.110> though<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.680> bit<00:02:02.070> smaller<00:02:02.340> okay<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
motion is though a bit smaller okay so

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.370 
motion is though a bit smaller okay so
they<00:02:03.299> want<00:02:03.420> try<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> work<00:02:03.869> with<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.200> your

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
they want try to work with it so your

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.319 
they want try to work with it so your
hip<00:02:04.470> just<00:02:04.680> won't<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.100> eventually<00:02:05.790> smaller

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
hip just won't be eventually smaller

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.539 
hip just won't be eventually smaller
okay<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.259> from<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:07.799> what<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.070> want<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.369> is

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
okay so from here what we want to do is

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.100 
okay so from here what we want to do is
just<00:02:08.759> kind<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:08.970> practice<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.720> standing<00:02:10.049> here

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
just kind of practice just standing here

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
just kind of practice just standing here
first<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:11.130> do<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.430> drops<00:02:12.739> you<00:02:13.739> don't<00:02:13.920> even

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
first to do the drops you don't even

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.610 
first to do the drops you don't even
have<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.489> go<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.180> down<00:02:15.329> just<00:02:16.049> get<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> feel

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
have to go up and down just get a feel

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.159 
have to go up and down just get a feel
for<00:02:16.650> how<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.070> can<00:02:17.280> do<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.549> controlled<00:02:18.329> drop

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:19.169 
for how you can do that controlled drop

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:21.600 
for how you can do that controlled drop
without

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
without

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.290 
without
a<00:02:21.670> big<00:02:22.210> range<00:02:22.630> of<00:02:22.930> motion<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.550> practice<00:02:25.270> that

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
a big range of motion so practice that

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.640 
a big range of motion so practice that
first<00:02:25.660> what<00:02:25.840> do<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:25.990> feel<00:02:26.110> awesome<00:02:26.260> what<00:02:26.530> with

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
first what do you feel awesome what with

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.470 
first what do you feel awesome what with
it<00:02:26.800> it's<00:02:27.250> really<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.580> matter<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.180> combine

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
it it's really a matter just combine

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.150 
it it's really a matter just combine
your<00:02:28.630> two<00:02:28.660> moves<00:02:29.020> together<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.590> lunge<00:02:29.800> going

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
your two moves together the lunge going

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.590 
your two moves together the lunge going
down<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.550> up<00:02:30.700> as<00:02:30.940> your<00:02:32.400> hip<00:02:33.400> drop<00:02:33.670> continues

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
down and up as your hip drop continues

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.440 
down and up as your hip drop continues
and<00:02:35.020> as<00:02:35.620> your<00:02:35.830> knee<00:02:36.010> bends<00:02:36.280> you'd<00:02:37.150> still

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
and as your knee bends you'd still

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.140 
and as your knee bends you'd still
allows<00:02:37.780> for<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.500> hip<00:02:38.830> drop<00:02:38.980> motion<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.790> happen

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
allows for the hip drop motion to happen

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.700 
allows for the hip drop motion to happen
so<00:02:40.270> that's<00:02:40.420> not<00:02:40.600> gonna<00:02:40.720> be<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.930> problem<00:02:41.200> at<00:02:41.500> all

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
so that's not gonna be a problem at all

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.160 
so that's not gonna be a problem at all
okay<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.490> just<00:02:42.520> relax<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.300> then<00:02:43.660> see<00:02:43.990> if<00:02:44.050> you

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
okay so just relax and then see if you

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.050 
okay so just relax and then see if you
can<00:02:44.380> combine<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:46.450> two<00:02:46.720> together<00:02:47.760> going<00:02:48.760> down

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
can combine the two together going down

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.350 
can combine the two together going down
the<00:02:49.630> key<00:02:49.870> here<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:51.280> keep<00:02:51.880> your<00:02:52.060> upper<00:02:52.240> body

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
and we want to market the beat that's a

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.520 
and we want to market the beat that's a
drop<00:03:16.120> that's<00:03:16.450> important<00:03:16.989> so<00:03:17.140> which<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.410> gonna

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
drop that's important so which is gonna

drop that's important so which is gonna
go<00:03:17.739> one<00:03:18.160> two<00:03:18.810> three<00:03:19.810> four<00:03:20.560> up<00:03:20.860> one<00:03:21.459> two<00:03:22.360> three

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
go one two three four up one two three

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.520 
go one two three four up one two three
four<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.190> want<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.760> control<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.390> count<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:26.410> he

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
four you want to control the count so he

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.170 
four you want to control the count so he
takes<00:03:26.709> just<00:03:26.950> about<00:03:27.130> as<00:03:27.280> much<00:03:27.489> time<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.850> go<00:03:28.000> down

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
takes just about as much time to go down

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.810 
takes just about as much time to go down
as<00:03:28.360> it<00:03:28.480> takes<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.720> go<00:03:28.900> up<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:30.100> tendency<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.700> to

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
as it takes to go up the tendency is to

as<00:04:14.110> far<00:04:14.290> as<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.500> arms<00:04:14.799> because<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.549> tend<00:04:15.730> to

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
as far as the arms because you tend to

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.099 
as far as the arms because you tend to
lose<00:04:15.940> balance<00:04:16.330> a<00:04:16.419> little<00:04:16.510> bit<00:04:16.720> in<00:04:16.780> this<00:04:16.870> move

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
lose balance a little bit in this move

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.830 
lose balance a little bit in this move
the<00:04:17.950> easiest<00:04:18.370> way<00:04:18.669> really<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:19.450> keep<00:04:19.630> your

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
the easiest way really to keep your

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.880 
the easiest way really to keep your
balance<00:04:19.959> is<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.290> keep<00:04:20.440> your<00:04:20.530> arms<00:04:20.799> over

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
balance is to keep your arms over

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.770 
balance is to keep your arms over
because<00:04:21.280> they<00:04:21.400> tend<00:04:21.640> to<00:04:21.729> balance<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.750> a

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
because they tend to balance you a

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.300 
because they tend to balance you a
little<00:04:23.050> bit<00:04:23.140> but<00:04:23.290> you<00:04:23.410> can't<00:04:23.740> play<00:04:24.100> with<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
little bit but you can't play with the

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.360 
little bit but you can't play with the
arms<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.910> do<00:04:25.900> different<00:04:26.740> things<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:27.220> can

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
arms and do different things so you can

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.280 
arms and do different things so you can
hold<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.700> one<00:04:27.880> in<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.060> back<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.600> then<00:04:29.140> just

hold the one in the back and then just

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.779 
hold the one in the back and then just
extend<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.830> one<00:04:29.979> in<00:04:30.099> the<00:04:30.190> front<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.460> go<00:04:30.580> one

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
extend the one in the front and go one

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.879 
extend the one in the front and go one
two<00:04:30.820> three<00:04:31.680> four<00:04:32.680> one

two three four one

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.670 
two three four one
two<00:04:33.979> three<00:04:34.669> four<00:04:34.909> you<00:04:35.719> can<00:04:35.840> also<00:04:36.020> hold<00:04:36.319> it<00:04:36.530> down

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
two three four you can also hold it down

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.170 
two three four you can also hold it down
for<00:04:36.740> a<00:04:37.009> little<00:04:37.099> bit<00:04:37.249> longer<00:04:37.520> so<00:04:37.699> you<00:04:37.939> can<00:04:38.060> go

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
for a little bit longer so you can go

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.939 
for a little bit longer so you can go
one<00:04:38.389> two<00:04:39.050> three<00:04:39.340> four<00:04:40.340> hold<00:04:40.939> six<00:04:41.689> seven<00:04:42.499> eight

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
one two three four hold six seven eight

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.080 
one two three four hold six seven eight
to<00:04:43.370> something<00:04:43.759> else

to something else
