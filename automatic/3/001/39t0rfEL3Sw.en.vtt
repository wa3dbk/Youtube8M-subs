00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.330
 in group sipse we improve the roller 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.330
 vibrating pr8 to optimize and 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.150
 facilitate its operation in the new pr 8 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.380
 we redesigned the upper cover 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.420
 installing a strap to hold it 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.310
 in its open position protecting the 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.789
 hinges the same cover 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.010
 lower 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.960
 Now it is manufactured in one piece that 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.150
 increases its rigidity at the sides and in 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.280
 the lower part reinforced the supports 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.500
 of clamping to prevent wear 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.270
 the rope also installed a hook 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.039
 metallic adjustable closure and it 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.230
 modified rubber cushion 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.480
 cover we incorporate a manual holder 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.790
 type bottle located in the lower part 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.500
 of the booth to avoid losing the 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.880
 user manual inside it 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.680
 container is in the 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.600
 hook type tool for the easy 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.329
 installation of system springs 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.340
 The pre8 now has a clutch 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.559
 tachometer gold meter with this device 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.180
 the operator can verify the 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.860
 calibration of the revolutions of 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.020
 engine and working hours for 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.640
 plan preventive maintenance for 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.560
 facilitate transport by truck 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.869
 We turn over the height of the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.909
 conveyor stringers the pre8 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.350
 has an innovative system of 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.020
 water spray 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.090
 that with capacity of 24 liters is now 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.159
 made of polyethylene that prevents 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.860
 contamination of the system by not having 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.930
 oxidation also has a plug 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.549
 large strategically located to 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.950
 facilitate filling with bucket 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.659
 we installed an easy-access filter that 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.520
 prevents the passage of particles towards the 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.320
 valve and sprayer the valve is 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.960
 controlled remotely from the handlebar 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.700
 providing greater comfort to the operator and 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.250
 facilitating the control of water flow 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.200
 the valve will be automatically done at no 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.360
 trigger the to facilitate the change of 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.460
 oil and avoid fouling the equipment 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.429
 has a drain hose by 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.319
 security the pre8 has a button 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.270
 emergency stop which turns off the 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.220
 equipment in contact with the operator in 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.190
 case of finding an obstacle when operating 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.750
 in reverse the pre8 has a new 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.550
 clutch system that works to 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.830
 through rods with ball joint for 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.539
 prolong its useful life the new design 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.399
 of bearing for the drive shaft 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.470
 reduces stress on bearings 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.929
 caused by clutch operation 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.370
 we change the coupling motor arrow 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.950
 of transmission by one of greater 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.620
 twisting capacity to increase your 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.390
 lifespan the eccentric shaft counts 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.459
 with a free greased system 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.769
 continued extending the periods of 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.049
 maintenance the mechanical shock absorber 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.659
 of advance and reverse control protects 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.670
 the hydrostatic transmission this system 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.590
 separates the sudden movements of 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.569
 operator on the handlebar of the lever 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.280
 that directly moves the transmission 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.560
 as additional protection of the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.620
 hydrostatic transmission we install a 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.700
 mechanism that controls the neutral point 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.040
 guaranteeing total unemployment between 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.260
 advance and reverse movements for a 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.870
 more stable and comfortable operation the new 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.450
 pr8 now has a double roller 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.430
 Support and a transversal reinforcement protects 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.530
 the lateral supports and the axis of the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.569
 rolls against impacts the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.120
 Roller scrapers are now 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.950
 self-adjusting driven by a system 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.170
 of springs that allows the drive 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.180
 backwards to facilitate the change of 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.549
 scraper and roller cleaning 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.650
 also has rubber shock absorbers 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.510
 that minimize the noise caused by the 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.000
 vibration engine versions 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.730
 available in power of 8 horses 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.549
 13 horsepower power force 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.069
 kÃ¶hler of 8 horsepower with da 8 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.520
 horsepower with gives 11 horses of 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.490
 force 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.040
 electrical more are 13 horsepower 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.770
 nine horsepower robing is 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.930
 as well as group sipse meets once again 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.640
 with the commitment to always improve 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.180
 to provide equipment of the highest 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.180
