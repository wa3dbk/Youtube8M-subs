00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
it a lot and it is Miami's ink and it's

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.980 
it a lot and it is Miami's ink and it's
kind<00:05:03.650> of<00:05:03.800> a<00:05:04.010> gray<00:05:04.610> color<00:05:05.000> now<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:05.360> looks<00:05:05.480> silver

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
kind of a gray color now it looks silver

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.440 
kind of a gray color now it looks silver
but<00:05:06.200> this<00:05:06.320> does<00:05:06.590> turn<00:05:07.280> up<00:05:07.520> kind<00:05:07.910> of<00:05:08.000> darkish

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.960 
but this does turn up kind of darkish
gray<00:05:08.500> so<00:05:09.500> don't<00:05:09.680> be<00:05:09.740> fooled<00:05:09.950> by<00:05:10.040> that<00:05:10.160> but<00:05:10.700> it's
