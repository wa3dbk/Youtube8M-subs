on the top left as well and on the top

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.470 
on the top left as well and on the top
if<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.500> click<00:01:01.680> file<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.340> then<00:01:02.789> expand<00:01:03.449> the

if you click file and then expand the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.719 
if you click file and then expand the
file<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.470> actually<00:01:04.619> go<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.369> click<00:01:05.549> this

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
file you can actually go and click this

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.429 
file you can actually go and click this
file<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.119> want<00:01:06.270> open<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.659> open<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
file you want open and open for you and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.280 
file you want open and open for you and
then<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.520> think<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.330> gets<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.780> default

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
then I think I think it gets to default

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.050 
then I think I think it gets to default
by<00:01:10.380> itself<00:01:10.680> after<00:01:10.890> you've<00:01:11.130> done<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.939> I'm

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
by itself after you've done that but I'm

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.310 
by itself after you've done that but I'm
not<00:01:12.090> sure<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.510> might<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.869> keep<00:01:12.990> doing

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
not sure you might have to keep doing

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320 
not sure you might have to keep doing
that<00:01:13.439> there's<00:01:13.920> there's<00:01:14.549> also<00:01:14.760> another<00:01:15.119> way

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that there's there's also another way

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880 
that there's there's also another way
you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.600> open<00:01:15.960> these<00:01:16.049> kind<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.320> files<00:01:16.530> and
