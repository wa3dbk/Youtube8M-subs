um so anyway this is final wars and
Garris<00:02:04.030> see<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:04.780> it's<00:02:05.020> different

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
Garris see that it's different

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.660 
Garris see that it's different
and<00:02:06.770> his<00:02:07.370> articulation<00:02:08.950> his<00:02:09.950> head<00:02:10.009> can<00:02:10.190> turn

and his articulation his head can turn

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.110 
and his articulation his head can turn
like<00:02:10.850> that<00:02:11.830> he's<00:02:12.830> like<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.220> rubbery<00:02:13.520> kind<00:02:14.000> of

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
like that he's like that rubbery kind of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.960 
like that he's like that rubbery kind of
deal<00:02:14.270> so<00:02:14.540> his<00:02:14.690> mouth<00:02:14.900> can<00:02:15.260> move<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.310> sort<00:02:16.850> of

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
deal so his mouth can move and sort of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.560 
deal so his mouth can move and sort of
tilt<00:02:17.180> up<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.600> down<00:02:19.420> his<00:02:20.420> arms<00:02:20.600> can<00:02:21.440> rotate

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
tilt up and down his arms can rotate

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.050 
tilt up and down his arms can rotate
like<00:02:23.570> not<00:02:24.260> all<00:02:24.290> 360<00:02:25.280> degrees<00:02:25.310> because<00:02:25.850> the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
like not all 360 degrees because the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.699 
like not all 360 degrees because the
shell<00:02:26.990> is<00:02:27.020> there<00:02:28.240> like<00:02:29.240> 180<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.870> for<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.380> back

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
shell is there like 180 so for the back

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.000 
shell is there like 180 so for the back
legs<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:35.330> back<00:02:35.450> legs<00:02:35.750> can<00:02:35.959> rotate<00:02:36.140> 360

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
legs the back legs can rotate 360

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.890 
legs the back legs can rotate 360
degrees<00:02:39.100> like<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:41.420> while<00:02:41.630> we're<00:02:41.750> on<00:02:41.780> the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
degrees like that and while we're on the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.890

discolored I don't know how that comes

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.220 
discolored I don't know how that comes
across<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.239> video<00:03:02.420> but<00:03:02.780> he<00:03:02.900> does<00:03:03.080> look

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
across in the video but he does look

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.290 
across in the video but he does look
discolored<00:03:03.800> from<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.070> movie<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.180> is

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
discolored from the movie like this is

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.449 
discolored from the movie like this is
more<00:03:05.480> yellow<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:05.870> that's<00:03:06.170> darker<00:03:06.770> color<00:03:07.010> but

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
more yellow and that's darker color but

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.910 
more yellow and that's darker color but
I<00:03:07.730> don't<00:03:08.360> know<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.810> he<00:03:08.989> is<00:03:09.020> like<00:03:09.380> as<00:03:09.709> I<00:03:09.890> said

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
I don't know and he is like as I said

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.740 
I don't know and he is like as I said
he's<00:03:10.190> rubber<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:11.269> could<00:03:11.420> squeeze<00:03:11.600> him

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
he's rubber you could squeeze him

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.750 
he's rubber you could squeeze him
together

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
together

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.250 
together
it's<00:03:13.760> pretty<00:03:14.090> weird<00:03:14.299> though<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:17.260> saying

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
it's pretty weird though and saying

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.930 
it's pretty weird though and saying
Garris<00:03:20.950> next<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.190> classic<00:03:23.150> King<00:03:23.870> Ghidorah<00:03:24.940> I

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
Garris next is classic King Ghidorah I

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.930 
Garris next is classic King Ghidorah I
think<00:03:26.630> this<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:26.959> like<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.650> mix<00:03:27.980> between<00:03:28.040> classic

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
think this is like a mix between classic

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.910 
think this is like a mix between classic
in<00:03:29.180> 2001<00:03:30.019> Ghidorah<00:03:34.360> it's<00:03:35.360> pretty<00:03:35.570> good<00:03:35.920> the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
in 2001 Ghidorah it's pretty good the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.090 
in 2001 Ghidorah it's pretty good the
heads<00:03:37.480> don't<00:03:38.480> move<00:03:38.720> but<00:03:39.290> they<00:03:39.620> are<00:03:39.769> pretty

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
heads don't move but they are pretty

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.430 
heads don't move but they are pretty
detailed<00:03:43.330> they<00:03:44.330> can<00:03:44.510> bend<00:03:44.810> like<00:03:44.989> that<00:03:45.019> cuz

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
detailed they can bend like that cuz

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.620 
detailed they can bend like that cuz
he's<00:03:45.680> sort<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.190> rubbery<00:03:46.549> stuff<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:49.760> tail

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
he's sort of that rubbery stuff the tail

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:58.330 
he's sort of that rubbery stuff the tail
will<00:03:51.530> rotate<00:03:52.840> down<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:54.140> foot<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:57.340> down

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
will rotate down to the foot and down

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.370 
will rotate down to the foot and down
that<00:03:58.850> way<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.890> ends<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.549> tails<00:04:02.110> can<00:04:03.110> move

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
that way the ends of the tails can move

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.530 
that way the ends of the tails can move
their<00:04:04.190> own<00:04:04.280> ball<00:04:04.519> joints<00:04:04.910> this<00:04:05.030> one's<00:04:05.269> sort<00:04:05.420> of

will rotate 360 degrees he's not that

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.360 
will rotate 360 degrees he's not that
rubbery<00:05:20.509> so<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.199> won't<00:05:21.409> end<00:05:21.889> up<00:05:22.039> and<00:05:22.189> down<00:05:22.339> a

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
rubbery so it won't end up and down a

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.159

and that far and the legs go like 360
degrees<00:05:35.810> almost<00:05:36.500> 360<00:05:37.219> degrees<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:39.110> legs<00:05:39.529> are

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
degrees almost 360 degrees the legs are

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.909 
degrees almost 360 degrees the legs are
really<00:05:40.509> rubbery<00:05:41.509> seeing<00:05:41.870> him<00:05:41.960> bend<00:05:42.199> them<00:05:42.379> and

McCulley's<00:05:50.710> um<00:05:51.710> I<00:05:52.039> like<00:05:52.250> final<00:05:52.550> Wars<00:05:52.699> guy<00:05:52.849> in

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120

McCulley's um I like final Wars guy in
but<00:05:54.050> I<00:05:54.319> think<00:05:54.379> the<00:05:54.680> shallow<00:05:54.949> one<00:05:55.399> is<00:05:55.849> better

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:56.089 
but I think the shallow one is better

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.719 
but I think the shallow one is better
colored<00:05:56.509> with<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:56.990> green<00:05:57.229> and<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:58.189> yellow<00:05:58.219> I

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
colored with the green and the yellow I

00:05:58.729 --> 00:05:59.709 
colored with the green and the yellow I
like<00:05:59.210> this<00:05:59.330> color

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
like this color

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.839 
like this color
I<00:05:59.899> like<00:06:00.139> this<00:06:00.259> design<00:06:00.439> but<00:06:00.949> I<00:06:01.189> like<00:06:01.639> shallow

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
I like this design but I like shallow

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.649 
I like this design but I like shallow
better<00:06:02.180> so<00:06:03.110> a<00:06:03.139> lot<00:06:03.349> of<00:06:03.379> you<00:06:03.560> probably<00:06:03.830> do<00:06:04.659> and

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
better so a lot of you probably do and

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.619 
better so a lot of you probably do and
now<00:06:06.620> last<00:06:06.979> but<00:06:07.159> not<00:06:07.399> least<00:06:07.699> possibly<00:06:08.270> the<00:06:08.419> best

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
now last but not least possibly the best

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:12.279 
now last but not least possibly the best
we<00:06:09.229> have<00:06:09.409> the<00:06:10.099> g-man<00:06:10.520> himself<00:06:11.180> Godzilla<00:06:11.930> and

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
we have the g-man himself Godzilla and

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.429 
we have the g-man himself Godzilla and
this<00:06:13.039> is<00:06:13.189> the<00:06:13.339> final<00:06:13.580> wars<00:06:13.879> design<00:06:14.330> same<00:06:15.289> as

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:15.439 
this is the final wars design same as

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:19.929 
this is the final wars design same as
Gigan<00:06:15.770> and<00:06:16.180> this<00:06:17.180> is<00:06:17.449> the<00:06:17.810> Japanese<00:06:18.139> import<00:06:18.939> so

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:19.939 
Gigan and this is the Japanese import so

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:22.719 
Gigan and this is the Japanese import so
I<00:06:20.389> know<00:06:20.599> a<00:06:21.050> lot<00:06:21.349> of<00:06:21.379> you<00:06:21.500> guys<00:06:21.710> on<00:06:22.129> YouTube<00:06:22.250> have

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
I know a lot of you guys on YouTube have

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.570 
I know a lot of you guys on YouTube have
the<00:06:23.149> American<00:06:23.870> version<00:06:24.310> some<00:06:25.310> of<00:06:25.399> you<00:06:25.459> guys

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
the American version some of you guys

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.749 
the American version some of you guys
might<00:06:25.789> have<00:06:25.819> the<00:06:26.029> Japanese<00:06:26.419> I<00:06:26.569> don't<00:06:26.719> know<00:06:26.779> but

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
might have the Japanese I don't know but

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.850 
might have the Japanese I don't know but
this<00:06:28.759> guy's<00:06:29.000> the<00:06:29.539> rubbery<00:06:29.810> stuff

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
this guy's the rubbery stuff

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.600 
this guy's the rubbery stuff
so<00:06:31.820> his<00:06:32.090> mouth<00:06:32.830> moves<00:06:33.830> like<00:06:33.920> that<00:06:33.980> but<00:06:34.400> it<00:06:34.490> will

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
so his mouth moves like that but it will

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.080 
so his mouth moves like that but it will
not<00:06:34.760> stick<00:06:35.500> his<00:06:36.500> head<00:06:36.710> can<00:06:36.980> rotate<00:06:37.090> 360

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
not stick his head can rotate 360

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.230 
not stick his head can rotate 360
degrees<00:06:41.560> this<00:06:42.560> is<00:06:42.770> called<00:06:43.010> final<00:06:43.310> goji<00:06:43.880> or

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
degrees this is called final goji or

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.150 
degrees this is called final goji or
final<00:06:44.660> Godzilla<00:06:45.020> and<00:06:45.860> his<00:06:46.370> legs<00:06:46.610> can<00:06:46.850> move

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
final Godzilla and his legs can move

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:56.590 
final Godzilla and his legs can move
that<00:06:53.170> signs<00:06:54.170> and<00:06:55.130> his<00:06:55.550> tail<00:06:55.760> doesn't<00:06:56.120> have<00:06:56.270> any

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
that signs and his tail doesn't have any

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.290 
that signs and his tail doesn't have any
real<00:06:56.960> pose<00:06:57.170> ability<00:06:57.620> but<00:06:57.830> you<00:06:57.950> can<00:06:58.250> move<00:06:59.120> it

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
real pose ability but you can move it

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.560 
real pose ability but you can move it
since<00:06:59.540> he's<00:06:59.720> that<00:06:59.870> vinyl<00:07:00.170> kind<00:07:00.590> of<00:07:00.680> stuff

since he's that vinyl kind of stuff
that's<00:07:02.570> what<00:07:02.780> I<00:07:02.810> was<00:07:02.990> looking<00:07:03.080> for<00:07:03.350> the

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
that's what I was looking for the

rubbery stuff it's vinyl and the arms

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.740 
rubbery stuff it's vinyl and the arms
can<00:07:06.950> move<00:07:08.290> that<00:07:09.290> far<00:07:09.620> back<00:07:09.980> I<00:07:10.490> don't<00:07:11.360> know<00:07:11.510> why

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750 
can move that far back I don't know why

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.380 
can move that far back I don't know why
he<00:07:11.810> would<00:07:12.020> want<00:07:12.230> him<00:07:12.320> to<00:07:12.380> go<00:07:12.500> that<00:07:12.710> far<00:07:12.920> back
