the rubidium here it is is that it well
it<00:01:17.670> might<00:01:17.790> not<00:01:17.820> look<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.479> much<00:01:18.660> Richard<00:01:19.110> but

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it might not look like much Richard but

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140 
it might not look like much Richard but
it's<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.440> highly<00:01:19.830> reactive<00:01:19.979> metal<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.820> sealed

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
right so what's going to happen when you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.410 
right so what's going to happen when you
drop<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.400> water<00:01:26.430> well<00:01:27.000> imagine<00:01:27.210> if

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
drop that in the water well imagine if

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.060 
drop that in the water well imagine if
you<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.720> letting<00:01:28.050> off<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> hand<00:01:28.530> grenade<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.979> a

you will letting off a hand grenade in a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.910 
you will letting off a hand grenade in a
bathtub<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:30.030> oh<00:01:30.090> I'm<00:01:30.420> off<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.289> okay

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
bathtub right oh I'm off and that okay

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.430 
bathtub right oh I'm off and that okay
good<00:01:32.220> luck

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.070 

okay<00:01:37.440> tickle<00:01:37.880> drop<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> rubidium<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
okay tickle drop the rubidium in the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.330 
okay tickle drop the rubidium in the
water<00:01:41.149> this<00:01:42.149> one's<00:01:42.780> gonna<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.050> bad<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:44.009> grams

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340

yes<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.160> more<00:02:10.399> like<00:02:10.640> only<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.270> Brainiac

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
yes that is more like only on Brainiac

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.440 
yes that is more like only on Brainiac
do<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.050> get<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.320> kind<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:13.000> science<00:02:14.000> but<00:02:14.390> I

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
do you get that kind of science but I

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.000 
do you get that kind of science but I
believe<00:02:14.750> we<00:02:14.990> can<00:02:15.020> go<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.500> better<00:02:15.710> there<00:02:15.920> is

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
believe we can go one better there is

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.710 
believe we can go one better there is
one<00:02:16.220> more<00:02:16.430> alkaline<00:02:16.820> metal<00:02:17.210> we<00:02:17.300> can<00:02:17.480> legally

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
one more alkaline metal we can legally

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.170 
one more alkaline metal we can legally
use<00:02:18.020> yes<00:02:18.710> we<00:02:18.830> should<00:02:18.980> cesium<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.670> emperor<00:02:20.150> of

use yes we should cesium the emperor of
alkali<00:02:20.660> metals<00:02:21.020> particularly<00:02:21.470> nasty<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:22.100> go

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
alkali metals particularly nasty to go

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.030

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
up at any time that's it oh yes

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.980 
up at any time that's it oh yes
I<00:02:25.430> like<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.910> already<00:02:26.030> now<00:02:26.390> what's<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.720> going

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
I like it already now what's that going

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.780 
I like it already now what's that going
to<00:02:27.110> do<00:02:27.260> when<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.010> hits<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.280> water

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
to do when it hits the water
