 for me luckily she is 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.680
 beefy because there they would occupy 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.320
 a beautiful spanking by her partners 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.200
 so there were two of the players 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.160

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.340
 to close the debates 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.340
 it's the Welsh back 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.580
