the regular playlist which we started in

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.129 
the regular playlist which we started in
originally<00:05:45.710> so<00:05:46.310> there's<00:05:47.240> not<00:05:47.389> many<00:05:47.600> features

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
originally so there's not many features

of the GM lock pick

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:51.909 
of the GM lock pick
like<00:05:51.020> I<00:05:51.080> said<00:05:51.139> it<00:05:51.350> does<00:05:51.440> allow<00:05:51.620> you<00:05:51.680> to<00:05:51.800> do

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
like I said it does allow you to do

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.140 
like I said it does allow you to do
playlists<00:05:52.460> you<00:05:52.550> can<00:05:52.699> scroll<00:05:52.910> through<00:05:53.090> your

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
playlists you can scroll through your

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.300 
playlists you can scroll through your
songs<00:05:53.419> that<00:05:53.630> displays<00:05:53.990> name<00:05:54.620> the<00:05:54.919> song<00:05:55.100> and

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
songs that displays name the song and

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.580 
songs that displays name the song and
artist<00:05:56.979> but<00:05:58.300> overall<00:05:59.300> it's<00:05:59.960> it's<00:06:00.290> not<00:06:00.530> the

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
artist but overall it's it's not the

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.980 
artist but overall it's it's not the
most<00:06:00.979> user-friendly<00:06:01.449> if<00:06:02.449> you<00:06:02.570> want<00:06:02.720> to<00:06:02.780> find<00:06:02.930> a

most user-friendly if you want to find a

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.990 
most user-friendly if you want to find a
particular<00:06:03.110> song<00:06:03.680> I<00:06:03.919> find<00:06:04.190> it<00:06:04.310> easiest<00:06:04.639> to

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
particular song I find it easiest to

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.390 
particular song I find it easiest to
plug<00:06:05.720> in<00:06:05.930> the<00:06:06.050> stereo<00:06:08.470> but<00:06:09.470> it<00:06:09.740> does<00:06:10.160> add<00:06:10.340> a

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
plug in the stereo but it does add a

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.850 
plug in the stereo but it does add a
nice<00:06:10.610> little<00:06:10.639> feature<00:06:11.090> to<00:06:11.210> the<00:06:11.449> GXP<00:06:11.960> and<00:06:12.260> the
