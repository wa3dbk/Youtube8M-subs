they<00:02:46.440> end<00:02:46.620> up<00:02:46.770> going<00:02:47.010> because<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:48.170> pretty

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
they end up going because it's pretty

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.170 
they end up going because it's pretty

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
unsustainable at its current rates and

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.510 
unsustainable at its current rates and
even<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> floor<00:02:52.140> price<00:02:52.320> like<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:52.980> can't<00:02:53.340> see

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
even the floor price like I can't see

even the floor price like I can't see
the<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.790> all<00:02:53.910> 50<00:02:54.120> floor<00:02:54.540> price<00:02:54.720> staying<00:02:55.080> there

the to all 50 floor price staying there

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.020 
the to all 50 floor price staying there
because<00:02:55.400> eventually<00:02:56.400> people<00:02:56.670> are<00:02:56.820> going<00:02:56.940> to

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
because eventually people are going to

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.280 
because eventually people are going to
stop<00:02:57.210> buying<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.660> Blizzard<00:02:57.960> will<00:02:58.080> want

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
stop buying and Blizzard will want

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.350 
stop buying and Blizzard will want
people<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.620> keep<00:02:58.740> buying<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.370> it's<00:03:00.060> very

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
people to keep buying so it's very

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.330 
people to keep buying so it's very
likely<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.900> I'll<00:03:01.170> lower<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.800> floor<00:03:02.130> price

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
likely that I'll lower the floor price

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.300 
likely that I'll lower the floor price
for<00:03:02.880> sales<00:03:03.500> just<00:03:04.500> increasing<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> quantity

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
for sales just increasing the quantity

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.040 
for sales just increasing the quantity
that<00:03:05.580> people<00:03:05.850> have<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.000> sell<00:03:06.300> in<00:03:06.480> may<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:06.840> like

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
that people have to sell in may be like

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.930 
that people have to sell in may be like
10<00:03:07.320> million<00:03:07.530> factorials<00:03:08.280> 50<00:03:08.610> or<00:03:08.670> something

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
10 million factorials 50 or something

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.660 
10 million factorials 50 or something
like<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.090> would<00:03:09.330> be<00:03:09.390> much<00:03:09.600> more<00:03:09.660> realistic

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
like that would be much more realistic

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.950 
like that would be much more realistic
so<00:03:11.670> there's<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.850> pretty<00:03:12.000> big<00:03:12.150> time<00:03:12.480> for<00:03:12.660> diablo

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
so there's a pretty big time for diablo

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.720 
so there's a pretty big time for diablo
3<00:03:13.200> i've<00:03:13.590> been<00:03:13.770> waiting<00:03:14.040> for<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.310> happen<00:03:14.430> and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.190 
3 i've been waiting for it to happen and
it's<00:03:15.150> interesting<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.690> see<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.870> way<00:03:16.140> things

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
it's interesting to see the way things

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.990 
it's interesting to see the way things
