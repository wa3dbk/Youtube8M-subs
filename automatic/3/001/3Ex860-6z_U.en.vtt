 if now bielefeld win 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.230

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.310

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.910
 third league, however, come bielefeld 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.439

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.949

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.000
 table top encountered 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.980
 and today is that the opponent of 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.830
 Bielefeld and thus at the same time 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.870
 the executor in the rows of red 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.719
 knows erfurt this is the man 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.640
 every time every week whenever there 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.739
 a job has to be done he is to 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.410
 and that the last five games 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.780
 in a row nils pentecost reddig every time 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.149
 The verdict was called eleven meters and every time

 has succeeded erfurts captain 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.559
 he is the field player with 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.570
 most inserts in the third 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.730
 league but also the record holder he is 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.680
 the one who is already 19 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.410
 a total of 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.670
 20 so only a single ticket and 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.399
 as you ask yourself the question is 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.729
 which was totally cool or how he does it 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.729
 dark 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.780
 that makes a lot of practice nils 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.640
 Pentecost reddig pushes for the 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.630

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.789
 elfmeter shoot 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.280
 curiously, it should be on its own 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.200
 quite often given in the statement 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.149
 But the game is more like that and precise 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.740
 If he had been English, he would have been 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.780
 already determined a national team 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.030

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.369

 order as the host therefore 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.039

 loritz stands well once and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.549
 Arrangement for the arminia 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.519

 he knife into a forward play has bible 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.510

 play station by a sink into the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.560
 Above all, he creates midfield space 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:46.459
 a lot of space for the coming out of the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.459
 Arminia leads 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.490
 typical bielefelder andre actually 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.740
 stayed there with klose has 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.500
 second playmaker to be the passenger

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.599
 this will of the dynamized arminia 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.099
 play with his speed and that 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.099
 with 32 years 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.750
 erfurts portal cracked that pleased 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.300
 of course the fans coach Stefan Kramer 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.580
 The Rhineland carnival of the rear 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:24.489
 is not committed at all so much 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.489
 Missing what's still behind 23 anyway 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.069
 free kick for the guests of course 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.069

 that's marie bockel could pointed 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.290
 the flank was actually here for him 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.910
 thought but now merkels idea there 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.459
 to finish yourself is not so 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.290
 bad 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.060
 then break on erfurt playmaker 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.160
 Pentecost reddig was completely from the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.160
 taken and a elf who gave it 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.519
 also for the pleasure of this 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.319
 East Westphalian rule in the 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.030
 second half and the bielefeld 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.610
 starts stronger now comes in better 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:08.130
 the erfurter half of an erika simon 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.130
 today second bielefelder str 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.540
 the erfurters are already closing 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.920
 beginning of the second passage now 70 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.920
 far in the back 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.980
 your own offensive efforts that 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.419
 Now everything lasts long the arminia 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.060
 can form up well 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.729
 meanwhile hindermann pentecost reddig 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.850
 good solution this pass as turk off yes 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.350
 in between, there is still room to do but there 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.540
 there was something else to look at 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.180
 again increases his body area 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.479
 not entitled to eleven meters for the 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.949
 penal specialists from erfurt because 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.030
 compactness that they set themselves 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:51.160
 have gradually zb sebastian hille 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.160
 he continues tirelessly advancing for 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.680
 beautiful participated 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.290
 many of them think the 20 now completely 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.360
 technically great and me 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:04.100
 all a move at erika simon 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.139
 quasi the success rate alu black man 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.400
 not at all presented his team 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.440
 now produces too many 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.570
 standard situations against itself that is 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.910
 a consequence of the bielefelder permanently 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.260
 back seat marc lorenz the corner whether the 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.510
 new in the startelf for the 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.020
 arminia 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.020
 and there comes 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.940
 20 that's the decision, of course 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.950
 on the alb and that's it too 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.540
 highly deserved fabian klos bother 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.790
 decide by means of this device 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:39.160
 to shorten the attempt at clarification and tom contactor 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.160
 then this will have successful violence 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.840
 it remains the arminia sees 20 views 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.180
 on trainer can be so nice joy 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.620
 the victory against him leads the more 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.410
 better nothing at the defeat 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.410
 can change and their fans in spite of everything 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.460
 if one as beautiful as today ranges 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.280
 just not and but I'm good at it 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.210
 about us doing something different 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.889
 bielefeld is in any case because of 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.810
 he's really hard to beat 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.520
 continue and put up to big three up there 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.050
 really under pressure because the arminia to 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.360
 joy the big and the little one 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.990
 fans still a game less in the 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.240
 behind hand 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.660
 The fight for progress remains correct 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.070
 exciting as I said exciting as never before and 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.169
 this is due to the next series in 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.240
 this case for arminia bielefeld the 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.220
 fourth home win in a row 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.050
 well now who we still the lot hansa 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.120
 Rostock against Darmstadt 98 actually 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.900
 cut it in if it is not too much 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.900
 would have snowed
