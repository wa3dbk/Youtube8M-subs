00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
so we seemingly got a brief synopsis of

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.309 
so we seemingly got a brief synopsis of
what<00:00:02.250> I'm<00:00:02.370> hoping<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.750> first<00:00:04.110> episode

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
what I'm hoping is the first episode

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.860 
what I'm hoping is the first episode
alone<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:05.190> Dragon<00:00:05.819> Ball<00:00:05.970> super<00:00:06.210> because<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.779> be

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
alone of Dragon Ball super because to be

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.930 
alone of Dragon Ball super because to be
honest<00:00:07.080> with<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.799> premise<00:00:08.220> if<00:00:08.400> it's<00:00:08.639> just

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
honest with you the premise if it's just

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.490 
honest with you the premise if it's just
for<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.179> first<00:00:09.300> episode<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.990> was<00:00:10.200> just

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
for the first episode it was just

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.049 
for the first episode it was just
getting<00:00:10.830> us<00:00:10.950> back<00:00:11.130> into<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.580> Dragon<00:00:11.940> Ball

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
getting us back into the Dragon Ball

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.089 
getting us back into the Dragon Ball
verse<00:00:12.269> then<00:00:12.509> by<00:00:12.870> all<00:00:12.900> means<00:00:13.080> cool

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
alright let's get started

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.880 
alright let's get started
gotta<00:00:15.630> start<00:00:15.870> off<00:00:15.990> somewhere<00:00:16.560> might<00:00:16.770> as<00:00:16.859> well

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
gotta start off somewhere might as well

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.470 
gotta start off somewhere might as well
start<00:00:17.160> off<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:17.970> I'm<00:00:18.060> hoping<00:00:18.420> this

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
start off like this but I'm hoping this

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.740 
start off like this but I'm hoping this
isn't<00:00:19.160> what<00:00:20.160> Dragon<00:00:20.699> Ball<00:00:20.850> super<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.330> gonna<00:00:21.539> be

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
isn't what Dragon Ball super is gonna be

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.390 
isn't what Dragon Ball super is gonna be
like<00:00:21.930> because<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.470> trailer<00:00:23.220> which

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
like because I think that trailer which

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.920 
like because I think that trailer which
that<00:00:23.670> teaser<00:00:24.029> or<00:00:24.240> whatever<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.600> we've<00:00:24.750> seen

a couple days ago whatnot I'm guessing

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.939 
a couple days ago whatnot I'm guessing
is<00:00:27.269> for<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> first<00:00:28.050> episode<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.650> lot<00:00:28.830> of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
is for like the first episode a lot of

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
is for like the first episode a lot of
times<00:00:29.130> they<00:00:29.250> use<00:00:29.490> P<00:00:30.000> DS<00:00:30.210> from<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.570> footage

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.880 
times they use P DS from like footage
from<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> first<00:00:31.230> episode<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:31.800> already

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890

from the first episode that they already
have<00:00:32.099> put<00:00:32.250> together<00:00:32.369> whatnot<00:00:32.910> I'm<00:00:33.180> hoping

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
have put together whatnot I'm hoping

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.569

with that
whatever<00:00:36.719> cool<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.730> something

sense and it's good to start things off

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
sense and it's good to start things off
with<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> universe<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:54.990> I'm<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.950> saying

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
with the universe but I'm just saying

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.069 
with the universe but I'm just saying
like<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.700> doesn't<00:01:57.240> sound<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:57.930> we're

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
like that doesn't sound like what we're

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.450 
like that doesn't sound like what we're
looking<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.649> I'm<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.100> hoping<00:01:59.399> that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
looking for so I'm really hoping that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.880 
looking for so I'm really hoping that
soon<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.110> starts<00:02:01.500> off<00:02:01.649> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
soon as like that starts off and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.230 
soon as like that starts off and
then<00:02:02.250> things<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.880> kick<00:02:03.119> off

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
then things you know kick off

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.060 
then things you know kick off
immediately<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:03.990> into<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.590> villain<00:02:04.860> pop

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
immediately we get into the villain pop

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.190 
immediately we get into the villain pop
and<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.610> already<00:02:05.850> seen<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.200> God

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and all because we already seen that God

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.990 
and all because we already seen that God
or<00:02:07.409> whatever<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.829> he<00:02:08.069> looks<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.459> beerus<00:02:08.849> or

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
or whatever that he looks like beerus or

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
or whatever that he looks like beerus or
whatever<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.420> something<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.530> happen

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
whatever so something is going to happen

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.750 
whatever so something is going to happen
hopefully<00:02:11.039> but

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
hopefully but

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.649 
hopefully but
yeah<00:02:12.390> that's<00:02:12.900> an<00:02:13.170> option<00:02:14.510> hopefully<00:02:15.510> it's

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
yeah that's an option hopefully it's

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.240 
yeah that's an option hopefully it's
just<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.900> very<00:02:16.140> brief<00:02:16.470> thing<00:02:16.799> of<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.099> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
just a very brief thing of like the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.640 
just a very brief thing of like the
beginning<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.299> episode<00:02:18.569> never<00:02:19.409> know<00:02:19.530> what
