00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
though this does have more paint detail

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.100 
though this does have more paint detail
in<00:02:03.190> it<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.429> is<00:02:03.580> just<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.849> flat<00:02:04.149> light<00:02:04.690> colored

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
in it this is just a flat light colored

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.559 
in it this is just a flat light colored
gray<00:02:05.410> this<00:02:05.679> actually<00:02:06.069> has<00:02:06.280> some<00:02:06.670> black<00:02:07.209> in<00:02:07.479> it

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
gray this actually has some black in it

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.419 
gray this actually has some black in it
and<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.959> think<00:02:08.020> this<00:02:08.289> just<00:02:08.530> looks<00:02:08.709> better<00:02:08.979> then

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
and I think this just looks better then

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.850 
and I think this just looks better then
we<00:02:09.520> have<00:02:09.640> bee-bop's<00:02:10.030> drill<00:02:10.720> gun<00:02:11.050> thing<00:02:11.500> just

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
we have bee-bop's drill gun thing just

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.010 
we have bee-bop's drill gun thing just
looks<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:12.610> made-up<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.330> don't<00:02:13.629> know<00:02:13.750> where<00:02:13.930> it

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
looks so made-up I don't know where it

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.140 
looks so made-up I don't know where it
fires<00:02:14.379> from<00:02:14.860> but<00:02:15.129> it<00:02:15.250> does<00:02:15.520> have<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.730> trigger<00:02:16.060> I

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
fires from but it does have a trigger I

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.729 
fires from but it does have a trigger I
think<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.390> just<00:02:16.510> spins<00:02:16.900> around<00:02:17.080> if<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:17.440> remember

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
think it just spins around if I remember

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.740 
think it just spins around if I remember

apps<00:02:58.689> with<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.930> silver<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.530> nose<00:02:59.709> ring<00:02:59.980> I

apps with the silver on the nose ring I

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.009 
apps with the silver on the nose ring I
think<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.519> came<00:03:00.730> out<00:03:00.849> good<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.719> figure

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
think that came out good and the figure

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.129 
think that came out good and the figure
is<00:03:02.049> pretty<00:03:02.530> husky<00:03:02.950> he's<00:03:03.159> pretty<00:03:03.489> big<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.510> you

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
is pretty husky he's pretty big so you

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.530 
is pretty husky he's pretty big so you
know<00:03:05.230> pretty<00:03:05.560> wide<00:03:05.859> shoulders<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.209> like

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
know pretty wide shoulders and I like

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.869 
know pretty wide shoulders and I like
the<00:03:07.689> turtle<00:03:08.079> shells<00:03:08.349> right<00:03:08.620> here<00:03:08.980> these<00:03:09.609> can

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
the turtle shells right here these can

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.819 
the turtle shells right here these can
be<00:03:10.030> moved<00:03:10.389> up<00:03:10.689> and<00:03:10.959> down<00:03:11.049> a<00:03:11.169> little<00:03:11.560> bit<00:03:11.709> I

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
be moved up and down a little bit I

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:12.960 
be moved up and down a little bit I
think<00:03:12.159> there's<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.370> little<00:03:12.700> bit<00:03:12.819> of<00:03:12.909> a

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
think there's a little bit of a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.220 
think there's a little bit of a
difference<00:03:13.269> between<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.569> skin<00:03:13.810> color<00:03:13.959> of<00:03:14.079> his

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
difference between the skin color of his

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.009 
difference between the skin color of his
face<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.769> his<00:03:14.919> arms<00:03:15.310> over<00:03:15.639> here<00:03:15.879> but<00:03:16.599> overall

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
face and his arms over here but overall

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.929 
face and his arms over here but overall
I<00:03:17.169> think<00:03:17.319> it's<00:03:17.590> pretty<00:03:17.829> nice<00:03:18.099> one<00:03:18.639> thing<00:03:18.790> worth

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
I think it's pretty nice one thing worth

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.640 
I think it's pretty nice one thing worth
mentioning<00:03:19.120> is<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.780> jacket<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.349> not

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
made out of a pliable material this is a

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.569 
made out of a pliable material this is a
very<00:03:22.599> stiff<00:03:22.959> plastic<00:03:23.620> over<00:03:23.859> here<00:03:24.069> there's<00:03:24.459> no

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
the paint applications are clean and I

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.550 
the paint applications are clean and I

Chuck Taylors right here pretty nice

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.000 
Chuck Taylors right here pretty nice
looking<00:03:40.540> figure<00:03:40.840> in<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.440> back<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.859> figure

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
looking figure in the back of the figure

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.250 
looking figure in the back of the figure
is<00:03:42.220> pretty<00:03:42.459> solid<00:03:42.669> nice<00:03:43.269> muscle<00:03:43.750> definition

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
is pretty solid nice muscle definition

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.689 
is pretty solid nice muscle definition
on<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.379> back<00:03:44.650> over<00:03:44.859> here<00:03:44.979> I<00:03:45.190> think<00:03:45.280> they<00:03:45.519> did<00:03:45.669> a

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
on the back over here I think they did a

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.460 
on the back over here I think they did a
really<00:03:45.790> cool<00:03:46.180> job<00:03:46.449> I'm<00:03:46.720> really<00:03:46.750> happy<00:03:47.109> that<00:03:47.260> we

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
really cool job I'm really happy that we

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.229 
really cool job I'm really happy that we
have<00:03:47.680> this<00:03:47.859> figure<00:03:48.220> like<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.489> said<00:03:48.699> I<00:03:48.729> like<00:03:49.030> how

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
have this figure like I said I like how

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.180 
have this figure like I said I like how
it<00:03:49.359> looks<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:49.780> articulation<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.680> little<00:03:51.069> on

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
it looks the articulation is a little on

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.640 
it looks the articulation is a little on
the<00:03:51.310> disappointing<00:03:51.909> side<00:03:52.180> his<00:03:52.780> head<00:03:53.049> rotates

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
the disappointing side his head rotates

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.189 
the disappointing side his head rotates
side-to-side<00:03:54.190> in<00:03:54.579> a<00:03:54.639> way<00:03:54.819> where<00:03:55.510> I<00:03:55.900> know<00:03:55.959> it's

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
side-to-side in a way where I know it's

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.809 
side-to-side in a way where I know it's
not<00:03:56.470> really<00:03:56.650> easy<00:03:56.979> to<00:03:57.220> get<00:03:57.310> him<00:03:57.430> into<00:03:57.639> cool

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
not really easy to get him into cool

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.819 
not really easy to get him into cool
poses<00:03:58.209> with<00:03:58.359> his<00:03:58.510> head<00:03:58.690> just<00:03:58.840> swiveling<00:03:59.620> like

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
poses with his head just swiveling like

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.369 
poses with his head just swiveling like
this<00:04:00.159> it<00:04:00.669> I<00:04:01.060> feel<00:04:01.389> like<00:04:01.569> he's<00:04:01.840> supposed<00:04:02.169> to

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
this it I feel like he's supposed to

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.830 
this it I feel like he's supposed to
move<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.680> up<00:04:02.769> and<00:04:02.919> down<00:04:03.069> more<00:04:03.370> so<00:04:03.699> but<00:04:04.269> you<00:04:04.810> know

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
move it up and down more so but you know

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.449 
move it up and down more so but you know
not<00:04:05.169> a<00:04:05.229> whole<00:04:05.500> lot<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:05.709> range<00:04:05.919> of<00:04:06.040> movement

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
not a whole lot of range of movement

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.849 
not a whole lot of range of movement
over<00:04:06.729> here<00:04:06.760> so<00:04:07.269> that's<00:04:07.540> kind<00:04:08.019> of<00:04:08.139> tricky<00:04:08.530> and

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
over here so that's kind of tricky and

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.979 
over here so that's kind of tricky and
not<00:04:09.459> too<00:04:09.669> fun<00:04:09.909> he<00:04:10.090> does<00:04:10.299> have<00:04:10.449> shoulders<00:04:10.840> that

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
not too fun he does have shoulders that

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.629 
not too fun he does have shoulders that
can<00:04:11.109> move<00:04:11.229> all<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.650> way<00:04:11.680> up<00:04:11.979> and<00:04:12.220> they<00:04:12.459> move

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
can move all the way up and they move

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.670 
can move all the way up and they move
forward<00:04:12.940> he<00:04:13.209> has<00:04:13.329> a<00:04:13.359> bicep<00:04:13.959> swivel<00:04:14.379> he<00:04:14.560> has

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
forward he has a bicep swivel he has

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.439 
forward he has a bicep swivel he has
double-jointed<00:04:15.159> elbows<00:04:15.430> even<00:04:16.180> though<00:04:16.269> only

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
double-jointed elbows even though only

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.270 
double-jointed elbows even though only
one<00:04:16.599> joint<00:04:17.139> really<00:04:17.380> works<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:17.889> guess<00:04:17.919> if<00:04:18.190> you

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
one joint really works I guess if you

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.279 
one joint really works I guess if you
try<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.579> push<00:04:18.880> this<00:04:19.090> yeah<00:04:19.449> see<00:04:19.720> can't<00:04:20.019> really

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
try to push this yeah see can't really

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.770 
try to push this yeah see can't really
move<00:04:20.560> both<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.159> joints<00:04:21.489> in<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:21.669> elbows<00:04:22.060> so

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
move both of the joints in the elbows so

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.779 
move both of the joints in the elbows so
he<00:04:22.930> can<00:04:23.050> only<00:04:23.169> bend<00:04:23.409> at<00:04:23.530> 90<00:04:23.770> degrees<00:04:24.099> his<00:04:24.580> left

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
he can only bend at 90 degrees his left

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.399 
he can only bend at 90 degrees his left
arm<00:04:24.970> does<00:04:25.150> have<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.539> forearm<00:04:25.810> rotation<00:04:25.990> right

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
arm does have the forearm rotation right

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.290 
arm does have the forearm rotation right
here<00:04:26.680> at<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.889> right<00:04:27.190> arm<00:04:27.460> does<00:04:27.729> not<00:04:27.880> have<00:04:28.030> form

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
here at the right arm does not have form

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.810 
here at the right arm does not have form
rotation<00:04:28.960> but<00:04:29.229> it<00:04:29.380> does<00:04:29.620> have<00:04:29.830> rotation<00:04:30.430> right

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
rotation but it does have rotation right

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.700 
rotation but it does have rotation right
here<00:04:31.270> at<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.509> wrist<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.080> guess<00:04:32.259> this

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
here at the wrist and I guess this

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.550 
here at the wrist and I guess this
bracelet<00:04:33.610> spins<00:04:34.000> independently<00:04:34.210> his<00:04:35.139> wrists

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
bracelet spins independently his wrists

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.589 
bracelet spins independently his wrists
do<00:04:35.770> move<00:04:35.979> up<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.400> down<00:04:36.669> so<00:04:37.120> I'm<00:04:37.240> glad<00:04:37.419> that

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
do move up and down so I'm glad that

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.450 
do move up and down so I'm glad that
they<00:04:37.720> had<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.320> hinge<00:04:38.770> joint<00:04:39.070> over<00:04:39.219> here

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
they had this hinge joint over here

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.159 
they had this hinge joint over here
unlike<00:04:39.729> the<00:04:39.849> turtles<00:04:40.180> we<00:04:40.300> do<00:04:40.419> not<00:04:40.599> get<00:04:40.810> finger

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
unlike the turtles we do not get finger

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.260 
unlike the turtles we do not get finger
articulation<00:04:41.889> he<00:04:42.400> does<00:04:42.550> have<00:04:42.700> a<00:04:42.729> diaphragm

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
articulation he does have a diaphragm

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.340 
articulation he does have a diaphragm
joint<00:04:43.630> you<00:04:44.110> can

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
joint you can

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.650 
joint you can
rotate<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:44.890> side<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.490> side<00:04:45.760> it<00:04:46.210> does<00:04:46.480> move

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
rotate it side to side it does move

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.360 
rotate it side to side it does move
forward<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.140> back<00:04:47.350> a<00:04:47.380> bit<00:04:47.740> now<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.130> leg

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370

articulation<00:04:48.940> is<00:04:49.060> kind<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:49.390> weird<00:04:49.660> it's<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.560> can

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
articulation is kind of weird it's a can

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.220 
articulation is kind of weird it's a can
they're<00:04:51.550> on<00:04:51.670> these<00:04:51.790> ball<00:04:52.210> pegs<00:04:52.510> right<00:04:52.960> there

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
they're on these ball pegs right there

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.810 
they're on these ball pegs right there
and<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:53.530> can<00:04:53.650> move<00:04:53.710> them<00:04:53.860> outward<00:04:54.220> that<00:04:54.520> much

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
and you can move them outward that much

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.180 
and you can move them outward that much
and<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.390> can<00:04:55.690> move<00:04:55.930> them<00:04:56.140> forward<00:04:56.500> a<00:04:56.650> bit<00:04:56.920> not

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
and you can move them forward a bit not

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.420 
and you can move them forward a bit not
too<00:04:57.670> much<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:58.210> you<00:04:58.690> can<00:04:58.960> rotate<00:04:59.260> them<00:04:59.650> all<00:05:00.100> the

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
too much and you can rotate them all the

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.160 
too much and you can rotate them all the
way<00:05:00.520> up<00:05:00.640> here<00:05:00.670> at<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:00.970> hip<00:05:01.150> too<00:05:01.420> so<00:05:01.720> that<00:05:01.930> works

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
way up here at the hip too so that works

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.290 
way up here at the hip too so that works
out<00:05:02.320> okay<00:05:02.710> I<00:05:02.740> guess<00:05:03.010> not<00:05:03.280> too<00:05:03.430> bad<00:05:03.640> he<00:05:04.120> does

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
out okay I guess not too bad he does

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.330 
out okay I guess not too bad he does
have<00:05:04.480> double<00:05:04.840> jointed<00:05:05.140> knees<00:05:05.200> and<00:05:05.860> bends

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
have double jointed knees and bends

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.340 
have double jointed knees and bends
pretty<00:05:06.730> well<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.450> then<00:05:07.600> he<00:05:07.630> has<00:05:07.810> ankles<00:05:08.230> that

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
pretty well and then he has ankles that

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.200 
pretty well and then he has ankles that
moves<00:05:08.530> side<00:05:08.770> to<00:05:08.950> side<00:05:09.160> and<00:05:09.460> that's<00:05:09.640> it<00:05:09.970> he

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
moves side to side and that's it he

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.850 
moves side to side and that's it he
doesn't<00:05:10.540> have<00:05:10.690> ankle<00:05:11.140> pivot<00:05:11.500> which<00:05:11.680> is<00:05:11.830> a

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
doesn't have ankle pivot which is a

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.620 
doesn't have ankle pivot which is a
bummer<00:05:12.190> I'm<00:05:12.490> really<00:05:12.700> frustrated<00:05:12.940> about<00:05:13.420> no

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
bummer I'm really frustrated about no

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.690 
bummer I'm really frustrated about no
ankle<00:05:14.080> pivot<00:05:14.380> nor<00:05:14.650> does<00:05:14.920> it<00:05:14.950> move<00:05:15.250> up<00:05:15.460> or<00:05:15.640> down

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
ankle pivot nor does it move up or down

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.310 
ankle pivot nor does it move up or down
so<00:05:16.210> that's<00:05:16.330> a<00:05:16.480> little<00:05:16.660> frustrating<00:05:17.140> with<00:05:17.200> the

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
so that's a little frustrating with the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.350 
so that's a little frustrating with the
ankle<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:17.800> he<00:05:18.070> does<00:05:18.340> have<00:05:18.580> peg<00:05:18.940> holes<00:05:19.120> at<00:05:19.270> the

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
ankle and he does have peg holes at the

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.640 
ankle and he does have peg holes at the
bottom<00:05:19.570> of<00:05:19.630> his<00:05:19.690> feet<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:20.050> to<00:05:20.200> the<00:05:20.290> top<00:05:20.470> of<00:05:20.590> the

all ratalie here's Beal off compared to

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160 
all ratalie here's Beal off compared to

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
the Gothic Tropius warthog figure I

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.440 
the Gothic Tropius warthog figure I
don't<00:05:38.410> remember<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:38.920> name<00:05:39.130> of<00:05:39.280> this<00:05:39.400> guy<00:05:39.730> but

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
don't remember the name of this guy but

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.690 
don't remember the name of this guy but
yeah<00:05:40.840> so<00:05:41.140> that's<00:05:41.260> just<00:05:41.500> towering<00:05:42.160> over<00:05:42.550> him

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
yeah so that's just towering over him

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.640 
yeah so that's just towering over him
but<00:05:43.030> if<00:05:43.150> I<00:05:43.210> bring<00:05:43.390> in<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.600> classic<00:05:44.110> turtle<00:05:44.440> I

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
but if I bring in the classic turtle I

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.980 
but if I bring in the classic turtle I
don't<00:05:44.800> know<00:05:44.950> now<00:05:45.340> Gotha<00:05:46.060> propolis<00:05:46.570> figure<00:05:46.900> is

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
don't know now Gotha propolis figure is

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.780 
don't know now Gotha propolis figure is
just<00:05:47.170> way<00:05:47.440> too<00:05:47.500> big<00:05:47.980> I<00:05:48.190> think<00:05:48.430> they're<00:05:48.520> out<00:05:48.640> of

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
just way too big I think they're out of

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.460 
just way too big I think they're out of
scale<00:05:49.030> with<00:05:49.240> each<00:05:49.390> other<00:05:49.600> there's<00:05:50.110> B<00:05:50.290> off

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
scale with each other there's B off

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.140 
scale with each other there's B off
compared<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:50.920> Rocksteady<00:05:51.550> review<00:05:51.940> coming

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
compared to Rocksteady review coming

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.300 
compared to Rocksteady review coming
soon<00:05:52.240> stay<00:05:52.690> tuned<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.410> here's<00:05:53.710> the<00:05:53.890> neck<00:05:54.130> of

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
soon stay tuned and here's the neck of

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.070 
soon stay tuned and here's the neck of
Leonardo<00:05:54.790> figure<00:05:55.030> compared<00:05:55.420> to<00:05:55.540> bebop<00:05:55.840> think

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
Leonardo figure compared to bebop think

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.230 
Leonardo figure compared to bebop think
you<00:05:56.200> like<00:05:56.350> 105<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:57.310> I<00:05:57.490> think<00:05:57.730> this<00:05:57.910> scale

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
you like 105 and I think this scale

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.030 
you like 105 and I think this scale
works<00:05:58.570> out<00:05:58.780> perfectly<00:05:59.290> this<00:05:59.560> is<00:05:59.620> what<00:05:59.920> I'm

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
works out perfectly this is what I'm

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.130 
works out perfectly this is what I'm
actually<00:06:00.250> looking<00:06:00.730> for<00:06:01.210> as<00:06:01.480> far<00:06:01.750> as<00:06:01.930> the

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
actually looking for as far as the

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.540 
actually looking for as far as the
height<00:06:02.320> difference<00:06:02.650> between<00:06:03.040> the<00:06:03.190> turtles

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
height difference between the turtles

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.430 
height difference between the turtles
and<00:06:03.790> bebop<00:06:04.150> and<00:06:04.330> rocksteady<00:06:05.050> I<00:06:05.230> don't<00:06:05.380> know

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
and bebop and rocksteady I don't know

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.260 
and bebop and rocksteady I don't know
how<00:06:05.530> accurate<00:06:05.710> that<00:06:05.980> is<00:06:06.130> to<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:06.400> cartoon<00:06:06.760> but

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
how accurate that is to the cartoon but

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.030 
how accurate that is to the cartoon but
this<00:06:07.600> is<00:06:07.750> what<00:06:07.930> I'm<00:06:08.020> looking<00:06:08.140> for<00:06:08.500> and<00:06:08.710> here<00:06:08.950> he

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
this is what I'm looking for and here he

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.110 
this is what I'm looking for and here he
is<00:06:09.130> compared<00:06:09.460> to<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.610> Marvel<00:06:09.850> Legends

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
is compared to the Marvel Legends

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.270 
is compared to the Marvel Legends
big-time<00:06:10.420> letdown<00:06:10.690> spider-man<00:06:11.440> so<00:06:11.860> yeah<00:06:12.250> I

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
big-time letdown spider-man so yeah I

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.770 
big-time letdown spider-man so yeah I
really<00:06:12.430> think<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:12.970> figure<00:06:13.240> could<00:06:13.450> have<00:06:13.600> been

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
really think the figure could have been

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.770 
really think the figure could have been
bigger<00:06:14.230> but<00:06:14.800> you<00:06:15.160> know<00:06:15.280> overall<00:06:15.580> I<00:06:15.940> do<00:06:16.000> like<00:06:16.300> it

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
bigger but you know overall I do like it

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.720 
bigger but you know overall I do like it
I'm<00:06:16.960> very<00:06:17.230> happy<00:06:17.650> that<00:06:17.680> they<00:06:17.950> made<00:06:18.190> it<00:06:18.370> their

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
I'm very happy that they made it their

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.730 
I'm very happy that they made it their
articulations<00:06:19.360> a<00:06:19.450> bit<00:06:19.660> lacking<00:06:20.080> in<00:06:20.530> in

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
articulations a bit lacking in in

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.890 
articulations a bit lacking in in
several<00:06:21.220> ways<00:06:21.580> really<00:06:22.060> if<00:06:22.300> the<00:06:22.420> turtles<00:06:22.720> had

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
several ways really if the turtles had

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.320 
several ways really if the turtles had
upper<00:06:23.290> thighs<00:06:23.530> swivel<00:06:24.130> and<00:06:24.370> they<00:06:24.940> did<00:06:25.180> have

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
upper thighs swivel and they did have

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.030 
upper thighs swivel and they did have
toe<00:06:25.570> articulation<00:06:26.380> there's<00:06:26.590> just<00:06:26.770> more

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
toe articulation there's just more

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.290 
toe articulation there's just more
articulation<00:06:27.550> that<00:06:27.790> I<00:06:27.820> was<00:06:27.940> kind<00:06:28.120> of<00:06:28.150> hoping
