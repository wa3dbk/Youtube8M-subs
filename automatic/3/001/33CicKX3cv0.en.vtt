change<00:01:30.659> shape<00:01:30.990> depending<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.530> decisions

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
change shape depending on the decisions

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920 
change shape depending on the decisions
you<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.100> your<00:01:32.310> team<00:01:32.520> make<00:01:32.760> depending<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.540> when

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
you and your team make depending on when

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.230 
you and your team make depending on when
and<00:01:34.229> how<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.590> decide<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.189> open<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> gate<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and how you decide to open the gate the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.330 
and how you decide to open the gate the
map<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.479> completely<00:01:37.229> change<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.040> five

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
map can completely change they have five

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.730 
map can completely change they have five
different<00:01:38.700> schematics<00:01:39.210> labeled<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.930> 1<00:01:40.170> 385<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
different schematics labeled a 1 385 and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.649 
different schematics labeled a 1 385 and
b1<00:01:41.250> through<00:01:41.430> B<00:01:41.549> Phi<00:01:41.759> which<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.090> suppose<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
b1 through B Phi which I suppose of the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.990 
b1 through B Phi which I suppose of the
alpha<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:42.990> Bravo<00:01:43.290> spawns<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.979> each<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
alpha and Bravo spawns and each one of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.550 
alpha and Bravo spawns and each one of
these<00:01:45.150> schematics<00:01:45.420> looks<00:01:46.170> very<00:01:46.470> very

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
these schematics looks very very

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.289 
these schematics looks very very
different<00:01:46.920> from<00:01:47.100> every<00:01:47.430> other<00:01:47.520> schematic<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
different from every other schematic and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.760 
different from every other schematic and
I<00:01:48.600> believe<00:01:48.900> this<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.080> because<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> what

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
I believe this is because of what

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.530 
I believe this is because of what
happens<00:01:50.100> when<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.310> open<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> gate<00:01:50.909> when<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
happens when you open the gate when you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.060 
happens when you open the gate when you
decide<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.080> that<00:01:52.229> how<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.530> decide<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> do

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
decide to do that how you decide to do

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.260 
decide to do that how you decide to do
that<00:01:53.189> because<00:01:53.280> apparently<00:01:53.640> there's<00:01:53.880> multiple

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that because apparently there's multiple

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.149 
that because apparently there's multiple
ways<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.540> open<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.930> my<00:01:55.409> guess<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.920> you'd

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
ways to open it my guess is that you'd

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.649 
ways to open it my guess is that you'd
have<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.430> either<00:01:56.520> shoot<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> gate<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> lobby<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
have to either shoot the gate a lobby to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.569 
have to either shoot the gate a lobby to
open<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.110> use<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> lever<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.860> switch<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.159> open

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
open or use a lever or a switch to open

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.069 
open or use a lever or a switch to open
it<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.150> might<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.329> different<00:02:00.600> ways<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
it and there might be different ways to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.080 
it and there might be different ways to
do<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.470> that<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.400> might<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.729> go<00:02:02.909> up

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
do it like that or you might just go up

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.730 
do it like that or you might just go up
and<00:02:03.299> start<00:02:03.509> blasting<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.320> something<00:02:04.530> I

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and start blasting it with something I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.050 
and start blasting it with something I
have<00:02:04.890> no<00:02:05.040> idea<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.549> might<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.759> something

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
have no idea there might be something

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.310 
have no idea there might be something
you<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.360> activate<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.259> open

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you have to activate to get it to open

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.620 
you have to activate to get it to open
but<00:02:08.160> depending<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.700> how<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.000> decide<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.540> do

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
but depending on how you decide to do

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.360 
but depending on how you decide to do
that<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.989> map<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.410> actually<00:02:10.860> change<00:02:11.100> which

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
that the map can actually change which

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.860 
that the map can actually change which
is<00:02:11.549> very<00:02:11.730> interesting<00:02:12.299> now<00:02:12.420> while<00:02:12.600> I've<00:02:12.720> not

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
is very interesting now while I've not

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.600 
is very interesting now while I've not
tried<00:02:13.079> this<00:02:13.260> myself<00:02:13.440> yet<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.340> certainly

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
tried this myself yet it's certainly

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.400 
tried this myself yet it's certainly
something<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:15.030> would<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.420> see<00:02:15.840> done<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.350> I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
something I would like to see done and I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.810 
something I would like to see done and I
will<00:02:16.530> probably<00:02:16.739> post<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.220> video<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.549> it<00:02:17.640> very

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
will probably post a video of it very

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.180 
will probably post a video of it very
soon<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.120> expect<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.019> come<00:02:19.200> now<00:02:19.950> as<00:02:20.070> far

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
soon so expect that to come now as far

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.500 
soon so expect that to come now as far
as<00:02:20.310> weapons<00:02:20.489> that<00:02:20.730> look<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.000> be<00:02:21.090> effective<00:02:21.450> on

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
as weapons that look to be effective on

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.330 
as weapons that look to be effective on
this<00:02:21.630> map<00:02:21.810> assault<00:02:22.440> rifles<00:02:22.769> SMG

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
this map assault rifles SMG

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.770 
this map assault rifles SMG
and<00:02:23.430> maybe<00:02:23.610> shotguns<00:02:24.180> I'm<00:02:24.330> not<00:02:24.480> thinking

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and maybe shotguns I'm not thinking

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.000 
and maybe shotguns I'm not thinking
snipers<00:02:25.140> are<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> great<00:02:25.680> idea

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
snipers are going to be a great idea

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.500 
snipers are going to be a great idea
here<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.700> map<00:02:26.910> has<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.120> lot<00:02:27.269> of<00:02:27.300> vertical

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
here the map has a lot of vertical

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.300 
here the map has a lot of vertical
aspects<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.349> not<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:28.980> much<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
aspects to it not so much in the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.680 
aspects to it not so much in the
horizontal<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:30.000> much<00:02:30.150> more<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.480> death

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
horizontal it's much more like death

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.420 
horizontal it's much more like death
room<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.290> where<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.950> have<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.129> whole

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
room like that where you have a whole

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.430 
room like that where you have a whole
lot<00:02:32.879> of<00:02:33.060> area<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.420> move<00:02:33.690> around<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.290> it's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
lot of area to move around but it's

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.530 
lot of area to move around but it's
actually<00:02:34.620> pretty<00:02:35.010> compact<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:36.030> area<00:02:36.330> might

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
actually pretty compact the area might

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.449 
actually pretty compact the area might
be<00:02:36.660> more<00:02:36.810> vertical<00:02:37.319> than<00:02:37.349> horizontal<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:38.250> on

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
be more vertical than horizontal and on

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.670 
be more vertical than horizontal and on
the<00:02:38.580> XY<00:02:38.849> plane<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.569> something<00:02:40.260> more<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.500> think

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
the XY plane so something more to think

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.780 
the XY plane so something more to think
about<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.129> that<00:02:41.280> you're<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.549> be<00:02:41.610> running

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
about is that you're going to be running

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.100 
about is that you're going to be running
around<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.150> lot<00:02:42.299> with<00:02:42.420> assault<00:02:42.660> rifles<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
around a lot with assault rifles and

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.020 
around a lot with assault rifles and
SMGs<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.160> said<00:02:44.220> probably<00:02:44.489> shotguns

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
SMGs and like I said probably shotguns

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.210 
SMGs and like I said probably shotguns
now<00:02:45.209> if<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.480> had<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.870> lay<00:02:46.049> that<00:02:46.200> out<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.830> looks

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
now if I had to lay that out it looks

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.500 
now if I had to lay that out it looks
like<00:02:47.370> they're<00:02:47.489> using<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.790> shotgun<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
like they're using a shotgun in the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.240 
like they're using a shotgun in the
screenshot<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.349> combat<00:02:49.680> arms<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:49.950> released

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
screenshot that combat arms is released

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.920 
screenshot that combat arms is released
they<00:02:50.400> are<00:02:50.519> holding<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.849> for<00:02:51.000> moss<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.720> I'm

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
they are holding it for moss so I'm

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.119 
they are holding it for moss so I'm
guessing<00:02:52.140> that's<00:02:52.349> probably<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.739> hint<00:02:52.950> that

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
guessing that's probably a hint that

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.589 
guessing that's probably a hint that
assault<00:02:53.730> rifles<00:02:54.000> would<00:02:54.090> probably<00:02:54.330> be<00:02:54.450> better

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
assault rifles would probably be better

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.900 
assault rifles would probably be better
for<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:54.870> map<00:02:55.110> although<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.190> looks<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.430> smgs

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
for this map although it looks like smgs

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.030 
for this map although it looks like smgs
from<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.299> way<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.569> map<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.900> laid<00:02:58.079> out<00:02:58.110> smgs

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
from the way the map is laid out smgs

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.080 
from the way the map is laid out smgs
are<00:02:59.099> going<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.280> be<00:02:59.370> very<00:02:59.400> useful<00:02:59.579> as<00:02:59.940> well

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
are going to be very useful as well

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.970 
are going to be very useful as well
preferably<00:03:00.420> things<00:03:00.840> just<00:03:00.989> low<00:03:01.140> recoil<00:03:01.349> p9

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
preferably things just low recoil p9

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.530 
preferably things just low recoil p9
these<00:03:02.190> are<00:03:02.310> probably<00:03:02.519> be<00:03:02.670> very<00:03:02.849> useful<00:03:02.910> here

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
these are probably be very useful here

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.449 
these are probably be very useful here
I'd<00:03:03.989> also<00:03:04.200> guess<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.769> lot<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.040> really<00:03:05.250> fast

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
I'd also guess that a lot of really fast

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.220 
I'd also guess that a lot of really fast
fire<00:03:05.730> rate<00:03:05.910> smgs<00:03:06.360> like<00:03:06.510> mag<00:03:06.690> polls<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.110> going

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
fire rate smgs like mag polls are going

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.229 
fire rate smgs like mag polls are going
to<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.349> very<00:03:07.470> good<00:03:07.680> here<00:03:07.920> as<00:03:08.040> well<00:03:08.190> however<00:03:09.000> tap

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
to be very good here as well however tap

to be very good here as well however tap
firing<00:03:09.480> looks<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.900> be<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.049> key<00:03:10.260> because<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.530> can

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
firing looks to be a key because I can

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.289 
firing looks to be a key because I can
see<00:03:10.829> a<00:03:10.860> lot<00:03:11.099> of<00:03:11.129> spaces<00:03:11.489> where<00:03:11.819> peaking<00:03:12.180> is

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
see a lot of spaces where peaking is

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.390 
see a lot of spaces where peaking is
going<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.629> be<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.750> big<00:03:13.019> problem<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.950> having

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
going to be a big problem so having

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.130 
going to be a big problem so having
those<00:03:14.489> kind<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.760> high<00:03:14.940> accuracy<00:03:15.360> really<00:03:15.989> good

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
those kind of high accuracy really good

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.660 
those kind of high accuracy really good
tap<00:03:16.319> firing<00:03:16.530> guns<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.010> going<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.220> be<00:03:17.280> important

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
tap firing guns is going to be important

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.640 
tap firing guns is going to be important
as<00:03:17.790> well<00:03:17.970> snipers<00:03:18.870> may<00:03:19.049> or<00:03:19.170> may<00:03:19.260> not<00:03:19.290> play<00:03:19.620> a

as well snipers may or may not play a
role<00:03:19.739> I'm<00:03:20.129> looking<00:03:20.940> at<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.120> schematics<00:03:21.690> they

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
role I'm looking at the schematics they

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.539 
role I'm looking at the schematics they
have<00:03:22.079> snipers<00:03:22.680> are<00:03:23.069> not<00:03:23.220> going<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.459> be<00:03:23.519> very

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
have snipers are not going to be very

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.250 
have snipers are not going to be very
useful<00:03:23.730> based<00:03:24.209> on<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.420> elevation<00:03:24.959> levels

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
useful based on the elevation levels

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.869 
useful based on the elevation levels
that<00:03:25.410> they've<00:03:25.560> offered<00:03:25.769> for<00:03:26.099> the<00:03:26.160> map<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.579> it

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
that they've offered for the map and it

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.250 
that they've offered for the map and it
looks<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.120> base<00:03:27.510> camping<00:03:27.989> could

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
looks like base camping could

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.960 
looks like base camping could
potentially<00:03:28.889> be<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.040> problem<00:03:29.340> depending<00:03:29.850> on

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
potentially be a problem depending on

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
when the gates opened for example the a5

when the gates opened for example the a5
and<00:03:32.880> ace<00:03:33.120> sorry<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.959> 84<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.410> 85<00:03:34.819> schematics

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
and ace sorry the 84 and 85 schematics

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.340 
and ace sorry the 84 and 85 schematics
if<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.000> look<00:03:36.150> at<00:03:36.269> those<00:03:36.420> there's<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.079> lot<00:03:37.109> more

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
if you look at those there's a lot more

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.780 
if you look at those there's a lot more
area<00:03:37.889> to<00:03:37.920> move<00:03:38.130> around<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.549> looks<00:03:38.700> like

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
area to move around it looks like

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.160 
area to move around it looks like
they're<00:03:38.910> probably<00:03:39.060> more<00:03:39.269> sniper<00:03:39.599> friendly

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
they're probably more sniper friendly

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.390 
they're probably more sniper friendly
and<00:03:40.319> that<00:03:40.410> base<00:03:40.590> camp<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:41.010> could<00:03:41.099> become<00:03:41.250> a

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
and that base camp it could become a

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.740 
and that base camp it could become a
thing<00:03:41.639> if<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.269> look<00:03:42.389> at<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.599> elevation

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
thing if you look at the elevation

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.289 
thing if you look at the elevation
levels<00:03:43.380> on<00:03:43.470> either<00:03:43.620> side<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.280> spawns<00:03:44.549> they

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
levels on either side of the spawns they

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.180 
levels on either side of the spawns they
look<00:03:45.569> like<00:03:45.720> they<00:03:45.930> are<00:03:46.049> very<00:03:46.319> well<00:03:46.650> varied

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
look like they are very well varied

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.440 
look like they are very well varied
actually<00:03:47.609> so<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:47.940> looks<00:03:48.090> like<00:03:48.180> there<00:03:48.299> could<00:03:48.329> be

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
actually so it looks like there could be

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.910 
actually so it looks like there could be
quite<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> bit<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:48.959> discrepancy<00:03:49.260> between<00:03:49.560> those

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
quite a bit of discrepancy between those

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.650 
quite a bit of discrepancy between those
two<00:03:50.099> sides<00:03:50.370> whereas<00:03:50.760> if<00:03:50.849> you<00:03:50.910> look<00:03:51.060> at<00:03:51.150> a1<00:03:51.510> and

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
two sides whereas if you look at a1 and

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.199 
two sides whereas if you look at a1 and
a2<00:03:51.780> they're<00:03:52.590> very<00:03:52.859> very<00:03:53.190> flat<00:03:53.700> which<00:03:53.940> means

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
a2 they're very very flat which means

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.190 
a2 they're very very flat which means
that<00:03:54.359> there's<00:03:54.510> probably<00:03:54.720> gonna<00:03:54.810> be<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.989> lot<00:03:55.139> of

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
that there's probably gonna be a lot of

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.170 
that there's probably gonna be a lot of
room<00:03:55.470> for<00:03:55.500> smgs<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.190> assault<00:03:56.459> rifles<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.970> try

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
room for smgs and assault rifles you try

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.670 
room for smgs and assault rifles you try
to<00:03:57.239> use<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.450> sniper<00:03:57.750> rifle<00:03:57.870> on<00:03:58.169> a<00:03:58.200> flat<00:03:58.440> room

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
to use a sniper rifle on a flat room

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.990 
to use a sniper rifle on a flat room
you're<00:03:59.130> going<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.310> get<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.489> lot<00:03:59.549> of<00:03:59.669> kills<00:03:59.910> so

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
you're going to get a lot of kills so

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.069 
you're going to get a lot of kills so
you're<00:04:00.120> going<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.269> get<00:04:00.389> killed<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.720> lot<00:04:00.900> as<00:04:01.049> well

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
you're going to get killed a lot as well

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.629 
you're going to get killed a lot as well
especially<00:04:01.829> if<00:04:02.099> you<00:04:02.160> don't<00:04:02.280> have<00:04:02.400> very<00:04:02.519> good

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
especially if you don't have very good
