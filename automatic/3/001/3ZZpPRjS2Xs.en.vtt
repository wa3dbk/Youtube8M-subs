00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.680
 nina are three then I say yes but only 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.410
 good feelings 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.990
 yet another victory if they already have me 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.460
 all said i'm getting boring 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.740
 half- cost costs what time to finish it here 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.160
 so I don't know I don't know who to give 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.900
 I am very happy for this 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.490
 mezzala but that however was hard 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.050
 the cards have been reshuffled from 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.930
 wind several times and then the third one 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 mezzalama these records leave 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.100
 a little time they find but 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.040
 surely the satisfaction being 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.360
 be the first to succeed but beyond this 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.379
 let's say it was a big merger 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.750
 in the graphics it is shown who you are 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.340
 but if the season went very well 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.370
 all the goals that I had 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.879
 set are have entered are gone 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.210
 very well so it is clear that it is the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.879
 icing on the cake of a season 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.970
 perfect has been here to the blade I go out 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.030
 a lot and from the ever more beautiful da 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.460
 bad examined production la 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.930
 next season we think about it now not 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.630
 I want to do too long programs 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.930
 term because I know myself by now 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.270
 I know pretty well that I'll still have the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.000
 my difficulties during the fall start 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.680
 winter therefore it is next season a 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.710
 starting from February we are still looking for 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.780
 again to confirm that we are staying 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.229
 at high levels then we see how it goes to 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.600
 to end 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.640
 we condemn said that you two are from 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.990
 two years that you have always won in 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.390
 cup then I would say a winning combination 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.970
 but also a winning setting but 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.640
 secondary we are not good we are 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.610
 however we know each other well 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.200
 we know how to run intelligently 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.750
 so even when we are not the most 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.690
 strong we can still cut 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.119
 out of 100 percent from the one from the race 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.470
 for this reason even more when we are 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.300
 more fit 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.970
 it seems that things are easy but in 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.060
 actually it was not so there is that is of the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.420
 work behind and even even 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.700
 difficulties then now the latter two 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.980
 years went well in pairs has me 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.580
 won everything we were there 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.800
 set and nothing will be up to us now 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.950
 see if it is reconfirm together or 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.950
 if you divide us and from current
