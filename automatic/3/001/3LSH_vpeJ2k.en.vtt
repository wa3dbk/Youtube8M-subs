00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.730
 talk about beauty today do the comparative 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.750
 is to commit at least 680 of microsoft 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 535 then we have begun to do the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.010
 design of the units 630 knots 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.039
 we have a weight of 134 grams and a 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.730
 9-point thickness 2 mm 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:38.100
 thickness number 585 we have a weight 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.559
 of 146 grams and a thickness of 8.8 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.270
 minutes and people will respond to the mech 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 requires 35 is thinner and 130 is a bit 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.210
 more well built and there is less 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.390
 close so now let's talk about the screen 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.390
 of the lumsa ink apparatus we are 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.480
 a 4.5-inch band with resolution 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.670
 of 854 480 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.159
 this results in 220 people per inch 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.119
 585 We are a 5 inch screen 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:16.290
 with resolution of 960 by 640 up to 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.619
 220 pixels per inch in the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.990
 practice until the new S60 is better because it 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.909
 has the technology td black 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.310
 which means that blacks are 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.900
 as you can see in the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.049
 video logo 535 looks like a mirror 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.869
 the opinion which is deeper than 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.020
 and ps ensures greater angle of 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.020
 kingson 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.340
 walked without protection now thanks 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.020
 resistant to scratches and impacts 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.979
 so let's talk about the camera of the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.210
 appliance 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.990
 both have cameras is 5 megapixels but 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.219
 like 680 he has no fashion nor 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.469
 both front is what kills the device 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:07.049
 the front screen of Fluminense that is 85 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.349
 is the same as the rear camera so it's the 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.940
 same thing back and front camera 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.739
 This is very good for 5 megapixels 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.349
 is a detail worth noting is 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.400
 that volume 35 and called in four years 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.489
 80 p 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.989
 while the number 630 it records in HD 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.290
 so let's talk about the hardware of the 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.780
 1,681 new device we the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.819
 Which processor do I always say 400 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:42.000
 can core of 1.2 ghz gpu adreno 205 e 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.819
 want 12 in December to tie and new 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.299
 mexico at 85 we have the bearer by 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:51.900
 example you will have with 200 can code 1.2 and 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.690
 hatch received adriano 3 2 and 1 gb of 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.160
 ram memory and a chin means that 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.459
 he runs more games he has 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.160
 compatibility with more games but the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.569
 number 680 he is faster because he 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.569
 has an upper processor 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.450
 let's see 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.640
 the volume is R 85 and can hide 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.370
 virtual buttons the games at least 680 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.560
 wheel and wheel in a good 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.180
 is a detail is that the devices with where 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.840
 memory as is the case with the man of 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.510
 35 years will receive more news very 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.250
 at 10 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:38.280
 so let's see the speed to open 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.109
 the apps stayed a little was 60 was 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.549
 a little ahead 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.549
 now we will have the messenger 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:04:01.620
 and it was a technical tie 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:05.400
 Let's close rangers facebook wants 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.110
 tell if it was but nothing so good to be 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.400
 video application 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.940
 how long it takes to open 60 was in 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.470
 so now, let's talk about the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.780
 system of the two devices 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.420
 let's run windows phone 8.1 on 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.030
 president of medellin is the same thing 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.490
 or is called the two devices as the 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.920
 system windows phone 8.1 is the system 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.620
 lightweight and even wheels on 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.380
 lower settings as is the case 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.750
 of the volume at 630 which is only 512 mb 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.150
 of ram 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.530
 so let's talk about the battery of the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.900
 number 689 years the subject matter of 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.050
 1889 the pj that is capable of the old boy is 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:54.050
 of seven hours in heavy use or around 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.430
 one day in the moderate and 75 in the battle of 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.680
 1950 he plays that is from the 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.410
 old about five hours in use 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:07.260
 intense or where it is a new 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:08.580
 60's battery is better because the 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.300
 smaller screen 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.940
 so now advanced storage of 2 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.020
 Let's have another goal of 8 gb s with 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:22.020
 memory card situation of 128 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:25.020
 and you can move applications to the 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.310
 memory card which is a good and 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.410
 connections the appliance 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:34.770
 both in wifi 3g gps is a detail is that 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:38.220
 on the sensors volume r 151 brightness 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.140
 automatic and opportunity it will erase 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.920
 until immediately when making a 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:46.760
 call 60 and it will be long and we do not have 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.760
 the automatic brightness 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.220
 then each one speak of the audio of the device 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.020
 4060 better believe a sound more 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.830
 consistent 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.830
 now 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.800
 then this is obvious 2535 it is more or 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.490
 any less 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:15.000
 actually the audio of month 60 and is higher 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:17.159
 is more consistent than a detail that 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.530
 worth it is that I do not know if 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:28.680
 it comes with digital TV 151 doping 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:38.639
 touch was on the TV in the year 680 we can 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:41.580
 record and will then open the conclusion 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:43.080
 about this comparative is that the volume is 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.479
 that people like this are a wall 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.719
 complete because it has a front 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:51.719
 flash and 1gb ram memory that yes and that 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:55.289
 will run all the games in the store but the 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:59.969
 number 680 is a much better screen because 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:05.240
 would be to have a job is the black well 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:07.500
 big fan of ec 60 is superior but 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.539
 105 well in general 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.770
 for the same reason I said 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:12.960
 previously 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.449
 so basically I think she liked the 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.300
 Sun video is favorite that will join 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:22.370
 if tomorrow the social networks in the teacher 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.370
 book and even in your next video
