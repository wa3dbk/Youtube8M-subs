00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
I don't know how much of a song but this

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.370 
I don't know how much of a song but this

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.680 

don't<00:05:26.009> get<00:05:26.160> close<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.699> a<00:05:27.419> dog<00:05:28.199> very<00:05:28.949> close<00:05:29.280> Oh

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
don't get close to a dog very close Oh

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.900 
don't get close to a dog very close Oh
mouth<00:05:30.690> because<00:05:31.680> if<00:05:31.949> it<00:05:32.160> feels<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.550> ball<00:05:32.729> and

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
mouth because if it feels the ball and

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.790 
mouth because if it feels the ball and
then<00:05:33.289> it's<00:05:34.289> gone

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
then it's gone

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.639 
then it's gone
definitely
