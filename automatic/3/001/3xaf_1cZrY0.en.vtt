the<00:01:06.820> casual<00:01:07.150> mode<00:01:07.240> we<00:01:07.420> have<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.600> what<00:01:08.350> we're

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
the casual mode we have a what we're

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.530 
the casual mode we have a what we're
calling<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.890> Go<00:01:09.100> button<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:10.210> Go<00:01:10.330> button

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
calling the Go button the Go button

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.170 
calling the Go button the Go button
allows<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.259> user<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.590> focus<00:01:12.100> on<00:01:12.490> driving<00:01:12.940> the

allows the user to focus on driving the
car<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.690> cool<00:01:14.170> thing<00:01:14.350> about<00:01:14.440> it<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.770> when

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
car the cool thing about it is when

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.130 
car the cool thing about it is when
you're<00:01:15.250> approaching<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.970> turn<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:16.479> helps<00:01:17.020> you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
you're approaching a turn it helps you

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.469 
you're approaching a turn it helps you
manage<00:01:17.350> your<00:01:17.530> braking<00:01:18.070> your<00:01:18.220> gas<00:01:18.399> so<00:01:19.060> you<00:01:19.090> can

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
manage your braking your gas so you can

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.499 
manage your braking your gas so you can
actually<00:01:19.840> get<00:01:20.050> around<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.409> turn

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
actually get around the turn

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.170 
actually get around the turn
