00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.980
 it was this little video 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.710
 For once, not directly what with 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.450
 I have new gameplay or something to do 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.500
 want you here or someone 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.170
 I'm here with you 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.740
 his website imagine where it or 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.170
 I can create a website where he joins where 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.939
 This is really about new comics 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.109
 make then where has the hall which has 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.310
 also have to do as a reward 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.570
 I do not want to grow up I 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.279
 But I will go at last 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.650
 directly leave the word and I show 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.189
 you then in the at times what is because 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.630
 to see it here 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.670
 I am early how much already said 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.860
 i work on web comic 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.879
 based on the background story too 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.210
 league of legends 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.200
 I work on it with a Spanish 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.739
 Draftsman for about two years 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.719
 In the meantime we had long ago 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.969
 the first chapter should be released and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.109
 then had a longer break until we ourselves 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.420
 have really decided the project 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.730
 follow through 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.920
 we have just finished our new chapter 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.380
 finished and will be starting from the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.020
 next month beginning weekly pages 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.760
 rauszubringen 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.070
 The comic is primarily in English 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.340
 written but I translate the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.140
 chapter back in German again 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.119
 So if you do not speak English so well 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.729
 there is no problem there, I know all 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.549
 thing in German translated as that 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.720
 a whole fan project is our name 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.509
 are not directly with riot games 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.890
 somehow connected we finance ourselves 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.759
 donate exclusively 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.600
 We will be starting next month 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.920
 Weekly as I already said pages 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.860
 rausbringen we will do it for three 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.020
 months and then we decide 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.729
 if we can continue the project 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.100
 or not based on the time 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.990
 Anyway, so be happy if you 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.380
 let's have a look at the chapter 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.890

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.659

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.890
 I have only viewed I show you 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.719
 however, just my luck is not so it is 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.030
 by me probably directly via sms on the way 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.619
 as the pure it looks really good 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.840
 drawn out to offer and her that 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.459
 right here with me I can see 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.870
 I pack the links in the description 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.720
 1 So everything is there 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.950
 she needs and really takes it 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.970
 here for three to five minutes 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.599
 she by the pure 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.459
 It 's really good stuff to me too 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.599
 I really want to say that you can 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.709
 also in a little bigger than that too 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.750
 if he really does that again 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.810
 support of escapes researchers refer 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.360
 what to say or what is far from theirs 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.519
 but as soon as I said it was ours 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.040
 website has the comics again 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.220
 a mailing while the website falls off 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.930
 and sometimes it slowly loads server 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.000
 have in the United States may slow its 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.519
