00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
so as you could hear the car sounds like

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.880

an<00:01:55.400> absolute<00:01:56.030> monster<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.380> reason<00:01:57.740> is

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
an absolute monster and the reason is

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.450
