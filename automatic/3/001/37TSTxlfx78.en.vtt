00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it is that he spins around he lights up

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.139 
it is that he spins around he lights up
and<00:01:45.329> he<00:01:45.689> makes<00:01:45.899> some<00:01:46.020> awesome<00:01:46.409> sounds<00:01:47.159> but

and he makes some awesome sounds but
that's<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.869> even<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.680> best<00:01:49.829> feature<00:01:50.990> he

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
that's not even the best feature he
