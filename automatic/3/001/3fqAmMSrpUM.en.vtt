you know it's a big game being a go Cup
final<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.590> think<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:27.210> know<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.600> came<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
final so I think you know I came in and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.899 
final so I think you know I came in and
like<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.090> said<00:01:30.150> provided<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.810> lot<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:30.990> energy<00:01:31.200> for

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
team you know from the back back forward

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.590 
team you know from the back back forward
to<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.350> Fords<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.640> like<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.360> said<00:04:36.420> we

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
to the to the Fords so like I said we

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.100 
to the to the Fords so like I said we
have<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.750> be<00:04:36.900> organized<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.530> make<00:04:37.710> sure<00:04:37.860> we're

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
have to be organized to make sure we're

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.320 
have to be organized to make sure we're
locking<00:04:40.110> them<00:04:40.350> down<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:41.090> aspect<00:04:42.090> of<00:04:42.210> the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
locking them down and that aspect of the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.900 
locking them down and that aspect of the
game<00:04:42.360> but<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.320> think<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.430> we<00:04:44.520> can't<00:04:44.730> forget

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
game but I think that we can't forget

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.030 
game but I think that we can't forget
that<00:04:45.330> we<00:04:45.420> need<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.600> score<00:04:45.900> goals<00:04:45.960> too<00:04:46.440> because

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
that we need to score goals too because

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.540 
that we need to score goals too because
I<00:04:47.190> think<00:04:47.280> also<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:48.090> good<00:04:48.800> offenses<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.340> best

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
I think also a good offenses is the best

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.940 
I think also a good offenses is the best
defense<00:04:50.960> all<00:04:51.960> right<00:04:52.140> Rico<00:04:52.530> well<00:04:52.710> now<00:04:52.830> we're

alright so first question in your bio I

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.130 
alright so first question in your bio I
was<00:05:06.090> reading<00:05:06.390> it<00:05:06.510> says<00:05:06.720> that<00:05:06.870> you're<00:05:07.020> in

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
was reading it says that you're in

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.159

seems like an odd term but I guess that

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.909 
seems like an odd term but I guess that
means<00:05:12.540> you<00:05:12.720> like<00:05:12.900> any<00:05:13.110> sports<00:05:13.230> team<00:05:13.650> in

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
means you like any sports team in

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.650 
means you like any sports team in
Atlanta<00:05:14.310> and<00:05:14.430> then<00:05:14.970> putting<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:15.450> you're<00:05:15.630> a
