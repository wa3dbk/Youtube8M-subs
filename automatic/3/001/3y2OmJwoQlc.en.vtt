this<00:01:09.420> year<00:01:09.689> i<00:01:09.960> think<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.189> low<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.700> very

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
this year i think that the low is a very

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.670 
this year i think that the low is a very
reminiscent<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.890> nines<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
reminiscent of the nines and and the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.100 
reminiscent of the nines and and the
outer<00:01:16.890> visible<00:01:17.580> dynamic<00:01:18.240> flywire<00:01:18.479> just

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
outer visible dynamic flywire just

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.530 
outer visible dynamic flywire just
really<00:01:19.380> reminds<00:01:19.770> me<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.670> air<00:01:20.790> maxes<00:01:21.390> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
really reminds me of the air maxes that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.560 
really reminds me of the air maxes that
they<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.840> out<00:01:22.110> now<00:01:22.759> definitely<00:01:23.759> not<00:01:24.299> going
