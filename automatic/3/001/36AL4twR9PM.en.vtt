00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
aircraft until I upgraded PDF the

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.850 
aircraft until I upgraded PDF the
service<00:03:04.490> pack<00:03:04.700> 2<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:06.110> I<00:03:06.140> think<00:03:06.380> it<00:03:06.590> might<00:03:06.680> be<00:03:06.740> a

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
service pack 2 so I think it might be a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.950 
service pack 2 so I think it might be a
just<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.280> book<00:03:07.520> with<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.880> service<00:03:08.480> pack<00:03:08.690> 2<00:03:08.900> in

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
just a book with the service pack 2 in

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.150 
just a book with the service pack 2 in
general<00:03:10.030> but<00:03:11.080> I've<00:03:12.080> had<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.380> having<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.710> lot<00:03:13.070> of

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
general but I've had to having a lot of

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.560 
general but I've had to having a lot of
my<00:03:13.250> other<00:03:13.340> aircraft<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.120> don't<00:03:14.270> really<00:03:14.480> know

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
my other aircraft so I don't really know

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.630 
my other aircraft so I don't really know
it<00:03:14.750> sometimes<00:03:15.560> if<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.890> power<00:03:16.130> goes<00:03:16.220> like

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
it sometimes if the power goes like

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.590 
it sometimes if the power goes like
behind<00:03:17.150> like<00:03:17.600> trees<00:03:18.460> clouds<00:03:19.460> and<00:03:19.760> such<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:20.330> I

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
behind like trees clouds and such but I

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.910 
behind like trees clouds and such but I
don't<00:03:20.960> think<00:03:21.080> that's<00:03:21.200> really<00:03:21.440> he<00:03:21.530> has<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:21.800> do

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
don't think that's really he has to do

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.260 
don't think that's really he has to do
the<00:03:22.070> aircraft<00:03:22.490> that'll<00:03:22.730> have<00:03:22.850> fun<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.060> most

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
the aircraft that'll have fun the most

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.400 
the aircraft that'll have fun the most
stuff<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.570> doesn't<00:03:23.840> do<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.020> in<00:03:24.050> a<00:03:24.170> virtual

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
stuff it doesn't do it in a virtual

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.130 
stuff it doesn't do it in a virtual
cockpit<00:03:24.770> for<00:03:25.250> us<00:03:25.370> but<00:03:26.180> let's<00:03:26.720> just<00:03:26.870> get<00:03:26.990> you

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140

cockpit for us but let's just get you
the<00:03:27.290> overall<00:03:27.620> con<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.980> it<00:03:31.640> um<00:03:31.990> it<00:03:32.990> has

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
the overall con to you so it um it has

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.230 
the overall con to you so it um it has
average<00:03:33.620> textures<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.460> mean<00:03:34.640> they're<00:03:34.790> not<00:03:34.940> like

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
average textures I mean they're not like

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.210 
average textures I mean they're not like
whoa<00:03:35.720> high<00:03:36.020> qualities<00:03:36.530> are<00:03:36.650> they're<00:03:36.770> not<00:03:36.920> that

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
whoa high qualities are they're not that

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.450 
whoa high qualities are they're not that
bad<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:38.900> has<00:03:39.050> this<00:03:39.200> weird<00:03:39.440> landing<00:03:39.920> ruler<00:03:40.190> so

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
bad it has this weird landing ruler so

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.980 
bad it has this weird landing ruler so
you<00:03:40.550> can<00:03:40.640> actually<00:03:40.760> raise<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.480> land<00:03:41.660> of<00:03:41.810> you

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
you can actually raise the land of you

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.840 
you can actually raise the land of you
even<00:03:42.230> though<00:03:42.320> there's<00:03:42.500> no<00:03:42.620> animation<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:43.760> when

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
you land you land on your bellies it's

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.310 
you land you land on your bellies it's
pretty<00:03:45.770> weird<00:03:46.040> but<00:03:46.390> as<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.450> texture<00:03:48.020> rapid

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
see kind of a little bit floppy but it's

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.970 
see kind of a little bit floppy but it's
only<00:03:59.540> we<00:03:59.840> are<00:03:59.959> able<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.260> see<00:04:00.440> if<00:04:00.530> you<00:04:00.650> look<00:04:00.800> like

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
we're really pleased so it's not that

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.330 
we're really pleased so it's not that
bad<00:04:03.320> especially<00:04:03.620> when<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.130> shine<00:04:04.400> goes<00:04:04.670> over

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
bad especially when the shine goes over

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.110 
bad especially when the shine goes over
but<00:04:06.340> I<00:04:06.990> mean<00:04:07.990> this<00:04:08.560> aircraft<00:04:09.460> even<00:04:09.940> though<00:04:10.000> it

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
but I mean this aircraft even though it

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.700 
but I mean this aircraft even though it
does<00:04:10.240> have<00:04:10.420> these<00:04:10.570> weird<00:04:11.050> little<00:04:11.350> glitches

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
does have these weird little glitches

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.220 
does have these weird little glitches
it's<00:04:12.070> so<00:04:12.220> really<00:04:12.490> fun<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.910> fly<00:04:13.240> it<00:04:13.660> looks<00:04:13.990> great

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
it's so really fun to fly it looks great

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.509 
it's so really fun to fly it looks great
for<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.560> most<00:04:14.710> part<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.880> it<00:04:16.660> just<00:04:16.870> overall

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
very good in fact it's one of my

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.590 
very good in fact it's one of my
favorite<00:04:20.320> freeware<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:24.180> we're<00:04:25.180> taking<00:04:25.450> off

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
favorite freeware that we're taking off

for<00:04:25.870> pharmacies

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
for pharmacies

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.010 
for pharmacies
get<00:04:27.940> high<00:04:28.060> lie<00:04:28.210> down<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.510> background<00:04:28.870> is

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
get high lie down the background is

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.680 
get high lie down the background is
again<00:04:29.320> tuck<00:04:29.620> it<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:29.980> make<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.700> short<00:04:31.240> clip<00:04:31.540> the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
again tuck it and make a short clip the

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.689 
again tuck it and make a short clip the
place<00:04:31.930> over<00:04:32.140> there

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.839 

so<00:04:37.150> it's<00:04:37.389> very<00:04:38.139> smooth<00:04:38.530> dynamics<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.610> it's

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
so it's very smooth dynamics and it's

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.149 
so it's very smooth dynamics and it's
just<00:04:40.259> again<00:04:41.259> I'm<00:04:41.409> gonna<00:04:41.530> throw<00:04:41.770> some<00:04:41.979> dirty
