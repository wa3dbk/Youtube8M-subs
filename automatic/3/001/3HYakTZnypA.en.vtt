00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
thermal stability and then he also has

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.010 
thermal stability and then he also has
like<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> other<00:00:56.640> generator<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.390> 12-volt<00:00:57.930> fan

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
like the other generator a 12-volt fan

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.840 
like the other generator a 12-volt fan
and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> other<00:00:59.399> side<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.220 
and then on the other side of that
there's<00:01:00.030> another<00:01:00.300> fan<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.780> he's<00:01:00.899> got<00:01:01.050> backup

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
there's another fan so he's got backup

the Murphy relay control box and of
course<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> coolant<00:01:21.630> temperature<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.530> sensed

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
course the coolant temperature is sensed

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.230 
course the coolant temperature is sensed
right<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.820> comes<00:01:23.970> out<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.150> the

right here as it comes out of the
cylinder<00:01:24.509> head<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.810> we'll<00:01:24.990> start<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.439> let

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
cylinder head so we'll start it up let

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.340 
cylinder head so we'll start it up let
it<00:01:26.280> run<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.700> I'll<00:01:26.909> shut<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.270> down<00:01:27.390> here's<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
it run and I'll shut it down here's the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.190 
it run and I'll shut it down here's the
push-button<00:01:28.710> shut<00:01:29.250> down<00:01:29.400> switch<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.240> sends

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
push-button shut down switch that sends

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.039 
push-button shut down switch that sends
a<00:01:31.229> signal<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.909> relay<00:01:33.180> delay<00:01:33.450> box<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:33.900> there

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
a signal to the relay delay box up there

00:01:34.049 --> 00:02:08.859 
a signal to the relay delay box up there
to<00:01:34.200> shut<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.500> down

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.860 

that's<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.140> thanks<00:02:10.380> for<00:02:10.440> watching
