00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
see some nice abilities their balance I

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.650 
see some nice abilities their balance I
found<00:03:42.940> really<00:03:43.030> good<00:03:43.480> for<00:03:43.870> dps<00:03:44.260> and

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
found really good for dps and

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.629 
found really good for dps and
telekinetics<00:03:46.660> it's<00:03:46.900> also<00:03:47.109> damaged<00:03:47.709> tree<00:03:48.190> but

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
telekinetics it's also damaged tree but

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.759 
telekinetics it's also damaged tree but
I<00:03:48.669> think<00:03:49.030> it's<00:03:49.209> more<00:03:49.299> tailored<00:03:50.169> for<00:03:50.319> PvP<00:03:50.739> I

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
I think it's more tailored for PvP I

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.159 
I think it's more tailored for PvP I
could<00:03:51.160> be<00:03:51.280> wrong<00:03:51.489> it's<00:03:52.329> hard<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.629> say<00:03:52.750> really

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
could be wrong it's hard to say really
