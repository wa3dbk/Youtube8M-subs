00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.859
 have fun 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.279
 after the first part is so good with you 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.050
 i thought i would have thought so 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.199
 but also the next part of the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.119
 top 3 apple jacks row the last video 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.410
 is now a month old and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.119
 meanwhile I have three new ones 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.730
 applications which I give you today 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.980
 I would like to start with 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.989
 an application of apple itself and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 Although remote remote has been around 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.370
 longer time for the iphone and for that 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 ipad and many of you should be her 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.270
 certainly be known as the name 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.129
 you can already reveal with this 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.210
 Application of various devices 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.219
 remote control 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.350
 in my case are that here two apple 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.850
 tvs but not only apple tvs are here 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.000
 supports but also all 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.649
 Itunes libraries really a lot 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.300
 handy app especially if you look 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.129
 lying on the couch or in bed and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.930
 his remote just does not work 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.660
 Hand has really worked the whole thing 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.489
 wonderful and very fluid therefore 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.070
 the app really highly recommended 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.110
 it continues with some music more closely 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.990
 said with podcast and that with the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.420
 application over cast rover cast is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.610
 one of the best podcast app in the app store 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.490
 and I'm currently in the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.170
 switch from instapaper cast to bin 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.229
 now really more than satisfied 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.330
 with this application with the ovag is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.670
 apple watch app you can do your podcast 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.470
 start pausing rewind and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.780
 of course also fast forward 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.390
 you can also lead a forestay trail 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.610
 Here you come in another menu where he 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.979
 select different podcast 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.439
 or you can also in the effects menu 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.329
 go where he activate certain effects 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.909
 or disable it 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.500
 you are available here once 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.960
 the smart speed which the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.630
 speed of the podcast automatically 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.670
 adapts as well as the voice bus of the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.890
 volume or accentuation 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.540
 the vote in some highlights and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.820
 Of course you also have a good last one 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.920
 the possibility of the speed of the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.229
 manually adjust podcast 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.360
 a really great application 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.030
 which remote access to your 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.480
 podcast very relieved and thus 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.640
 we come last 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.159
 application which I show today 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.840
 I want to translator this 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.640
 There is also an application 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.980
 longer and she counts meanwhile 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.019
 really the best 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.390
 Translation app for the ios device and 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.370
 now for the apple what was up on me 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.799
 The apple bot pretty much like it 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.780
 the direct input possibility over the 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.760
 Apple Watch itself which you the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.049
 respective text equal to the respective one 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.120
 translated language 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.890
 in addition to English you can also here 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.610
 many different languages 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.440
 choose 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.000
 Here I was from the selection so more 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.129
 as a positive surprise 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.230
 the only thing I do not like so much 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.569
 is the fact that the translated 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.760
 text is not read out loud but one 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.829
 little improvement potential needs 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.780
 yes, every application and me 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.609
 can imagine that this 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.920
 feature is still being implemented 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.049
 and yes that was it already again 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.930
 with this video and the second part 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.609
 the top 3 apple jacks row in case you 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.739
 I still have an app which I have 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.349
 should definitely look at it writes 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.239
 me below the comments and maybe 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.739
 this application also lands already 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.870
 in the next part of this series 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.609
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.769
 if so, I would go over one 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.730
 Thumbs up and an abo of course 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.950
 for the happy ones 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.160
 We will be up next time 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.160
