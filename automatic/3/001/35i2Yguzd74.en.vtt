00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
scrimmage and we put them on the hash

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.080 
scrimmage and we put them on the hash
marks<00:00:30.630> they're<00:00:31.470> gonna<00:00:31.679> sprint<00:00:32.130> from<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.850> hash

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090

to<00:00:37.410> stay<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.710> bounds<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.340> our<00:00:38.489> kids<00:00:38.760> know<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to stay in bounds and our kids know and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.540 
to stay in bounds and our kids know and
you<00:00:39.390> heard<00:00:39.570> him<00:00:39.600> asking<00:00:40.079> today<00:00:40.250> as<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.520> were

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
you heard him asking today as you were

you heard him asking today as you were
filming<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.510> drop<00:00:42.750> somebody<00:00:43.079> that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
filming that can we drop somebody that

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.770 
filming that can we drop somebody that
goes<00:00:43.590> out<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.829> bounds<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
goes out of bounds on this and the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
goes out of bounds on this and the
reason<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.320> you're<00:00:46.710> chasing<00:00:47.160> some<00:00:47.370> kid<00:00:47.579> he

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
reason is you're chasing some kid he

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
reason is you're chasing some kid he
goes<00:00:47.969> five<00:00:48.270> yards<00:00:48.600> out<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.840> bounds<00:00:49.230> these<00:00:49.440> kids

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
goes five yards out of bounds these kids

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.260 
goes five yards out of bounds these kids
are<00:00:49.860> not<00:00:50.010> very<00:00:50.280> happy<00:00:50.640> because<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:50.910> they<00:00:51.030> don't

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
are not very happy because if they don't

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.830 
are not very happy because if they don't
touch<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:51.870> they<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.129> go<00:00:53.250> again<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.360> when

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
touch them they have to go again so when

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.750 
touch them they have to go again so when
you're<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.199> dose<00:00:55.500> guard<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.460> got<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
you're this dose guard and you got to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.660 
you're this dose guard and you got to
catch<00:00:56.910> some<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.199> sophomore<00:00:59.129> tailback

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
catch some you know sophomore tailback

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.939 
catch some you know sophomore tailback
that<00:01:00.329> ran<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.719> bounds<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.649> missed

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that ran out of bounds and you missed

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.310 
that ran out of bounds and you missed
and<00:01:02.250> now<00:01:02.340> your<00:01:02.520> groups<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.210> jog<00:01:03.809> right<00:01:04.049> back

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and now your groups you jog right back

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.440 
and now your groups you jog right back
up<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.830> go<00:01:05.040> again<00:01:05.430> you're<00:01:05.970> ready<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.299> kill

zone<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.540> even<00:01:33.689> tougher<00:01:34.079> drill<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
zone you know it's even tougher drill to

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.039 
zone you know it's even tougher drill to
do<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.729> way<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.540> creative<00:01:36.659> as

do that way so you can be as creative as

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.749 
do that way so you can be as creative as
you<00:01:37.079> want<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.560> here's<00:01:37.829> here's<00:01:38.310> probably<00:01:38.700> the
