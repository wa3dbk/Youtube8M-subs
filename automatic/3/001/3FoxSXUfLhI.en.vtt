00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 yes hello people added to this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.730
 Video today a comparison test of the Honda 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.889
 cbr 500 under ktm rc 93 both 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.679
 motorcycles for the a2 driver's license 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.560
 are suitable and I'll tell you right away 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.750
 what about the rc I test now 40 days 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.990
 My girlfriend was allowed to say something to you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.990
 your motorcycle the cbr and off you go 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.170
 yes we come to the comparative test of 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.900
 cards mrc 93 and the honda cb 500 er 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.030
 now for a few shots the strengths 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.460
 The ktm are in any case their easy 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.830
 weight and thus their immense 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.300
 manageability so the thing was real 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.010
 Chasing through the curves makes that easy 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.860
 only fun combined is the whole 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.090
 of course with the single cylinder what 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.140
 of course a very interesting one 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.140
 driving experience 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.300
 my girlfriend just stuck behind 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.130
 car so I can tell you one time 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.350
 little thing to tell the moped what 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 bothering me a bit is at 3 4000 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.250
 revolutions 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.870
 That's where the front panel starts 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.500
 to rattle so right here in front 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.030
 left area 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.530
 I do not know if it is mine 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.410
 press machines lies or whether that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.710
 Generally the case is definitely something 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.900
 with all rc 93 124 certainly with 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.210
 a problem is that you reflect that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.860
 almost exclusively his frames 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.260
 So that's what it looks like 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.310
 always nice to the poor they not 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.470
 so much of the traffic 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.450
 if I really want to watch what's behind 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.910
 I have to go either hand 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.500
 completely outside or even on the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.060
 best off the steering wheel what a lot 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.330
 is extraordinary and at least in 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.950
 my eyes on the beautiful is that the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.630
 left integrated in the mirrors at the front 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.729
 So I do not have that yet 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.320
 at least not seen on the spot 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.180
 is unique or so they have it yes 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.630
 here in the mirror surfaces as such 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.270
 but the rim how do you call the people 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.640
 I've never seen anything cool in general 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.679
 LED technology here what you hear very often 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.880
 is that the on-board computer 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.370
 I do not find it clear that I am personally 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.470
 Not at all when you consider that 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.570
 if you would buy outer place me 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.459
 Of course, you have to think longer term 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.440
 the ice is chased time to memorize the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.050
 and then this is a top onboard computer 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.180
 So many cool features 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.750
 which you really miss anything from the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.070
 aisle indicator up to the sound of a flash 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.870
 consumption indicator and so on and so on 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.500
 If you already have the consumption 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.080
 speak 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.320
 He is really low on the moped 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.810
 So I drive the 93 with four liters 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.750
 it has pretty much 4.0 liters of abs 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.049
 of course very sporty in cyprus so 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.690
 for has two drivers who go with it 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.459
 just awesome what de facto way is 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.040
 is that she is so petite 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.230
 is and just with the skinny tires 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.070
 just think one or the other 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.500
 so diehard 1000 kubik driver that 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.049
 it's about a 125cc 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.370
 Personally, that does not bother me 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.010
 However, we imagine that he has a few 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.720
 other level 2 just does not run from 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.060
 Wants to be held 125th 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.329
 What bothers me personally was water for 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.359
 a lot of it will be me 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.930
 personally a bit like that 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.420
 Choices what the design 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.380
 Missing means you have this 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.600
 a decor and the frame is anyway 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.430
 always orange so he could not do anything 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.440
 turn it on but if you just a ktm 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.709
 then buys you know that you were only on 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.419
 So eva wittchen over a year 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.250
 I can say that very well what I say 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:46.530
 have learned to love her over time 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.419
 For one thing, it's clear that 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.340
 I sporting optics me just also 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.410
 has brought in the first time on itself 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.410
 to pay attention what is therefore 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.260
 were also very good off so found 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.829
 the first sit after the first drive 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.720
 you are sitting on it relatively straight 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.000
 very pleasant terrain and back 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.799
 I had little problems so far 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.840
 with time like on a typical 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.799
 Athletes are the rats we are on 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.440
 at the front rather than a real athlete 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.600
 and also the handlebar is higher than 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.070
 bench so much higher it was 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.500
 why did I play a role? 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.680
 the antue body was also very clear that 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.090
 you for the a2 driver's license 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.900
 was tailored 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.280
 with their 48 hp and also these 850 guests 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.500
 come out well what's in the 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.330
 Opposite for example throttled xj6 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.070
 supply market and I mean already 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:45.630
 very good but what a pity that is 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.300
 the ktm trumps my already 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.740
 I have a lot in my life too 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.230
 he thinks he is sick 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.320
 and the tank volume so I'm coming with 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.270
 a tank good 350 kilometers 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.410
 approach 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.390
 from the manufacturer to 390 gas stations mostly 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.870
 maybe 17 euros, I'm so happy 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.450
 as for example with the game today for ten 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.610
 euro follows the orientation thus has 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.380
 obtained must namely for gas station 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.300
 that would personally drive me first 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.310
 the four motorcyclists persist 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.400
 atan to bring what, however, to 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.670
 Since he has to find much better is the 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.820
 standard sound so my cbr 90 there 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:31.780
 really cute on what s.meine too 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.270
 is still not bad is 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.240
 again to return to the comfort 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:42.560
 the seats are beautiful is extreme 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.370
 narrow as the patient then 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.500
 would have to get a long time 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.169
 which is also clear to me 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.680
 has better like Annika tm is indeed the 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.120
 optics see both numbers athletic 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.780
 I have no opinion 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:02.800
 but a little more is mine 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:04.750
 yes, even wider she jumps in love 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.430
 width probably also conditional 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.510
 through the profound game always 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.340
 already thin mature on it which I always 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:17.040
 a lot smaller so you could 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.040
 now think of 125 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.199
 so now we have seen what we both did 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:28.009
 think about the individual motorcycles 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.469
 In summary, it can be said that 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:32.059
 is the sportier motorcycle that's him 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:34.279
 the motorcycle for longer tours for 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:36.680
 someone who maybe a bit 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:39.139
 wants to travel more comfortably and that is 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.300
 just really year a sports equipment me 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.259
 almost say and i hope in any case 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.360
 could you guys a bit further 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.249
 help if so take it would be me 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.050
 me in any case in the blue thumb 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:49.909
 wish and that they sometimes the 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.520
 social networks looks to the left of me 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.289
 My job is still open today 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.839
 I do not have a t-shirt myself 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.099
 because my all are in the laundry 

00:06:55.839 --> 00:07:26.469
 and yes, I like to look over and then 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:34.030
 see you soon again next slower 

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:36.900
 maybe 50 country road to plan 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.900
 now refrain
