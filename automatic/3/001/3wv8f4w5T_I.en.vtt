00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.550
 yes finally there is news to need 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.080
 for speed row which has now only 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.620
 a bit of a break 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.780
 year 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.270
 now electronic arts has a new one 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.910
 trailer published or a teaser 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.990
 trailer and there are also some info 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.510
 and we want to do that now 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.580
 Quick summarize here so that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.580
 All this would indeed as a kind of reboot will 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.810
 so back to the roots again 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.980
 to think again a bit 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.420
 Gather the best elements 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.020
 believe together and again 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.969
 to begin 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.879
 the last need for speed parts were 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.110
 yes not the best years 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.660
 at least not so great arrived 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.489
 that actually means pure need for 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.030
 speed around just so again this 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.780
 reboot to make that clear 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.100
 starts at zero 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.079
 It plays an open world exactly is supposed to 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.969
 So also an action enter 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.800
 detached transmitter face uncertain 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.699
 but should any story arc one 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.149
 action arc in 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.979
 it only plays at night resp 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.140
 from the evening until dawn 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.240
 pure but so real races at the time of action 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.650
 it probably will not be synonymous what synonymous 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.159
 but with all the optics of this 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.659
 trailers and also the screenshots so 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.950
 I think nobody can believe that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.810
 deny that's a bit 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.700
 going underground is very accurate 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.180
 So need for speed also uses the same 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.700
 engine like they used to be from 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.820
 visitors will come to use 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.409
 namely the frostbite engine and the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.930
 but also means that the old 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.939
 console generation for the first time at the new 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.790
 Need for speed is not taken into account 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.850
 So who has an xbox 360 or the ps3 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.189
 and ps2 or the ps1 can be the new one 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.500
 no need to play for speed 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.390
 yes good at the change now synonymous 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.430
 even at the time however, it is also 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.979
 say in the trailer is stated that it 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.009
 involved in the game 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.170
 should act and that the scenes 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.700
 shown scene also representative of 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.740
 all platforms be 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.570
 should of course it is the question whether the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.399
 nevertheless real gameplay material is 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.080
 or rather in engine foto privat 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.879
 So so so beautiful today says the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.260
 expectation until the first 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.400
 shown gameplay maybe again 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.840
 a little bit careful his more or 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.220
 the next downgrade scandal 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.720
 is currently still quite difficult 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.060
 guess if the game really like that 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.099
 at least she looks good 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.030
 even if not terrible in the trailer 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.980
 a lot to see that a few 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.810
 Information can be pulled out there 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.360
 is for example police but 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.549
 so the mode is also back 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.239
 but you can as far as I was not 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.290
 policemen play as the statement what 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.030
 one also sees that is the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.459
 license plates as far as you can tell 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.130
 may be californian and also 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.019
 the city the scenery seems a bit 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.280
 to los angeles that is 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.220
 maybe it will be similar 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.959
 underground 2 a fictional California 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.610
 city was also underground 2 was yes 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.410
 be inspired to the area or 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.970
 maybe it will actually become one 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.769
 more or less fictive ll 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.150
 replica is supposed to be open gold 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.000
 insofar, the guess is the city 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.519
 becomes size right and electronic arts 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.590
 works also with the speedhunters 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.090
 together what he be up with that well 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.069
 this is a website about racing and 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.230
 Tuning scenes as I understood 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.760
 So they should have it too 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.019
 involved his tips and hints man 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.639
 sees the cars in the trailer as well 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.859
 Of course it really belongs to need for 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.950
 speed but also a little something 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.030
 you can see from tuning already a bodykit 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.829
 I have let me know but I know 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.630
 I'm there myself to not have been made 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.239
 We also make real products of real ones 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.750
 tuning manufacturer and also there you can 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.940
 a short time 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.810
 tuning should be a very big one again 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.690
 role-play 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.670
 in need for speed then should also the 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.560
 first announcement as part of the e3 should 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.780
 then probably the same size 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.910
 Possibilities for tuning to adaptability 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.799
 The vehicles are presented exactly 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.549
 we are anxious to appear that 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:54.239
 whole in autumn 2015 for playstation 4 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:57.060
 for xbox one and of course for the 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.799
 pc we stay tuned to the topic and yes that 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.560
 First of all, everything important to 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.459
 new need for speed and yes enjoys 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.030
 just in the cellar 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.030
 See you 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.670
