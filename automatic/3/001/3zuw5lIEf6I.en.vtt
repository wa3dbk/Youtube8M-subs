00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
switch off now but I cannot let this

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.950 
switch off now but I cannot let this
opportunity<00:02:32.700> pass<00:02:33.180> me<00:02:33.390> by

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.880 

I<00:02:38.960> thought<00:02:39.960> it<00:02:40.110> would<00:02:40.170> be<00:02:40.320> worth<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.620> try<00:02:40.830> to

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
I thought it would be worth to try to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.010 
I thought it would be worth to try to
ask<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.340> world<00:02:41.520> for<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> little<00:02:41.970> help<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.450> see

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
ask the world for a little help and see

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.890 
ask the world for a little help and see
what<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.230> said<00:02:43.410> back<00:02:43.700> but<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:45.180> all<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.330> know<00:02:45.510> it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
what it said back but for all I know it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.660 
what it said back but for all I know it
could<00:02:45.930> turn<00:02:46.320> round<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.770> me<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.100> say<00:02:47.310> hey<00:02:47.640> stop

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
could turn round to me and say hey stop

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.980 
could turn round to me and say hey stop
which<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:51.150> fair<00:02:51.990> enough<00:02:52.520> or<00:02:53.520> we<00:02:54.420> could<00:02:54.600> say<00:02:54.810> yes

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
which is fair enough or we could say yes

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.110 
which is fair enough or we could say yes
and<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:56.040> boy<00:02:56.190> from<00:02:56.430> Croydon<00:02:56.670> could<00:02:57.000> be
