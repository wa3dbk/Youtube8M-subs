00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.190
 good afternoon, let's explain the 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.200
 short steps 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.630
 a little bit how is the theme of the 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.240
 repairs 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.220
 usually people for perfect ones 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.830
 so in shoes usually shoot the 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.270
 usually throw or we do not fix emiss 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.380
 which is very expensive because they do not know 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.720
 we are here for 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.960
 explain to the people how can they 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.399
 fix it 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.980
 the processes the time it takes and the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.360
 cost what 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.360
 that dropped him to a mexico drum 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.380
 here we appreciate how 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.910
 the lid 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.720
 comes to this line but here is a 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.800
 wear 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.440
 with which in the machine we reduce as 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.000
 we appreciate here 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.600
 to put a piece 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.430
 and fill in that lack with which the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.760
 height of the heel 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.610
 does not go too low and the tip does not rise 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.770
 upwards every case that is commanded 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.840
 with the toe would always rise towards 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.730
 above 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.210
 if here it goes up a bit if we eat more 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.740
 heel was still rising more 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.740
 they are things that people do not know 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.060
 we would put the piece 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.330
 that work is twice as much work 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.900
 to put a lid but in this case there 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.570
 what to put 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.910
 I always apply for the next 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.830
 repair bear in mind will not come 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.720
 until the piece that is put 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.560
 we go to the next shoe and here we see 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.950
 the worker there is the piece 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.540
 and from here to down in the layer with 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.840
 which what indicated in the other 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.890
 shoe is that before you get to the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.729
 dividing hairline 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.640
 of the wedge bring the lid then the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.980
 cost will be cheaper 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.650
 and the shoe will not break down so much 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.260
 and bone 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.799
 that what you have to fill in all 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.799
 worn outsole 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.150
 as it is but 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.310
 perfect the people of this gentleman by 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.940
 example in particular I thought that the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.890
 shoe was going to throw 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.760
 when you find it you will notice 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.960
 that the shoe is going to be 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.610
 practically new 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.650
 a good finish 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.870
 some good auctions 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.400
 as we see the piece practically neither 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.640
 note it seems that it is a 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.060
 and then at the time of finishing 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.980
 all the outline will be painted in black 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.640
 the shoe will be cleaned with cream and 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.640
 will be eggs 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.060
 there are people who make you a little bit more 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.740
 the foot out 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.720
 or inwardly it can also be 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.670
 With which 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.290
 I always tell them that there is a way to 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.950
 fix 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.980
 and is putting a type of outer wedge or 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.799
 inside as in this case we see that what 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.970
 it does is to compensate tread 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:30.090
 walk 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.349
 what is recommended and what I always try 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.720
 inform customers is that it is wedged 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:40.240
 you have to put it when the shoe does not 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.870
 has practically use for what 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.470
 so that when put 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.769
 the shoe does not have a shape or a vice 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.440
 he has already caught at the time of walking 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:55.030
 then the piece could be put but 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.650
 the result would not be as effective 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.650
 I hope you have served them well 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.700
 and that you have fixed various doubts 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.700
 that you have 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.590
 in any other doubt or I would have 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.590
 liked video I hope that 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.230
 you ask me 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.260
 best 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.170
 with 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.810
 this shoe when you do it a little bit or 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.190
 this is according to the time of 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.840
 shredding the lid on one side is a 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.810
 normal track of the people 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.920
 today 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.060
 is so easy 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.060
 come back here in this 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.259
 they realize 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.030
 thank you very much hello and I hope 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.479
 it has served them something to 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.479
 solve 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.690
