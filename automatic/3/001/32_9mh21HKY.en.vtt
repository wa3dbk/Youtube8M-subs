00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
opinion before getting to the statistics

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.740 
opinion before getting to the statistics
is<00:00:49.399> not<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.579> best<00:00:50.760> gun<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.210> game<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.600> it's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
is not the best gun in the game but it's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.049 
is not the best gun in the game but it's
not<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.930> worst<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> same<00:00:53.010> time<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.489> feel

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
not the worst at the same time I feel

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.470 
not the worst at the same time I feel
that<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.360> gun<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.960> made<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:57.149> play

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that this gun was made to be to play

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.110 
that this gun was made to be to play
almost<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.170> an<00:00:58.260> assault<00:00:58.590> rifle<00:00:58.730> but<00:00:59.730> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
almost like an assault rifle but the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.900 
almost like an assault rifle but the
running<00:01:00.449> gun<00:01:00.719> style<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.320> an<00:01:01.590> SMG<00:01:01.949> because<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
running gun style of an SMG because the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.570 
running gun style of an SMG because the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
really really far it is almost as much

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.069 
really really far it is almost as much
as<00:01:38.130> an<00:01:38.369> assault<00:01:38.759> rifle<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.479> highest<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:39.990> this

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079

some<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> long-range<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.540> somehow

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
some a long-range and you can somehow

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.679 
some a long-range and you can somehow
hold<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> recoil<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.220> stay<00:01:47.430> constant<00:01:48.090> you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
hold that recoil to stay constant you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.819 
hold that recoil to stay constant you
are<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.020> able<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.229> kill<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> enemy<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
are going to be able to kill the enemy a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
are going to be able to kill the enemy a
lot<00:01:50.220> easier<00:01:50.399> with<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.850> gun<00:01:51.060> compared<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> any

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
lot easier with this gun compared to any

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.620 
lot easier with this gun compared to any
other<00:01:51.840> SMG<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.009> I'd<00:01:53.250> say<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.880> SMG<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.540> you're

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
other SMG so I'd say this SMG if you're

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.090 
other SMG so I'd say this SMG if you're
going<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.780> pick<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.259> probably<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> most

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
going to pick it is probably the most

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
going to pick it is probably the most
versatile<00:01:56.640> SMG<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.479> pick<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
versatile SMG that you can pick in the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.350 
versatile SMG that you can pick in the
game<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.439> still<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> best<00:01:59.820> SMG<00:02:00.210> in

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
game I still think that the best SMG in

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.990 
game I still think that the best SMG in
the<00:02:00.420> game<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> PDW<00:02:01.020> or<00:02:01.380> MSMC<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> say<00:02:02.790> that

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the game is a PDW or MSMC but I say that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.270 
the game is a PDW or MSMC but I say that
this<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.509> compete<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.350> close<00:02:04.590> number<00:02:04.860> 2<00:02:05.070> or

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
this can compete for a close number 2 or

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.690 
this can compete for a close number 2 or
a<00:02:05.450> really<00:02:06.450> easy<00:02:06.750> number<00:02:07.500> three<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.340> mp7

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
a really easy number three with the mp7

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.059 
a really easy number three with the mp7
so<00:02:09.539> getting<00:02:09.869> into<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> statistics<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.800> this

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
so getting into the statistics of this

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.790 
so getting into the statistics of this
gun<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.910> has<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> clip<00:02:13.080> size<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
gun it has a clip size of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.460 
gun it has a clip size of
30<00:02:14.070> with<00:02:14.700> extended<00:02:15.120> mags<00:02:15.150> has<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.810> clip<00:02:16.080> size<00:02:16.260> of

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
30 with extended mags has a clip size of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.990 
30 with extended mags has a clip size of
40<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.580> damage<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.560> 33<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.460> out<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.670> a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
40 the damage is 33 that is out of a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.430 
40 the damage is 33 that is out of a
potential<00:02:21.750> health<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.580> 100<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.960> damage

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
potential health of 100 and the damage

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.910 
potential health of 100 and the damage
at<00:02:26.810> 9999<00:02:27.810> meters<00:02:28.110> which<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.380> unlimited

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
at 9999 meters which is unlimited

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.900 
at 9999 meters which is unlimited
distance<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.670> 18<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.920> three-shot<00:02:31.920> will<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.490> 0

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
distance is 18 so a three-shot will be 0

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.040 
distance is 18 so a three-shot will be 0
to<00:02:33.000> 20<00:02:33.420> meters<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:35.010> six-shot<00:02:35.790> will<00:02:36.750> be

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
to 20 meters and a six-shot will be

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.020 
to 20 meters and a six-shot will be
anything<00:02:37.670> past<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:39.120> believe<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:40.730> 60<00:02:41.730> meters

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
anything past I believe it's 60 meters

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.510 
anything past I believe it's 60 meters
seventy<00:02:42.540> meters<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.290> gonna<00:02:43.590> be<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.740> six-shot<00:02:44.220> so

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
seventy meters is gonna be a six-shot so

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.780 
seventy meters is gonna be a six-shot so
it<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.510> doesn't<00:02:45.840> have<00:02:46.170> it's<00:02:46.620> obviously<00:02:47.580> if

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
it it doesn't have it's obviously if

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.890 
it it doesn't have it's obviously if
we're<00:02:47.910> going<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.060> be<00:02:48.150> playing<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.510> very<00:02:48.720> long

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
we're going to be playing a very long

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.990 
we're going to be playing a very long
distance<00:02:49.290> game<00:02:49.530> go<00:02:50.400> with<00:02:50.550> an<00:02:50.640> assault<00:02:50.910> rifle

close quarters and you run into those

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.920 
close quarters and you run into those
odd<00:02:55.890> encounters<00:02:56.520> of<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.760> long<00:02:57.150> range<00:02:57.420> this

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
odd encounters of the long range this

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.630 
odd encounters of the long range this
gun<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:59.040> kill<00:02:59.070> them<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.960> won't<00:03:01.160> beat<00:03:02.160> them<00:03:02.430> in

because<00:03:06.030> obviously<00:03:06.270> they<00:03:06.600> are<00:03:06.720> better<00:03:06.990> but<00:03:07.650> at

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
because obviously they are better but at

the same time this won't be an automatic
death<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.640> can<00:03:11.940> somehow<00:03:12.720> compete<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.740> a

the reload time on this gun is 1.96
which<00:03:28.800> is<00:03:28.980> pretty<00:03:29.280> fast<00:03:29.700> for<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.570> gun<00:03:31.080> and

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
which is pretty fast for a gun and

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.620 
which is pretty fast for a gun and
adding<00:03:31.739> fast<00:03:32.040> makes<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.520> this<00:03:32.700> makes<00:03:33.420> it

adding fast makes to this makes it

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.190 
adding fast makes to this makes it
reload<00:03:34.400> crazy<00:03:35.400> fast<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:36.570> are<00:03:36.720> not<00:03:36.930> going<00:03:37.110> to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
with any other SMG is one hundred

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.780 
with any other SMG is one hundred
percent<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:46.380> LMGs<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.190> salt<00:03:47.370> rifles<00:03:47.640> are

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
percent the LMGs and the salt rifles are

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.100 
percent the LMGs and the salt rifles are
under<00:03:48.090> one<00:03:48.180> hundred<00:03:48.390> percent<00:03:48.420> everything<00:03:48.989> is

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
under one hundred percent everything is

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.610 
under one hundred percent everything is
measured<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.920> SMGs<00:03:50.660> anyways<00:03:51.660> what<00:03:52.590> I

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
measured to the SMGs anyways what I

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.820 
measured to the SMGs anyways what I
really<00:03:52.950> like<00:03:53.130> riding<00:03:53.610> on<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:53.820> gun<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.830> the

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
really like riding on this gun is the

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.490 
really like riding on this gun is the
fast<00:03:56.190> mags<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.000> laser<00:03:57.239> sight<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:57.810> really

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
fast mags and the laser sight I really

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.170 
fast mags and the laser sight I really
find<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.920> laser<00:03:59.160> sight<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.580> this<00:03:59.640> gun<00:03:59.910> to

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
find the laser sight in this gun to

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.270 
find the laser sight in this gun to
actually<00:04:00.570> help<00:04:00.690> me<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> lot<00:04:01.290> when<00:04:01.920> I'm<00:04:02.070> in<00:04:02.160> this

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
actually help me a lot when I'm in this

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.550 
actually help me a lot when I'm in this
close-quarter<00:04:02.730> confrontations<00:04:03.510> um<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:04.500> just

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
close-quarter confrontations um I just

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.320 
close-quarter confrontations um I just
like<00:04:04.950> hip<00:04:05.130> firing<00:04:05.340> with<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:05.610> gun<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.940> feel<00:04:06.180> as

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
like hip firing with this gun I feel as

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.920 
like hip firing with this gun I feel as
the<00:04:06.600> hip<00:04:06.989> fire<00:04:07.140> on<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:07.380> gun<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:08.010> spread<00:04:08.400> is

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
the hip fire on this gun the spread is

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.380 
the hip fire on this gun the spread is
really<00:04:09.930> close<00:04:10.550> almost<00:04:11.550> I'm<00:04:11.760> not<00:04:11.910> sure<00:04:12.150> if<00:04:12.300> it's

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
really close almost I'm not sure if it's

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.229 
really close almost I'm not sure if it's
closer<00:04:12.750> than<00:04:12.900> any<00:04:13.500> other<00:04:13.769> SMG<00:04:14.519> but<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.060> just

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
closer than any other SMG but I just

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.000 
closer than any other SMG but I just
find<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.750> can<00:04:15.870> kill<00:04:16.080> people<00:04:16.109> relatively

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
find that I can kill people relatively

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.820 
find that I can kill people relatively
fast<00:04:17.370> whenever<00:04:18.209> I'm<00:04:18.419> hip<00:04:18.720> firing<00:04:18.989> with<00:04:19.320> laser

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
fast whenever I'm hip firing with laser

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.460 
fast whenever I'm hip firing with laser
sight<00:04:20.190> um<00:04:20.400> if<00:04:21.209> you're<00:04:21.720> not<00:04:21.870> going<00:04:22.049> with<00:04:22.140> laser

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
sight um if you're not going with laser

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.830 
sight um if you're not going with laser
sight<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:22.890> say<00:04:23.070> long<00:04:23.310> barrel<00:04:23.669> because<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.660> long

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
sight I say long barrel because the long

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.410 
sight I say long barrel because the long
barrel<00:04:25.140> will<00:04:25.350> increase<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:26.010> distance<00:04:26.220> by<00:04:26.729> 15

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
barrel will increase the distance by 15

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.270 
barrel will increase the distance by 15
sent<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.810> damaged<00:04:28.380> by<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.560> little<00:04:28.800> bit<00:04:28.920> as<00:04:29.040> well

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
sent and damaged by a little bit as well

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.810 
sent and damaged by a little bit as well
and<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:30.510> always<00:04:30.840> love<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.380> long<00:04:31.710> barrel<00:04:31.950> on<00:04:32.280> an

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
and I always love a long barrel on an

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.570 
and I always love a long barrel on an
SMG<00:04:33.180> but<00:04:33.510> with<00:04:33.660> that<00:04:33.870> being<00:04:34.080> said<00:04:34.230> a<00:04:34.770> long

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
SMG but with that being said a long

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.290 
SMG but with that being said a long
distance<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.390> recoilless<00:04:37.350> gun<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:38.300> vertical

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
distance the recoilless gun is vertical

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.300 
distance the recoilless gun is vertical
so<00:04:39.990> when<00:04:40.290> you're<00:04:40.410> shooting<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.710> long<00:04:40.890> distance

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
so when you're shooting a long distance

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.980 
so when you're shooting a long distance
you're<00:04:41.520> gonna<00:04:41.700> have<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.880> burst<00:04:42.180> fire<00:04:42.420> pretty

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
you're gonna have to burst fire pretty

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.730 
you're gonna have to burst fire pretty
hard<00:04:43.350> because<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:44.310> vertical<00:04:44.910> arm<00:04:45.740> recall

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
hard because the vertical arm recall

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.090 
hard because the vertical arm recall
this<00:04:46.890> gun<00:04:47.100> happens<00:04:47.880> a<00:04:48.170> pretty<00:04:49.170> random<00:04:49.710> I'd<00:04:49.860> say

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
this gun happens a pretty random I'd say

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.040 
this gun happens a pretty random I'd say
because<00:04:50.670> you'll<00:04:51.120> start<00:04:51.420> shooting<00:04:51.780> maybe

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
because you'll start shooting maybe

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.200 
because you'll start shooting maybe
three<00:04:52.290> four<00:04:52.590> five<00:04:52.860> bullets<00:04:53.310> maybe<00:04:53.970> in<00:04:54.030> six

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
three four five bullets maybe in six

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.000 
three four five bullets maybe in six
bullets<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:54.720> all<00:04:54.870> sin<00:04:55.170> will<00:04:55.320> start<00:04:55.560> skipping

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
bullets and all sin will start skipping

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.760 
bullets and all sin will start skipping
up<00:04:56.270> relatively<00:04:57.270> fast<00:04:57.810> so<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.440> need<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.680> be

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
up relatively fast so you need to be

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.920 
up relatively fast so you need to be
able<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.010> hold<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.340> recoil<00:04:59.700> pretty<00:05:00.420> well<00:05:00.690> and

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
able to hold the recoil pretty well and

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.680 
able to hold the recoil pretty well and
if<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.470> can<00:05:01.890> do<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.130> burst<00:05:02.880> fire<00:05:03.120> you're

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
if you can do that burst fire you're

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.600 
if you can do that burst fire you're
gonna<00:05:03.780> be<00:05:03.990> really<00:05:04.470> good<00:05:04.800> off<00:05:04.920> with<00:05:05.040> this<00:05:05.160> gun<00:05:05.370> I

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
gonna be really good off with this gun I

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.080 
gonna be really good off with this gun I
say<00:05:06.830> use<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:07.980> gun<00:05:08.160> and<00:05:08.400> maps<00:05:08.610> like<00:05:08.820> this

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
say use this gun and maps like this

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.270 
say use this gun and maps like this
where<00:05:09.750> most<00:05:10.080> of<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.260> time<00:05:10.410> you<00:05:10.650> are<00:05:10.680> in<00:05:11.040> close

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
where most of the time you are in close

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.000 
where most of the time you are in close
range<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:12.080> but<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.290> know<00:05:13.380> what<00:05:13.410> if<00:05:13.680> you<00:05:13.800> do

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
range and but you know what if you do

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.050 
range and but you know what if you do
come<00:05:14.250> into<00:05:14.430> that<00:05:14.550> long<00:05:14.700> rage<00:05:14.880> confrontation

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
come into that long rage confrontation

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.640 
come into that long rage confrontation
you<00:05:15.630> can<00:05:15.750> still<00:05:16.020> win<00:05:16.140> it<00:05:16.230> you<00:05:16.320> can<00:05:16.470> still

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
you can still win it you can still

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.970 
you can still win it you can still
compete<00:05:16.980> and<00:05:17.570> that<00:05:18.570> is<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:19.110> exact<00:05:19.560> reason<00:05:19.680> why

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
compete and that is the exact reason why

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.850 
compete and that is the exact reason why
I<00:05:20.100> think<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.460> Peacekeeper<00:05:20.850> is<00:05:20.970> made<00:05:21.180> and

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
I think the Peacekeeper is made and

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.500 
I think the Peacekeeper is made and
personally<00:05:22.860> I<00:05:23.040> think<00:05:23.580> it's<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:24.000> good<00:05:24.120> gun<00:05:24.300> I

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
personally I think it's a good gun I

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.030 
personally I think it's a good gun I
like<00:05:24.840> using<00:05:25.020> it<00:05:25.260> i'll<00:05:25.440> be<00:05:25.590> using<00:05:25.740> it<00:05:25.920> off

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
like using it i'll be using it off

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.280 
like using it i'll be using it off
pretty<00:05:26.340> often<00:05:26.640> I<00:05:26.970> think<00:05:27.720> it'll<00:05:27.810> be<00:05:27.900> one<00:05:28.110> of<00:05:28.200> my

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
pretty often I think it'll be one of my

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.130 
pretty often I think it'll be one of my
top<00:05:28.800> five<00:05:29.250> weapons<00:05:29.760> in<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:29.970> game<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.270> use<00:05:30.510> just

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
top five weapons in the game to use just
