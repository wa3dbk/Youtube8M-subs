in my head as are Antonin since I was
like<00:04:02.200> 10<00:04:02.530> so<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.640> knew<00:04:04.330> exactly<00:04:04.450> what<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:04.989> do

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
like 10 so I knew exactly what to do

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.390 
like 10 so I knew exactly what to do
what<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.290> would<00:04:05.560> do<00:04:05.709> if<00:04:05.860> I<00:04:05.950> got<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.190> opportunity

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
what I would do if I got the opportunity

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.420 
what I would do if I got the opportunity
and<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.090> just<00:04:07.120> never<00:04:07.450> took<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.870> as<00:04:07.989> a<00:04:08.019> fan<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.709> so

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
and I just never took it as a fan and so

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.650 
and I just never took it as a fan and so
now<00:04:09.579> I'm<00:04:09.640> taking<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.180> all<00:04:10.299> the<00:04:10.329> way<00:04:10.420> forward

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
now I'm taking it all the way forward

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.750 
now I'm taking it all the way forward
guys<00:04:10.900> end<00:04:11.230> up<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.829> it's<00:04:12.069> sort<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.370> default<00:04:12.579> all
