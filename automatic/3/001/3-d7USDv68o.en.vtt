00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Not just young people who talk about the future 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Playing in the new world with a melody that resonates in my heart 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.000
 Flower of reverence Blooms in the heart blooming here And sow seeds 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Flower named the hope named Around the World 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000

 The chapped chrysanthemum scent is also clean and clearly remembered

 Embarrassment of pure nature nature This pinched friendship power Pinch overcoming 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 I am griefing goodbye as a blue spring runaway with my feet 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Nobody knows what tomorrow is, so Every time Try and Error 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Believe that the path you chose is not wrong Let's walk together 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Morning clouds flow A clear journey or a long beginning of the day 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 I bathed in the morning sun on the body I swear I'm different from me until yesterday 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 I will stand in the school building today also today's octagonal tower 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 I remember I appreciate what I learned here. I met you 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.500
 If we spend while accumulating unshakable power, we will surely advance some day High ideal 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.000
