00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
probably my most popular video that's

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.710 
probably my most popular video that's
really<00:02:50.220> easy<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.910> tell<00:02:51.120> it's<00:02:51.329> got<00:02:51.450> twelve

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
really easy to tell it's got twelve

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.410

thousand<00:02:52.079> views<00:02:52.349> almost<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.549> thousand<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.329> one

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
thousand views almost a thousand and one

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.949 
thousand views almost a thousand and one
hundred<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.590> then<00:02:56.099> I<00:02:56.489> guess<00:02:56.970> Borderlands<00:02:57.690> 2

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
hundred and then I guess Borderlands 2

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.199 
hundred and then I guess Borderlands 2

basically<00:03:33.470> allow<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.530> basically<00:03:35.250> allows

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
basically allow that basically allows

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.720 
basically allow that basically allows
you<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.030> test<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.139> out<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:38.130> what<00:03:38.340> I'm<00:03:38.459> going<00:03:38.639> to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
you to test it out so what I'm going to

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.150 
you to test it out so what I'm going to
do<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.120> open<00:03:39.389> up<00:03:39.569> google<00:03:40.049> chrome<00:03:40.290> like<00:03:40.889> this

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
do is open up google chrome like this

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.530 
do is open up google chrome like this
and<00:03:42.590> this<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.829> actually<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> desktop<00:03:44.609> icon<00:03:45.239> so

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
and this is actually a desktop icon so

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.180 
and this is actually a desktop icon so
I'm<00:03:45.690> able<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.349> use<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.859> end

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
I'm able to use the end

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.010 
I'm able to use the end
it<00:03:47.250> on<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:47.670> desktop<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.150> like<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.480> better<00:03:48.660> for

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
it on the desktop I like that better for

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.020 
it on the desktop I like that better for
downloading<00:03:49.590> stuff<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:50.100> don't<00:03:50.640> know<00:03:50.730> why<00:03:50.880> I'm

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
downloading stuff I don't know why I'm

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.750 
downloading stuff I don't know why I'm
picky<00:03:51.360> but<00:03:52.010> all<00:03:53.010> you're<00:03:53.280> going<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.460> want<00:03:53.550> to<00:03:53.610> do

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
picky but all you're going to want to do

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.210 
picky but all you're going to want to do
is<00:03:53.910> search<00:03:54.120> WM<00:03:54.840> where<00:03:56.930> workstation<00:03:57.930> 9<00:03:58.530> and

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
is search WM where workstation 9 and

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.430 
is search WM where workstation 9 and
you're<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.270> going<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.450> want<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.720> go<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.930> their

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
you're just going to want to go to their

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.070 
you're just going to want to go to their
website<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:04.700> basically<00:04:05.700> download<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.810> it's

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
website and basically download it it's

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.340 
website and basically download it it's
it's<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.860> virtualization<00:04:08.820> machine<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:10.020> it

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
it's a virtualization machine so it

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.650 
it's a virtualization machine so it
allows<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.160> make<00:04:11.370> basically<00:04:12.000> fake<00:04:12.330> hard

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
allows you to make basically fake hard

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.950 
allows you to make basically fake hard
drives<00:04:12.960> and<00:04:13.490> that<00:04:14.490> is<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.240> only<00:04:15.330> part<00:04:15.600> i'm<00:04:15.810> not

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
drives and that is the only part i'm not

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.270 
drives and that is the only part i'm not
going<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.200> make<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.320> video<00:04:16.530> about<00:04:16.739> how<00:04:16.980> to<00:04:17.040> do<00:04:17.160> it

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
going to make a video about how to do it

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.520 
going to make a video about how to do it
mostly<00:04:17.640> because<00:04:17.820> i<00:04:17.940> don't<00:04:18.180> want<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.450> launch<00:04:19.170> a

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
mostly because i don't want to launch a

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.690 
mostly because i don't want to launch a
windows<00:04:20.220> 8<00:04:20.430> on<00:04:20.640> my<00:04:20.970> windows<00:04:21.330> 8<00:04:21.540> but<00:04:22.700> it's

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
windows 8 on my windows 8 but it's

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.000 
windows 8 on my windows 8 but it's
really<00:04:24.060> easy<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.300> do<00:04:24.510> just<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:25.050> lot<00:04:25.260> maybe<00:04:25.620> 30

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
really easy to do just a lot maybe 30

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.820 
really easy to do just a lot maybe 30
gigabytes<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.850> thing<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.810> just<00:04:28.110> runs

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
gigabytes to the thing and it just runs

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.780 
gigabytes to the thing and it just runs
and<00:04:29.070> then<00:04:29.160> if<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.370> delete<00:04:29.670> the

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
and then if you delete the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.410 
and then if you delete the
virtualization<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:31.050> 30<00:04:31.260> gigabytes<00:04:31.650> are

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
virtualization the 30 gigabytes are

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.530 
virtualization the 30 gigabytes are
restored<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.930> your<00:04:34.260> hard<00:04:34.980> drive<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:36.120> then<00:04:36.510> all

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
restored to your hard drive so then all

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.180 
restored to your hard drive so then all
you're<00:04:36.870> going<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.050> want<00:04:37.170> to<00:04:37.230> do<00:04:37.380> is<00:04:37.590> go<00:04:37.890> into

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
you're going to want to do is go into

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.010 
you're going to want to do is go into
your<00:04:39.090> drop<00:04:39.990> into<00:04:40.740> my<00:04:40.920> dropbox<00:04:41.190> i<00:04:41.610> guess<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.120> i

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
your drop into my dropbox i guess and i

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.100 
your drop into my dropbox i guess and i
have<00:04:43.170> uploaded<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.860> file<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.550> i<00:04:44.580> have<00:04:44.820> started

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
have uploaded a file that i have started

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.590 
have uploaded a file that i have started

windows 8 pro en-us x 86 meaning it's a

32 bit operating system for some reason

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.159 
32 bit operating system for some reason
64-bit<00:04:56.940> kind<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.360> screwed<00:04:57.600> up<00:04:57.780> on<00:04:57.990> certain

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
64-bit kind of screwed up on certain

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.320 
64-bit kind of screwed up on certain
computers<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:58.950> i<00:04:59.190> played<00:04:59.490> it<00:04:59.640> safe<00:04:59.850> just<00:05:00.120> went

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
computers so i played it safe just went

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.270 
computers so i played it safe just went
with<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:00.510> 32<00:05:00.990> bit<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.410> it<00:05:01.800> is<00:05:01.830> running

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
with the 32 bit and it is running

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.510 
with the 32 bit and it is running
perfectly<00:05:02.760> smoothly<00:05:03.200> so<00:05:04.200> I<00:05:04.230> i<00:05:04.980> would<00:05:05.340> just

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
perfectly smoothly so I i would just

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.159 
perfectly smoothly so I i would just
download<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.390> and<00:05:06.630> i<00:05:06.720> will<00:05:06.960> leave<00:05:07.140> a

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
download that and i will leave a

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.050 
download that and i will leave a
download<00:05:07.770> link<00:05:07.800> in<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.340> description<00:05:08.910> and

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
download link in the description and

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.450 
download link in the description and
then<00:05:09.900> you're<00:05:10.140> just<00:05:10.169> going<00:05:10.470> to<00:05:10.560> mount<00:05:10.830> that<00:05:10.950> to

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
then you're just going to mount that to

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.790 
then you're just going to mount that to
your<00:05:11.790> virtual<00:05:12.150> machine<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:12.870> it'll<00:05:13.470> run<00:05:13.710> the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
your virtual machine and it'll run the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.220 
your virtual machine and it'll run the
installer<00:05:14.160> and<00:05:14.430> basically<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.360> will<00:05:15.810> save<00:05:16.110> all

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
installer and basically it will save all

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.620 
installer and basically it will save all
your<00:05:16.290> progress<00:05:16.740> so<00:05:17.040> you<00:05:17.520> can<00:05:17.730> run<00:05:17.940> windows<00:05:18.180> 7

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
your progress so you can run windows 7

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.750 
your progress so you can run windows 7
and<00:05:18.750> windows<00:05:18.840> at<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:19.350> same<00:05:19.590> time<00:05:19.770> personally

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
and windows at the same time personally

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.150 
and windows at the same time personally
I<00:05:20.940> partition<00:05:21.930> my<00:05:22.110> hard<00:05:22.140> drive<00:05:22.560> oh<00:05:22.710> why<00:05:22.950> did<00:05:23.100> I

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
I partition my hard drive oh why did I

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.909 
I partition my hard drive oh why did I
do<00:05:23.220> that<00:05:23.600> partition<00:05:24.600> my<00:05:24.750> hard<00:05:24.780> drive<00:05:25.290> so<00:05:25.890> that

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
do that partition my hard drive so that

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.100 
do that partition my hard drive so that
