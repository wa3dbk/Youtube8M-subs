00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.230

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.379
 possess the skills we need 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.719
 So we want you to get the idea 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.489

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.600
 task it is to chase the funds evil 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:04.399
 see the before the latest court 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:06.500
 want to earn money 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.020
 law enforcement officers died 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.259
 for some souls hide under 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.950
 the living between which eyes should 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.950
 I bayern what you 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.460
 what she is never more like you and 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.189
 you also do not listen to them that way anymore and 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.390
 Now they are looking forward to the 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.390
 chinese what is with them 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.720
 they wanted to win 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.549
 Are you always ready to be healthy? 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.950
 Good day we suspect that you 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.720
 maybe you can be dead 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.190
 Putin is a gift in itself 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.190
 I will follow me 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.570
 two blocks remain 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.749
 As you can see we can do a whole 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:02:00.430
 I still have a lot of stuff 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:02.870
 never seen before 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.420
 as the dead win does that for the 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.040
 live because we have the wrong way 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.050
 chosen to defend himself 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.520
 this world is for the living and the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.520
 will make sure it stays that way 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.280
 Yes 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:32.210
 only started while the world was not 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.210
 goes down fun or stay relaxed 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.470
 apd goes 96 minutes twelve years 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.290
 released and runs yesterday the 29th 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.180
 august 2013 in german cinemas 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.880
 tells the story of Nick Walker 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.440
 actually create the right a head 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.300
 is happy with his friends 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.560
 an insert to a certain prey 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.720
 come and try with his partner 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.100
 played by kevin bacon the whole 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.050
 somehow to bring around the corner 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.580
 and make money out of it 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.140
 but then the bad cons is plaguing 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.510
 and the question what will be his partner 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.890
 say he is dead he or he is 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.080
 drive city into the sky and there 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.420
 SPD creates a really great sequence 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.300
 Build a new one for them 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.940
 police department the apb the rest in 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.100
 Peace department of a kind and skull 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.900
 because others are trying on the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.400
 to hunt earth like monsters 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.050
 if you like your human skin 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.340
 first burst open and then 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.750
 at the latest at the point monument 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.730
 somehow everything has something of men in it 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.200
 black also comedic science fiction 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.660
 technically packed the whole is though 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.430
 not so cool if I'm honest apd 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.870
 create or manage it 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.490
 over the whole film length not so 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.290
 really funny to defend that he pro 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.390
 man ryan reynolds on where to jeff 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.250
 bridges and kevin bacon is the movie 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.380
 absolutely predictable in any moment 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.030
 somehow really coal man misses 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.130
 already the very old men in black time 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.270
 and says that was funny at the time 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.620
 and it's hard to make a difference 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.380
 understand but the whole is one 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.209
 pure cgi 3d year right through the 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.860
 city â€‹â€‹at the beginning 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.390
 knows what will happen in the end and short 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.160
 moment for any is really 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.810
 Surprise will be there are small 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.120
 funny sequences like when ryan reynolds 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.920
 and jeff bridges in front of the camera 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.360
 and in reality for mortals 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.950
 but look like an old chinese and 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.540
 a sexy blonde that is quite 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.820
 funny moments but at the latest when 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.380
 you apply it the tenth time , too 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.030
 have no irritating factor anymore and that 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.590
 make a film out of the strip for me 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.780
 at the movie trailer thought okay 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.940
 cool boss will be kevin bacon 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.680
 and Ryan Reynolds and I at the end of the 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.240
 cinema totally disappointed and the movie 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.740
 would not recommend anything at all 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.590
 I'm almost sorry because actually 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.960
 like that crazy genre crossover though 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.720
 this is unfortunately nothing and that is 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.730
 that ap's comedy by me as a fantasy 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.890
 about the really little laugh can still 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.600
 even if some effects really 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.610
 four out of ten are great 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.080
 get points 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.060
 the 3d no obligation here if the company 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.439
 2g should do that for that 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.599
 I do not necessarily pay extra 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:51.060
 Overall , the film is relatively disappointing 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:53.219
 from only 3 of beer only three out of ten 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.979
 possible points and then won the 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.240
 it was from me with marijo c ap who will 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.620
 not interested in what he got to the film 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.000
 says you have already seen cinema if so 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.379
 likes to write in the comments if it 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Maybe you felt the same 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.530
 can you better than me in words 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.060
 what is your opinion about exactly 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.289
 has lain or if her good was something 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.610
 Did you think that would be me? 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.789
 otherwise, as was said , interesting 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.919
 So now it is this which the ap 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.120
 terrain a thumb there we this 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.919
 let it stay if not 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.870
 looks like my last cinema critiques 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.279
 over or on twitter and facebook only 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.349
 want to write a bit about movies 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:24.090
 or my two-channel if you do not have one 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.279
 want to miss videos of and with me 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.379
 let it stay if it does 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:30.240
 only decides about tomorrow at 15 o'clock 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:32.340
 there is a new video here at the latest 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.129
 and then I hope here since tomorrow 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.129
 again, of course, on 3
