00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.259
 today's 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.129
 should not have no name or surname 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.800
 ni dni 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:12.530
 my mother who gave birth to him why 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.690
 all right 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.560
 it is not that I doubt that it will end the 5 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.030
 ironmans but the doubt is already if I go to 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.570
 finish today 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.820
 because I had not done a swim but 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.820
 especially a bike captures 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.970
 in my fucking life 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.090
 d 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.510
 in my fucking life the day has begun to 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.030
 distorted 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.670
 because last night after 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.190
 finish very late and have the time just 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.219
 to dine some macaroni drink a little 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.050
 of water we said we're going to drink the 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.050
 most expensive bottle of wine that we find 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.690
 after those crazy with the cream 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.270
 recuperator to bag to cool as 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.270
 we could stretch in the same goal 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.760
 put we were lucky that in the hotel 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.350
 there was pool first legs in the 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.350
 frozen pool 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.440
 in the bathtub because very very very hot and 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.780
 after this basically trying 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.149
 sleep and rest a little for today 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.610
 as it was early morning 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.070
 we stayed on Saturdays and this morning we have 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.170
 started at 9 to give it a little more 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.020
 late or maybe a little later 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.150
 and the water had currents that 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.130
 finite then when the current was going 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.680
 in favor very well but when I was going to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.659
 find a disaster and it did not compensate 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.560
 one thing with the other and out of the water 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.869
 The first port flies as its way 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.049
 We have been ten kilometers to climb 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.649
 climb up and there what has happened is 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.439
 I've crossed myself and I've become serious 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.950
 now the word was spoken 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.319
 for borja mercedes was so crossed not 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.420
 by whim but because seen what is 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.030
 I came over because in the profile in 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.590
 its state marked as the small port 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:21.340
 I have seen that the ischia that had already 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.709
 suffered a lot in the titan they started 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.379
 to stretch and stretch instead of loading 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.180
 to stretch and that the thing was going to be very 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.760
 very very very hard 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.859
 and what has happened since the courage 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.180
 rebel not rebel against the team of 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.519
 gordon and against the people that I 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.859
 existed but rebel against me 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:43.180
 has come up has gotten quiet 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:47.560
 for inside he has stared towards 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.310
 the goal and throw me to the first 40 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.799
 kilometers is more than two hours 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.829
 Climbing as he could without drinking without eating 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.139
 nothing they say to speak with existence as 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.419
 thinking that if I did nothing I would advance 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:05.079
 kilometers faster the truth is that 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:07.750
 It has been a day of ghosts of demons and 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.750
 It has been the fucking day two like the fucking day 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.079
 2 of the ultraman of Welsh where we 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.109
 we lost like the fucking day 2 the ultraman 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.629
 from hawaii where I street three times where 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.569
 sorry where I click three times where I 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.060
 I fell where the brake broke and where I 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.090
 I lost where I arrived with rotten feet 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.939
 like the fucking day 2 of costa rica where 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.260
 he was so chastened that the veneers 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.230
 I was made 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.090
 long long long long long 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.819
 and like the fucking day 2 of madrid lisboa 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.460
 where when we took 40 hours is 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.970
 say the first day 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.620
 16 hours on day 2 because I fell and 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.130
 they had to come to rescue me the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.190
 career went to fuck then 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.360
 I think bringing this in my head 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.860
 has been able to carry then 2002 and peak 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.620
 kilometers that we have made of unevenness 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.620
 as in the ironman of lanzarote has 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.410
 could the legs the truth is that in 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.000
 my right leg has shattered the 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.800
 twin in the left leg of the ischium 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.170
 so without saying anything and without speaking 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.170
 gone throwing until suddenly 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.389
 and I already leave march of this level 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.190
 because I had too much work in the bread 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.979
 and they told me to put the 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.930
 headphones because like that if in some 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.970
 moment we got lost they would call me 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.220
 I would listen to the call and I could 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.150
 answer did not have the strength to put 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.870
 music and has been pulling pulling pulling 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:53.349
 and despairing me until suddenly 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.240
 we have planted at kilometer 130 and 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:59.169
 there the slopes have finished the 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.620
 second port was to cry and a 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.050
 athletic triathlon club guy and we 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.500
 we have laughed for the first time 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.599
 in the day I have been gone gone living 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.319
 but I've been seeing that it was very very very 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:17.830
 just force when I get your mouse and 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:21.280
 I did not know what or how he called me 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.800
 It seems he had a fever but hey, nothing 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.620
 to be there a little lying down and eat 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.569
 we have also taken advantage of that as in the 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.240
 where we were we could not 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.310
 stay to run there because when 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.410
 it was done at night was there there was not even 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.080
 you do not bear anything, so we've grown the 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.289
 car we have come to see and now 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.370
 the marathon I'm doing here nothing 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:49.840
 I've been 15 km holding the pace at 5 35 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.880
 40 and the only good thing is that it seems that what 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.949
 that was punishing the ischium at 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.310
 run instead of mother to become more 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:59.410
 battered because I'm recovering well 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.630
 that is all I have left of 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.830
 Hope to think that what I'm going to do 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08.710
 Now instead of fucking, it's more going away 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.610
 to go doing at night and going to go 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.259
 improving if today there are only three days left 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.960
 where the bike has a steep slope 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.000
 minor and if then there is the luck that the 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.410
 body holds well 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.690
 the marathons will be able and if not not 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.960
 we will know that half is like this very 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.960
 worthily 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:36.010
 like the half marathon and this thing 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.190
 is fucked and goes for long 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:41.590
 we leave the video and if you want to know 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.610
 how the twitter.com thing evolves 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:48.010
 gordon without facebook.com gordon without e 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.430
 dotcom instagram for gordon without there 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:55.030
 We will have odei computed surplus 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:57.470
 of the mercy already borja updating thus 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.430
 I'm still here 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.430
 and we are reporting
