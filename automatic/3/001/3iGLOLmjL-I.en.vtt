00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.790
 well let's center the part of 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.620
 usability as one of the references 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.960
 of the axis in the experience part of 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.910
 user as you can see the phone is 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.880
 You can unlock from anywhere 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.830
 from the screen you can easily access a 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.940
 drop-down menu where you have numerous 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.480
 fully editable shortcuts 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.920
 and with notification information 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.570
 I am continually struck by the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.760
 function that is light with this function 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.560
 you can use so many videos internet note 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.250
 calculating calendar and what it is that 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:48.430
 I show you, you select a video 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.540
 the reproduces controls its transparency 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.720
 how can you 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.730
 observe and you are able to continue using the 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.800
 telephone in a normal manner while 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.240
 playback of the video follows that is 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.010
 you can access the internet to make a 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.870
 search while you keep seeing it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.390
 and your movies can also pass the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.850
 full screen screen as you are 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.770
 watching closely to highlight another function 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.360
 in the quick function we see the function 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.189
 which you can play the same can 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.460
 activate both the access bar 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.810
 fast that would be here or with an access 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.360
 fast that is pressing the volume 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.670
 up and down simultaneously with this 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.440
 with this application that is what it does 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.140
 allows you to take notes about the capture 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.030
 of screens that you have either blank 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.080
 or keeping what you have this is very 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.060
 practical for example in case of 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.800
 googlemaps if you want to send a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.110
 information and share it in this case 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.740
 Well, we can share a number of 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.990
 phone with whom we want to either 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.780
 through some facebook application 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.170
 whatsapp so whatever but not 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.360
 only that allows you to activate the overlay 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.920
 what is multi-layer operation is 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.190
 say I keep the information that I have 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.590
 written and I am able to continue using the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.840
 phone that allows you to access the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.390
 phone and dial the number that 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.180
 previously you have been told 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.069
 the call is very practical for cases 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.470
 like this then another feature to highlight 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.200
 are the icons the icons are totally 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.209
 customizable for example if 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.090
 we select we are activated and a 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.830
 brush we select it and we are capable 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.350
 to change the icon for any other 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.440
 of the predefined ones of that letter such or 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.300
 Go to your gallery and select a photo 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.890
 is the example we have here that is 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.080
 select a photo that I had 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.330
 disputed provision other functionality 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.040
 highlight is perhaps to look connectivity 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.320
 through wifi direct as you see what 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.540
 I have on the phone I play it in the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.500
 screen without problem this allows you 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.500
 to access 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.980
 to the videos 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.670
 and play on the screen in what 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.870
 you are seeing in what you bet the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.849
 playback on the phone but not 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.560
 only this not just a simple 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.980
 player but you can also activate 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.290
 The dual play dual screen function with the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.730
 that allows you to leave in playback 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.640
 of the video that you were on the screen and 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.010
 keep using the phone so 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.680
 normal and agree to do the luxury that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.680
 you want with regard to the camera we have 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.290
 numerous functionalities the best the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.359
 most notable is the time capsule that 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.489
 easily activated from this icon and with 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.879
 what makes you are a series of shots 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.590
 to the past is to say they take the picture and you 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.700
 has taken photos since 2 seconds before 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.299
 so you have not lost 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.819
 the moment and this is not all but they are the 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.909
 keep and maybe the most functionalities 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.409
 remarkable from our optimus that the 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.409
 The world's first film phone
