00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
hey guys wanted to share something with

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.010 
hey guys wanted to share something with
you<00:00:05.069> real<00:00:05.250> quick<00:00:05.460> about<00:00:05.790> matching<00:00:06.600> subwoofers

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
you real quick about matching subwoofers

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.020 
you real quick about matching subwoofers
and<00:00:07.319> amplifiers<00:00:07.649> so<00:00:08.370> now<00:00:08.490> I'm<00:00:08.639> sorry<00:00:08.879> I<00:00:08.940> don't

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
and amplifiers so now I'm sorry I don't

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.180 
and amplifiers so now I'm sorry I don't
have<00:00:09.180> screen<00:00:09.540> capture<00:00:09.900> on<00:00:09.930> my<00:00:10.020> laptop<00:00:10.260> but<00:00:11.160> I

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
have screen capture on my laptop but I

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.310 
have screen capture on my laptop but I
figured<00:00:11.520> this<00:00:11.549> would<00:00:11.820> be<00:00:11.879> a<00:00:12.570> little<00:00:13.049> bit<00:00:13.170> more

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
figured this would be a little bit more

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.019 
figured this would be a little bit more
interesting<00:00:13.770> than<00:00:13.980> watching<00:00:14.160> my<00:00:14.549> face<00:00:14.789> while

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:15.029 
interesting than watching my face while

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.560 
interesting than watching my face while
I<00:00:15.059> talk

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
I talk

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.310 
I talk
so<00:00:15.719> anyways<00:00:17.090> matching<00:00:18.090> subwoofers<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.929> amps

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
so anyways matching subwoofers and amps

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.429 
so anyways matching subwoofers and amps
now<00:00:19.500> right<00:00:19.650> now<00:00:19.800> I'm<00:00:19.919> looking<00:00:20.070> at<00:00:20.339> buying

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
now right now I'm looking at buying

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.320 
now right now I'm looking at buying
subwoofers<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:23.009> an<00:00:23.699> amp<00:00:23.849> right<00:00:24.029> now<00:00:24.150> for

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
subwoofers and an amp right now for

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.630 
subwoofers and an amp right now for
myself<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.499> that's<00:00:25.679> why<00:00:25.919> this<00:00:25.980> got<00:00:26.369> brought

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
myself so that's why this got brought

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.560 
myself so that's why this got brought
back<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:27.089> now<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:28.019> reason<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:29.359> bring<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.419> up

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
back up now the reason I bring this up

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.610 
back up now the reason I bring this up
because<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> lot<00:00:31.409> of<00:00:31.439> people<00:00:31.829> don't<00:00:31.980> know<00:00:32.279> that

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
because a lot of people don't know that

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.510 
because a lot of people don't know that
what<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> look<00:00:34.830> for<00:00:35.040> when<00:00:35.160> you're<00:00:35.310> matching

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
what to look for when you're matching

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.420 
what to look for when you're matching
them<00:00:35.790> together<00:00:35.970> so<00:00:36.620> basically<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.250> can

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
them together so basically you can

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.400 
them together so basically you can
either<00:00:38.580> find<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.060> subdue<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> want<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.990> then

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
either find the subdue you want and then

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.690 
either find the subdue you want and then
match<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.340> amp<00:00:41.520> or<00:00:41.730> vice<00:00:41.940> versa

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
match it with the amp or vice versa

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.520 
match it with the amp or vice versa
usually<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:44.880> finding<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.960> amp<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.410> your

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
usually I think finding the amp in your

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.490 
usually I think finding the amp in your
price<00:00:46.770> range<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.490> then<00:00:48.450> matching<00:00:48.720> subs<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.410> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
price range and then matching subs to it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.720 
price range and then matching subs to it
is<00:00:49.620> much<00:00:49.920> easier<00:00:50.240> now<00:00:51.240> it's<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.430> up<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.580> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is much easier now it's all up to you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.810 
is much easier now it's all up to you
depending<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.300> how<00:00:54.450> much<00:00:54.600> money<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.990> have<00:00:55.080> and

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
depending on how much money you have and

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.060 
depending on how much money you have and
what<00:00:56.820> you're<00:00:56.970> willing<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.270> spend<00:00:57.420> now<00:00:58.350> right

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
what you're willing to spend now right

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.800 
what you're willing to spend now right
now<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.220> just<00:00:59.400> said<00:00:59.760> there's<00:01:00.090> no<00:01:00.240> budget<00:01:00.660> for

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
now I just said there's no budget for

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.359 
now I just said there's no budget for
what<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.260> want<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.130> I<00:01:03.030> mean<00:01:03.690> under<00:01:04.019> $250<00:01:05.009> but<00:01:05.250> I'm

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
what I want so I mean under $250 but I'm

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.510 
what I want so I mean under $250 but I'm
still<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.820> gonna<00:01:06.799> try<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.829> see<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.280> comes

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
still just gonna try to see what comes

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.209 
still just gonna try to see what comes
so<00:01:09.119> um<00:01:10.429> basically<00:01:11.429> I<00:01:12.060> decided<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.259> want<00:01:13.979> around

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
so um basically I decided I want around

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:20.599 
so um basically I decided I want around
500<00:01:14.969> watts<00:01:15.890> oops<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.219> not<00:01:17.399> it<00:01:19.460> that's<00:01:20.460> not

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
500 watts oops that's not it that's not

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.090 
500 watts oops that's not it that's not
it<00:01:20.729> either

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
it either

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.279 
it either
there<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.399> is<00:01:23.579> okay<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.450> basically<00:01:24.840> decided

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
there it is okay so I basically decided

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.599 
there it is okay so I basically decided
I<00:01:25.679> want<00:01:25.859> about<00:01:26.039> 500<00:01:26.579> watt<00:01:26.759> RMS<00:01:27.240> at<00:01:27.630> 2<00:01:28.200> ohm<00:01:28.609> if

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
I want about 500 watt RMS at 2 ohm if

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:31.459 
I want about 500 watt RMS at 2 ohm if
you<00:01:29.729> don't<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:29.969> about<00:01:30.090> ohm<00:01:30.420> ratings

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
you don't know about ohm ratings

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.469 
you don't know about ohm ratings
maybe<00:01:31.979> I'll<00:01:32.159> bust<00:01:32.310> up<00:01:32.490> another<00:01:32.729> video<00:01:33.090> just

RMS at 2 ohms now people ask you know
should<00:02:08.769> I<00:02:08.860> run<00:02:09.039> at<00:02:09.160> 1<00:02:09.310> ohm<00:02:09.489> because<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:09.940> gives

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
should I run at 1 ohm because that gives

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.259 
should I run at 1 ohm because that gives

say<00:02:13.480> run<00:02:13.720> at<00:02:13.870> 2<00:02:14.019> ohms<00:02:14.260> some<00:02:14.650> people<00:02:14.920> say<00:02:15.099> 4<00:02:15.430> ohms

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
say run at 2 ohms some people say 4 ohms

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.350 
say run at 2 ohms some people say 4 ohms
gives<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.049> a<00:02:17.110> little<00:02:17.349> bit<00:02:17.530> better<00:02:18.010> sound<00:02:18.640> in

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
gives you a little bit better sound in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.509 
gives you a little bit better sound in
my<00:02:19.540> experience<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.379> run<00:02:20.860> with<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.129> 2<00:02:21.310> ohms

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
my experience just run with the 2 ohms

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.729 
my experience just run with the 2 ohms
it's<00:02:21.819> easiest<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.269> match<00:02:22.569> easiest<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.560> wire

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
it's easiest to match easiest to wire

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.270 
it's easiest to match easiest to wire
and<00:02:24.099> in<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.360> end<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.780> day<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.950> should<00:02:27.010> be

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
around this wattage and and went down

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.170 
around this wattage and and went down
until<00:03:05.169> I<00:03:05.230> found<00:03:05.380> something<00:03:05.889> that<00:03:06.099> said<00:03:06.940> join

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
until I found something that said join

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.319 
until I found something that said join
your<00:03:07.329> 50<00:03:07.630> watts<00:03:07.840> now<00:03:08.200> if<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.099> notice<00:03:09.489> my<00:03:10.030> amp

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
your 50 watts now if you notice my amp

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.140 
your 50 watts now if you notice my amp
is<00:03:10.989> 500<00:03:11.650> watts<00:03:11.799> at<00:03:12.010> 2<00:03:12.160> ohms<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:13.079> this<00:03:14.079> sub<00:03:14.410> is

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
is 500 watts at 2 ohms and this sub is

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.530 
is 500 watts at 2 ohms and this sub is
250<00:03:16.150> watts<00:03:16.329> so<00:03:17.519> basically<00:03:18.519> I<00:03:18.639> said<00:03:19.030> well<00:03:19.269> what

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
250 watts so basically I said well what

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.390 
250 watts so basically I said well what
the<00:03:19.630> heck<00:03:19.780> I'll<00:03:19.930> I'll<00:03:20.260> get<00:03:20.380> 2<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.620> them<00:03:20.859> so<00:03:21.370> I

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
the heck I'll I'll get 2 of them so I

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.360 
the heck I'll I'll get 2 of them so I
joined<00:03:21.609> your<00:03:21.669> 50<00:03:21.970> plus<00:03:22.120> 250<00:03:22.599> equals<00:03:23.019> 500<00:03:23.620> now

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
joined your 50 plus 250 equals 500 now

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.770 
joined your 50 plus 250 equals 500 now
in<00:03:24.910> my<00:03:25.120> experience<00:03:25.239> I<00:03:25.959> prefer<00:03:26.769> to<00:03:26.980> match<00:03:27.630> 1<00:03:28.630> to

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
in my experience I prefer to match 1 to

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.520 
in my experience I prefer to match 1 to
1<00:03:28.959> ratio

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
1 ratio

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.759 
1 ratio
watts<00:03:30.400> RMS<00:03:30.970> for<00:03:31.329> subs<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.959> watts<00:03:32.109> RMS<00:03:32.590> for

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
watts RMS for subs and watts RMS for

watts RMS for subs and watts RMS for
amplifiers<00:03:33.280> other<00:03:33.609> people<00:03:33.970> might<00:03:34.120> tell<00:03:34.299> you

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
amplifiers other people might tell you

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.809 
amplifiers other people might tell you
differently<00:03:34.780> but<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:35.859> far<00:03:36.040> I've<00:03:36.220> yet<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.489> blow

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
differently but so far I've yet to blow

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.120 
differently but so far I've yet to blow
a<00:03:37.090> sub<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.780> I've<00:03:38.200> been<00:03:38.410> running<00:03:38.560> in<00:03:38.829> pretty

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
a sub and I've been running in pretty

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.900 
a sub and I've been running in pretty
high<00:03:39.370> wattage

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.580 

so<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.150> think<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.840> way<00:03:46.930> I've<00:03:47.050> been<00:03:47.080> doing<00:03:47.230> it's

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
so I think the way I've been doing it's

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.470 
so I think the way I've been doing it's
been<00:03:47.769> okay<00:03:48.330> now<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:51.220> thing<00:03:51.459> is<00:03:51.700> if<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.030> were

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
been okay now the thing is if you were

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.960 
been okay now the thing is if you were
to<00:03:52.540> get<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.410> amp<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.430> was<00:03:54.550> talking<00:03:54.879> about

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
to get the amp that I was talking about

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.600 
to get the amp that I was talking about
and<00:03:55.390> go<00:03:55.870> ahead<00:03:56.050> and<00:03:56.230> get<00:03:56.410> these<00:03:56.590> subs<00:03:56.920> be

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
and go ahead and get these subs be

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.770 
and go ahead and get these subs be
careful<00:03:58.120> if<00:03:58.239> you<00:03:58.390> buy<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:59.940> dual<00:04:00.940> voice<00:04:01.150> coil<00:04:01.540> or

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
careful if you buy a dual voice coil or

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.009 
careful if you buy a dual voice coil or
single<00:04:02.140> voice<00:04:02.230> coil<00:04:02.910> also<00:04:03.910> be<00:04:04.569> careful<00:04:04.959> if

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
single voice coil also be careful if

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.170 
single voice coil also be careful if
you're<00:04:05.170> buying<00:04:05.349> a<00:04:05.560> 2<00:04:05.769> ohm<00:04:06.010> forum<00:04:06.549> or<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.940> tone

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
you're buying a 2 ohm forum or a tone

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.460 
you're buying a 2 ohm forum or a tone

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.219 
ratings but basically make sure that
your<00:04:19.810> ohms<00:04:20.109> match<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:22.030> amp<00:04:22.810> that<00:04:23.020> you're

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
your ohms match the amp that you're

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.990 
your ohms match the amp that you're
getting<00:04:23.410> so<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:24.820> is<00:04:26.370> well<00:04:27.370> now<00:04:27.610> I'd<00:04:27.790> say<00:04:27.970> that

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
getting so this is well now I'd say that

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.750 
getting so this is well now I'd say that
and<00:04:28.360> now<00:04:28.479> I<00:04:28.510> want<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.840> take<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.139> back<00:04:29.760> because

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
and now I want to take it back because

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.460 
and now I want to take it back because
of<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.030> depending<00:04:31.419> on<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.780> wiring<00:04:32.020> the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
of the depending on the wiring the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.129 
of the depending on the wiring the
number<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:32.830> have<00:04:33.070> in<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.370> dual<00:04:33.550> voice<00:04:33.700> coil

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
number you have in the dual voice coil

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.050 
number you have in the dual voice coil
or<00:04:35.139> a<00:04:35.169> single<00:04:35.530> voice<00:04:35.620> coil<00:04:36.100> that<00:04:36.639> will<00:04:36.820> judge

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
or a single voice coil that will judge

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.210 
or a single voice coil that will judge
whether<00:04:37.300> or<00:04:37.419> not<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:38.229> will<00:04:38.470> actually<00:04:38.710> match

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
whether or not it will actually match

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.170 
whether or not it will actually match
this<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:39.789> am<00:04:40.320> so<00:04:41.320> let<00:04:42.250> me<00:04:42.400> try<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.610> make<00:04:43.030> it

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
this I am so let me try to make it

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.230 
this I am so let me try to make it
simple<00:04:43.389> here<00:04:43.780> now<00:04:43.979> 500<00:04:44.979> watts<00:04:45.100> RMS<00:04:45.610> at<00:04:45.789> 2<00:04:45.970> ohms

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
simple here now 500 watts RMS at 2 ohms

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.700 
simple here now 500 watts RMS at 2 ohms
if<00:04:47.050> you<00:04:47.710> look<00:04:47.979> at<00:04:48.130> this<00:04:48.310> and<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.120> scroll<00:04:49.419> down

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
if you look at this and you scroll down

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
dual voice coil and 2 ohms now if we

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.089 
dual voice coil and 2 ohms now if we
look<00:05:02.560> at<00:05:02.830> our<00:05:02.860> wiring<00:05:03.370> diagrams<00:05:04.090> here<00:05:04.889> if<00:05:05.889> you

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
look at our wiring diagrams here if you

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.190 
look at our wiring diagrams here if you
go<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.430> Crutchfield<00:05:07.090> calm<00:05:07.599> they<00:05:08.020> have<00:05:08.169> a

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
go to Crutchfield calm they have a

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.110 
go to Crutchfield calm they have a
really<00:05:08.530> nice<00:05:09.300> very<00:05:10.300> simple<00:05:11.220> wiring<00:05:12.220> guide<00:05:12.700> and

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
really nice very simple wiring guide and

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.620 
really nice very simple wiring guide and
so<00:05:13.660> if<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:13.840> look<00:05:13.990> here<00:05:14.310> it's<00:05:15.310> so<00:05:15.910> on<00:05:16.150> the

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
so if you look here it's so on the

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.150 
so if you look here it's so on the
selections<00:05:17.229> you<00:05:17.380> just<00:05:17.620> go<00:05:17.710> down<00:05:17.889> to<00:05:18.010> two

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
selections you just go down to two

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.020 
selections you just go down to two
subwoofers<00:05:18.580> I'm<00:05:19.479> in<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:19.930> mono<00:05:20.349> amplifier

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
subwoofers I'm in the mono amplifier

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.870 
subwoofers I'm in the mono amplifier
configuration<00:05:22.289> two<00:05:23.289> subwoofers<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:24.220> then<00:05:24.700> go

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
configuration two subwoofers and then go

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.620 
configuration two subwoofers and then go
down<00:05:25.090> and<00:05:25.680> to<00:05:26.680> so<00:05:27.370> number<00:05:27.729> of<00:05:27.760> speakers<00:05:28.180> dual

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
down and to so number of speakers dual

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.750 
down and to so number of speakers dual
voice<00:05:28.810> coil<00:05:29.139> and<00:05:29.440> each<00:05:29.830> voice<00:05:30.099> coil<00:05:30.400> is<00:05:30.490> rated

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
voice coil and each voice coil is rated

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.420 
voice coil and each voice coil is rated
for<00:05:30.910> too<00:05:31.090> long<00:05:31.240> so<00:05:31.650> then<00:05:32.650> I'll<00:05:32.800> just<00:05:33.010> pull<00:05:33.280> this

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
for too long so then I'll just pull this

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.219 
for too long so then I'll just pull this
up<00:05:33.639> and<00:05:34.950> you<00:05:35.950> can<00:05:36.130> see<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:36.639> the<00:05:37.419> load<00:05:37.690> on<00:05:38.050> the

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
up and you can see that the load on the

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.850 
up and you can see that the load on the
amp<00:05:38.410> is<00:05:38.650> 2<00:05:38.979> ohm<00:05:39.190> which<00:05:39.940> if<00:05:40.479> we<00:05:40.599> look<00:05:40.780> here<00:05:41.080> at<00:05:41.289> my

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
amp is 2 ohm which if we look here at my

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.900 
amp is 2 ohm which if we look here at my
amp<00:05:42.340> is<00:05:42.690> 500<00:05:43.690> watts<00:05:43.870> RMS<00:05:44.320> so<00:05:44.530> we<00:05:44.680> know<00:05:44.910> 500

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
amp is 500 watts RMS so we know 500

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.180 
amp is 500 watts RMS so we know 500
watts<00:05:46.090> RMS<00:05:46.479> is<00:05:46.660> produced<00:05:46.990> here<00:05:47.110> and<00:05:47.530> we<00:05:48.070> know

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
watts RMS is produced here and we know

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.080 
watts RMS is produced here and we know
each<00:05:48.340> of<00:05:48.490> these<00:05:48.639> pull<00:05:48.970> 250<00:05:49.630> at<00:05:49.900> 2<00:05:50.229> ohms

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
each of these pull 250 at 2 ohms

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.730 
each of these pull 250 at 2 ohms
actually<00:05:52.090> it<00:05:52.210> doesn't<00:05:52.479> matter<00:05:52.690> what<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.169> ohms

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
actually it doesn't matter what the ohms

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.480 
actually it doesn't matter what the ohms
because<00:05:54.099> it<00:05:54.220> will<00:05:54.400> always<00:05:54.610> pull<00:05:54.940> 250<00:05:55.419> so<00:05:56.490> 2

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
because it will always pull 250 so 2

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.120 
because it will always pull 250 so 2
ohms<00:05:57.699> 2<00:05:58.030> ohms<00:05:58.240> 2<00:05:58.539> ohms<00:05:58.750> 2<00:05:58.990> ohms<00:05:59.199> and<00:05:59.620> 2<00:05:59.889> ohms

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
ohms 2 ohms 2 ohms 2 ohms and 2 ohms

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.059 
ohms 2 ohms 2 ohms 2 ohms and 2 ohms
here<00:06:00.340> this<00:06:00.910> is<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.300> one<00:06:01.449> that<00:06:01.599> matters<00:06:01.810> is<00:06:02.289> the

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:03.069 
here this is the one that matters is the

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:04.710 
here this is the one that matters is the
the<00:06:03.400> symbol<00:06:03.759> for<00:06:03.940> what<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:04.270> load<00:06:04.449> is<00:06:04.539> being

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
the symbol for what the load is being

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.350 
the symbol for what the load is being
pulled<00:06:05.020> so<00:06:05.590> these<00:06:06.310> different<00:06:06.759> options<00:06:07.000> for

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
pulled so these different options for

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.420 
pulled so these different options for
wiring<00:06:07.599> obviously<00:06:08.470> but<00:06:08.740> this<00:06:08.919> is<00:06:09.130> the<00:06:09.280> one

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
wiring obviously but this is the one

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.809 
wiring obviously but this is the one
that<00:06:09.610> pulls<00:06:09.849> the<00:06:10.060> correct<00:06:10.300> load<00:06:10.569> and<00:06:11.819> matches

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:12.819 
that pulls the correct load and matches

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.420 
that pulls the correct load and matches
the<00:06:13.090> amp<00:06:13.720> and<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:14.020> subs<00:06:14.259> together<00:06:14.650> perfectly

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
the amp and the subs together perfectly

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.309 
the amp and the subs together perfectly
so<00:06:16.150> if<00:06:16.210> you<00:06:16.270> have<00:06:16.389> any<00:06:16.539> more<00:06:16.630> questions<00:06:16.870> about

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
so if you have any more questions about

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.879 
so if you have any more questions about
wiring<00:06:17.710> or<00:06:18.190> questions<00:06:19.150> about<00:06:19.319> ohms<00:06:20.319> or

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
wiring or questions about ohms or

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:22.860 
wiring or questions about ohms or
wattage<00:06:21.099> or<00:06:21.639> how<00:06:22.120> that<00:06:22.330> all<00:06:22.479> works<00:06:22.660> together

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
wattage or how that all works together

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.820 
wattage or how that all works together
go<00:06:23.860> ahead<00:06:23.889> and<00:06:24.250> shoot<00:06:24.520> me<00:06:24.639> a<00:06:24.729> message<00:06:24.759> but<00:06:25.449> um

go ahead and shoot me a message but um

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.409 
go ahead and shoot me a message but um
the<00:06:26.830> interesting<00:06:27.340> thing<00:06:27.610> after<00:06:28.030> I<00:06:28.060> did<00:06:28.330> all

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
the interesting thing after I did all

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.809 
the interesting thing after I did all
that<00:06:28.569> research<00:06:28.630> was<00:06:29.500> I<00:06:30.009> actually<00:06:30.310> started

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 
that research was I actually started

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:32.309 
that research was I actually started
reading<00:06:31.150> the<00:06:31.270> names<00:06:31.509> of<00:06:31.750> what<00:06:31.930> I<00:06:31.960> was<00:06:32.199> looking

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 
reading the names of what I was looking
