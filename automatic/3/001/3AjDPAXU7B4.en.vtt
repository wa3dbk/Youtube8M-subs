00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.990
 graciela francs 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.509
 ok well I will not explain how to use it 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.699
 what thing today today we are going to learn how 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.699
 the wax patina is used 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.539
 let's work with patinas to the heras 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.919
 peeled and creamy and first of all 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.850
 I want to tell you a little bit about 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:35.640
 Product features is a wax 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.280
 that this is a patina forgiveness that is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.839
 prepared with natural waxes and with 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.640
 pigments that have the characteristic 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:49.260
 of being very cognitive the patinas are 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.690
 can apply on different 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.440
 surfaces we can work them on 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.260
 wood on metals about that on 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.660
 biscuit on brass good on 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.320
 different surfaces and today in this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.240
 case let's work on sex forgiveness 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.610
 a question about sex so 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.590
 direct or previous you do not give a hand 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.570
 acrylic we will not work 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.690
 basically we are going to give a two hands of 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.990
 naviblue in acrylic or eureka 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.080
 and two hands to work after I made a 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.830
 patina that I want to show you how to 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.760
 they use 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.440
 the patina will be loaded on a brush 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.820
 we can also work in a 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.400
 sponge we have to carry a 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.140
 clear paint this is a painting it 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.260
 Can use directly to paint 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.140
 I will also use it as a 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.130
 simply to highlight the reliefs 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.640
 so 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.250
 He took out the excess material and what I'm going 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.730
 to do is to pass it with the brush 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.750
 perpendicular to leave the naval blue 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.240
 in the background in the bas-reliefs and in 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.860
 the reliefs we will pass the brush very 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.190
 sideways to highlight and give the base 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.790
 to the color that we are going to place after 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.310
 it's going to be the very important pewter color 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.750
 that you use a bristle brush the brushes 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.240
 they are sow 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.459
 if you need this a hard brush you can 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.200
 also pass with a sponge you can 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.640
 work with your fingers many times 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.490
 I also work with my hands, so 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.270
 but the brush has to be hard 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.390
 good something the same with him 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.640
 with the pewter patina and I'm going 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.780
 work the same as I already have the bases 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.480
 and if you notice 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.400
 as real as reality the work of the 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.540
 exact 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.709
 then all that are reliefs are going 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.260
 to highlight I'm going to have to withdraw 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.569
 somewhere or not if you want to be able 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.900
 retire but actually working from 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.989
 this way the patina is a very work 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.879
 simple and that the result is barbarian 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.819
 this and there scares a little but it is 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.519
 very very simple you do not have to withdraw 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.010
 because you're going through almost nothing 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.440
 material and remember highlighting the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.930
 volume remind me the base color that 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.190
 you used the base color was acrylic 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.519
 naviblue the naval blue of eureka two 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.549
 hands after a color patina 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.400
 Turquoise thinks it's a creamy color 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:43.780
 and about the turquoise patina that makes me 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.090
 of base I will pass the color of 3 in the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.060
 ppl 3 a very dark metallic gray is 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.090
 the finish that we can show you if 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.069
 after we did all this and we gave him 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.280
 we highlight the reliefs to taste the 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.520
 result would be this 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.069
 and if you notice there are reliefs that are 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.540
 much brighter yes they highlight much more 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:10.770
 I gave them a little touch with the 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:14.880
 Silver color so you can see it is very very 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.650
 Of course, it is not exact after the 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.660
 material s as highlight what 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.530
 you want not everything because the recipe idea 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.870
 polish clear and once it dries 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.910
 You pass a franelita a woolen cloth 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.050
 to achieve more break and shine 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.390
 that union 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.940
 I wanted to tell you that as patinas 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.010
 They give a lot of possibility to work me 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.990
 I would like to continue working in 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.840
 successive programs and follow 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.640
 showing them different effects 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.760
 different endings can be done 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.150
 of everything and recycle elements that already 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.400
 they were out there in disuse good if 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.380
 receives thank you very much for a purse will 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.510
 to skate everything I think so 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.460
 because at the same step of each exactly 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.590
 make a day thank you all and see you 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.590
 thank you very much we continue
