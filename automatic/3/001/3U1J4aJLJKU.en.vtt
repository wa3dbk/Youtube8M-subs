00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.940
 greetings welcome to everyone today xavier 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.770
 inside I find myself right now 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.260
 sony offices where in brief 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.810
 moments will begin the presentation of the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.090
 new range of bravia 4k TVs for 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.980
 2015 has still been a bit of a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.440
 half ride but behind me as you see 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.350
 I just installed the TV that 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.480
 I can assure you it is the finest I have 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.099
 seen in all my life that's why here I 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.200
 accompanies the misfortune responsible for 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.899
 televisions for sony in spain and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.150
 portugal greetings to see the usual xavi 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.800
 come on I could be looking a little 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.810
 of the television a few minutes before 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.170
 start that interview and it 's really 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:49.800
 very fine is impressive 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 in fact we say that 49 millimeters ago 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.739
 of thickness does not reach even half a centimeter 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 and to give you an idea you know 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.710
 ok the experience and you would dare 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.200
 details same last sony phone 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.870
 TVs even thinner than 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.300
 experience so fine that 73 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.070
 Many of you want to hang the 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.470
 TV also on the wall of this 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.990
 Even if it is hung, it will continue 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.220
 looking as fine as it is if from 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.650
 made our engineers have thought 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.080
 also in this and it comes supplied with 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.060
 the television a special support that we 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.400
 allows to hang it on the wall and that is 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.560
 totally stuck and this is what forms 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.960
 part of the design concept that 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.570
 flame flow team style 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.400
 exactly this even though with you it is 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.170
 a concept that what it does is that if you 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.020
 fixed on televisions as a panel 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.360
 crystal from end to end no frame is 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.130
 super fine as we have seen and this gives 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.630
 a feeling of total lightness that 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.870
 when you're watching the TV it seems 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.790
 as if you are looking at a window and 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.530
 when you hang it on the wall it also gives 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.140
 this feeling of lightness this 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.960
 TV has a dazzling design 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.700
 that is very clear, it happens that some 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.980
 you have asked to be a 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.600
 TV so thin we had to 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.490
 give up image quality 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.470
 to preserve all image quality 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.619
 this television has the latest 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.230
 technologies is not only a 4k panel but 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.989
 that also incorporates / luminous 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.760
 incorporates extend dynamic range 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.040
 incorporates all technologies as per 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.450
 example not processor x 1 which is a 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.120
 novelty that we incorporate this year 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.980
 If we already saw very good quality with 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.069
 televisions of last year with the one of 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.810
 processor x 1 the zone overcome it this 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.730
 condenser will be alone in this 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.980
 model or we will have it available throughout 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.769
 the range this processor will be in all 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.599
 the 4k TVs of 2015 and what 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.940
 does it improve both the definition 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.560
 like the colors like the contrast 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.410
 works all dimensions for 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.260
 get the best image quality 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.020
 very good image quality is clear 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.300
 premium design but let's talk now 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.070
 of connectivity this TV or if 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.260
 I'm not wrong, it works with the system 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.420
 operative android tv many of you 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.520
 you have heard about it in forums and 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.720
 online but exactly on what 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.250
 consists 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.950
 I believe that Android knows all the 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.690
 world 80% of the phones that are 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.000
 they sold in the last year they work with 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.410
 Android operating system and what 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.720
 we do is incorporate this system 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.070
 operative directly on the television 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.930
 so it's much easier 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.640
 intuitive for all for all 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.710
 people can share these 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.080
 contents between smartphone or tablets and 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.670
 our television or let's let's go 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.830
 to leave things clear if I 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.380
 example I'm sitting on my couch 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.170
 home we can take my phone and send 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.760
 for example a photograph to the screen 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.070
 so all my friends can see it 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.140
 then share a picture you can 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.180
 share music you can share videos 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.760
 what you want 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.829
 the function strikes any content 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.260
 that you are seeing on your phone or on your 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.659
 tablet directly by pressing a button the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.609
 you can send the TV talk about 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.530
 the applications we will be able to download 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.370
 applications directly in the 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.140
 TV 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.030
 if a television that also google play 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.370
 with which you can access all the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.290
 Available applications and download them 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.510
 directly on the television you can 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.799
 install all kinds of applications 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.590
 operations for the time the news 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.019
 social networks including games games 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.720
 attention to such games we will be able to 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.760
 play games directly on our 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.820
 yes television clear with an application 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.260
 more inside android tv and you can play 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.150
 controlling from the remote control 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.130
 of your own television from your smartphone 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.560
 or even if you want it was an experience 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.360
 of the most real game still connecting a 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.100
 bluetooth control directly to 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.870
 television is based on us as almost having 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.510
 a console tucked inside the TV 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.760
 practically very well and how are we going to 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.350
 be able to navigate between so much content 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.630
 because it looks like it's going to be a bit messy 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.490
 not with so many things that have to be more 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.169
 easy that never actually one of the 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.940
 possibilities you have is to speak to you 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.740
 directly to the television and ask him what 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.360
 you want to grab the athletic up of 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.490
 you will see with the one flick command 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.949
 directly you have a key on which 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.600
 you can activate it and give it any order 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.240
 via voice with a microphone that carries 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.039
 incorporated here through the 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.630
 Gestural menu you can move through 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.949
 the different applications so 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.840
 super easy wow 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.419
 It seems very easy to control 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.669
 this but now now ask a little 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.190
 uncomfortable what happens if we do not have a 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.789
 phone that carries the operating system 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.620
 from android 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.900
 Well, also the rest of 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.970
 platforms of the rest of systems 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.830
 operatives also have applications 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.199
 that allow sharing the same 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.460
 content with android tv good to see 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.199
 we are going to do now and the great 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.120
 million question what we all are 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.220
