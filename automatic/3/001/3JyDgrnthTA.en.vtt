00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.900
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.790
 new July 2014 hunting 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.110
 nice to meet you we'll start 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.880
 immediately with good news 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.530
 since it was brought to us by the 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.850
 recent figures published by the Office 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.300
 national hunting and wildlife 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.370
 wild 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.130
 concerning hunting safety and 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.140
 accidents the balance sheet of these accidents 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.960
 show a decrease of 11% in particular 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.220
 for fatal accidents even though in 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.240
 most cases and well that's the 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.900
 big game hunt that remains 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.880
 responsible with 60% of the cases the accident 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.860
 it should be noted that this 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.479
 decline is exciting for 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.400
 In the years to come, we know that 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.140
 hunting federations also accompanied 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.430
 by the trainers of the national office 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.170
 of hunting and wildlife puts 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.540
 a special focus on safety 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.000
 you know that today it is the axÃ© 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.369
 main part of the training, in particular 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.080
 hunting license and therefore efforts to 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.450
 do not let go even if you do not have to 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.310
 prides itself on its results and well 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.050
 it's always a step forward towards more 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.380
 security on the hunt 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.320
 obviously neither the age nor the mode of hunting 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.090
 should not be neglected in taking 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.740
 of awareness of the risks associated with our 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.820
 activity 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.890
 then lately you know it without 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.390
 doubt bernard baudin and a certain 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.789
 number of directors met 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.990
 putting the environment and 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.270
 sustainable development 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.679
 Madame Segolene Royal he talked 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.060
 with her on the future of hunting for 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.890
 important files including the law 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.649
 biodiversity the law of the agricultural future 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.000
 but obviously also the waterfowl and 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.490
 the problem of geese 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.229
 I propose to address all these topics in 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.940
 coming back to the heart of the matter with 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.830
 thierry costes who is our guest the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.080
 next week two hunters of 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.950
 france steve go back in the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.740
 departments if you want it 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.319
 direction the champagne ardenne with the 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.220
 program scribbled a shot culture that 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.630
 is currently in full swing 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.850
 for the record, you must know that the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.740
 agrifaune network aims to 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.569
 develop of course the amenities and 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.640
 favorable years farming practices 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.140
 no doubt to the small sedentary wildlife 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.060
 the partners 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.430
 drop a mark called 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.110
 agrifaune interculturel aims to 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.880
 label a number of cutlery 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.380
 of plants that are both beneficial 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.910
 for the small game of sedentary 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.850
 plain for the small plain fauna 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.690
 but also that they are agronomically 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.130
 performant we look right now 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.660
 with a video clip that was 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.880
 carried out by the Regional Federation of 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.740
 Champagne Ardenne countryside found 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.470
 several natural regions so already 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.340
 necessarily the wine champagne with its 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.840
 large areas of vine on the slopes 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.010
 superficial and then of course the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.720
 chalky champagne which is the region 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.700
 the most important natural agricultural 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.950
 champagne ardenne it is characterized by 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.989
 large cereal plains with 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.550
 quite a few hedges of shrubbery so 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.959
 the objective of the agri fun program is 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.360
 precisely of these to reintroduce a 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.709
 little bit of landscape elements in 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:26.500
 these big plains of champagne for 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:28.090
 agriculture and for biodiversity in 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.650
 what they see that the motivations that 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.350
 encourages the farmer imported from the EU 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.750
 Christmas are relatively numerous the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.360
 main and especially a request 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.459
 hunter farmers who wish 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.049
 make favorable arrangements for 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.570
 small game of sorrows and in particular 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.030
 lose it and we have a demand that 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.220
 begins to develop that there is a 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.980
 crop aid application he has 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.630
 also a landscape aspect in the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.130
 as far as we are on a vast plain 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.410
 relatively desert 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.630
 it can be agronomic objectives 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.690
 in soils with slopes accentuate 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.220
 the haye can have a retention role 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.590
 water to fight against erosion 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.780
 for example breaking objectives 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.079
 also especially among farmers 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.760
 breeders on all projects as soon as 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.860
 sets up with farmers 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.870
 it is recommended to put in place a 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.620
 grassed strip on both sides of the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.810
 woody strip 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.030
 the objective being to accentuate the role of 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.280
 the hague including biodiversity too 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.760
 good for the small fauna as for the 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.950
 insects 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.820
 in terms of meetings and well I 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.070
 propose to make a detour 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.800
 by the general meeting of the hunting 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.260
 Femina held last June the 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.580
 June 28 exactly to the federation 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.080
 departmental hunters of the oise 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.020
 where were obviously present his 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.330
 president but also the president of 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.950
 the association martine pion who had to 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.690
 his sides alain duran vice president of 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.820
 the national federation but also yves 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.289
 duthel president of the federation of 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.700
 picardie hunters is hardly both 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.960
 fake obviously the president of the 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.240
 hunters of the oise who welcome them 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.800
 in their premises a very ag 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.210
 international you will be able to 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.770
 find out since was present and well 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.080
 huntsmen from Quebec 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.220
 especially to talk about the hunt for 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.680
 the bear or moose and to exchange 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.060
 on the hunting methods in Quebec and the 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.060
 women's hunt in quebec but also 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.710
 hunters from Romania with 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.150
 which they could also exchanged 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.280
 throughout this shared day 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.539
 of course emotions and the 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.820
 passion for hunting the female have no 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.810
 doubt an appointment and photos to be 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.880
 not miss you will find them again 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.789
 obviously on the website of the association 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.599
 national women's hunting 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.330
 national associations the hunt for 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.280
 feminine and finally we are in July 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.990
 and August is the right time after the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.000
 spring counts to participate 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.640
 sampling gray partridge and 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.880
 red partridges the areas that were 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.650
 beaten before now actually 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.599
 carefully explore in order to 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.680
 to know the reproduction and to appreciate 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.510
 this reproduction throughout the 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.150
 season all the niches and are noted 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.710
 you know taking into account the number of 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.500
 young people their age the number of adults 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.030
 and those who accompany them the name 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.590
 and the average number of 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.810
 young by chickens will allow 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.820
 precisely to evaluate the success of the 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.570
 reproduction compared to years 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.620
 previous 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.810
 the goal being to have at least 40 % of 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.729
 hens observed in the spring and the 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.080
 find on the territory it is necessary 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.940
 know that the partridge actually 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.479
 today is the subject of all 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.710
 attentions 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.700
 a father diaries collective 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.020
 its climbs recently you can 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.540
 find elsewhere on their website 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.130
 facebook collective gray partridge I you 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.830
 strongly invite you to subscribe 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.360
 we find ourselves for the month 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.590
 from August with a lot of fun pass 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.590
 a beautiful summer has very soon goodbye
