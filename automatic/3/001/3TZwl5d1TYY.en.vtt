I would have to give this one a thumbs

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.260 
I would have to give this one a thumbs
down<00:05:04.890> while<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:06.040> flavor<00:05:06.370> when<00:05:06.760> I<00:05:06.790> got<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.030> nice

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
down while the flavor when I got a nice

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.200 
down while the flavor when I got a nice
bite<00:05:07.600> of<00:05:08.010> mushrooms<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.280> sauce<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:10.030> pasta

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
bite of mushrooms and sauce the pasta

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.930 
bite of mushrooms and sauce the pasta
the<00:05:11.050> chicken<00:05:11.470> it<00:05:11.860> was<00:05:11.920> delicious

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
the chicken it was delicious

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.930 
the chicken it was delicious
but<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:14.080> rest<00:05:14.290> of<00:05:14.530> it<00:05:14.710> was<00:05:15.100> really<00:05:15.430> lacking<00:05:15.670> in

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
but the rest of it was really lacking in

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.020 
but the rest of it was really lacking in
the<00:05:16.120> sauce<00:05:16.360> so<00:05:16.600> we<00:05:16.810> would<00:05:16.960> probably<00:05:17.350> need<00:05:17.500> like

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
the sauce so we would probably need like

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.260 
the sauce so we would probably need like
three<00:05:19.030> packages<00:05:19.600> to<00:05:20.050> make<00:05:20.260> it<00:05:20.850> what<00:05:21.850> we<00:05:22.030> would

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270
