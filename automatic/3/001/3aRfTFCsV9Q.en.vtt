00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.430
 stand 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.800
 through the rejection fear of falling fear of setting their goals 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.900
 the hall is that nobody aboard in the penultimate minute 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.320
 we have seized long days but thanks to hope 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.700

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 this region vÃ¤rmland god is the apple together to hibernate 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.899
 chasing a branch 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.540
 I say that myself on March 7 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.140
 then only went to the street to do the shopping 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 it must have got you going on the bed a day later 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.260
 especially scared to people encountered 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.820
 but there I come to the opener I was allowed to work on myself and that from the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.020
 love of christ who directs himself 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.020

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.190

 can buy one or more for the following symptoms click here is the air 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.230
 of all eighty of those affected by guilt 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.710
 issue with 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.050
 other players 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.069
 the castle club 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.969
 the suspect stepped 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.149
 weight reduction 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.279
 despite the lack of sleep concentration and more things like that 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:20.129
 everyone thinks it has been a big blow, but the question is 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.359
 the committee 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.439
 the suspected brain behind the pollution it was completely over after itself 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.359
 and in my area but the stock of gorkum at the vld to that end is not 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.189
 has been thought under his rule 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.670
 as time goes by the term a catastrophe of emotions 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.319
 starting from the two positive thoughts, I started myself again 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.599
 go with the little one 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.919
 I could no longer get out of the prison of the suspects 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.009
 and I feel whole is in the fight 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.289
 but by the hope and faith in jesus also just i did not understand the 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:51.999
 had an issue about my life 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.999
 I am very satisfied 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.209
 fortis couch 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.299
 and what is the reality? 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.859
 the site is lifted, but it is covered there 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.859
 in short you look outside 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:11.889
 some go 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.299
 I suggest the plus 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.079
 as long as you stick to it 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.079
 nor can you mislead 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.059
 the treatment is aimed at the first reception 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.909
 sometimes it seemed like a crisis situation 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.399
 setups and stabilization 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:36.759
 motivation 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.039
 activation 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.649
 at the Merkel pump 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:41.939
 you treat 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.949
 consists of 24-hour supervision 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.549
 including in the second treatment 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.699
 group training 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.189
 work placement 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.189
 training opportunities 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.329
 of the problem 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.519
 piet hopping 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.899
 within this treatment 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.329
 hopefully a therapy like 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.019
 pharmacotherapy 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.529
 cognitive behavioral therapy 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.509
 pastoral counseling 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:10.499
 the system can still p 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:12.109
 movement therapy 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.109
 out of creative therapy 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.209
 I don't believe in a hopeless case 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.519
 there is hope 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.780
 carry everyone
