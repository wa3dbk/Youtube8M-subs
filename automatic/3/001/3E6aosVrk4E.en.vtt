00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
agree with those issues I'd add

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.970 
agree with those issues I'd add
protection<00:02:45.329> of<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.019> environment<00:02:46.139> which

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
protection of the environment which

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.009 
protection of the environment which
should<00:02:47.250> really<00:02:47.579> correspond<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.359> protection

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
should really correspond with protection

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.409 
should really correspond with protection
of<00:02:49.139> the<00:02:49.290> water<00:02:49.530> supply<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.209> should

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
of the water supply and and this should

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.750

we've<00:02:53.939> identified<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.900> should<00:02:55.290> i<00:02:55.349> okay

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
we've identified so should i okay

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.280 
we've identified so should i okay
all<00:02:56.069> right<00:02:56.189> one<00:02:56.970> issue<00:02:57.150> we<00:02:57.629> might<00:02:57.780> have<00:02:57.930> due<00:02:58.169> to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
all right one issue we might have due to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.259 
all right one issue we might have due to
our<00:02:58.379> relationship<00:02:58.889> that<00:02:58.919> we<00:02:59.069> have<00:02:59.310> with<00:02:59.549> the

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
our relationship that we have with the

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.940 
our relationship that we have with the
responsible<00:03:00.989> point<00:03:01.200> into<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> trucking

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
responsible point into the trucking

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.559 
responsible point into the trucking
company<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.400> think<00:03:02.909> we<00:03:03.000> should<00:03:03.180> add<00:03:03.299> some

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
company I think we should add some

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.959 
company I think we should add some
wording<00:03:04.109> about<00:03:04.430> making<00:03:05.430> sure<00:03:05.579> that<00:03:05.700> there<00:03:05.879> is

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
wording about making sure that there is

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.599 
wording about making sure that there is
complete<00:03:06.120> decontamination<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:08.040> entire

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
complete decontamination of the entire

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.119 
complete decontamination of the entire
affected<00:03:09.209> area<00:03:09.560> we're<00:03:10.560> going<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.829> turn<00:03:11.010> this

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
affected area we're going to turn this

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.209 
affected area we're going to turn this
back<00:03:11.340> over<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.719> trucking<00:03:13.469> company<00:03:13.889> I

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:14.219 
back over to the trucking company I

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.679 
back over to the trucking company I
don't<00:03:14.669> think<00:03:14.819> we<00:03:14.909> can<00:03:15.030> expect<00:03:15.269> them<00:03:15.480> to

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
don't think we can expect them to

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.920 
don't think we can expect them to
complete<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.290> job<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:16.980> with<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.450> can<00:03:18.810> go
