 But there is still a button there you need 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.520
 register and as for me it is very 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.829
 long 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.789

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:47.489
 from here you can download let's download 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.489
 and see what happens with us 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.509

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.240
 quack is everything let's 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.240
 installed as administrator 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.619
 agree 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.010
 so download and install install 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.980
 the current version is clicked because it 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.170
 set us up to date and can 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.460
 do not come to us license doctor who 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.460
 went to the root of the archive 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.530
 snooping Windows I'm right handed than video I'm 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.900
 disconnected and therefore there is such information 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.420
 that they are now starting to chop off licenses 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.579
 to everyone but due to the fact that I turned off surveillance 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.950
 I think my license will remain I want it 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.750
 the future will have something like me 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.720
