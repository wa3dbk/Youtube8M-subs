00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
however a Sevilla's defense was pretty

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.010 
however a Sevilla's defense was pretty
good<00:00:51.500> making<00:00:52.730> United<00:00:53.730> earn<00:00:54.149> their<00:00:54.719> court

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
dangerous throughout the first half at

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.690 
dangerous throughout the first half at
least<00:01:15.409> for<00:01:16.409> their<00:01:16.530> offense<00:01:16.979> they<00:01:17.250> got<00:01:17.430> some

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
least for their offense they got some

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.450

Ireland<00:01:20.460> was<00:01:20.580> playing<00:01:20.820> well<00:01:21.030> today<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.330> thought

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
Ireland was playing well today I thought

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600 
Ireland was playing well today I thought
throughout<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> whole<00:01:22.170> game<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.610> benteke

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
throughout the whole game and benteke

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.170 
throughout the whole game and benteke
was<00:01:24.000> also<00:01:24.299> very<00:01:24.420> good<00:01:25.759> eventually<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.909> game

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
was also very good eventually this game

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.880 
was also very good eventually this game
does<00:01:27.479> not<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.869> their<00:01:27.990> favor<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.560> we'll<00:01:28.740> get

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
does not go in their favor but we'll get

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.219 
does not go in their favor but we'll get
there<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.630> they're<00:01:30.630> counter-attacks

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
there but they're counter-attacks

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
there but they're counter-attacks
there's<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.590> part<00:01:31.829> where<00:01:31.979> wyman<00:01:32.549> should<00:01:32.790> have

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
there's one part where wyman should have

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.300 
there's one part where wyman should have
probably<00:01:33.030> passed<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.600> Ireland<00:01:34.310> faster

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
probably passed on to Ireland faster

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.910 
probably passed on to Ireland faster
because<00:01:35.490> when<00:01:35.700> he<00:01:35.790> tried<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.060> pass<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.630> forward

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
because when he tried to pass it forward

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.280 
because when he tried to pass it forward
Ferdinand<00:01:37.920> was<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.400> deflect<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.880> away

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
Ferdinand was there to deflect it away

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.450 
Ferdinand was there to deflect it away
so<00:01:40.290> they<00:01:40.409> had<00:01:40.560> some<00:01:40.829> errors<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
so they had some errors on the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.310 
so they had some errors on the
counter-attack<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.659> they<00:01:42.840> could<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.170> had

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
counter-attack that they could have had

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.730 
counter-attack that they could have had
a<00:01:43.350> chance<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.860> score<00:01:44.180> against<00:01:45.180> man<00:01:45.540> united<00:01:45.740> but

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
a chance to score against man united but

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.090 
a chance to score against man united but
it<00:01:46.979> didn't<00:01:47.280> happen<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.350> meant<00:01:49.350> Manchester

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
it didn't happen so meant Manchester

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.319
