great grip the grippy handles really

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.240

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.889 
provides a nice grip for you there's
jimping<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:36.180> sort<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.440> mean<00:00:38.690> it's<00:00:39.690> kind<00:00:39.870> of

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
jimping here sort of I mean it's kind of

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.930 
jimping here sort of I mean it's kind of
useless<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:42.440> it's<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.590> some<00:00:43.739> jumping<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
useless but it's got some jumping in the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.610 
useless but it's got some jumping in the
lock<00:00:45.450> which<00:00:46.170> gives<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> good<00:00:46.800> grip<00:00:50.870> but<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
lock which gives you a good grip but the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
lock which gives you a good grip but the
reason<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.980> don't<00:00:53.760> really<00:00:54.000> pull<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.480> thing

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
reason I don't really pull this thing

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.080 
reason I don't really pull this thing
out<00:00:54.780> where<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> need<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.350> anything<00:00:56.090> which

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
out where I need to do anything which

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.959 
out where I need to do anything which
makes<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.449> pretty<00:00:57.539> useless<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.079> EDC<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.969> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
makes it pretty useless for EDC is the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.880 
makes it pretty useless for EDC is the
fact<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.510> barely<00:01:00.870> legal<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.469> canada

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
fact that it's barely legal in canada

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.509 
fact that it's barely legal in canada
and<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.940> reason<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
and the reason that is because the

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.600 
and the reason that is because the
assisted<00:01:05.519> opening<00:01:05.790> knives<00:01:06.000> aren't<00:01:06.420> illegal

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
assisted opening knives aren't illegal

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.240 
assisted opening knives aren't illegal
flippers<00:01:08.610> are<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.560> basically<00:01:10.979> what<00:01:11.130> this

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
flippers are and so basically what this

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.940 
flippers are and so basically what this
is<00:01:11.310> an<00:01:11.729> assisted<00:01:12.150> flipper<00:01:12.390> right<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> I'm

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
is an assisted flipper right so I'm

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.910 
is an assisted flipper right so I'm
thinking<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.760> ever<00:01:15.229> got<00:01:16.229> caught<00:01:16.470> using<00:01:16.710> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
thinking if I ever got caught using this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.399 
thinking if I ever got caught using this
thing<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.049> thinking<00:01:19.080> it'd

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
thing and you know I'm thinking it'd

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.929 
thing and you know I'm thinking it'd
probably<00:01:19.619> end<00:01:19.830> up<00:01:19.890> getting<00:01:20.130> confiscated<00:01:20.790> or

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
probably end up getting confiscated or

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.429 
probably end up getting confiscated or
whatever<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:23.060> yeah<00:01:24.060> I'm<00:01:24.450> looking<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
whatever so yeah I'm looking to get a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.359 
whatever so yeah I'm looking to get a
new<00:01:26.340> EDC<00:01:26.850> knife<00:01:27.530> I'm<00:01:28.530> kind<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.920> looking<00:01:29.040> at

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
new EDC knife I'm kind of looking at

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.920 
new EDC knife I'm kind of looking at
hopefully<00:01:31.460> benchmade<00:01:32.460> griptilian<00:01:32.930> but

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
hopefully benchmade griptilian but

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.679 
hopefully benchmade griptilian but
that's<00:01:34.110> pretty<00:01:34.380> expensive<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.180> not<00:01:36.180> sure<00:01:36.420> if

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
