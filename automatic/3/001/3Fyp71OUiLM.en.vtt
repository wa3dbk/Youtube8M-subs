00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:11.790

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.990
 comes alex capcoms senior manager has in 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.460
 clarified an interview like 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.619
 elaborate the development for the new 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.449
 Consoles is the work we do 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.800
 in a game for the psp xbox ears 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.779
 stuck is compared to last 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.760
 console generation eight to ten times as 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.140
 many players assume that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.369
 development at new consoles 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.529
 had to be easier because of the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.880
 hardware more s.pcs based that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.140
 is true because the developers less 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.000
 Problems with the peculiarities of 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.500
 but hardware has increased 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.120
 you spend everything from the new consoles 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.290
 to tickle character models and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.510
 textures have to be much more detailed 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.559
 to be created 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.629
 a new part from the back if it 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.530
 Officially for pc ps3 and xbox ears 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.820
 been announced 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.289
 ours continues to experience this 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.850
 favorite bounty hunter grad the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.500
 culmination of his career what a 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.539
 professional killer of course no walk 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.039
 in the park is next to the graphic should also 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.539
 the ki be rebuilt so that the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.649
 huge devil even more alive and 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.780
 more credible 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.399
 In addition , the contrexx mode comes back 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.140
 concrete details are to be provided during the course of the project 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.110
 year, what do you wish for? 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.549
 new dedication to it in the comments 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.229
 there is a concept that has a place 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.820
 torn open his artist and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.830
 the adversaries from zelda into the real world 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.830
 conjured look at how 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.210
 eglofs katrin would look real 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.979
 By the way, the pictures are not 3d 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.330
 ripped graphics that was all in 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.400
 photoshop made quite nice 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.220
 impressive and disgusting but that did 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.720
 I already said to have announced 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.130
 to revise the steam controller 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.930
 Touchscreen falls away and is against 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.759
 traditional four button pad 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.500
 exchanged the picture comes from a 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.159
 presentation by wolf and shows one 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.840
 prototypes 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.780
 well possible so that the layout 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.979
 until the release even further changed 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 drive works should actually already 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.250
 launch the ps4 come out that did not 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.950
 worked and the release to 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.600
 Start of the ps4 in Japan on 22 february 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.070
 not even the official works 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.960
 start shot in japan now to one 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.549
 fall later time says rapp in 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.729
 Europe still does not appear 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.729
 known 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.610
 former developers of microsoft and 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.619
 the sensation creator firaxis work 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.840
 currently on a next generation engine 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.580
 for strategy games does not sound right now 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.380
 so exciting but look at it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.959
 video about it in the battlefield are 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.459
 involved over 10,000 units where 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.640
 stay the star trek and star wars 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.380
 games that put on this engine 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.520
 battlefield call of duty great for both 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.230
 because of their single player campaign 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.730
 but criticizes with one 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.290
 Single player mode is shooter easy 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.570
 better to market as the times of 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.010
 he is said to have lacked 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.600
 namely a scripted moments so 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.070
 that in the trailers no formal 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.709
 sequences are visible but only 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.820
 unprocessed gameplay sequences what is 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.620
 Actually you want to go with them 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.090
 exciting trailer that look blatant 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.070
 but little with the actual game too 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.070
 do or have unadulterated gameplay 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.280
 Last week finally announced 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.379
 the first gameplay video we have them 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.030
 minutes of alien action for you the 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.870
 rather after horror than after baller 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.870
 action look 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.290
 an anonymous designed now unpacked 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.090
 how difficult is it for the rio 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.560
 so to develop the developers 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.120
 tools completely awkward to use 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.770
 be one while nintendo sometimes 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.520
 For a week it took a simple question 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.290
 to answer 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.030
 The design of the iju has nintendo 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.440
 Moreover, more on power consumption than 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.910
 Respect for performance why the 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.980
 console now no chance against the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.390
 performance of ps4 and xbox has 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.950
 That's why almost everyone has 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.420
 Third-party developer already has the video 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.300
 written off and do not make players 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.160
 You can remember more about that 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.170
 that you ever set a video game 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.090
 has that could change in the future 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.560
 The Federal Court has ruled that 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.180
 in games may not be used 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.350
 if this addressed children directly 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.570
 and to buy game content 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.340
 it is actually meant to be brought 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.290
 in the judgment about runes of magic and the 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.880
 Formulation This week you have again 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.680
 the chance to whet your character 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.770
 the makers of news of magic have 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.630
 Vocation against the verdict lodged the 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.830
 Guides ps4 controller is always on 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.750
 no matter if you are from a game 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.310
 is used or not 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.780
 nothing will change in the future 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.340
 The question is if you have the ladder with you 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.200
 switch off future firmware update 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.940
 may have sony chef shuhei yoshida at 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.720
 twitter a short and unique 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.400
 The answer in a horror baby was the 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.930
 inhabitant of new york scared to death 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.730
 The whole action is a marketing gag 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.620
 for the horror movie definition of in 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.620
 Germany does not start until 10 april 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.939
 can 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.900
 Recordings 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.639
 that was it again with the most important 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.319
 last week's gaming news follows us 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.729
 on facebook twitter and youtube i am 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.990
