00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
to make it sound run quieter I know I

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.950 
to make it sound run quieter I know I
guess<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:29.910> think<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.300> was<00:02:30.450> been<00:02:30.630> what

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
guess that I think that was been what

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:39.680 
guess that I think that was been what
