00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
and set the the bottom point in our

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
and set the the bottom point in our
cuboid<00:00:54.180> which<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.719> gonna<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> down<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.440> it's

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
cuboid which is gonna be down here it's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.590 
cuboid which is gonna be down here it's
going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.699> pause<00:00:57.859> there<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:58.920> go<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.390> if

going to be pause there we go so then if
I<00:01:00.750> fly<00:01:01.020> back<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.410> which<00:01:01.770> could<00:01:02.340> take<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.550> while

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
I fly back up which could take a while

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.200 
I fly back up which could take a while
now<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.080> need<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> command<00:01:05.129> which<00:01:06.030> I'm

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
now we need to do a command which I'm

now we need to do a command which I'm
doing<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.630> tf2<00:01:07.130> create<00:01:08.130> map<00:01:08.909> followed<00:01:09.420> by<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
doing here tf2 create map followed by a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.440 
doing here tf2 create map followed by a
name<00:01:09.780> called<00:01:10.560> YouTube<00:01:10.920> there<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
name called YouTube there we go so that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.530 
name called YouTube there we go so that
YouTube<00:01:12.930> has<00:01:13.320> created<00:01:13.770> being<00:01:14.729> created<00:01:15.210> sorry

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
YouTube has created being created sorry

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.899 
YouTube has created being created sorry
and<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.860> need<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.580> set<00:01:17.729> some

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and what we need to do now is set some

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.960 
and what we need to do now is set some
spawn<00:01:18.180> points<00:01:18.630> capture<00:01:19.259> points<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.970> yes

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
spawn points capture points and yes

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.850 
spawn points capture points and yes
that's<00:01:21.270> why<00:01:21.450> I've<00:01:21.540> got<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.810> wall<00:01:22.080> there's<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
that's why I've got this wall there's a

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.690 
that's why I've got this wall there's a
sign<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.670> use<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.900> before<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> we

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
sign I can use so before we do that we

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.730 
sign I can use so before we do that we
need<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.119> set<00:01:27.390> stuff<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.810> time<00:01:28.140> limit<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
need to set stuff like time limit and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.539 
need to set stuff like time limit and
play<00:01:29.280> limit<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.290> tf2<00:01:32.360> c3po<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.170> set<00:01:36.200> player

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
play limit so tf2 c3po do to set player

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.350 
play limit so tf2 c3po do to set player
limit<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:41.090> basically<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.479> way<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> works<00:01:42.930> is

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
limit and basically the way it works is

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.960 
limit and basically the way it works is
if<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.570> set<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.049> six<00:01:46.399> half<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.729> is

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
if you set it to six half of that is

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.020 
if you set it to six half of that is
three<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.899> when<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.229> get<00:01:49.380> three<00:01:49.680> people<00:01:50.030> it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
three so when you get three people it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.580 
three so when you get three people it
will<00:01:51.180> automatically<00:01:51.630> start<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.200> I'll<00:01:52.320> set<00:01:52.560> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
will automatically start so I'll set it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.420 
will automatically start so I'll set it
to<00:01:52.829> two

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
to two

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.330 
to two
because<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.149> only<00:01:54.299> me<00:01:54.509> linked<00:01:54.810> part<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.340> if

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
because it's only me linked part but if

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.480 
because it's only me linked part but if
you<00:01:56.520> had<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.880> four<00:01:57.240> players<00:01:58.250> setting<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
you had like four players setting it to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.200 
you had like four players setting it to
two<00:01:59.640> would<00:01:59.850> be<00:02:00.079> yeah<00:02:01.110> good<00:02:01.530> alright<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.399> it

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
two would be yeah good alright so it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.090 
two would be yeah good alright so it
would<00:02:03.299> automatically<00:02:03.719> start<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:04.890> need

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
would automatically start so now we need

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.919 
would automatically start so now we need
to<00:02:05.159> set<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.579> time<00:02:05.939> limit<00:02:06.090> which<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:09.060> how<00:02:09.869> long

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to set a time limit which is how long

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.710 
to set a time limit which is how long
the<00:02:10.470> games<00:02:10.890> will<00:02:11.129> run<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.420> similar

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the games will run for so it's a similar

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.040 
the games will run for so it's a similar
command

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
command

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.730 
command
and<00:02:13.370> instead<00:02:14.370> play<00:02:14.580> up<00:02:14.850> time<00:02:15.090> limit<00:02:15.710> then<00:02:16.710> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
and instead play up time limit then the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.030 
and instead play up time limit then the
name<00:02:17.010> YouTube<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.780> don't<00:02:18.900> know<00:02:19.140> it's

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
name YouTube and I don't know it's

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.870 
name YouTube and I don't know it's
minutes<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.790> believe<00:02:21.440> two<00:02:22.440> minutes

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
minutes I believe two minutes

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.480 
minutes I believe two minutes
hopefully<00:02:24.660> that's<00:02:24.960> minutes<00:02:25.380> not<00:02:25.590> seconds<00:02:26.040> so

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
hopefully that's minutes not seconds so

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.550 
hopefully that's minutes not seconds so
just<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.510> case<00:02:27.660> under<00:02:27.960> 200<00:02:28.770> which<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.820> either

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
just in case under 200 which is either

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.940 
just in case under 200 which is either
200<00:02:31.560> seconds<00:02:31.920> or<00:02:32.040> 200<00:02:32.400> minutes<00:02:33.350> yeah<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.800> we'll

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
200 seconds or 200 minutes yeah so we'll

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.070 
200 seconds or 200 minutes yeah so we'll
find<00:02:35.100> out<00:02:35.310> later

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
find out later

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.660 
find out later
all<00:02:37.080> right<00:02:37.200> couple<00:02:38.070> more<00:02:38.190> things<00:02:38.340> we<00:02:38.460> need<00:02:38.550> to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
all right couple more things we need to

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.730 
all right couple more things we need to
do<00:02:39.980> because<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.760> red<00:02:42.360> team<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.380> attacking

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
do because the red team is attacking

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.680 
do because the red team is attacking
they<00:02:46.740> have<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.160> delay<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.510> blue<00:02:48.660> team

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
they have a delay so that the blue team

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.410 
they have a delay so that the blue team
can<00:02:49.110> start<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.590> defense<00:02:49.980> or<00:02:50.310> something<00:02:51.150> I

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
to be a delay in seconds right so 10

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.640 
to be a delay in seconds right so 10
seconds<00:03:05.310> there<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.790> go<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.630> now<00:03:06.660> we<00:03:06.990> set<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.440> few

go
so<00:05:19.770> we<00:05:20.280> both<00:05:20.490> selected<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:20.940> class<00:05:22.430> one<00:05:23.430> team's

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
to capture right so it's the red team

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.950 
to capture right so it's the red team
