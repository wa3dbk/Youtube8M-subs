00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
okay so that's it so I was going to go

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.509 
okay so that's it so I was going to go
for<00:03:59.299> just<00:03:59.870> shape<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.439> so<00:04:00.739> like<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:01.099> get<00:04:01.340> a

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
for just shape and so like you get a

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.460 
for just shape and so like you get a
height<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.360> then<00:04:02.450> if<00:04:02.629> you<00:04:02.780> bring<00:04:03.079> in<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.290> low

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
height and then if you bring in a low

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.960 
height and then if you bring in a low
point<00:04:03.709> and<00:04:03.890> you<00:04:04.069> have<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.310> highest<00:04:04.489> there<00:04:04.819> and

point and you have the highest there and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.580 
point and you have the highest there and
that's<00:04:05.120> balanced<00:04:05.569> so<00:04:05.840> that's<00:04:06.019> really

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
that's balanced so that's really

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.069
