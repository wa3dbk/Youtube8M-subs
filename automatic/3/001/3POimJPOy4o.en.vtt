00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.580
 hello people here is the hd and 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.200
 welcome to another 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.230
 old with teamplay review 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.010
 As you can see today, Soldado is in 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.990
 shape 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.470
 and of course we will be in 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.100
 future also our our 250 subscribers 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.770
 special upload and advertising though 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.600
 thinks he might even have one 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.670
 you can take a small share of it 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.649
 We upload for you 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.820
 but more on that later we will 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.739
 also upload a video 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.289
 however now it goes first to 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.780
 soldado in shape and as always I start 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.179
 his tempo is at his pace 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.460
 striker I have been really acceptable 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.839
 would rate it at 81 82 and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.370
 in my opinion, that's enough 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.800
 perfect for the striker so was 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.999
 even a bit faster than that 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.370
 not in shape 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.989
 the sprint speed is clear 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.699
 better than the entrance is a striker 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.350
 The really still the first ten meters 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.020
 But then you can see that quickly 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.300
 also very clear in the game when I soldado 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.250
 in real seht then realized that was but 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.350
 In any case, the five will be only five 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.420
 meters can really take up the tempo 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.010
 who just a kind of striker well 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.560
 however we come to his 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.990
 next city ​​and that's his best 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.780
 As I thought his best sted was his 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.660
 I would say on the shoot 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.240
 Show your 88 before he was 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.050
 just a fucking punishment room 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.850
 monster long protection like firepower 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.370
 just been bomb his four 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.790
 Shots are outside the sixteen that 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.220
 very good and always in game 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.340
 worshiped 95 finishing but quite honest 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 felt it is 99 because the type has 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.200
 for me, almost every thing goes in well so 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.740
 there you can really a lot of him 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.740
 expect 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.050
 and within the sixteen-meter space 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.740
 He really does everything really everything 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:06.490
 everything and everything pure whether normal shot 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.590
 whether shallow shot there is really everything 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.119
 pure within the sixteen and that 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.830
 is also a very clear one 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.380
 Improvement not in the shape of the so 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.840
 shot will be mega then cured 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.480
 dribbling was like we do not think so 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.459
 his dribbling is okay 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.410
 Ball acceptance and ball control are in 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.720
 order but nothing special is also 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.940
 every now and then a ball skips 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.370
 use rather than second voice and 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.319
 to the storm partner storm partner like dell 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.690
 storage samuel eto'o if you have one 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.760
 would like to have a bit quieter or then 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.500
 neck and dribble if you have a lot 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.190
 has money and so van persie or no 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.959
 Unfortunately, there are only three players 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.870
 star skills and quite a weak one 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.970
 foot makes a bit sometimes 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.580
 safer in the sixteenth and 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.950
 outside so there it is already rather 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.510
 not so much with you anymore 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.980
 wants to play for a long time because that makes 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.480
 sometime after currently just no 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.030
 more fun if you do not do tricks 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.370
 can or otherwise be a pass 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.170
 For the striker was really okay 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.630
 now and then did not come to ball but 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.579
 that happens yes one is not 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.340
 Practical teens like Son Wayne Rooney 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.380
 for example as a striker so then 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.450
 I wanted to give you something again 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.010
 say his headball game because his 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.320
 kopfschutz game made me damn 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.060
 Surprised that had not in shape 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.670
 I have a couple of good head because but 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.150
 the inform values ​​such bulky 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.000
 Another thing was incredible 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.920
 1 79 is expected initially only times 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.819
 not so much of the player from 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.970
 but he has almost every second 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.579
 So head in, the flanks 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.890
 came and almost came to us 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.510
 everyone in there, so I'll say it carefully 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.290
 every second ball was in 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.790
 net be work great lie unfortunately can 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.350
 I tell you in media medien and 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.359
 that's why it's just on midfield 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.799
 and that's why we also tell you 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.750
 You should do it in one of two 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.090
 Try storm and mine 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.010
 ultimately rating is 1 5 from 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.810
 10 possible points so an absolute 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.970
 top striker and the price performance 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.459
 ratio is 99 so his money 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.199
 Definitely worth it was mine 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.199
 people I was called out
