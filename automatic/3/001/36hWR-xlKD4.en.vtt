00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.610
 samp-rp on the fourteenth server and and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:22.500
 finally drove to the casino 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:26.820
 I want to raise a little bit of money and I want 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.570
 save up for a license to carry weapons in 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:36.450
 driving school it costs 50,000 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:40.440
 up now I will find a suitable table by 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.629
 my finances and found the first table 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.629
 now let's see how much the bet will be 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.409
 So 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.960
 but here people say 50,000 and but it 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:58.109
 a very big bet or my order 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.799
 no more money now let's see 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.789
 how many croup will ask up to 50,000 Victor he 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:10.950
 for sure now will ask 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:15.539
 up to 50,000 I'm leaving with the data I will go 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:21.899
 under another table that suits me 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:23.659
 here is another chair found so no this 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.330
 the table is busy 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:36.209
 I go to another table that's perfect finished 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:40.530
 the place is played here right now I will borrow you 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:49.210
 I will bet 1000 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:50.130
 fine yes everything is right now i'm at my place 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.430
 fell out 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.430
 11 points 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:04.710
 so meanwhile me the largest number of 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:12.590
 all other players so there are thousands i 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.590
 win 4000 and so 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.280
 so i got my first win 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:30.260
 Now here's another bet they bet 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.260
 I put another thousand 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.350
 I will look 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.410
 so how many points do I have 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.110
 now I roll the dice and fall out of me 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.290
 five points 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:51.340
 damn lost okay now let's see 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:58.120
 how much will give 4000 well agree 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:00.780
 probably or not 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.780
 I'll wait now 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.370
 another bet so 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:17.920
 so what is the 4,000 bet up okay 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:26.090
 risk but so 4000 I can win 12,000 and 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:29.390
 So I have 12 numbers equal to 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.680
 he is also the first 12 now we probably 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.220
 will replay 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.880
 so at the other 11 we fall now 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.880
 replay 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:50.390
 and so I got a number 10 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:53.480
 another player 4 fine I won 12000 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.200
 and all the money I get is 46,000 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.340
 i need 50 now croup set 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:06.620
 5000 bid well, this is a very big bet 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.860
 they will put wait for something 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.860
 slightly less 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.720
 so come on circle I already install 2000 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.790
 fine 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:24.389
 s2000 can win 10.000 so 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:31.610
 I get the number 4 except already 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:31.610
 lost what it turns out 5-7 4 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.360
 so but now once again put 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.000
 looked 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.400
 so the 2000 rate is excellent agree 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:55.060
 so the number 10 has dropped out of me so far 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:59.560
 most of all here 84 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:05.210
 10 and 7 excellent so I won 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:09.400
 49,000 Wirth rate of 5 thousand but it is very 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:14.200
 I will not risk it, I probably put more 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.200
 I'll wait for a smaller bet 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.680
 so 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.479
 let's throw already 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.479
 1 player 7 dropped 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.680
 So 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.009
 throw faster 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.009
 2 10 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.390
 and have 3 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.640
 7 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:51.039
 so now how many croupiers for delivery 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.039
 2000's perfect to me 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.750
 so now I quit 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:04.610
 the bones so the number 8 falls by me 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:09.550
 which is the most great i won and so 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:12.280
 I earned 52,000 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.290
 Wirth 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.639
 now I need to find a taxi 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:26.190
 to get me to the driving school 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:33.330
 so I purchased a weapon license and 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:33.330
 so now i will leave the casino 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:39.259
 so 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:41.830
 taxi drivers are not around will come as 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.830
 get 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.660
 so now I buy a license to wear 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:57.050
 weapons for 50000 wear I confirm the purchase 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:07:01.870
 and finally all purchased license 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.870
 now he was finally carrying a weapon 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.400
 that's what's going on
