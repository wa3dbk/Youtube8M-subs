now this is the trap trailer that the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.779 
now this is the trap trailer that the
wolves<00:02:07.390> have<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.900> you<00:02:08.349> can<00:02:08.530> see<00:02:08.799> that<00:02:09.069> Sasha's

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
wolves have and you can see that Sasha's

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.270 
wolves have and you can see that Sasha's
outpost<00:02:10.269> here<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:10.810> all<00:02:11.080> burnt<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.769> you've<00:02:12.129> got

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
outpost here is all burnt and you've got

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.539 
outpost here is all burnt and you've got
some<00:02:12.549> holes<00:02:12.819> here<00:02:13.090> in<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:14.680> wall<00:02:14.920> or<00:02:15.190> yeah

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
some holes here in the the wall or yeah

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.940 
some holes here in the the wall or yeah
yeah<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.390> fence<00:02:16.540> for<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.870> wall<00:02:17.440> that

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
yeah the the fence for the wall that

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.180 
yeah the the fence for the wall that
goes<00:02:18.069> around<00:02:18.209> Alexandria<00:02:19.209> so<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.860> think<00:02:20.980> it's

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
goes around Alexandria so I I think it's

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.309 
goes around Alexandria so I I think it's
pretty<00:02:21.310> safe<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.549> assume<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:22.319> definitely

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
pretty safe to assume that definitely

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.110 
pretty safe to assume that definitely
the<00:02:23.440> wolves<00:02:23.769> early<00:02:24.220> on<00:02:24.370> because<00:02:24.640> right<00:02:24.760> now

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
the wolves early on because right now

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.399 
the wolves early on because right now
they're<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.510> know<00:02:25.540> they're<00:02:25.750> probably<00:02:25.930> film

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
they're you know they're probably film

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.440 
they're you know they're probably film
in<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.620> first<00:02:26.799> two<00:02:26.950> episodes<00:02:27.209> maybe<00:02:28.209> not

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
in the first two episodes maybe not

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.759 
in the first two episodes maybe not
right<00:02:28.629> in<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.810> premiere<00:02:29.140> but<00:02:29.170> could<00:02:29.650> be

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
right in the premiere but could be

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.160 
right in the premiere but could be
premiere<00:02:30.129> we'll<00:02:30.909> see<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.659> know<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.959> this

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
premiere we'll see you know this this

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.720 
premiere we'll see you know this this
trailer<00:02:32.590> actually<00:02:32.769> possibly<00:02:33.340> go<00:02:33.459> through<00:02:33.489> a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
trailer actually possibly go through a

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.210 
trailer actually possibly go through a
wall<00:02:34.000> or<00:02:34.269> one<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.599> them<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.680> wolves<00:02:36.040> will

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
wall or one of them and the wolves will

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.850 
wall or one of them and the wolves will
actually<00:02:36.580> Walker<00:02:36.880> bomb<00:02:37.209> Alexandria<00:02:38.200> so

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
actually Walker bomb Alexandria so

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.500 
actually Walker bomb Alexandria so
here's<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.459> hoping<00:02:39.760> that

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
here's the hoping that

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.789 
here's the hoping that
there's<00:02:40.659> more<00:02:40.810> wolves<00:02:41.170> than<00:02:41.260> just<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.620> two

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
there's more wolves than just the two

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.330 
there's more wolves than just the two
I'm<00:02:42.040> sure<00:02:42.220> there<00:02:42.430> probably<00:02:42.790> will<00:02:43.000> be<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:44.340> you

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
I'm sure there probably will be and you

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.280 
I'm sure there probably will be and you
know<00:02:45.430> we're<00:02:45.640> gonna<00:02:45.760> see<00:02:46.000> them<00:02:46.209> use<00:02:46.480> everything

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
know we're gonna see them use everything

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.500 
know we're gonna see them use everything
they<00:02:47.590> can<00:02:47.799> gather<00:02:48.010> at<00:02:48.430> their<00:02:48.610> disposal<00:02:48.909> to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
they can gather at their disposal to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.050 
they can gather at their disposal to
their<00:02:50.409> their<00:02:50.829> benefit<00:02:51.310> when<00:02:51.640> they<00:02:51.760> attack

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
their their benefit when they attack

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.690 
their their benefit when they attack
Alexandria<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.049> actually<00:02:53.470> unleash<00:02:53.829> herd<00:02:54.459> of

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
Alexandria and actually unleash herd of

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.569 
Alexandria and actually unleash herd of
zombies<00:02:55.170> upon<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.860> know<00:02:56.950> Alexandra

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
zombies upon the you know Alexandra

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.520 
zombies upon the you know Alexandra
it--some<00:02:58.150> I'm<00:02:58.329> sure<00:02:58.569> that's<00:02:58.810> probably<00:02:58.989> what

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
it--some I'm sure that's probably what

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.619 
it--some I'm sure that's probably what
the<00:02:59.650> crane<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.099> for<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:01.060> know<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.329> record

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
the crane is for to you know to record

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:02.940 
the crane is for to you know to record
some<00:03:01.810> shots<00:03:02.079> of<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.349> they've<00:03:02.530> covered<00:03:02.860> it

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
some shots of that they've covered it

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.949 
some shots of that they've covered it
with<00:03:03.069> some<00:03:03.310> some<00:03:04.090> black<00:03:04.329> whatever<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:04.900> is

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
with some some black whatever this is

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.509 
with some some black whatever this is
tarp<00:03:05.379> type<00:03:05.620> thing<00:03:05.860> but<00:03:06.010> that's<00:03:06.250> what<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.459> is

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
tarp type thing but that's what it is

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.190 
tarp type thing but that's what it is
underneath<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:07.629> I<00:03:07.720> think<00:03:07.900> there's<00:03:08.109> another

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
underneath and I think there's another

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.899 
underneath and I think there's another
picture<00:03:08.530> here<00:03:08.859> of<00:03:08.890> where<00:03:09.430> they<00:03:09.549> actually<00:03:09.790> got

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
picture here of where they actually got

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.420 
picture here of where they actually got
it<00:03:10.030> from<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:10.629> you<00:03:10.750> can<00:03:10.900> see<00:03:11.049> here<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.310> can

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
it from so you can see here so you can

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.559 
it from so you can see here so you can
you<00:03:12.609> can<00:03:12.640> see<00:03:12.849> that<00:03:13.000> there<00:03:13.209> there's<00:03:13.390> that

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
you can see that there there's that

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.809 
you can see that there there's that
there's<00:03:14.049> that<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.769> know<00:03:14.799> building<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.730> was

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
there's that you know building that was

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.190 
there's that you know building that was
there<00:03:15.970> too<00:03:16.180> here's<00:03:16.420> here's<00:03:16.629> the<00:03:16.690> wall<00:03:16.959> right

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
there too here's here's the wall right

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.449 
there too here's here's the wall right
here<00:03:17.230> Alexandra<00:03:17.920> wall<00:03:18.129> but<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.340> can
