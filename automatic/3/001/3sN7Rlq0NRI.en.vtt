you<00:00:21.150> know<00:00:21.270> what<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.449> noticed<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.619> looked

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
horrible when I put everything back it

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.070 
horrible when I put everything back it
looks<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.650> clean<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.250> naked<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.390> thought<00:00:27.750> as

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
looks so clean and naked so I thought as

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.779 
looks so clean and naked so I thought as
I<00:00:28.140> was<00:00:28.439> putting<00:00:28.590> things<00:00:28.830> back<00:00:28.920> I'd<00:00:29.340> give<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
I was putting things back I'd give you a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.569 
I was putting things back I'd give you a
quick<00:00:29.970> show<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.170> because<00:00:31.529> really<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.160> think

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
quick show of it because really I think

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.580 
quick show of it because really I think
it's<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> layering<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.510> stuff<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.350> really

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
it's the layering of stuff that really

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
it's the layering of stuff that really
makes<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.890> room<00:00:35.070> look<00:00:35.219> finished<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.820> complete

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
makes a room look finished and complete

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.240 
makes a room look finished and complete
and<00:00:36.450> without<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.989> stuff<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:37.890> kind<00:00:38.219> of

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and without that stuff it just kind of

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.600 
and without that stuff it just kind of
looks<00:00:38.460> off<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.149> naked<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.379> come<00:00:40.770> with<00:00:40.860> me<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.219> I

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
room they buy a really this isn't a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.100 
room they buy a really this isn't a
really<00:01:02.820> nice<00:01:02.969> expensive<00:01:03.300> sofa<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:03.930> they<00:01:04.019> buy

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
really nice expensive sofa but they buy

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.170 
really nice expensive sofa but they buy
like<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> really<00:01:04.650> nice<00:01:04.799> expensive<00:01:05.189> sofa<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
like a really nice expensive sofa you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.179 
like a really nice expensive sofa you
put<00:01:06.360> some<00:01:06.479> pictures<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> walls<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.439> then

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
put some pictures on the walls and then

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.280 
put some pictures on the walls and then
they<00:01:08.820> wonder<00:01:09.090> why<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.720> doesn't<00:01:10.110> look

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
they wonder why it just doesn't look

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.560 
they wonder why it just doesn't look
finished<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.580> think<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.240> secret

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
finished and I think really the secret

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140 
finished and I think really the secret
is<00:01:12.720> layering<00:01:13.710> when<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.610> comes<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.000> decorating

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
is layering when it comes to decorating

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.649 
is layering when it comes to decorating
a<00:01:15.720> living<00:01:16.439> room<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.770> layering<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:18.150> even<00:01:18.540> though

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
a living room is layering so even though

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.719 
a living room is layering so even though
we<00:01:18.780> already<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.470> carpet<00:01:19.799> here<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.520> lot

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
we already have a carpet here and a lot

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
we already have a carpet here and a lot
of<00:01:21.060> people<00:01:21.270> say<00:01:21.420> no<00:01:21.689> no<00:01:21.930> no<00:01:22.140> never<00:01:22.439> put<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
of people say no no no never put a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.640 
of people say no no no never put a
carpet<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> carpet<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:24.259> had<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> really

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
carpet on the carpet I had this really

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.620 
carpet on the carpet I had this really
old<00:01:25.799> carpet<00:01:26.189> from<00:01:26.310> our<00:01:26.460> old<00:01:26.670> house<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.360> I've

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
old carpet from our old house that I've

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.410 
old carpet from our old house that I've
had<00:01:27.810> actually<00:01:28.290> since<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.009> was<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> teenager<00:01:29.610> but

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
had actually since I was a teenager but

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.600 
had actually since I was a teenager but
I<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> look<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.590> layering<00:01:32.310> I

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
I really like the look of layering I

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
I really like the look of layering I
think<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.880> defines<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> area<00:01:33.659> even<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.500> it's

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
think it defines the area even if it's

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.539 
think it defines the area even if it's
putting<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> over<00:01:35.400> an<00:01:35.640> old<00:01:35.759> carpet<00:01:37.369> okay<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.430> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
putting it over an old carpet okay so I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.310 
putting it over an old carpet okay so I
threw<00:01:38.729> down<00:01:38.820> my<00:01:38.970> old<00:01:39.180> carpet<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.810> carpet<00:01:40.200> is

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
threw down my old carpet this carpet is

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.749 
threw down my old carpet this carpet is

flank it on either side so I have these
really<00:02:32.030> cheap<00:02:32.240> tables<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.810> got<00:02:33.590> from<00:02:33.800> Walmart

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
really cheap tables I got from Walmart

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.520 
really cheap tables I got from Walmart
because<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.850> needed<00:02:35.180> end<00:02:35.480> tables<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.140> I'm<00:02:36.230> way

too<00:02:36.590> cheap<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:36.980> buy<00:02:37.250> expensive<00:02:37.850> furniture

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
too cheap to buy expensive furniture

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.760 
too cheap to buy expensive furniture
it's<00:02:40.910> definitely<00:02:41.450> looking<00:02:41.600> better<00:02:41.780> but<00:02:42.200> I

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
it's definitely looking better but I

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.590 
it's definitely looking better but I
think<00:02:42.860> living<00:02:43.400> rooms<00:02:43.640> look<00:02:43.850> really<00:02:44.270> naked

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
think living rooms look really naked

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.230 
think living rooms look really naked
without<00:02:44.990> a<00:02:45.590> coffee<00:02:46.310> table<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:46.940> our<00:02:47.030> coffee

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
without a coffee table and our coffee

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.170 
without a coffee table and our coffee
table<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.600> really<00:02:47.840> old<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.380> beat<00:02:48.590> up<00:02:48.700> but<00:02:49.700> an

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
table is really old and beat up but an

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.210 
table is really old and beat up but an
old<00:02:50.600> beat-up<00:02:50.870> coffee<00:02:51.200> table<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.710> better<00:02:51.950> than

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
old beat-up coffee table is better than

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.830 
old beat-up coffee table is better than
no<00:02:52.700> coffee<00:02:53.120> table<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:56.180> much<00:02:56.330> better<00:02:56.540> right

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
no coffee table so much better right

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.130 
no coffee table so much better right
um<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.190> just<00:02:58.490> put<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:59.060> table<00:02:59.510> runner<00:02:59.660> on<00:02:59.810> it

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
um and I just put a table runner on it

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.350 
um and I just put a table runner on it
because<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.770> so<00:03:01.010> scratched<00:03:01.340> my<00:03:02.000> daycare

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
because it is so scratched my daycare

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.210 
because it is so scratched my daycare
kids<00:03:02.570> used<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.810> bang<00:03:03.080> on<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.410> drive<00:03:03.620> cars<00:03:03.950> in<00:03:04.100> it

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
kids used to bang on it drive cars in it

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.400 
kids used to bang on it drive cars in it
I<00:03:04.430> have<00:03:04.610> three<00:03:04.940> kids<00:03:05.210> so<00:03:05.420> obviously<00:03:05.990> it's<00:03:06.230> not

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
I have three kids so obviously it's not

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.130 
I have three kids so obviously it's not
going<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.710> be<00:03:06.800> perfect<00:03:07.220> but<00:03:08.120> having<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.870> table

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
going to be perfect but having the table

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.140 
going to be perfect but having the table
runner<00:03:09.290> on<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.590> first<00:03:10.010> of<00:03:10.160> all<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.490> layers<00:03:10.820> it

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
runner on it first of all it layers it

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.310 
runner on it first of all it layers it
so<00:03:11.270> it<00:03:11.390> does<00:03:11.540> make<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.750> look<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.020> little<00:03:12.110> bit

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
so it does make it look a little bit

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.470 
so it does make it look a little bit
nicer<00:03:12.440> because<00:03:12.770> it<00:03:12.860> adds<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.160> pop<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.460> color<00:03:13.610> but

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
nicer because it adds a pop of color but

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.190 
nicer because it adds a pop of color but
also<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:15.560> hides<00:03:15.890> how<00:03:16.490> horribly<00:03:17.480> scratched<00:03:17.930> it

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
also it hides how horribly scratched it

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.000 
also it hides how horribly scratched it
is<00:03:18.350> so<00:03:19.250> um<00:03:19.780> let's<00:03:20.780> continue<00:03:21.200> with<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.709> most

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
is so um let's continue with the most

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.699 
is so um let's continue with the most
important<00:03:22.730> part<00:03:23.540> if<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.900> ask<00:03:24.020> me<00:03:24.200> anyways

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
important part if you ask me anyways

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.199 
important part if you ask me anyways
it's<00:03:27.709> so<00:03:27.980> dark<00:03:28.220> in<00:03:28.310> here<00:03:28.520> so<00:03:28.670> it's<00:03:28.790> hard<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.060> see

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
it's so dark in here so it's hard to see

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.960 
it's so dark in here so it's hard to see
but<00:03:29.390> throw<00:03:29.810> pillows<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:30.860> make<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.550> difference

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
but throw pillows so make the difference

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.030 
but throw pillows so make the difference
these<00:03:32.510> are<00:03:32.570> just<00:03:32.870> cheap<00:03:32.959> cheap<00:03:33.530> cheap<00:03:33.560> throw

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
these are just cheap cheap cheap throw

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.630 
these are just cheap cheap cheap throw
pillows<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:35.120> I<00:03:35.180> got<00:03:35.450> from<00:03:36.050> Walmart<00:03:36.950> but<00:03:37.490> like

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
pillows that I got from Walmart but like

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.420 
pillows that I got from Walmart but like
a<00:03:37.750> couch<00:03:38.750> without<00:03:39.110> pillows<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:39.620> think<00:03:39.830> it<00:03:40.070> looks

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
a couch without pillows I think it looks

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.420 
a couch without pillows I think it looks
so<00:03:40.730> naked<00:03:41.390> it's<00:03:42.320> like<00:03:42.500> going<00:03:42.950> out<00:03:43.100> of<00:03:43.280> the

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
so naked it's like going out of the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.960 
so naked it's like going out of the
house<00:03:43.610> without<00:03:44.330> a<00:03:44.480> shirt<00:03:44.900> on<00:03:45.050> it<00:03:45.290> just<00:03:45.470> seems

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
house without a shirt on it just seems

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.180 
house without a shirt on it just seems
naked<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.150> weird<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.020> these<00:03:48.590> are<00:03:48.800> really

naked and weird so these are really
cheap<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.640> think<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.970> paid<00:03:50.209> like<00:03:50.890> $9<00:03:51.890> each<00:03:52.390> for

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.550 
cheap I think I paid like $9 each for
these<00:03:54.190> just<00:03:55.190> plain<00:03:55.730> throw<00:03:56.600> pillows<00:03:56.959> but<00:03:57.440> you

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
colors when choosing placements of

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.229 
colors when choosing placements of
objects<00:04:11.360> on<00:04:11.540> on<00:04:12.500> surfaces<00:04:13.100> I<00:04:13.310> like<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:13.820> do<00:04:13.970> odd

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
objects on on surfaces I like to do odd

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.740 
objects on on surfaces I like to do odd
numbers<00:04:14.810> so<00:04:15.080> for<00:04:15.920> me<00:04:16.070> this<00:04:16.310> looks<00:04:16.520> like<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:16.760> 1/2

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
numbers so for me this looks like a 1/2

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.170 
numbers so for me this looks like a 1/2
right<00:04:18.500> like<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.830> 1/2<00:04:19.370> but<00:04:19.609> there<00:04:19.760> seems<00:04:20.000> like

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
right like a 1/2 but there seems like

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.219 
right like a 1/2 but there seems like
there<00:04:20.330> should<00:04:20.359> be<00:04:20.540> something<00:04:20.870> in<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.169> middle

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
there should be something in the middle

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.770 
there should be something in the middle
to<00:04:21.590> make<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.950> 3/4<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.610> focal<00:04:22.940> point<00:04:23.150> so<00:04:23.720> I'm

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780

three there so yeah hopefully you think

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.340 
three there so yeah hopefully you think

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
it looks better I definitely need some

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.520

blinds<00:04:43.860> for<00:04:44.130> my<00:04:44.280> window<00:04:44.670> so<00:04:45.420> that's<00:04:45.840> next<00:04:46.260> on

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
blinds for my window so that's next on

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.060 
blinds for my window so that's next on
the<00:04:46.650> list

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
the list

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.170 
the list
and<00:04:47.570> yeah<00:04:48.570> that's<00:04:49.370> layering<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.580> living<00:04:50.970> room

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
and yeah that's layering a living room

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.680 
and yeah that's layering a living room
with<00:04:51.840> pillows<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.680> throws<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.880> rugs<00:04:54.390> and

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
with pillows and throws and rugs and

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.510 
with pillows and throws and rugs and
lamps<00:04:55.170> I<00:04:55.380> think<00:04:55.920> those<00:04:56.100> are<00:04:56.130> all<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.490> things

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
lamps I think those are all the things

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.940 
lamps I think those are all the things
that<00:04:56.970> are<00:04:57.060> necessary<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:57.720> sort<00:04:58.140> of<00:04:58.200> pull<00:04:58.620> the

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
that are necessary to sort of pull the

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.700 
that are necessary to sort of pull the
room<00:04:59.130> together<00:04:59.400> so<00:04:59.940> it<00:05:00.060> doesn't<00:05:00.330> look<00:05:00.560> kind<00:05:01.560> of

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
room together so it doesn't look kind of

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.620 
room together so it doesn't look kind of
empty<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:02.720> naked<00:05:05.030> so<00:05:06.030> here's<00:05:06.240> my<00:05:06.390> final

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
empty and naked so here's my final

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.870 
empty and naked so here's my final
finished<00:05:07.440> living<00:05:07.590> room<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.640> can<00:05:08.760> see

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
finished living room and you can see

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.340 
finished living room and you can see
that<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.090> added<00:05:09.270> blinds<00:05:09.930> but<00:05:10.020> I<00:05:10.080> just<00:05:10.230> think

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
that I added blinds but I just think

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.080 
that I added blinds but I just think
it's<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.620> finishing<00:05:10.980> touch<00:05:11.280> that<00:05:11.760> makes<00:05:11.970> it

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
it's the finishing touch that makes it

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.710 
it's the finishing touch that makes it
look<00:05:12.240> a<00:05:12.420> lot<00:05:12.720> nicer<00:05:13.280> this<00:05:14.280> window<00:05:14.820> is<00:05:15.060> really
