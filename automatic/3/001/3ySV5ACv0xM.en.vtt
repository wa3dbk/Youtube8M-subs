00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
August 2013 and I'm looking at the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.940 
August 2013 and I'm looking at the
oncidium<00:00:08.040> dancing<00:00:08.610> lady<00:00:08.820> if<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.150> remember

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
oncidium dancing lady if you remember

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.100 
oncidium dancing lady if you remember
this<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.219> very<00:00:11.639> very<00:00:11.820> tightly<00:00:12.210> packed<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:13.049> here

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
this is very very tightly packed in here

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.390 
this is very very tightly packed in here
and<00:00:13.769> gave<00:00:14.009> me<00:00:14.130> many<00:00:14.490> many<00:00:14.730> multiple<00:00:15.389> spikes

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
and gave me many many multiple spikes

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.760 
and gave me many many multiple spikes
here's<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.460> bit<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.730> leaf<00:00:17.910> damage<00:00:18.240> from<00:00:19.170> being

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
here's a bit of leaf damage from being

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.910 
here's a bit of leaf damage from being
crimped<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> garden<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.830> nasty<00:00:22.830> all

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
crimped in the garden but nasty all

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.160 
crimped in the garden but nasty all
right<00:00:23.160> yeah<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:25.789> I'm<00:00:26.789> now<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.630> report<00:00:27.990> it

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
right yeah so I'm now going to report it

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.269 
right yeah so I'm now going to report it
that<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.740> will<00:00:29.010> pipe<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.660> hope<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.859> could

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
that I will pipe and I hope that I could

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.500 
that I will pipe and I hope that I could
divide<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.000> into<00:00:33.420> several<00:00:33.660> plots<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:35.510> all

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
divide this into several plots so all

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.810 
divide this into several plots so all
the<00:00:36.780> plants<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.410> done<00:00:37.670> biking<00:00:38.670> I'm

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the plants that have done biking I'm

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.130 
the plants that have done biking I'm
going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.469> sort<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.530> keep<00:00:40.829> them<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.140> looking

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
going to sort of keep them and looking

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.010 
going to sort of keep them and looking
for<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.590> new<00:00:43.800> babies<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:45.360> will<00:00:45.510> probably<00:00:45.870> be

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
for the new babies that will probably be

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.830 
for the new babies that will probably be
the<00:00:46.170> source<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:46.829> next<00:00:47.190> fight<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the source of my next fight so this is a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.450 
the source of my next fight so this is a
new<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.489> amount<00:00:51.120> Heat<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.370> here's<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
new one this is amount Heat and here's a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
new one this is amount Heat and here's a
new<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> potential<00:00:55.399> plant

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
new one so this is a potential plant

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
new one so this is a potential plant
then<00:00:57.480> there's<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> middle<00:00:58.350> there

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
then there's one in the middle there

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.700 
then there's one in the middle there
this<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.550> that's<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.239> potential<00:01:00.690> plant<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
this one that's a potential plant so I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.100 
this one that's a potential plant so I
have<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> few<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.520> there<00:01:02.730> I'm<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> divide

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
have a few in there I'm going to divide

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.940 
have a few in there I'm going to divide
this<00:01:04.439> into<00:01:05.040> three<00:01:05.090> spots<00:01:06.229> so<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
this into three spots so here are the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.120 
this into three spots so here are the
four<00:01:08.189> forgot<00:01:08.640> here<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:10.020> I'm<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
four forgot here and here I'm going to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.010 
four forgot here and here I'm going to
put<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:12.229> think<00:01:13.229> pure<00:01:13.530> Moss<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.840> see<00:01:15.840> what

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
put I think pure Moss and see what

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.609 
put I think pure Moss and see what
happens<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.560> how<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.900> stop<00:01:18.900> wiping

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
happens so how do I have to stop wiping

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.899 
happens so how do I have to stop wiping
this<00:01:20.070> plant<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:22.009> pull<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.700> its<00:01:24.180> pot<00:01:24.560> I

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
this plant and pull it out of its pot I

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.520 
this plant and pull it out of its pot I
just<00:01:26.909> need<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> very<00:01:27.540> very<00:01:27.750> rootbound<00:01:28.200> very

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
just need a very very rootbound very

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.789 
just need a very very rootbound very
tight<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.509> need<00:01:30.659> two<00:01:30.930> hands<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.470> put

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
tight and I just need two hands and put

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.380 
tight and I just need two hands and put
down<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> camera<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.549> come<00:01:33.060> back<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.329> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
down the camera and come back in a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.890 
down the camera and come back in a
second<00:01:34.220> okay<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.280> here<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.659> very

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
second okay so here it is very very

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.160 
second okay so here it is very very
tight<00:01:37.229> root<00:01:37.680> bound<00:01:37.979> plant<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.869> we<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:39.960> going

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
tight root bound plant and we are going

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.539 
tight root bound plant and we are going
to<00:01:40.320> divide<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:42.920> try<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.130> separate

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
to divide this up and try and separate

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.950 
to divide this up and try and separate
the<00:01:44.790> root<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.950> also<00:01:47.180> divide<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.360> plants<00:01:48.780> so

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the root and also divide the plants so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.319 
the root and also divide the plants so
that<00:01:48.990> there<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.649> main<00:01:49.979> bulb<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:51.119> baby

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
that there is one main bulb and a baby

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.410 
that there is one main bulb and a baby
along<00:01:52.290> with<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.549> probably<00:01:53.759> make<00:01:54.090> three

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
along with it so it probably make three

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.359 
along with it so it probably make three
divisions<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.320> I'll<00:01:55.680> show<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.950> when<00:01:56.250> they

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
divisions and I'll show you when they

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.429 
divisions and I'll show you when they
are<00:01:56.430> fully<00:01:56.670> separated<00:01:57.180> I'm<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.380> to

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
are fully separated I'm just going to

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.280 
are fully separated I'm just going to
work<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.979> gently<00:01:59.399> gently<00:01:59.850> try<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.049> ease

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
work on this gently gently try and ease

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.240 
work on this gently gently try and ease
out<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.590> roots<00:02:02.009> okay<00:02:03.049> okay<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.219> are

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
out the roots okay okay so here we are

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.830 
out the roots okay okay so here we are
again<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:07.110> separated<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:07.920> part<00:02:08.569> from<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
again I have separated one part from the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.029 
again I have separated one part from the
plant<00:02:10.140> there

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
plant there

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.759 
plant there
it's<00:02:11.760> very<00:02:12.030> very<00:02:12.269> tight<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.870> can<00:02:13.470> see<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
it's very very tight you can see the

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.420 
it's very very tight you can see the
roots<00:02:14.040> are<00:02:14.340> now<00:02:14.580> separated<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.739> I<00:02:16.739> won't<00:02:17.220> show

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
roots are now separated and I won't show

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.420 
roots are now separated and I won't show
you<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.610> medium<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.659> I<00:02:18.720> pulled<00:02:19.019> out<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:20.159> is

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
you the medium that I pulled out it is

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.729 
you the medium that I pulled out it is
very<00:02:20.459> soggy<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.450> actually<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.019> thought<00:02:22.379> it<00:02:22.439> was

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
very soggy and actually I thought it was

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.960 
very soggy and actually I thought it was
soil<00:02:23.129> but<00:02:24.090> it's<00:02:24.269> not<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:24.840> act<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.709> is<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:26.010> bark

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
soil but it's not it's act it is a bark

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.030 
soil but it's not it's act it is a bark
medium<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.599> has<00:02:27.750> become<00:02:27.959> extremely<00:02:28.440> mushy

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
medium that has become extremely mushy

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.789 
medium that has become extremely mushy
and<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:30.150> only<00:02:30.329> thing<00:02:30.599> that's<00:02:30.810> sort<00:02:31.709> of

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
and the only thing that's sort of

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.280 
and the only thing that's sort of
helping<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.400> dry<00:02:32.610> out<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.390> bits<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:34.049> stone

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
helping it dry out is the bits of stone

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.180 
helping it dry out is the bits of stone
and<00:02:34.560> perlite<00:02:34.980> in<00:02:35.310> there<00:02:35.549> so<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:37.620> course<00:02:37.829> in<00:02:38.069> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
and perlite in there so of course in the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.280 
and perlite in there so of course in the
process<00:02:38.609> of<00:02:38.730> separation<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.599> had<00:02:39.780> some<00:02:40.019> root

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
process of separation I had some root

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.979 
process of separation I had some root
loss<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.829> had<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.129> cut<00:02:41.310> away<00:02:41.450> because<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.569> was<00:02:42.689> so

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
loss I had to cut away because it was so

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.039 
loss I had to cut away because it was so
very<00:02:43.349> tight<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.519> I'm<00:02:44.790> going<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.030> keep<00:02:45.209> on<00:02:45.420> going

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
very tight so I'm going to keep on going

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.289 
very tight so I'm going to keep on going
here<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.650> really<00:02:46.920> looks<00:02:47.220> almost<00:02:47.519> like<00:02:47.819> soil

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
here it really looks almost like soil

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.530 
here it really looks almost like soil
doesn't<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.900> but<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.349> isn't<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.980> doubt<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.940> you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
doesn't it but it isn't I doubt that you

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.960 
doesn't it but it isn't I doubt that you
could<00:02:51.720> grow<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.799> plant<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.370> soil<00:02:53.639> this<00:02:53.909> is

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
could grow this plant in soil this is

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.869 
could grow this plant in soil this is
just<00:02:54.480> rotted<00:02:56.000> medium<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.659> it<00:02:57.810> shows<00:02:58.049> like<00:02:58.379> how

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
just rotted medium so it shows like how

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.629 
just rotted medium so it shows like how
bad<00:02:59.879> can<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.329> get<00:03:00.629> so<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:02.010> know<00:03:02.129> this<00:03:02.459> is

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
bad can it get so you know this is

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.640 
bad can it get so you know this is
definitely<00:03:02.909> definitely<00:03:03.450> needed<00:03:04.079> reporting

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
definitely definitely needed reporting

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.910 
definitely definitely needed reporting
so<00:03:05.459> okay<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.389> our<00:03:06.659> next<00:03:06.780> division<00:03:07.440> will

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
so okay so our next division will

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.699 
so okay so our next division will
probably<00:03:08.489> be<00:03:08.700> somewhere<00:03:09.120> here<00:03:09.540> I'm<00:03:09.959> trying<00:03:10.530> to

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
probably be somewhere here I'm trying to

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.640 
probably be somewhere here I'm trying to
keep<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.879> mother<00:03:12.150> mother<00:03:12.659> bulb<00:03:12.959> with<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.379> baby

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
keep the mother mother bulb with a baby

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.670 
keep the mother mother bulb with a baby
bulb<00:03:13.950> together<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.629> that<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.260> know<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.500> root

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
bulb together so that you know the root

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.699 
bulb together so that you know the root
system<00:03:17.129> doesn't<00:03:17.489> get<00:03:17.579> damaged<00:03:18.079> okay<00:03:19.079> we'll

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
system doesn't get damaged okay we'll

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.619 
system doesn't get damaged okay we'll
keep<00:03:19.889> pushing<00:03:20.280> I'll<00:03:20.970> show<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.389> finished

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
keep pushing I'll show you the finished

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:22.930 
keep pushing I'll show you the finished
product

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
product

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.939 
product
okay<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.000> here<00:03:24.510> we<00:03:24.660> go<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:26.160> although<00:03:27.889> this<00:03:28.889> is

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
okay so here we go so although this is

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.580 
okay so here we go so although this is
the<00:03:29.220> root<00:03:29.430> loss<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:30.060> came<00:03:30.359> out<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.079> all<00:03:31.410> the

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
the root loss that came out and all the

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.460 
the root loss that came out and all the
soil<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:32.160> came<00:03:32.400> out<00:03:32.579> or<00:03:32.910> rather<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.989> rotten

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
soil that came out or rather the rotten

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.900 
soil that came out or rather the rotten
bark<00:03:34.889> and<00:03:35.510> is<00:03:36.510> mushy<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.379> so<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.310> got<00:03:38.609> three

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
bark and is mushy and so I got three

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:46.220 
bark and is mushy and so I got three
segments<00:03:39.510> one<00:03:40.430> two<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:42.510> three<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:45.230> think

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
segments one two and three and I think

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.449 
segments one two and three and I think
that's<00:03:46.379> the<00:03:46.500> best<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.829> could<00:03:46.889> do<00:03:47.160> with<00:03:47.310> the

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
that's the best I could do with the

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.020 
that's the best I could do with the
roots<00:03:47.930> without<00:03:49.069> losing<00:03:50.069> them<00:03:50.250> all<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.699> think<00:03:50.940> it

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
roots without losing them all I think it

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.759 
roots without losing them all I think it
might<00:03:51.209> have<00:03:51.359> lost<00:03:51.540> some<00:03:51.720> roots<00:03:52.079> but<00:03:52.319> I<00:03:52.379> hope<00:03:52.590> it

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
might have lost some roots but I hope it

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.580 
might have lost some roots but I hope it
can<00:03:52.889> recover<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.750> tried<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.109> kept<00:03:55.440> the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
can recover so I tried to kept the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.369 
can recover so I tried to kept the
babies<00:03:55.980> as<00:03:56.250> close<00:03:56.609> to<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.940> mother<00:03:57.120> bulb<00:03:58.109> as

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
babies as close to the mother bulb as

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.920 
babies as close to the mother bulb as
possible<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.250> trying<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.120> preserve<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.720> root

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
possible and trying to preserve the root

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.770 
possible and trying to preserve the root
but<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.500> was<00:04:01.709> so<00:04:01.980> entangled<00:04:02.669> I<00:04:02.849> just<00:04:03.389> have<00:04:03.629> to

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
but it was so entangled I just have to

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.089 
but it was so entangled I just have to
go<00:04:03.959> like<00:04:04.919> cut<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.900> know<00:04:07.379> I'm<00:04:07.620> sure<00:04:07.650> and

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
go like cut it and you know I'm sure and

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.289 
go like cut it and you know I'm sure and
in<00:04:08.639> the<00:04:08.790> mess<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.239> lost<00:04:09.540> some<00:04:09.870> roots<00:04:10.139> and

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
in the mess I lost some roots and

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.649 
in the mess I lost some roots and
imagine<00:04:12.299> all<00:04:12.479> this<00:04:13.049> all<00:04:13.440> this<00:04:14.359> three<00:04:15.359> plants

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
imagine all this all this three plants

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.640 
imagine all this all this three plants
and<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.889> was<00:04:17.579> all<00:04:18.000> packed<00:04:18.299> into<00:04:18.690> this<00:04:18.959> this

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
and that was all packed into this this

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.930 
and that was all packed into this this
one<00:04:19.859> pot

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
one pot

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.470 
one pot
believe<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.690> it's<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:22.710> tight<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:23.790> now<00:04:24.090> what<00:04:24.360> I'm

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
believe it it's so tight so now what I'm

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.680 
believe it it's so tight so now what I'm
going<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.750> do<00:04:24.960> is<00:04:25.430> pack<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.610> inside<00:04:27.090> moss<00:04:27.420> and

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
going to do is pack it inside moss and

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.070 
going to do is pack it inside moss and
bark<00:04:28.340> mixture<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.870> put<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:31.190> on<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.400> side<00:04:33.080> like

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
bark mixture and put it on the side like

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.240 
bark mixture and put it on the side like
that<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.720> new<00:04:36.900> buds<00:04:37.170> have<00:04:37.590> room<00:04:37.980> to

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
that so that the new buds have room to

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.780 
that so that the new buds have room to
grow<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:40.290> farmers<00:04:40.740> do<00:04:40.890> it<00:04:41.010> on<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.310> side<00:04:41.550> so

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
grow so the farmers do it on the side so

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.870 
grow so the farmers do it on the side so
they<00:04:42.000> can<00:04:42.060> keep<00:04:42.360> growing<00:04:42.570> this<00:04:42.930> way<00:04:43.340> so<00:04:44.340> I

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
they can keep growing this way so I

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.990 
they can keep growing this way so I
think<00:04:45.540> I<00:04:45.870> will<00:04:46.020> put<00:04:46.200> it<00:04:47.100> does<00:04:47.340> seem<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.670> enjoy

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
think I will put it does seem to enjoy

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.150 
think I will put it does seem to enjoy
the<00:04:48.450> moisture<00:04:48.900> so<00:04:49.140> I'll<00:04:49.260> put<00:04:49.500> quite<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.740> lot<00:04:50.010> of

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
the moisture so I'll put quite a lot of

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.820 
the moisture so I'll put quite a lot of
moss<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.850> mix<00:04:51.690> it<00:04:51.870> with<00:04:52.020> bark<00:04:52.320> so<00:04:52.620> I'm<00:04:52.680> going

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
moss and mix it with bark so I'm going

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.910 
moss and mix it with bark so I'm going
to<00:04:52.860> try<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.100> 50/50<00:04:53.910> mixture<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.660> see<00:04:55.590> how<00:04:55.770> it

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
to try a 50/50 mixture and see how it

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.370 
to try a 50/50 mixture and see how it
goes<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:56.430> really<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.330> can't<00:04:57.690> get<00:04:57.900> over<00:04:57.930> the

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
goes and really I can't get over the

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.980 
goes and really I can't get over the
rottenness<00:04:59.250> of<00:04:59.640> this<00:04:59.850> you<00:05:00.420> see<00:05:00.600> it's<00:05:00.780> not<00:05:00.930> like

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
rottenness of this you see it's not like

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.530 
rottenness of this you see it's not like
soil<00:05:01.530> so<00:05:01.920> I<00:05:01.980> will<00:05:02.250> leave<00:05:02.430> sort<00:05:02.760> of<00:05:02.850> brown

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
soil so I will leave sort of brown

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.950 
soil so I will leave sort of brown
smudgy<00:05:04.110> marks<00:05:04.440> so<00:05:04.890> this<00:05:05.040> is<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.520> just<00:05:06.330> rotten

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
smudgy marks so this is the just rotten

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.070 
smudgy marks so this is the just rotten
bark<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:08.010> have<00:05:08.190> never<00:05:08.430> seen<00:05:08.760> this<00:05:08.970> so<00:05:09.690> my<00:05:09.840> guess

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
bark I have never seen this so my guess

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.410 
bark I have never seen this so my guess
is<00:05:10.290> that<00:05:10.620> these<00:05:10.890> these<00:05:11.520> plants<00:05:11.940> have<00:05:12.090> been<00:05:12.120> in

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
is that these these plants have been in

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.830 
is that these these plants have been in
that<00:05:12.660> pot<00:05:13.160> for<00:05:14.160> a<00:05:14.190> few<00:05:14.520> years<00:05:14.820> I<00:05:15.120> would<00:05:15.630> think

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
that pot for a few years I would think

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.660 
that pot for a few years I would think
and<00:05:16.110> every<00:05:16.500> time<00:05:16.680> it's<00:05:16.890> spiking<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.580> you

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
and every time it's spiking and you

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.450 
and every time it's spiking and you
don't<00:05:17.880> be<00:05:18.030> like<00:05:18.180> disturbing<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.410> you<00:05:20.310> know

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
don't be like disturbing it so you know

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.980 
don't be like disturbing it so you know
I'm<00:05:21.120> going<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.360> wash<00:05:21.540> this<00:05:21.780> out<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.640> repot<00:05:23.640> it

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
there's room for the plants to grow now

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.540

so this one has the baby plant here this
one<00:05:57.270> has<00:05:58.370> this<00:05:59.370> one<00:05:59.669> here<00:06:00.060> and<00:06:00.210> that<00:06:01.200> one<00:06:01.530> over

there<00:06:02.550> yeah<00:06:03.240> so<00:06:04.200> there's<00:06:04.560> no<00:06:04.710> way<00:06:04.890> I<00:06:04.919> could

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
there yeah so there's no way I could

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.340 
there yeah so there's no way I could
arrange<00:06:05.580> it<00:06:05.820> in<00:06:06.030> the<00:06:06.150> pot<00:06:06.390> either<00:06:06.720> way<00:06:07.020> any

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
arrange it in the pot either way any

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.290 
arrange it in the pot either way any
diameter<00:06:07.770> you<00:06:08.130> take<00:06:08.340> it<00:06:08.520> would<00:06:08.700> be<00:06:08.850> spreading

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
diameter you take it would be spreading

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.470 
diameter you take it would be spreading
like<00:06:09.450> that<00:06:09.690> and<00:06:10.250> this<00:06:11.250> one<00:06:11.550> back<00:06:12.210> in<00:06:12.390> the

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
like that and this one back in the

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.770 
like that and this one back in the
mother's<00:06:12.810> mother<00:06:13.260> pot<00:06:13.530> is<00:06:13.800> this<00:06:14.790> is<00:06:14.970> a<00:06:15.000> new

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
mother's mother pot is this is a new

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.600 
mother's mother pot is this is a new
plant<00:06:16.080> it's<00:06:16.770> not

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
plant it's not

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.210 
plant it's not
the<00:06:18.789> new<00:06:18.939> plant<00:06:20.789> this<00:06:21.789> one<00:06:22.060> here<00:06:22.330> so<00:06:23.259> plenty<00:06:24.189> of

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
the new plant this one here so plenty of

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.760 
the new plant this one here so plenty of
room<00:06:24.310> for<00:06:24.490> the<00:06:24.849> oncidium<00:06:25.479> to<00:06:25.720> grow<00:06:25.930> nice<00:06:26.740> and

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
room for the oncidium to grow nice and

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.309 
room for the oncidium to grow nice and
moist<00:06:27.219> medium<00:06:27.789> I<00:06:27.939> will<00:06:28.120> be<00:06:28.330> I<00:06:28.569> have<00:06:28.900> packed<00:06:29.110> it

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 
moist medium I will be I have packed it

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.189 
moist medium I will be I have packed it
nice<00:06:29.560> and<00:06:29.590> tight<00:06:30.039> and<00:06:30.449> the<00:06:31.449> roots<00:06:31.659> will<00:06:31.900> grow<00:06:32.080> I

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
nice and tight and the roots will grow I

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.200 
nice and tight and the roots will grow I
think<00:06:32.439> the<00:06:32.710> plant<00:06:32.949> will<00:06:33.129> rest<00:06:33.400> for<00:06:33.520> a<00:06:33.669> bit

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
think the plant will rest for a bit

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.439 
think the plant will rest for a bit
recover<00:06:34.960> from<00:06:35.139> the<00:06:35.319> shock<00:06:35.349> of<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:36.449> separating

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449 
recover from the shock of the separating

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:40.740 
recover from the shock of the separating
and<00:06:38.370> hopefully<00:06:39.370> I<00:06:39.400> will<00:06:39.610> have<00:06:39.729> three<00:06:40.180> oncidium

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
and hopefully I will have three oncidium

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.110 
and hopefully I will have three oncidium
