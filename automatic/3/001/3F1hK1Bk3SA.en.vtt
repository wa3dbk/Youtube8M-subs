00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.730
 hi friends and welcome to my channel 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.920
 world of toys this time 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.320
 I'm going to review this package 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.990
 to play play doh it's called 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.029
 dying 'breaks' and this time I was 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.329
 they will forgive but I do not know how to say 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.210
 in Spanish and good brings this machine that 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.579
 is for digging and good this machine 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.710
 also serves to cut and in here 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.110
 bring the molds we can make with 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.950
 this play doh and also includes this 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.950
 play doh boat 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.510
 this is the box from the back 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.940
 As you can see, you can create blocks 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.700
 for construction with this package for 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.250
 play here says you shape it and that 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.250
 cuts like this is that I'm going to get them out of 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.160
 the box to be able to show it better 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.730
 I'm going to cut here with scissors 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.730
 here 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.600
 and 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.710
 here is the machine out of the box 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.619
 look here is the play doh too 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.530
 this play doh is gray or color 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.380
 silver and has silver flashes I do not know 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.330
 if you can see them but it's very beautiful and 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.700
 It is a perfect color to make the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.630
 blocks now let's start playing 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.630
 with our machine 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.070
 in this part of this is where we can 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.650
 make the blocks we are going to put the play 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.630
 doh here 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.259
 and let's make see 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.399
 we are going to press hard and now we are going to 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.399
 see what happened 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.290
 look 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.870
 look and here is our first block 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.870
 What do you think 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.210
 well now let's make more blocks 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.710
 and there is our second block 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.710
 let's make more blocks 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.150
 yes 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.650
 look 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.500
 look like this you see in my other machine 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.500
 side 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.040
 i 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.750
 we can also make more blocks 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.880
 thin like this you can only 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.420
 put the play doh here and press with 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.420
 your finger 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.260
 now you take it out and this way you have left 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.260
 a more thin block 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.480
 look at the children you have to like them 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.819
 this is not because the machines are for 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.980
 children 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.230
 there are other play doh machines very 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.790
 similar to this one but they do things 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.609
 different 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.109
 tell me if you also want to see them 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.180
 it depends on how much slack they leave me in 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.659
 this video I will keep uploading videos 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.769
 or not ok then look here are all 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:42.859
 the blocks that I already did look at how much and 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:49.209
 my screw now we can make a 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:49.209
 fence a wall with this look 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.470
 also if we want to cut a block 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.920
 we can cut it with this machine look 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.920
 here it goes 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.480
 and it's full of our block in two 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.270
 pieces and good what do you think if now 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.660
 we make blocks of another color as color 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.660
 coffee 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.420
 if they look good to you who believe 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.420
 Look 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.560
 never 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.960
 let's do one more 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.729
 what do you think if we also build 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.729
 a wall or a wall 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.020
 there is 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.360
 good friends, you could see that this 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.610

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.250
 they can make blocks of colors that 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.650
 you want and form constructions 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.690
 They can use different colors to 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.300
 observe them like this coffee and gray that I 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.070
