00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.180
 It happened in the summer of 2004 finally that should do that 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.630
 I heard from one of them and there should be public participation 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:15.949
 Good idea that was the market what he wants to become so boring and the changing rooms 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.449
 I pray 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.589
 You can not do anything if it's up to me 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.380
 I thought with Aachen 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.269
 Actually, politics does not interest me that way 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.739
 but this time it was not directly related 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.390
 Vigier FB strut donor with experts 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.310
 Ulm 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.350
 on starter of Tobias Schorr 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.520
 that has not recycled he has Ubuntu scale 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.670
 quite difficult his decision 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.210
 how good that my class is not that big 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 hang there 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.350
 our group all people wrote down a hit list 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.350
 very far ahead was in front of the field 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.089
 Wally at last was at play and then jump into the cold water 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.110
 but not more and more works has participated 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.770
 several schools from the district were there 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.830
 they met and brought together all the star of brands under that 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.470
 i can remember well two finally my birthday 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.600
 Dagmar 19 divided 12 groups 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.850
 what he still definitely avoided a whirlpool in the water Meier the group was 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.720
 he also ask for fun and games 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.010
 Like Grandma, Wahiba was not 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.250
 I pray 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.320
 That's why this group has also made a ski slope and this far 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.930
 even more attentive time in the swimming pool at best the whole year 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.340
 over 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 but somehow that did not work Red 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.520
 everything 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.599
 We then gave our market shares says Kai BÃ¶cking 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.160
 not the teens were in the process of choosing others 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 their concepts attached 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.689
 the use has been worthwhile case 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.289
 if I lost the game today 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.699
 APA I have what you want to write 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.699
 from my dream and reality 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:24.669
 It is worth it 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.669
 you too can change the world 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:30.959
 Rohregger 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.959
 he was 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.419
