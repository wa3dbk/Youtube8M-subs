then I put it in my dry container for
the<00:01:41.909> Vitamix<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.409> what<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the Vitamix and this is what it is and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.420 
the Vitamix and this is what it is and
we<00:01:45.210> had<00:01:45.299> tried<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.659> awhile<00:01:45.930> ago<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.770> we're

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
we had tried this awhile ago and we're

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.950 
we had tried this awhile ago and we're
wondering<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:48.060> know<00:01:48.090> will<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.450> work<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:48.689> us

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
wondering you know will this work for us

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.870 
wondering you know will this work for us
but<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:49.950> working<00:01:50.250> well<00:01:50.579> for<00:01:50.610> us

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
but it's really working well for us

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.389 
but it's really working well for us
because<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.930> plant<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.409> lot<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.710> lettuce

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
because we can plant a lot of lettuce

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.850 
because we can plant a lot of lettuce
and<00:01:53.759> green<00:01:53.970> leafy<00:01:54.149> things<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.530> feel<00:01:55.710> like

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and green leafy things and I feel like

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.859 
and green leafy things and I feel like
we<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.369> eat<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.700> all<00:01:56.790> right<00:01:57.060> now<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.570> give

we have to eat it all right now or give

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.350 
we have to eat it all right now or give
it<00:01:57.990> away<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.189> dehydrate<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
it away because we can dehydrate it and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.510 
it away because we can dehydrate it and
save<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.869> later<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.100> nice<00:02:02.280> thing

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
save it for later and the nice thing

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.060 
save it for later and the nice thing

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.429 
about this xcalibur is it has a live
food<00:02:05.549> setting<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:07.020> set<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.409> a

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
food setting so you can set it on a

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.770 
food setting so you can set it on a
temperature<00:02:07.950> where<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.280> still<00:02:08.580> maintains<00:02:09.090> all

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
temperature where it still maintains all

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.999 
temperature where it still maintains all
the<00:02:09.989> live<00:02:10.200> enzymes

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the live enzymes

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.059 
the live enzymes
in<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.120> vegetable<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.800> still

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
in the in the vegetable but it still

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.479 
in the in the vegetable but it still
dries<00:02:14.280> out<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.730> then<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.440> great

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
dries out and then you have great

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.479 
dries out and then you have great
smoothie<00:02:17.489> material<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.239> we<00:02:18.450> figured<00:02:18.810> out

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
smoothie material and we figured out

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.410 
smoothie material and we figured out
about<00:02:20.489> 1<00:02:20.970> tablespoon<00:02:21.690> minimum<00:02:22.879> you<00:02:23.879> know<00:02:24.000> for

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
about 1 tablespoon minimum you know for

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.110 
about 1 tablespoon minimum you know for
a<00:02:24.660> half<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.500> container<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.489> smoothies<00:02:26.910> with

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
a half of a container of smoothies with

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.229 
a half of a container of smoothies with
a<00:02:27.330> banana<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.900> some<00:02:28.050> water<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.739> anyway<00:02:29.610> that's

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
a banana and some water so anyway that's

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.210 
a banana and some water so anyway that's
the<00:02:30.510> update<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.410> other<00:02:31.530> thing<00:02:31.800> about<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
the update the other thing about the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.280 
the update the other thing about the
Swiss<00:02:32.430> chard<00:02:32.670> as<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.000> do<00:02:33.060> cut<00:02:33.720> out<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.989> center

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
Swiss chard as I do cut out the center

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.039 
Swiss chard as I do cut out the center
piece<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:35.370> because<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.760> takes<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
piece just because it takes is the

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.839 
piece just because it takes is the
texture<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:37.890> different<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.400> takes<00:02:38.580> longer

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
texture is so different it takes longer

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.750 
texture is so different it takes longer
for<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.239> dry<00:02:39.330> out<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.290> when<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.280> get<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.519> bunch

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
for it to dry out and when I get a bunch

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.800 
for it to dry out and when I get a bunch
of<00:02:41.849> them<00:02:42.030> I'll<00:02:42.360> I'll<00:02:42.900> stack<00:02:43.260> them<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.590> and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
of them I'll I'll stack them in and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.030 
of them I'll I'll stack them in and
dehydrate<00:02:45.810> them<00:02:45.989> all<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.410> blend<00:02:46.620> them<00:02:46.769> up<00:02:46.830> too

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
dehydrate them all and blend them up too

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.400 
dehydrate them all and blend them up too
because<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:47.519> still<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.940> good<00:02:48.209> part<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
because it's still a good part of the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.589 
because it's still a good part of the
leaf<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.160> takes<00:02:50.670> longer<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:51.060> dehydrate

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
leaf it just takes longer to dehydrate

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.509 
leaf it just takes longer to dehydrate
anyway<00:02:52.349> hope<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.680> enjoy<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.220> protein
