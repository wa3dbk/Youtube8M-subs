of<00:02:26.120> these<00:02:26.330> keyboard<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.290> mouse<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.740> like

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
of these keyboard and the mouse I like

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.550 
of these keyboard and the mouse I like
the<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.060> red<00:02:29.210> glow<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.630> LEDs<00:02:30.260> underneath

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
the the red glow of the LEDs underneath

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.160 
the the red glow of the LEDs underneath
which<00:02:30.800> match<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.100> keyboard<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:32.750> overall

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
which match the keyboard and you overall

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.720 
which match the keyboard and you overall
which<00:02:33.380> I<00:02:33.500> find<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.860> really<00:02:33.920> nice<00:02:34.160> maps<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.580> use

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
which I find it really nice maps to use

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.640 
which I find it really nice maps to use
but<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.570> wouldn't<00:02:35.840> recommend<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.230> for<00:02:36.350> small

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
but I wouldn't recommend it for small

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.920 
but I wouldn't recommend it for small
people<00:02:37.070> with<00:02:37.280> small<00:02:37.490> hands<00:02:37.670> as<00:02:38.030> it's<00:02:38.750> quite<00:02:38.900> a

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
people with small hands as it's quite a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.880 
people with small hands as it's quite a
large<00:02:39.170> Mouse<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.860> be<00:02:39.950> used<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.720> if<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.770> was

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
large Mouse to be used so if I was

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.350 
large Mouse to be used so if I was
recommending<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.370> keyboard<00:02:43.700> mouse<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:44.150> would
