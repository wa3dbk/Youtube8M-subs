00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.980
 hello about three years ago I took here 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.160
 such a red rose 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.230
 now it serves me easier and 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.970
 infobox I'll leave you a link to the article 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.610
 which describes in detail the process 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.349
 knitting this particular florets a in 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.110
 I recently needed 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.430
 tie the same roses for decoration 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.489
 children's hat and panama 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.100
 but fewer petals video 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.829
 already on the example of such white flowers I 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 I'll show you how these roses match 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.410
 first step crochet chain 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.950
 considering the moment that the amount 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.810
 loop 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.200
 should be twice as large as 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.730
 estimated number of petals 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.950
 for example for a red rose I needed 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.410
 twenty six petals i typed 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.630
 fifty two loops in this example 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.500
 rosette will be of 8 petals 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.560
 so I dial 16 loops next 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.360
 row 3 lift air loops which 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.320
 corresponds to one double crochet 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.140
 and 1 air loop one more column with 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.479
 sc in the same loop as 1 if 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.600
 count from the end it will be 5 loops 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.600
 to 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:26.159
 and then the air loop and again the column 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.789
 double crochet through one loop previous 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.789
 row 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:39.530
 double crochet air loop 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.140
 same loop of the previous row as 1 and 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.030
 air loop 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.030
 continue to knit according to the pattern to the end of the row 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.810
 finish the row with double crochet 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.880
 this way we got the letters in 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.600
 the next row we will knit in 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.040
 the arch of these small letters is a connecting column 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.040
 Mark 1 letters in 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.190
 now 3 lifting loops which 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.190
 double crochet 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.300
 1 double crochet 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.819
 then 3 air loops and again 2 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.459
 double crochet in the same arch and 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.170
 continue in each of our small letter v 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.690
 knit two crochet 3 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.690
 air loops 2 double crochets 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.260
 last row in each arch of three 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.800
 loops knit 10 columns with 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.800
 nakidom 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:33.640
 This knitting finish now our 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:36.340
 Rosette should roll start 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.770
 wrap in the middle and every time 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.770
 at the bottom we catch a needle with thread 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:28.530
 and our rosette is ready in the infobox you 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:36.539

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:39.270
