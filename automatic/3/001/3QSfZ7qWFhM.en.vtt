all<00:00:04.520> right<00:00:04.640> here's<00:00:04.819> the<00:00:04.880> intake<00:00:05.210> valve<00:00:05.420> and<00:00:05.689> I

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
all right here's the intake valve and I

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.549 
all right here's the intake valve and I
ran<00:00:06.439> it<00:00:06.560> through<00:00:06.740> the<00:00:07.069> wire<00:00:07.549> wheel<00:00:08.240> on<00:00:08.540> the<00:00:09.080> on

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
ran it through the wire wheel on the on

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.529 
ran it through the wire wheel on the on
the<00:00:09.650> bench<00:00:09.830> grinder<00:00:10.250> you<00:00:11.000> got<00:00:11.150> everything

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:11.539 
the bench grinder you got everything

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.439 
the bench grinder you got everything
nice<00:00:11.750> and<00:00:12.709> cleaned<00:00:12.949> up<00:00:13.100> in<00:00:13.250> there<00:00:13.430> and<00:00:13.610> looking

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:14.449 
nice and cleaned up in there and looking

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.390 
nice and cleaned up in there and looking
at<00:00:14.600> the<00:00:14.690> face<00:00:14.900> of<00:00:14.930> the<00:00:15.199> valve<00:00:15.619> I<00:00:15.949> really<00:00:16.250> don't

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
at the face of the valve I really don't

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.870 
at the face of the valve I really don't
see<00:00:16.490> any<00:00:16.610> pitting<00:00:17.240> on<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:17.539> valve<00:00:18.610> but<00:00:19.610> here<00:00:19.790> in

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
see any pitting on the valve but here in

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.260 
see any pitting on the valve but here in
the<00:00:19.970> cylinder<00:00:20.300> head<00:00:20.330> on<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:21.230> valve<00:00:21.410> seat

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
the cylinder head on the valve seat

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.050 
the cylinder head on the valve seat
there<00:00:23.270> is<00:00:23.450> a<00:00:23.480> little<00:00:23.900> bit<00:00:24.020> of<00:00:24.140> pitting

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
there is a little bit of pitting

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.840 
there is a little bit of pitting
possibly<00:00:26.470> but<00:00:27.470> I<00:00:27.530> did<00:00:27.740> see<00:00:27.980> what<00:00:28.580> I<00:00:28.610> thought

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
possibly but I did see what I thought

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.660 
possibly but I did see what I thought
was<00:00:29.030> a<00:00:29.060> little<00:00:29.180> bit<00:00:29.360> of<00:00:29.450> pitting<00:00:29.630> on<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:29.990> valve

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
was a little bit of pitting on the valve

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.130 
was a little bit of pitting on the valve
before<00:00:31.670> I<00:00:31.850> ran<00:00:32.059> it<00:00:32.180> through<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.360> wire<00:00:32.870> wheel

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
before I ran it through the wire wheel

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.500 
before I ran it through the wire wheel
so<00:00:33.440> now<00:00:34.280> we're<00:00:34.399> ready<00:00:34.550> to<00:00:34.610> come<00:00:34.789> in<00:00:34.910> here<00:00:35.120> and

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
so now we're ready to come in here and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.500 
so now we're ready to come in here and
actually<00:00:36.010> put<00:00:37.010> valve<00:00:37.310> lapping<00:00:37.700> compound<00:00:37.730> on

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
actually put valve lapping compound on

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.160 
actually put valve lapping compound on
here<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:40.360> lapping<00:00:41.360> our<00:00:41.450> valves<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.870> see<00:00:42.020> if<00:00:42.079> we

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
here and lapping our valves to see if we

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.160 
here and lapping our valves to see if we
can't<00:00:43.120> get<00:00:44.120> that<00:00:44.270> uh<00:00:45.070> that<00:00:46.070> leak<00:00:46.280> down<00:00:46.520> that

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
can't get that uh that leak down that

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.330 
can't get that uh that leak down that
the<00:00:48.170> leakage<00:00:48.530> that<00:00:48.680> I<00:00:48.739> was<00:00:48.890> giving<00:00:49.190> through

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
the leakage that I was giving through

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.870 
the leakage that I was giving through
the<00:00:49.430> valves<00:00:49.820> get<00:00:50.809> that<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.110> stop<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:51.890> we<00:00:52.760> get

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
the valves get that to stop so we get

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.040 
the valves get that to stop so we get
the<00:00:52.970> valve<00:00:53.120> lapping<00:00:53.420> compound<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:53.989> then

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
the valve lapping compound and then

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.319 
the valve lapping compound and then
we'll<00:00:54.260> we'll<00:00:54.770> get<00:00:54.890> started<00:00:55.100> I've<00:00:56.030> got<00:00:56.180> some

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
we'll we'll get started I've got some

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.400 
we'll we'll get started I've got some
new<00:00:56.450> stuff<00:00:56.510> here<00:00:56.780> that<00:00:56.840> I've<00:00:57.020> never<00:00:57.140> actually

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
new stuff here that I've never actually

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.790 
new stuff here that I've never actually
seen<00:00:58.070> before

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
seen before

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.040 
seen before
valve<00:01:00.800> lapping<00:01:01.219> compound<00:01:01.250> but<00:01:01.969> when<00:01:02.750> I<00:01:02.809> bought

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
valve lapping compound but when I bought

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.660 
valve lapping compound but when I bought
it<00:01:03.170> in<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.320> past<00:01:03.559> it<00:01:03.770> just<00:01:03.800> came<00:01:04.070> in<00:01:04.129> one<00:01:04.399> tube

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
it in the past it just came in one tube

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.660 
it in the past it just came in one tube
and<00:01:04.969> this<00:01:05.449> one<00:01:05.890> you<00:01:06.890> can<00:01:07.069> read<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.459> they

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
and this one you can read that they

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.109 
and this one you can read that they
actually<00:01:07.939> give<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.149> a<00:01:08.240> coarse<00:01:08.539> grit<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:10.119> a

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
actually give you a coarse grit and a

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.999 
actually give you a coarse grit and a
fine<00:01:11.389> grit<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.350> I<00:01:12.439> thought<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:12.740> was<00:01:12.829> kind<00:01:12.979> of

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
fine grit and I thought that was kind of

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.929 
fine grit and I thought that was kind of
cool<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:13.429> we'll<00:01:14.389> get<00:01:14.509> started<00:01:14.630> on<00:01:14.869> this<00:01:15.049> and

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
cool so we'll get started on this and

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.489 
cool so we'll get started on this and
we'll<00:01:16.939> get<00:01:17.060> started<00:01:17.209> with<00:01:17.509> uh<00:01:17.539> with<00:01:18.409> the

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:18.499 
we'll get started with uh with the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:20.109 
we'll get started with uh with the
coarse<00:01:18.709> grit<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.429> let<00:01:19.520> me<00:01:19.579> get<00:01:19.729> started<00:01:19.850> I'm

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
coarse grit so let me get started I'm

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.940 
coarse grit so let me get started I'm
actually<00:01:20.270> gonna<00:01:20.479> use<00:01:20.749> just<00:01:21.049> a<00:01:21.529> little<00:01:21.770> bit<00:01:21.859> of

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
actually gonna use just a little bit of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.160 
actually gonna use just a little bit of
regular<00:01:22.100> wd-40<00:01:23.029> that's<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.630> lubricant<00:01:24.079> I'm

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
regular wd-40 that's the lubricant I'm

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.419 
regular wd-40 that's the lubricant I'm
gonna<00:01:24.289> spray<00:01:25.209> inside<00:01:26.209> the<00:01:26.389> valve<00:01:26.569> guide<00:01:26.840> there

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
gonna spray inside the valve guide there

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.359 
gonna spray inside the valve guide there
and<00:01:28.429> then<00:01:28.579> put<00:01:28.819> even<00:01:29.630> just<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.229> little<00:01:30.259> bit<00:01:30.499> on

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
and then put even just a little bit on

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.449 
and then put even just a little bit on
the<00:01:31.549> valve<00:01:31.759> stem<00:01:32.060> itself<00:01:32.979> so<00:01:33.979> I've<00:01:34.069> got<00:01:34.249> the

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
the valve stem itself so I've got the

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.639 
the valve stem itself so I've got the
valve<00:01:35.149> lapping<00:01:35.479> compound<00:01:35.509> spread<00:01:36.259> onto<00:01:36.529> the

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
valve lapping compound spread onto the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.550 
valve lapping compound spread onto the
valve<00:01:37.099> seat<00:01:37.399> and<00:01:37.670> then<00:01:38.569> on<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:39.139> the<00:01:39.170> actual

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
valve seat and then on to the actual

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.809 
valve seat and then on to the actual
valve<00:01:39.770> itself<00:01:40.099> so<00:01:40.340> take<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:42.429> stick<00:01:43.429> that<00:01:43.609> in

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
valve itself so take that stick that in

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.099 
valve itself so take that stick that in
there<00:01:44.349> wipe<00:01:45.349> my<00:01:45.499> fingers<00:01:45.889> off<00:01:46.069> a<00:01:46.099> little<00:01:46.399> bit

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
there wipe my fingers off a little bit

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.730 
there wipe my fingers off a little bit
then<00:01:48.109> we<00:01:48.139> got<00:01:48.319> our<00:01:48.439> valve<00:01:48.649> lapping<00:01:49.039> tool<00:01:50.740> stick

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
then we got our valve lapping tool stick

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.560 
then we got our valve lapping tool stick
it<00:01:51.859> on<00:01:51.950> there

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
it on there

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.930 
it on there
and<00:01:53.810> just<00:01:54.020> start<00:01:54.230> spinning<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:58.790> want

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
and just start spinning it and you want

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.170 
and just start spinning it and you want
to<00:01:59.030> give<00:01:59.150> it<00:02:01.060> kind<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.150> pop<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.360> like<00:02:02.660> that<00:02:04.180> kind

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
to give it kind of pop it like that kind

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.210 
to give it kind of pop it like that kind
of<00:02:05.210> spreads<00:02:05.540> out<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.650> bow<00:02:06.770> block<00:02:07.040> and

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
of spreads out the bow block and

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.490 
of spreads out the bow block and
compound<00:02:13.780> all<00:02:14.780> right<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:15.020> see<00:02:15.170> here<00:02:15.320> on<00:02:15.410> the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
compound all right you see here on the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.160 
compound all right you see here on the
on<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.830> face<00:02:16.510> where<00:02:17.510> it's<00:02:17.690> kind<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.500> shiny<00:02:19.120> and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
on the face where it's kind of shiny and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.600 
on the face where it's kind of shiny and
then<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.350> dull<00:02:21.680> area<00:02:22.070> is<00:02:22.160> what<00:02:22.370> we've<00:02:22.580> just

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
then that dull area is what we've just

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.050 
then that dull area is what we've just
ground<00:02:23.120> down<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.390> we<00:02:23.600> got<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.780> little<00:02:24.080> bit<00:02:24.350> more

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
ground down and we got a little bit more

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.840 
ground down and we got a little bit more
lapping<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.180> do<00:02:27.430> but<00:02:28.430> we're<00:02:28.550> getting<00:02:28.730> pretty

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
lapping to do but we're getting pretty

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.330 
lapping to do but we're getting pretty
close<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:30.350> intake<00:02:30.710> valve<00:02:30.950> when<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.190> did

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
close this this intake valve when I did

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.010 
close this this intake valve when I did
the<00:02:31.400> leak<00:02:31.550> down<00:02:31.730> test<00:02:32.000> wasn't<00:02:32.240> leaking<00:02:32.720> badly

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
the leak down test wasn't leaking badly

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.470 
the leak down test wasn't leaking badly
but<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.100> was<00:02:34.220> leaking<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.850> was<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.030> noticeable

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
but it was leaking it was a noticeable

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.650 
but it was leaking it was a noticeable
leak<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.380> here<00:02:36.620> on<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.800> valve<00:02:36.980> seat<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:38.180> can

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
leak and here on the valve seat I can

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.000 
leak and here on the valve seat I can
see<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.020> there's<00:02:39.200> really<00:02:39.260> not<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.710> lot<00:02:39.770> of

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
see that there's really not a lot of

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.090 
see that there's really not a lot of
pitting<00:02:40.310> there<00:02:40.870> but<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.930> still<00:02:41.990> need<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.320> come

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
pitting there but I still need to come

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.850 
pitting there but I still need to come
in<00:02:43.220> here<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.230> lap<00:02:45.230> these<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> little<00:02:45.709> bit<00:02:45.770> more

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
in here and lap these a little bit more

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.310 
in here and lap these a little bit more
with<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.250> coarse<00:02:46.490> grit<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.080> then<00:02:48.080> we'll<00:02:48.200> move

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
with the coarse grit and then we'll move

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.710 
with the coarse grit and then we'll move
on<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.650> fine<00:02:48.860> grit<00:02:49.330> I'm<00:02:50.330> pretty<00:02:50.510> happy

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
on to the fine grit I'm pretty happy

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.630 
on to the fine grit I'm pretty happy
with<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:51.020> surface<00:02:51.290> there<00:02:52.250> on<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.459> valve

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
with that surface there on the valve

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.910 
with that surface there on the valve
seat<00:02:52.940> put<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:53.990> fine<00:02:54.170> grid<00:02:54.410> on<00:02:54.530> there<00:02:54.740> and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
seat put the fine grid on there and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.100 
seat put the fine grid on there and
lapped<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.610> in<00:02:55.760> come<00:02:56.600> over<00:02:56.780> here<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.990> the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
lapped it in come over here to the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.380 
lapped it in come over here to the
exhaust<00:02:57.440> seat<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:57.890> can<00:02:58.040> see<00:02:58.220> how<00:02:59.060> much<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.239> a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
exhaust seat you can see how much of a

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.680 
exhaust seat you can see how much of a
difference<00:02:59.600> that<00:03:00.560> actually<00:03:00.860> makes<00:03:01.070> there<00:03:01.690> and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
difference that actually makes there and

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.390 
difference that actually makes there and
here's<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.770> intake<00:03:04.040> valve<00:03:04.280> itself<00:03:06.400> yeah

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
here's the the intake valve itself yeah

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.790 
here's the the intake valve itself yeah
pretty<00:03:08.030> nice<00:03:08.270> little<00:03:08.600> area<00:03:08.750> there<00:03:09.560> on<00:03:09.680> the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
pretty nice little area there on the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.060 
pretty nice little area there on the
seat<00:03:10.060> it's<00:03:11.060> not<00:03:11.300> perfect<00:03:11.800> but<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:12.830> make<00:03:13.040> it

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
seat it's not perfect but to make it

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.979 
seat it's not perfect but to make it
perfect<00:03:13.550> you'd<00:03:14.450> have<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.690> take<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.959> the

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
perfect you'd have to take to the

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.360 
perfect you'd have to take to the
machine<00:03:15.290> shop<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.709> like<00:03:15.800> I<00:03:15.890> said<00:03:15.950> I'm<00:03:16.160> just

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
machine shop and like I said I'm just

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.870 
machine shop and like I said I'm just
doing<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.580> back<00:03:16.760> yard<00:03:17.200> kind<00:03:18.200> of<00:03:18.290> refresh<00:03:18.880> on

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
doing a back yard kind of refresh on

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.920 
doing a back yard kind of refresh on
this<00:03:20.120> engine<00:03:20.330> I<00:03:22.269> am<00:03:23.269> at<00:03:23.390> some<00:03:23.540> point<00:03:23.720> probably

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
this engine I am at some point probably

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.690 
this engine I am at some point probably
gonna<00:03:24.110> have<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.440> engine<00:03:24.769> fully<00:03:25.700> rebuilt<00:03:27.700> but

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
gonna have this engine fully rebuilt but

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.160 
gonna have this engine fully rebuilt but
for<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:28.970> time<00:03:29.150> being<00:03:29.360> I<00:03:29.510> just<00:03:29.690> need<00:03:29.840> it<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.050> be

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
for the time being I just need it to be

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.530 
for the time being I just need it to be
a<00:03:30.380> running<00:03:30.860> engine<00:03:31.220> so<00:03:32.120> that's<00:03:32.239> why<00:03:32.390> I'm<00:03:32.510> just

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
a running engine so that's why I'm just

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.520 
a running engine so that's why I'm just
doing<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:33.019> this<00:03:33.110> way

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
doing it this way

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.800 
doing it this way
pretty<00:03:33.980> simple<00:03:34.330> we'll<00:03:35.330> just<00:03:35.480> see<00:03:35.540> if<00:03:35.570> we<00:03:35.630> can

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
pretty simple we'll just see if we can

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.130 
pretty simple we'll just see if we can
get<00:03:35.900> rid<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:36.110> some<00:03:36.440> of<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.560> leak<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:38.140> improve

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
get rid of some of that leak and improve

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.470 
get rid of some of that leak and improve
this<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:40.459> efficiency<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:41.000> this<00:03:41.090> engine<00:03:41.239> a

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
this the efficiency of this engine a

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.060 
this the efficiency of this engine a
little<00:03:41.570> bit<00:03:41.780> make<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.140> run<00:03:42.800> a<00:03:42.830> little<00:03:42.860> bit

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
little bit make it run a little bit

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.880 
little bit make it run a little bit
better<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:43.690> we<00:03:44.690> got<00:03:44.840> finished<00:03:45.019> at<00:03:45.739> least

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
better so we got finished at least

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.710 
better so we got finished at least
lapping<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.459> intake<00:03:46.760> valve<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.420> exhaust

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
lapping in the intake valve the exhaust

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.320 
lapping in the intake valve the exhaust
valve<00:03:47.959> just<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.950> identical<00:03:49.370> procedure<00:03:50.150> that

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
valve just the identical procedure that

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.090 
valve just the identical procedure that
we<00:03:50.420> just<00:03:50.600> did<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.019> let's<00:03:51.590> take<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:51.920> valve

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
we just did so let's take this valve

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.729 
we just did so let's take this valve
back<00:03:52.310> in<00:03:52.550> and<00:03:52.900> put<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:53.959> new<00:03:54.080> seal<00:03:54.290> on<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.620> and

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
back in and put the new seal on it and

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.820 
back in and put the new seal on it and
get<00:03:54.890> everything<00:03:55.070> buttoned<00:03:55.400> back<00:03:55.610> up
