00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
different things so I said then let me

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.360 
different things so I said then let me
just<00:00:43.629> start<00:00:43.960> tearing<00:00:44.140> into<00:00:44.350> it<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:45.219> what<00:00:45.339> I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
just start tearing into it and what I

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.459 
just start tearing into it and what I
did<00:00:45.609> was<00:00:45.789> I<00:00:45.850> just<00:00:45.879> took<00:00:46.059> my<00:00:46.210> screwdriver<00:00:47.050> and

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
did was I just took my screwdriver and

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.450 
did was I just took my screwdriver and
went<00:00:48.100> in<00:00:48.219> underneath<00:00:48.609> these<00:00:49.979> buttons<00:00:50.979> and

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
went in underneath these buttons and

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.149 
went in underneath these buttons and
just<00:00:51.489> take<00:00:51.850> one<00:00:52.059> like<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.749> and<00:00:52.929> then<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:53.859> found

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
just take one like that and then I found

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.270 
just take one like that and then I found
that<00:00:54.339> there<00:00:54.579> was<00:00:54.670> some<00:00:54.940> interesting

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
that there was some interesting

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.590 
that there was some interesting
connectors<00:00:57.280> on<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.609> bottom<00:00:57.999> now<00:00:58.239> some<00:00:58.479> of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
connectors on the bottom now some of

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.779 
connectors on the bottom now some of
them<00:00:58.749> came<00:00:58.929> off<00:00:59.170> and<00:01:00.159> I<00:01:00.339> believe<00:01:00.549> you<00:01:00.670> could

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
them came off and I believe you could

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.729 
them came off and I believe you could
probably<00:01:00.969> see<00:01:01.269> it<00:01:01.389> here<00:01:01.659> there's<00:01:01.899> several<00:01:02.499> of

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
probably see it here there's several of

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.920 
probably see it here there's several of
them<00:01:02.799> here<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.219> have<00:01:03.370> gold<00:01:04.149> I<00:01:04.479> just<00:01:04.509> turned

gold<00:01:06.460> plated<00:01:06.820> pins<00:01:07.630> that<00:01:08.619> I<00:01:08.649> found<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.130> there

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
gold plated pins that I found in there

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.039 
gold plated pins that I found in there
so<00:01:09.460> I<00:01:09.520> said<00:01:09.729> well<00:01:09.880> let<00:01:10.000> me<00:01:10.030> start<00:01:10.270> keep<00:01:10.630> tearing

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
so I said well let me start keep tearing

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.600 
so I said well let me start keep tearing
this<00:01:11.140> apart<00:01:11.200> so<00:01:11.920> I've<00:01:12.189> got<00:01:12.340> all<00:01:12.460> these

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
this apart so I've got all these

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.969 
this apart so I've got all these
different<00:01:12.670> buttons

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

different buttons
most<00:01:14.979> of<00:01:15.219> them<00:01:16.380> broke<00:01:17.380> off<00:01:17.560> cleanly<00:01:18.280> but<00:01:18.939> then

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
most of them broke off cleanly but then

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.499 
most of them broke off cleanly but then
I<00:01:19.119> just<00:01:19.299> take<00:01:19.450> my<00:01:19.979> cutters<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.460> I<00:01:21.700> just<00:01:21.909> cut

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
I just take my cutters and I just cut

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.840 
I just take my cutters and I just cut
these<00:01:22.689> off<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.219> save<00:01:24.219> that<00:01:24.399> little<00:01:24.549> piece

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
these off and save that little piece

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.959 
these off and save that little piece
right<00:01:25.409> over<00:01:26.409> my<00:01:26.619> growth<00:01:26.829> gold<00:01:27.070> scrap<00:01:27.310> box<00:01:27.670> and

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
right over my growth gold scrap box and

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.029 
right over my growth gold scrap box and
each<00:01:28.960> one<00:01:29.200> of<00:01:29.289> these<00:01:29.350> that's<00:01:29.619> what<00:01:29.770> I<00:01:29.799> do<00:01:29.950> the

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
each one of these that's what I do the

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.859 
each one of these that's what I do the
same<00:01:30.219> thing<00:01:30.579> wanna<00:01:31.179> try<00:01:31.329> to<00:01:31.390> pull<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.689> out<00:01:31.780> of

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
same thing wanna try to pull it out of

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.069 
same thing wanna try to pull it out of
there<00:01:31.990> if<00:01:32.079> I<00:01:32.170> can<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.670> oops<00:01:34.270> if<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:34.539> cut<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.869> see

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
there if I can and oops if I cut it see

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.510 
there if I can and oops if I cut it see
it<00:01:35.140> goes<00:01:35.289> flying<00:01:35.619> so<00:01:35.890> that's<00:01:36.039> one<00:01:36.189> or<00:01:36.280> even<00:01:36.369> up

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
it goes flying so that's one or even up

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.770 
it goes flying so that's one or even up
with<00:01:36.670> my<00:01:36.759> hand<00:01:37.000> down<00:01:37.149> there<00:01:37.210> typically

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
with my hand down there typically

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.260 
with my hand down there typically
because<00:01:38.770> if<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:39.009> accidentally<00:01:39.429> cut<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:39.820> you

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
because if you accidentally cut it you

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.980 
because if you accidentally cut it you
don't<00:01:40.450> lose<00:01:40.659> it

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
don't lose it

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.060 
don't lose it
and<00:01:41.939> that's<00:01:42.939> that's<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.299> good<00:01:43.390> way<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:44.170> make

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
and that's that's a good way to make

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.260 
and that's that's a good way to make
sure<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.429> keep<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:45.999> all<00:01:47.340> your<00:01:48.340> gold<00:01:48.579> so<00:01:49.240> you

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
don't have to go find it later in the

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.340 
don't have to go find it later in the
sweeps<00:01:51.280> when<00:01:51.729> you<00:01:51.850> sweep<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.539> up<00:01:52.689> all<00:01:53.229> right

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
sweeps when you sweep it up all right

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
but in this case these broke off into

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.620 
but in this case these broke off into
the<00:02:35.890> plastic<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.000> sure<00:02:37.270> want<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.510> get

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
understand that gold is not just

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.590 
understand that gold is not just
necessarily<00:03:23.560> what<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.799> see<00:03:24.010> visible<00:03:24.640> right

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
necessarily what you see visible right

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.229 
necessarily what you see visible right
up<00:03:25.810> front<00:03:26.170> sometimes<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.370> want<00:03:27.549> to<00:03:27.640> dig<00:03:28.209> a

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
up front sometimes you want to dig a

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.630 
up front sometimes you want to dig a
little<00:03:28.360> bit<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:29.230> switches<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:29.829> buttons<00:03:30.040> and

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
little bit and switches and buttons and

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.090 
little bit and switches and buttons and
things<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.450> are<00:03:31.870> pretty<00:03:32.350> good<00:03:32.709> about

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
things like that are pretty good about

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.270 
things like that are pretty good about
it<00:03:33.700> these<00:03:34.120> buttons<00:03:34.540> actually<00:03:34.720> have<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.470> nice

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
it these buttons actually have a nice

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.539 
it these buttons actually have a nice
little<00:03:36.519> piece<00:03:36.760> here<00:03:37.180> I<00:03:38.010> think<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.370> maybe

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
little piece here I think that maybe

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.819 
little piece here I think that maybe
brass<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.570> don't<00:03:40.930> think<00:03:41.140> that's<00:03:41.290> really<00:03:41.530> gold

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829

roof to the refiner as well and it could

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.600
