sometimes<00:00:42.309> I<00:00:42.429> don't<00:00:42.489> really<00:00:42.910> do<00:00:43.179> precisely

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
sometimes I don't really do precisely

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.119 
sometimes I don't really do precisely
the<00:00:44.140> details<00:00:44.710> better

the bone structure when you have the
sketch<00:00:48.429> it<00:00:49.030> goes<00:00:49.300> really<00:00:49.690> on<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:49.960> first

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
sketch it goes really on the first

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.590 
sketch it goes really on the first
prototype<00:00:50.800> meaning<00:00:51.190> working<00:00:52.149> on<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:52.390> last

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600

shoe has this thing which is called mesh

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.000 
shoe has this thing which is called mesh
and<00:01:04.390> above<00:01:04.900> this<00:01:05.290> mesh<00:01:05.590> which<00:01:05.860> is<00:01:05.979> a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
and above this mesh which is a

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.180 
and above this mesh which is a
transparent<00:01:06.640> sort<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.120> little<00:01:07.840> material

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
transparent sort of little material

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.060 
transparent sort of little material
above<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.400> mesh<00:01:09.610> you<00:01:09.820> have<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:10.090> lace<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:11.800> laser

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
above the mesh you have a lace the laser

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.090 
above the mesh you have a lace the laser

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.480 

then<00:01:25.870> the<00:01:26.020> hole<00:01:26.260> here<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.860> in<00:01:27.010> Crystal

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
then the hole here is in Crystal

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.600 
then the hole here is in Crystal

that it was a shoe that I could not

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.790 
that it was a shoe that I could not
reproduce<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.910> could<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.360> was<00:02:25.540> done<00:02:25.840> one<00:02:26.260> maybe

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
reproduce it could it was done one maybe

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.490 
reproduce it could it was done one maybe
two<00:02:27.220> three<00:02:27.490> times<00:02:27.580> maximum<00:02:28.330> but<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.110> didn't

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
two three times maximum but I didn't

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.460 
two three times maximum but I didn't
have<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.770> material<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.520> do<00:02:30.790> more<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.470> couldn't

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
have the material to do more I couldn't

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.280 
have the material to do more I couldn't
do<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.830> more<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:34.150> was<00:02:34.360> always<00:02:34.630> calling<00:02:35.080> that

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
do it more so I was always calling that

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.260 
do it more so I was always calling that
shoes<00:02:35.560> as<00:02:35.740> an<00:02:35.890> ear<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.340> shoe<00:02:36.550> like<00:02:36.730> one<00:02:37.060> day

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
shoes as an ear and a shoe like one day

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.330 
shoes as an ear and a shoe like one day
it<00:02:37.420> goes<00:02:37.660> it's<00:02:38.350> here<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.890> then<00:02:38.980> one<00:02:39.190> day

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
it goes it's here and then one day

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.130 
it goes it's here and then one day
disappears<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.180> never<00:02:40.330> see<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:40.930> yes

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
disappears and you never see it so yes

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.990 
disappears and you never see it so yes
