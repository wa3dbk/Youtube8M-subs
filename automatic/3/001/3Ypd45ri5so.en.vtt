00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.370
 the three b 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:13.580
 The top three wanted the best fast food 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.590
 but that's actually me 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.570
 schwegler age charikar yes what 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.480
 with her if you already have a checkout 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.140
 do you see these something this 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.270
 slightly more corpulent women over 40 die 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.460
 then stand with such a match on the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.890
 head but hairnet and then such a 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.870
 typical currywurst then saleswomen 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.600
 there are only these women that that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.170
 sell because the currywurst was like that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.210
 abysmal in this shop so it does not matter 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.219
 As the seller to have to main thing 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.620
 the food is good that is and they whole 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.750
 atmosphere and curry canis I see 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.480

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.129
 difficulty is that two kentucky 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.680

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.830

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.979

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.000
 but already there it was somehow like that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.530
 actually five years with us from the inside 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.450

 exclusive that I could drink that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.189
 one of the whole thing is that you 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.079

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.450
