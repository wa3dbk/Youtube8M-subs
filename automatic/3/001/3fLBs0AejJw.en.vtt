00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 and have you ever dreamed 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.049
 colonize a small asteroid 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.120
 rebuild it in the spirit of hi-tech create 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.370
 small army thus becoming a specific 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.099
 cognac and go do your will 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.960
 the nearest asteroid belt that well up 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.960
 Prince probably will not work and that's so 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.789
 cosmic lord yes why not glad 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.220
 present you with a unique one 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.170
 island game sort of cloud and if to be 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.170
 more precisely the video review on it because the game 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.150
 finally got to android devices 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.980
 get comfortable on the shuttle 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.820
 the nearest asteroid is sent 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.820
 immediately 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.590
 before you begin your story about how 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.210
 great and hard to be alone at the same time 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.930
 from cosmic lords should go 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.820
 from afar 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.220
 most likely with a combination of words 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.470
 space browser strategy you have 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.600
 the association of one of 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.850
 hundreds of primitive games where it comes down to 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.440
 constant upgrade capacity building 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.970
 thousands of virtual fleet 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.680
 which we see in the pictures 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.780
 ships of a certain war which also 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.940
 being conducted somewhere on the server side and we 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.340
 we simply donâ€™t see it receiving only reports 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.650
 about the course of the fight I hasten to make you happy 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.820
 such games passes giving way to where 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.619
 more advanced analog game astro 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.080
 lords is different from the above 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.300
 almost all common here is only that 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.369
 you will have to improve buildings but in 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.780
 the game is not brought to the level of marasmus 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.119
 when the same building is needed 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.190
 pump under a hundred times your way you 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.229
 start from relatively distant from 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.330
 all military movement place belt coiper 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.950
 to the word and the search for Walter and the military zone 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.229
 action cloud oort this 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.990
 instrumentally not confirmed however 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.280
 scientifically calculated places so here is the beginning 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.750
 games may scare a little 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.790
 unprepared player abundance 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.920
 functional and non-standard approach to 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.240
 some things for example before that 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.150
 then you need to build 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.250
 appropriate technology however if 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.929
 you listened carefully to your advisers 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.730
 who in the future will be generals and 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.040
 will fight by your side then 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.320
 further development of the base will not be 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.030
 labor and develop an asteroid relatively 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.190
 safe will you be up to that point 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.290
 when you dare not learn science 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.930
 piloting and don't go to the cloud 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.260
 oort here and it all begins 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.209
 interesting all dvizhuha precisely here lords 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.250
 fighting each other attack 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.239
 steroids each other fighting in a co-op 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.640
 against aliens 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.890
 moreover, the asteroids themselves are not static and 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.500
 fly around the cloud in search of adventure and 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.850
 military clashes and that's exactly the battle takes away 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.440
 the game is far from our usual 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.730
 building proposals at this stage 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.739
 better saying once see than 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.860
 a hundred times to hear the fight in real time 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.880
 at your disposal ship 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.440
 which somewhat resembles Management 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.720
 still a thief with 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.670
 if the worms are turn-based during the course 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.740
 enemies are static here here and you and your 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.840
 Opponent move on rollback and not a fact 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.550
 that the rocket you launched will find its 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.980
 the goal because the goal it can in a split second 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.840
 from the volley move if in combat 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.490
 one-on-one entertainment can and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.950
 not enough when a few ships 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.140
 go out on the warpath that sight already 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.270
 interesting shots of the explosion real 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.930
 light representation of course the sea 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.060
 adrenaline rush 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.830
 a clear conscience in my heart I can say that 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.840
 such an interpretation of the combat system 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.540
 delays and leaves the player simply 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.610
 by the observer and transfers directly 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.980
 to the combat zone leaving exactly 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.060
 for the skills of the player they are pumping the ship 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.220
 last word in battle in custody 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.870
 story a few words about the graphics game 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.790
 works on the unity engine that is known 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.920
 guarantees us a nice picture and 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.570
 good optimization all buildings 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.940
 unique species vary as 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.010
 improve space being by 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.200
 part-time general ambient he also 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.540
 at the height and does not create an illusion just 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.220
 static background yes and in general paint in 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.770
 the game juicy overall picture is nice 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.720
 As a result, the game has a rich 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.760
 functional and a bunch of innovative ideas 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.739
 here you do not have to constantly something 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.080
 improve and collect thousands of armies 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.390
 all limited to a few ships and 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.610
 their gradual upgrade combat system 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.260
 delays from the first bout say how 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.989
 there are yes and in general among space 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.910
 strategies game yara stands out showing 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.340
 finally how can a player be fresh 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.930
 look at the genre to all those who hang 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.000
 various browser string game 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.280
 Required to study after it, you are unlikely 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.830
 whether to return the usual build a hundred times 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.230
 it is better to grab such games on the mobile too 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.960
 Well, the gentle is given to complement the positive 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.030
 image of the game well, and on the SIM from all 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.840
 you were kinat and see our other 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.500
 channel video 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.500
 see you later
