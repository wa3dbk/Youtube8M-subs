00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
developed to not be the greatest top

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.080 
developed to not be the greatest top
line<00:03:10.660> but<00:03:11.470> uh<00:03:11.500> that's<00:03:12.160> what<00:03:12.340> made<00:03:12.670> me<00:03:12.850> pick

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
line but uh that's what made me pick

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.030 
line but uh that's what made me pick
that<00:03:13.120> dog<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.840> he<00:03:13.989> ended<00:03:14.170> up<00:03:14.290> becoming<00:03:14.650> a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
that dog and he ended up becoming a
