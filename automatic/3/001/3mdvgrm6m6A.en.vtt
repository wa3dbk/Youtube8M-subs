00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.250
 in the path waiting for that day it was detected that some that are great 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.690
 numbers that speak that the opinion we go then had to 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.719
 Apply 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.899
 in the note activate that personality 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:12.889
 these data are in Granada 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.829
 on the outside 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.829
 It is unheard of that Nicaragua will enter except in some cases 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.089
 but they are exceptions most of the time we only have the signal in 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.810
 january you from the foal 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.680
 we can have good kidneys to have our river this arrangement or we can 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.669
 have physical factors 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.649
 it can reach or millions but it can arrive with the radiation it can like and 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.580
 although a drug that has contact with these aids 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.480
 an expectation to the cellular receiver 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.120
 there is a signaling waterfall 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.980
 know all this the final goal that the shell and signaling 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.650
 these arrivals 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.310
 to the core 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.220
 the last of the elements that tekken can really enter 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.990
 that channel 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.900
 act 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.900
 and transcription 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.680
 intel a good streak 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.930
 the transcription factor are doing the times the message sends you 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.930
 no and with hormones we have to reproduce cells 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 this extradition factor was French 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.680
 eman this DNA molecule 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.940
 then what is going to be the pension tataratas 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.940
 April a small village 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.290
 for castro team 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.580
 exactly contain a herreÃ±a 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.870
 stay translated 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.780
 in protein 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.920
 eliana transcription factor 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.080
 because he came 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.510
 encourage a prescription process 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.510
 from the year get that came 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.210
 the priest ranera touch is to produce a protein 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.510
 now in this case 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.590
 if we have people or who never teach protein 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.620
 the main protein folder that has to be punished 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.590
 which is it going to be 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.440
 equipment the protein will be 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.069
 this protein 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.999
 is a 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.909
 cyclin e 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.400
 because the signs are saying that you have to enter p esic the aediles 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.609
 then all this is for China and not any cycling 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.709
 lousy when we started with the definition that is based on the given order 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.649
 by growth 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:33.199
 they must be neither york is not playing constantly 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.059
 only before the matter that nick 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.779
 and in the afternoon let's see what 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.169
 the presence is important 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.169
 and cherries 4 and 6 we started the cell cycle 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.349
 and just to be in shape
