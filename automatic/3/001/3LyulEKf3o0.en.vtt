00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
business because I think I think it's

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.900 
business because I think I think it's
important<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.700> good<00:03:00.739> years<00:03:01.739> ago<00:03:02.160> when<00:03:02.880> I

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
important it is good years ago when I

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.060 
important it is good years ago when I
was<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.209> lot<00:03:03.780> younger<00:03:03.840> I'm<00:03:04.470> gonna<00:03:04.620> drag<00:03:04.860> this

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
was a lot younger I'm gonna drag this

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.140 
was a lot younger I'm gonna drag this
myself<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.880> know<00:03:06.420> wait<00:03:06.720> no<00:03:06.840> wait<00:03:06.989> but<00:03:08.060> using<00:03:09.060> oh

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
myself I know wait no wait but using oh

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.820 
myself I know wait no wait but using oh
I<00:03:09.180> think<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.540> lot<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.720> youngsters<00:03:10.020> as<00:03:10.470> he<00:03:10.590> said

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
I think a lot of youngsters as he said

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.620 
I think a lot of youngsters as he said
as<00:03:11.430> they<00:03:11.880> start<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.420> drink<00:03:12.810> they<00:03:13.320> drink<00:03:14.630> lagers

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
as they start to drink they drink lagers

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.199 
as they start to drink they drink lagers
I<00:03:15.870> think<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.560> only<00:03:16.680> when<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.610> mature<00:03:17.910> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
I think it's only when you you mature a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.500 
I think it's only when you you mature a
bit<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.739> start<00:03:20.130> appreciating<00:03:20.910> these

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
bit and you start appreciating these

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.670 
bit and you start appreciating these
stouts<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.470> these<00:03:22.680> ales<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.970> really<00:03:24.680> go

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
stouts and these ales that you really go

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.060 
stouts and these ales that you really go
over<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:26.580> lurch<00:03:27.350> towards<00:03:28.350> an<00:03:28.500> angle<00:03:28.770> rather

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
over you lurch towards an angle rather

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.729 
over you lurch towards an angle rather
than<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.880> lager<00:03:30.120> because<00:03:30.570> it's<00:03:31.140> much<00:03:31.470> more

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
than a lager because it's much more

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.550 
than a lager because it's much more
going<00:03:32.040> on<00:03:32.340> there's<00:03:32.670> much<00:03:33.000> more<00:03:33.300> taste<00:03:33.720> there's

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
going on there's much more taste there's

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.250 
going on there's much more taste there's
much<00:03:34.800> more<00:03:35.100> craft<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.330> amount<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.750> craft<00:03:37.080> that

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
much more craft the amount of craft that

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.330 
much more craft the amount of craft that
goes<00:03:37.440> into<00:03:37.620> making<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:39.019> unbelievable

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
goes into making it is unbelievable

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.040 
goes into making it is unbelievable
for<00:03:41.340> instance<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:41.880> like<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.269> gets<00:03:42.480> brewed<00:03:42.780> in

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
for instance I like it gets brewed in

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.880 
for instance I like it gets brewed in
two<00:03:43.320> weeks<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:45.630> average<00:03:45.960> Joe<00:03:46.140> gets<00:03:46.410> brewed<00:03:46.680> in

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
two weeks the average Joe gets brewed in

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.860 
two weeks the average Joe gets brewed in
four<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.550> six<00:03:47.820> weeks<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.270> takes<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.540> lot<00:03:48.690> longer

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
four to six weeks it takes a lot longer

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.460 
four to six weeks it takes a lot longer
than

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
than

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.190 
than
more<00:03:49.710> craft<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:50.700> energy<00:03:51.270> for<00:03:51.480> people<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:52.020> go

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
more craft and energy for people to go

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.040 
more craft and energy for people to go
