00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.900
 here we have the base of the hat myself 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.110
 I have done one two three four five six 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.360
 rows ok then now we're going to 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.990
 continue with the bottom part and 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.330
 we start we make two chains 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.580
 a whole 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:29.410
 a chain in each space we are going to make 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.810
 the two integers together plus the chain 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.210
 in all the spaces we will finish 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.090
 same because 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.890
 because we are not going to continue increasing 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.770
 then where we had the little shells 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.040
 we are also going to do only the two 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.989
 whole together we have to erase the 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.020
 conchitas to be able to do the part of 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.290
 down the hat what goes in the pasta 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.120
 straight head 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.120
 here we come to the conchita 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.480
 here is the little shell you are the one in 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.580
 see her here we're going to do only one 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.700
 separated from a string and we go to 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.810
 following 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.710
 that's going to put the hat on and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.710
 let's keep moving forward 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.850
 in total we have to make 6 rows of this 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.220
 straight tissue 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.000
 Likewise, we are going to close each row with 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.370
 half point 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.390
 we lifted the two chains and we started 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.970
 from there until you have six more rows or 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.940
 less a hat for the child that is 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.610
 is the case must have from the beginning 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.960
 until the bottom 17 centimeters 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.450
 long approximately 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.450
 Here comes another conchita 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.119
 and this conchita is the same 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.260
 we have the time of the conchita but 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.530
 we're just going to make a little group 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.050
 of two points together and we continue like this 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.910
 They are about five rows of 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.080
 that we have to weave to get to 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.080
 total length of the hat 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.849
 we have here the cap here if they are given 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:24.550
 account you see the hexagon ok the part of 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:28.410
 the right of the hat here is the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:32.160
 I told him the one in the last row more 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.860
 this the beginning already without doing the see and already 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.050
 we are in the end 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.390
 now here what are we going to do we are going to 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.540
 make four rows of half a point 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.530
 making half a point as much where they are 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.340
 the chains like inside the two 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.920
 fair points 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.480
 it ends little to destroy three rows of 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.130
 half a point and we have our hat 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.510
 finished 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.880
 I'm going to show you 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.350
 how is the knitted half knit here 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.350
 so you can see it 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.840
 I recommend not closing the rows of 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.330
 half a point so that they do not make a 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.600
 step is preferable to work 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.510
 rows in round and without closing and without 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.390
 lift web rows so that 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.600
 little step that sometimes the effect is not 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.600
 see 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.590
 You see how it is with half a point 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.160
 here we are already reaching where 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.160
 we started the half point 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.709
 if you realize here is the first 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.930
 half a point then what are we going 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:47.129
 to do let's take this half point 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.129
 and we will knit it 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.060
 with another half point 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.370
 and we continue like this we lose the step 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.370
 that sometimes forms well
