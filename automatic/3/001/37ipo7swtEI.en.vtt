 productions the garbage and presents 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.620
 Merry Christmas for imprisoned brothers 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.860
 here we have in front of the screen the action watchtower of February 15, 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.639
 1919 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.320
 let's see page 63 93 king impressions in English that I will proceed to translate 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.589
 for you 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.589
 Christmas rejoicing for imprisoned brothers 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.519
 Christmas rejoicing 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.190
 our imprisoned brothers 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.390
 dear brothers of any place since our brothers in prison do not 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.500
 you can write to all the dear friends in your name I wish you 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.440
 express the great gratitude that they feel for each one of you and for 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.790
 all those brothers who sent them as gifts some remembrances for 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.020
 Christmas and this without having any intrinsic value with regard to the gift 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.140
 many of the gifts for them were packages with food merchandise 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.920
 substantial and healthy 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.610
 since they have received those packages they have greatly improved physically 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.150
 more than 150 prisoners in the castle had nothing for this Christmas and for 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.670
 so our brothers got a list of these people without gifts 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.170
 of the custodial officers and their own gifts the brothers made a 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.350
 small Christmas package for each of the unfortunate in jail and 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.600
 so many were very happy with their gifts 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.170
 even the officer guards were very happy for what they said never 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.190
 something like this had been done before in this place 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.630
 so we can truly say 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.630
 the lord was in that prison that Christmas 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.180
 listen to the inspired response that is given in which 24 45 47 translation of the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.850

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.270
 who truly the faithful and discreet slave whom his master on his shoulder 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.370
 your domestic to give you your correct food and high quality to your due 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.770
 happy time that slaves and their manure yesterday arrived at the area yes 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.770
 I really tell you what you name about all your goods 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.150
 and he has done it particularly since 1919 it has been true that he was named a 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.370
 collective group the remnant a turn over all the visible interests of the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.640
 kingdom the slave then became responsible not only to attend the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.410
 needs of the members of the homicide corps but also assumed the 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.980
 responsibility to preach the good news of the established kingdom to the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.139
 peoples of all nations

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:40.659
 how could Jesus choose watts tour as the true religion in 1919 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.409
 during his inspection if the society watts and tour was celebrating the 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:52.430
 Christmas in 1919 and until 1926 when finally change of point of view 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.959
 saying now that these celebrations will be of pagan origin 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.959
 who prefers to be you 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.239
 perhaps not an intelligent man 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.349
 or rather a stubborn and fanatic donkey 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.519
 it's time to pack up a rocket to get fired away 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.540
 but far from the dirt wittstock sane talks about a trick and tell your 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.409
