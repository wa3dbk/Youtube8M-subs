00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.390 
looks in just a magnetic room I don't
know<00:03:21.440> am<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.530> going<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.890> wrong<00:03:22.980> way

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
know am I going the wrong way

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.440 
know am I going the wrong way
I<00:03:25.549> didn't<00:03:26.549> even<00:03:26.670> get<00:03:26.790> travel<00:03:27.120> within<00:03:27.299> there

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
I didn't even get travel within there

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.520 
I didn't even get travel within there
just<00:03:27.629> send<00:03:28.019> me<00:03:28.080> right<00:03:28.230> here<00:03:28.530> okay

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
just send me right here okay

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.570 
just send me right here okay
I'm<00:03:31.530> probably<00:03:31.799> entirely<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.489> wrong

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
I'm probably entirely the wrong

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.979 
I'm probably entirely the wrong
direction<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.180> probably<00:03:33.330> screwed<00:03:33.750> myself

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
direction and I probably screwed myself

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.860 
direction and I probably screwed myself
have<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.489> think<00:03:35.940> it's<00:03:36.239> important<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.690> I

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
have but I think it's important that I

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:50.300 
have but I think it's important that I
pay<00:03:37.200> attention<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.590> where<00:03:37.739> I'm<00:03:37.920> going<00:03:37.950> but

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
no that was very choice hit save it but

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.300 
no that was very choice hit save it but
your<00:03:55.150> ROI<00:03:55.330> oh<00:03:58.349> you<00:03:59.349> don't<00:03:59.530> need<00:03:59.709> you<00:03:59.860> coconuts

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.150 
topics get answers to many subjects I'm
not<00:05:10.020> liking<00:05:10.350> this<00:05:10.440> idea<00:05:10.740> though<00:05:10.980> because

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
not liking this idea though because

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
with very few exceptions get blown up by

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.960 
with very few exceptions get blown up by
it<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.820> I<00:05:14.940> don't<00:05:15.000> wanna<00:05:15.210> get<00:05:15.300> blown<00:05:15.540> up<00:05:16.970> but

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
it and I don't wanna get blown up but

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.970 
it and I don't wanna get blown up but
that<00:05:18.270> being<00:05:18.450> said<00:05:18.510> if<00:05:18.900> I<00:05:19.020> get<00:05:19.170> a<00:05:19.200> save<00:05:19.440> here

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
that being said if I get a save here

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.100 
that being said if I get a save here
it's<00:05:20.700> ridiculous<00:05:21.240> cuz<00:05:21.540> we<00:05:21.660> didn't<00:05:21.900> do<00:05:21.990> much

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
it's ridiculous cuz we didn't do much

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.100 
it's ridiculous cuz we didn't do much
besides<00:05:22.380> walk<00:05:22.710> through<00:05:22.890> an<00:05:23.010> T<00:05:23.160> area<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:24.120> I'll

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
besides walk through an T area and I'll

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.010 
besides walk through an T area and I'll
cut<00:05:25.350> off<00:05:25.500> because<00:05:26.190> I'm<00:05:26.400> doing<00:05:26.490> these<00:05:26.640> little

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
cut off because I'm doing these little

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.240 
cut off because I'm doing these little
bite-sized<00:05:28.020> bits<00:05:28.230> as<00:05:28.380> opposed<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.680> gigantic

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
bite-sized bits as opposed to gigantic

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.550 
bite-sized bits as opposed to gigantic
like<00:05:29.430> marathon<00:05:29.790> rounds<00:05:30.180> in<00:05:30.270> this<00:05:30.330> game<00:05:31.190> but<00:05:32.190> I

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
like marathon rounds in this game but I

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.720 
like marathon rounds in this game but I
think<00:05:34.560> we're<00:05:34.650> almost<00:05:34.800> like<00:05:35.010> most<00:05:35.490> of<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.640> way

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
think we're almost like most of the way

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.900 
think we're almost like most of the way
through<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.180> game<00:05:36.210> because<00:05:36.480> I<00:05:36.690> think<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:37.910> is

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
through the game because I think the is

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.340 
through the game because I think the is
only<00:05:39.090> like<00:05:39.270> six<00:05:39.570> or<00:05:39.690> seven<00:05:39.720> episodes<00:05:40.230> we

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
only like six or seven episodes we

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.510 
only like six or seven episodes we
working<00:05:40.560> on<00:05:40.650> three<00:05:40.830> like<00:05:40.920> three<00:05:41.130> or<00:05:41.250> four<00:05:41.280> I

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
working on three like three or four I

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.800 
working on three like three or four I
think<00:05:41.730> but<00:05:43.460> I'm<00:05:44.460> not<00:05:44.730> entirely<00:05:45.030> certain<00:05:45.330> and

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
think but I'm not entirely certain and

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.030 
think but I'm not entirely certain and
this<00:05:46.050> loading<00:05:46.320> screen<00:05:46.380> is<00:05:46.650> taking<00:05:46.920> forever

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
this loading screen is taking forever

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.179 
this loading screen is taking forever
okay<00:05:47.730> that's
