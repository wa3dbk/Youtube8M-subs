00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.770 
think the biggest letdown is the rooms
they<00:03:59.730> could<00:03:59.880> do<00:04:00.000> with<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.180> bit<00:04:00.420> more<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.690> a

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
they could do with a bit more of a

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.660 
they could do with a bit more of a
renovation<00:04:01.380> as<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:02.069> would<00:04:02.160> just<00:04:02.340> bring<00:04:02.490> the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
renovation as it would just bring the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.750 
renovation as it would just bring the
resort<00:04:02.940> up<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.209> notch<00:04:03.390> in<00:04:03.600> my<00:04:03.630> opinion<00:04:04.760> there's

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
resort up a notch in my opinion there's

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.130
