00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.400
 a big fight 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.460
 with the happy 10% we saw that it's really deserved a second podium in 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.590
 10 minutes in the world viewfinder in that same scenario sense here it's in this 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.530
 mind that 24 years old but it's going nap to whoever is going to see soon in 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.280
 any effort should not panic 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.670
 the race has already begun with this war of nerves between peugeot and audi 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.710
 the lion brand has doubts about the validity of the techniques and 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.490

 dalhousie points the income 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.740
 I do not hear the lyrics and acts despite everything you say like 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.270
 always 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.060
 we pass successfully the state of the verifications 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.000
 the only thing I can say is that that's why things are 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.070
 past 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.780
 last night after being particularly bad at 100% 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.570
 allowed to start 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.620
 on the podium the most polemics the fans are there forever for 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.480
 bourdais 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.470
 the interview where is quietly held against another head 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.540
 crowned with the title 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.170
 when ever heard so much fervor around a pilot it's about the actor 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.500
 Patrick Dempsey 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.420
 the tribune c or the art 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 move the crowds 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.970
 within the majority 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.970
 we made our choice 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.010
 the American actor is flattered but he concentrates all the same 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.930
 on Corsica 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.690
 and yes the link rio-paris is really a magical place and it's a 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.109
 immense honor to be there 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.109
 I like all aspects of the race of the inscription today the weighing the 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.070
 crowd the excitement of the circuit of the simple Algarve but I think you 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.659
 do not have the race it's the most important thing we'll do why everything happens at 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.099
 the better this is our goal is mostly keep running to think that everything 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.909
 can arrive in 24 hours we will try to be well ranked we will see nothing 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.489
 the 24 in 2009 started in the heart of mans city and publishing 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.870
 already out of the ordinary to follow now 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.430
