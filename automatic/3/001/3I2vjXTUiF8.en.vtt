00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 now take a smartphone welcome to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.109
 a new video, I really appreciate that 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.860
 but good things of life things 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:15.089
 incoherent things of the people of 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.340
 suddenly we go to the video to the front 10 this 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.100
 it's from here again and well I wanted 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.119
 tell them that what they will be seeing are 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.640
 random plays could you say about me 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:33.420
 I go through the gears of war or ultimate 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.250
 edition hd at 1080p 720 hd and what 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.469
 it seems that's good I leave it there and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.550
 leaving the nonsense aside I wanted to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.579
 tell them that they can only play for 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.500
 things no no no I did not have the time to 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.239
 be able to play this beta that all very much 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.190
 people had telling me bad fame plays 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.190
 the beta which the beta is what I did 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.960
 was to connect me on facebook to leave them 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.780
 a link in a publication that I left 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.579
 when the day before I think it was before 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.890
 that the beta starts so that 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.930
 register was the e3 day if I did not 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.850
 I'm wrong for you to leave 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.540
 registering to the beta and keep it in 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 how much 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.850
 before, although better said they already had 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.070
 the beta is over I wanted them 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.630
 comment before I was going to talk about 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.660
 all this facebook and such for which 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.030
 is I can only play on the last day of 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.800
 the beta reaches the limit that was the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.830
 Monday I comment this I am 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.160
 recording on Tuesday the day that the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.300
 beta has closed and has closed its doors 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.490
 the training is behind closed doors and 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.410
 well the truth that I wanted to tell you in 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.310
 my opinion how little you can play 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.920
 can play in the 56 games the truth 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.890
 I came home late and I 'm not going to 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.890
 stay there without sleeping doing the ultra 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.920
 mega not sleep in a lifetime 24 hours 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.840
 live plane 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.450
 and the six games that I played the truth 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.270
 that has faults is obviously a beta 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.860
 has flaws but the game the idea that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.409
 It is behind all this I like 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.600
 very much the suburban for those who know 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.209
 a little bit of my story about the gers 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.230
 they know that I have not played it to see if 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.239
 I played the campaign but the multiplayer did not 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.060
 I played it in nothing and good this idea that 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.519
 have had to remaster everything that 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.880
 sergio suburban with graphics and 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.370
 everything that comes to do 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.890
 there are skins is also something that the truth 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.940
 that he puts a smile on his face and what 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.090
 that you can also surprise in the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.160
 face that in the beta only put you to 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.570
 change of weapon and only see a national 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.090
 answer up 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.230
 and good apart the weapons on the map do not 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.930
 what is the boom in the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.450
 sniper and things like that 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.280
 and not see rare weapons already know what 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.040
 I mean so well I'm not going to 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.560
 name because just in case because at 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.270
 better grab me in the video are 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.670
 seeing now and the weapons that 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.500
 that I do not want to name so good or 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.900
 I'm even going to name them why I 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.000
 I will be silent to tell you that 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.860
 from now on good since I could not 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.200
 take advantage of the beta more than the last day 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.710
 now what he touches at least for me 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.500
 is to go back to the 360 â€‹â€‹until they put in 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.390
 the games of the 360 in the xbox one 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.910
 because that is something that no if not 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.790
 they knew look for it because it's a 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.350
 information very very very very powerful but 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.660
 good taking off the middle since I do not 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.940
 it's a lot of video to tell them that it's my turn 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.460
 go back to 360 to play georg word 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.740
 3 at least until August 25 that 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.520
 it's the day they leave 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.200
 this ultimate edition of George word 1 and 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.860
 well that was all I hope you have 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.200
 liked 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.860
 I hope to see us a little more often go 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.860
 to our video 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.070
 plus
