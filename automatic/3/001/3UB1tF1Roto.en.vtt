not<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.230> hard<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> make<00:00:55.860> actually<00:00:56.570> you<00:00:57.570> need

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
not that hard to make actually you need

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.439 
not that hard to make actually you need
to<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.320> blackthorn<00:00:59.070> sand<00:00:59.940> off<00:01:00.149> that

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
to just the blackthorn sand off that

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.130 
to just the blackthorn sand off that
bottom<00:01:00.930> part<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.550> put<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.899> just<00:01:03.899> glue

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
bottom part and then put it on just glue

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.080 
bottom part and then put it on just glue
it<00:01:04.170> onto<00:01:04.379> gray<00:01:04.680> hello<00:01:04.949> may<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> guess<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.909> has<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
it onto gray hello may I guess it has a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
it onto gray hello may I guess it has a
second<00:01:06.600> smaller<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.439> fell<00:01:07.860> off

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
second smaller one but it fell off

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.330 
second smaller one but it fell off
earlier<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.290> stinks<00:01:10.290> I'd<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:10.979> time<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
earlier so that stinks I'd have time to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.859 
earlier so that stinks I'd have time to
glue<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.490> back<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.700> um<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.979> um<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.360> got

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
