00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.870
 iris garden video point combo called 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.030
 markus plans and our topic today is the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.300
 apricots bloom and you could 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.210
 add too early we do not have yet 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.340
 was tenth march eighth march and ours 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.770
 apricots and some of our apricots 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.580
 in the pilot plant mother in the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.800
 Pilot plant already blooming one sees 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.560
 of course, her blossom is a beautiful sight 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 goes before the deep blue deep blue 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.540
 heaven is a real pleasure though 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.149
 of course there is a danger that 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.460
 it's spring time now 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.370
 Of course, for almost two months 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.680
 possible damage is required 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.520
 They say that one is closed 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.030
 bud 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.649
 Take for example here 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.530
 relatively resistant is sometimes a few 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.410
 but minus grade from holding quite open 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.920
 flowers as if she sees here naturally 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.460
 of course, in a frosty 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.869
 minus degrees breaks 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.729
 So we'll see how that works in 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.549
 the next days and weeks developed 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.840
 also young fruits after the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.850
 Of course, fertilization early on 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.670
 Visible so anna boos can develop 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.220
 then have a certain resistance again 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.470
 but the open flowering is very vulnerable 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.180
 for spring freshness what can you do 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.920
 Here at this big tree we can 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.210
 that of course they can not do 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.340
 to miss an apricot 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.130
 especially at night to protect days 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.829
 how do we think we have no clouds 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.540
 will have a bright night and become 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.759
 have a cold night made himself 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.579
 then a sheet or something else 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.000
 to throw over the apricot and so on 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.310
 to protect against minus 23 degrees is that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.920
 quite possible and there you have it 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.590
 also prospects for success but at 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.189
 this big plant here we will be 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.649
 Of course, let hope and hope that 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.060
 the weather god our must help too 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.590
 this year one or the other 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.369
 apricots are needed here in the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.170
 to harvest the experimental plant and its 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.119
 Experience with protected apricots 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.600
 against spring festivals they write theirs 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.350
 Comment below purely and naturally 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.350
 gardens they continue
