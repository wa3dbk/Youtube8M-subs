00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.730
 the positioning of the fixation on this 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.650
 which really depends on the practice and 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.980
 urea do if we want to do more of the 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.380
 track plus do the free riding of the 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.990
 all snow we will go back slightly 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.480
 we will try to place between +20 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.240
 then scrap needed by ff 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.100
 it really sinks up even after everything is 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.620
 so in the meantime tam and festive more in 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.050
 back it allows better driving 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.880
 registered was stable in all 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.040
 snow conditions that it's snow from 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.079
 spring trafolle which dreux crust 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.090
 and saas or cloud lead to better sees 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.500
 if you vote you know nobody is acceptable 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.720
 not understood we will still make 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.579
 jumping rotations in the powder 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.960
 on the biting ones so we need a 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.059
 ski anyway a little bit more 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.439
 before more able to enter the 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.219
 times switch takeoffs and 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.219
 switch receptions 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.200
 if we have more fun to have registered 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.909
 more players we will say and more 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.100
 balanced in pure practices 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.680
 freestyle really focuses fixing 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.570
 to have so many noz and tijd on 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.830
 will adjust between +5 + 3 + 4 or more 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.080
 if this for someone who really wants 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.610
 switch back to 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.080
 having associations in the center 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.700
 it allows to have a stability 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.050
 as far forward as back we go 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.670
 adopt the language almost the same 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:43.420
 behavior also folded into two legs 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:45.130
 and we just start with straw he 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.259
 need more duct more cardoons 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.090
 that we are not quite center and we 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.850
 position the attachment a little bit 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.680
 more back than angie piece you 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.360
 look at a better grip or 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.590
 have not had rape and in the big steps and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.090
 no big pump built big 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.869
 speed and pickup 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.789
 cheyrou was shot down his banks and pierced 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.259
 plus enter this is a ski that will be 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.300
 really any player when we 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.860
 called me ksc to part a pop too 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.569
 well the back than the front that 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.700
 will facilitate since and of author everything 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.000
 that changes in the direction a super ski 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.000
 playful
