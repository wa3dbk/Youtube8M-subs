00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
trolls from the math department were

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.830 
trolls from the math department were
actually<00:00:25.890> married<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:27.180> he's<00:00:27.359> having<00:00:27.750> a

actually married but he's having a

actually married but he's having a
little<00:00:28.080> problem<00:00:28.380> applying<00:00:29.039> himself

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
little problem applying himself

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.669 
little problem applying himself
particularly<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.359> math<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.230> hold<00:00:31.410> him<00:00:31.529> back

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
particularly in math so hold him back

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.370 
particularly in math so hold him back
and<00:00:32.250> that's<00:00:32.850> why<00:00:33.030> he's<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> retard<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:34.260> you

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and that's why he's a retard now if you

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.020 
and that's why he's a retard now if you
can<00:00:34.530> teach<00:00:34.710> Kelso<00:00:35.100> how<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.399> math<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.910> can

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
can teach Kelso how to do math you can

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.180 
can teach Kelso how to do math you can
probably<00:00:36.210> teach<00:00:36.450> anybody<00:00:36.719> anything<00:00:36.980> at<00:00:37.980> my

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
probably teach anybody anything at my

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.160 
probably teach anybody anything at my
other<00:00:38.399> schools<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.059> was<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> future<00:00:39.660> math<00:00:39.840> girl

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
other schools I was the future math girl

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.500 
other schools I was the future math girl
well<00:00:40.920> you're<00:00:41.070> basically<00:00:41.219> halfway<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.329> if

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
well you're basically halfway there if

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.479 
well you're basically halfway there if
you're<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.899> really<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:44.010> bad<00:00:44.280> in

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
you're just really really really bad in

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.479 
you're just really really really bad in
that<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:46.050> how<00:00:46.170> school<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.530> math<00:00:46.890> still<00:00:47.190> kicking

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
that so how school is math still kicking

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:47.990 
that so how school is math still kicking
your<00:00:47.610> ass

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
your ass

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.590 
your ass
and<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:49.050> want<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.950> stop<00:00:50.340> feeling<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.180> an<00:00:51.329> idiot

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
and I want to stop feeling like an idiot

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.750 
and I want to stop feeling like an idiot
for<00:00:52.230> flunking<00:00:52.710> math<00:00:52.739> because<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.370> don't<00:00:53.579> have

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
for flunking math because I don't have

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.549 
for flunking math because I don't have
the<00:00:53.940> time<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.420> learn<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.840> spend<00:00:55.379> all<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.530> time

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the time to learn it spend all my time

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.220 
the time to learn it spend all my time
on<00:00:55.860> math<00:00:56.129> lucky<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> don't<00:00:57.120> flunk<00:00:57.629> anyway

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
on math lucky if I don't flunk anyway

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.580 
on math lucky if I don't flunk anyway
he's<00:00:58.920> flunking<00:00:59.250> math<00:00:59.780> well<00:01:00.780> subject<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.350> fat

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
he's flunking math well subject you fat

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.180 
he's flunking math well subject you fat

to<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.980> that<00:01:26.010> stuff<00:01:26.310> could<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.880> major<00:01:27.120> in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
to know that stuff could we major in

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.050 
to know that stuff could we major in
something<00:01:27.450> fun<00:01:27.840> light<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.920> mat<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.910> there

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
something fun light on the mat but there

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.990 
something fun light on the mat but there
was<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.710> required<00:01:31.710> math<00:01:32.070> class<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.520> know

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
was the required math class you know

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
was the required math class you know
hanging<00:01:33.540> over<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:33.960> head<00:01:33.990> eventually<00:01:34.830> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
hanging over my head eventually the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.180 
hanging over my head eventually the
pressure<00:01:35.610> got<00:01:35.940> to<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.210> too<00:01:36.420> much<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.950> I'm<00:01:37.950> not

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
pressure got to be too much so I'm not

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.910 
pressure got to be too much so I'm not
really<00:01:38.400> good<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.670> math<00:01:39.440> math<00:01:40.440> was<00:01:40.650> never<00:01:40.770> my

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
really good with math math was never my

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.830 
really good with math math was never my
strong<00:01:41.160> subject<00:01:41.460> I'm<00:01:42.180> afraid<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.540> got<00:01:42.570> my

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
strong subject I'm afraid you got my

genes in the math department kid if it
wasn't<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:44.910> your<00:01:45.030> moments<00:01:45.479> let<00:01:45.630> me<00:01:45.720> take<00:01:45.900> an

wasn't for your moments let me take an

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.410 
wasn't for your moments let me take an
algebra<00:01:46.410> I'll<00:01:47.250> never<00:01:47.580> get<00:01:47.910> a<00:01:47.940> math<00:01:48.180> either

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
algebra I'll never get a math either

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.270 
algebra I'll never get a math either
they're<00:01:49.050> doing<00:01:49.320> homework<00:01:49.530> right<00:01:49.830> now<00:01:50.010> and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
they're doing homework right now and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.850 
they're doing homework right now and
it's<00:01:50.400> that<00:01:50.550> math<00:01:51.050> trigger<00:01:52.050> grab<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.620> thing

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
it's that math trigger grab the thing

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.740 
it's that math trigger grab the thing
that<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.160> and<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.370> aren't<00:01:54.000> very<00:01:54.090> good<00:01:54.240> at

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.030 

that's<00:01:57.750> our<00:01:57.990> joke<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.350> don't<00:01:58.530> know<00:01:58.620> what<00:01:58.830> is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
that's our joke I don't know what is
