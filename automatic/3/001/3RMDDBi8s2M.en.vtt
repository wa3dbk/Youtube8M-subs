00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hi! How's it going again? 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.190
 programming of our fifth 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.230
 homemade 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.290
 today we'll make serving suggestions 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.210
 posted on youtube ice cream pie with 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.650
 friends 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.929
 the ingredients that we are going to use to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.449
 our recipe is a can of milk 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.810
 condensed a tablespoon of 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.730
 butter or margarine 3 tablespoons 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.550
 of chocolate powder 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.849
 we will also use a form of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.920
 Preferably it is open sides 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.410
 depending on the size of the shape is the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.899
 amount of bis that we are going to use 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.860
 here we have an escape of 23 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.050
 centimeters in diameter and seven in height 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.770
 for this fire we will use four 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.070
 boxes there are some brands of 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.829
 bis that already has the strawberry flavor this one 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.559
 strawberry flavor has lemon flavor 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.609
 so here we have four boxes of 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.480
 different brands and flavors too 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.420
 many different 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.739
 we'll also use an ice cream pot 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.780
 cream 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.080
 these are the ingredients we're going to use 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.479
 for our today's recipe in a pan 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.869
 on low heat we put the margarine 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.869
 or butter 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.840
 we put condensed milk 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.460
 we mix and now we're going to put the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.890
 chocolate powder 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.590
 mix well until blended 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.150
 homogeneous now we 'll keep stirring 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.310
 here without stopping not to embark 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.350
 continue on low heat until 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.700
 Here the bottom of the here loosening 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.979
 pan 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.990
 we turn on the liner let's cool it down 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.810
 at room temperature 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.649
 now we're going to ride in the way our 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.619
 bes 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.700
 As I talked to you, they have marks. 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.759
 different and different flavors here 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.829
 they have one side that is flatter and the other does not 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.500
 we'll leave out the side more 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.020
 smooth and let's putting so looks like 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.659
 if it were a hedge always the side 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.790
 more smooth on the outside and here 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.810
 strawberry to cooper 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.630
 the chocolate we are interspersing like this 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.300
 is 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.530
 Now you need what we need. 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.530
 form the cafu background 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.460
 then we form with the bis 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.690
 now we'll put an ice cream of 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.140
 cream 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.810
 We're not going to get too bad and then 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.920
 Let's put our brigadeiro that we 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.990
 We did 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.910
 but leaving a little off the refrigerator 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.220
 to be very creamy 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.680
 if much of mourinho is 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.840
 difficult to spread may be the taste of 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.990
 your preference of the people that we 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.540
 We put it in for training but if you like it 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.390
 more chocolate strawberry 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.840
 now we're going to put the ring for 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.830
 top of cream ice cream 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.650
 Brigadier must be cold to people. 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.840
 can put on and hot nal 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.950
 we put it so mixed it gets more 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.200
 pretty 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.420
 We do not charge everything alike, not now. 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.420
 We'll fill it with ice cream. 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.680
 we passed the spatula stay there 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.310
 over 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:31.640
 now let's put a little bit of our feet 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:34.610
 crumbled to decorate home can put 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.310
 You want you can come up with the 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.010
 chocolate bonbon 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.390
 now we are going to take the freezer for 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.580
 12 hours 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.770
 we like to leave more time to 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.370
 be consistent enough to facilitate the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.150
 uninformed in the freezer or freezer 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.580

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.860

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.459
 hours to stay very consistent 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.230
 It's very hot in our region.
