00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
easy to flip it and bars and that will

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.349 
easy to flip it and bars and that will
keep<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.129> bag<00:00:58.309> open<00:00:58.819> while<00:00:58.969> you're<00:00:59.120> filling

to<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.439> thin<00:01:59.710> side<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:01.030> need<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.329> keep

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
to it and a thin side you need to keep

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.539 
to it and a thin side you need to keep
the<00:02:01.689> thicker<00:02:01.930> side<00:02:02.259> in<00:02:02.649> towards<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.159> center

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
the thicker side in towards the center

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.899 
the thicker side in towards the center
of<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.759> cupcake<00:02:04.229> start<00:02:05.229> squeezing<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:06.220> then

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
of the cupcake start squeezing and then

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.059 
of the cupcake start squeezing and then
draw<00:02:07.119> it<00:02:07.210> out<00:02:07.420> towards<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.170> side<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.800> then

draw it out towards the side and then

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.540 
draw it out towards the side and then
back<00:02:09.220> into<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.610> center<00:02:11.130> giving<00:02:12.130> even

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
back into the center giving even

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.080 
back into the center giving even
pressure<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.870> each<00:02:13.930> petal<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.800> I'm<00:02:15.790> turning

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
pressure for each petal and I'm turning

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.610 
pressure for each petal and I'm turning
it<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.690> my<00:02:16.840> fingers<00:02:17.380> as<00:02:18.040> I'm<00:02:18.310> piping<00:02:18.819> it<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
it in my fingers as I'm piping it the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.530 
it in my fingers as I'm piping it the
second<00:02:21.040> layer<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.220> petals<00:02:21.580> are<00:02:22.090> done<00:02:22.269> in<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
second layer of petals are done in the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.080 
second layer of petals are done in the
same<00:02:22.569> way<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:24.370> smaller<00:02:24.670> length

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
same way but just with smaller length

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.920 
same way but just with smaller length
petals<00:02:26.550> then<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.700> cakes<00:02:27.910> can<00:02:28.299> be<00:02:28.510> left<00:02:28.720> at

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
petals then the cakes can be left at

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.050 
petals then the cakes can be left at
that<00:02:29.080> stage<00:02:29.470> but<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.160> think<00:02:30.340> it's<00:02:30.489> nice<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.940> do

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
that stage but I think it's nice to do

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.960 
that stage but I think it's nice to do
another<00:02:31.360> very<00:02:32.019> small<00:02:32.140> layer<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.160> petals<00:02:33.700> in

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
another very small layer of petals in

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:45.940 
another very small layer of petals in
the<00:02:34.000> center<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.650> that's<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:36.040> piped<00:02:36.310> cupcake

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
the butterflies for the top are made

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.840 
the butterflies for the top are made
using<00:02:48.810> flour<00:02:49.290> paste<00:02:49.650> which<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.550> be<00:02:50.670> bought

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
using flour paste which can be bought

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.000 
using flour paste which can be bought
from<00:02:51.060> most<00:02:51.300> cake<00:02:51.510> decorating<00:02:52.080> Supply<00:02:52.560> stores

upright<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:04.230> need<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.500> make<00:03:04.710> a<00:03:04.890> former<00:03:05.370> so

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
upright you need to make a former so

half and then fold back a bit on either

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.690 
half and then fold back a bit on either
side<00:03:18.050> so<00:03:19.050> that<00:03:19.290> when<00:03:19.800> I<00:03:19.830> open<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.370> the

butterfly will rest within that v-shape

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.670 
butterfly will rest within that v-shape
to<00:03:22.980> hold<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.490> shape<00:03:23.730> for<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.030> wings<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:25.470> roll

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:45.950 
now leave to dry and then I'll hold it
in<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:35.380> seam<00:05:35.620> of<00:05:35.770> a<00:05:35.860> kettle

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.469 

so<00:05:46.620> when<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.919> painting<00:05:47.370> has<00:05:47.520> dried<00:05:47.759> you<00:05:48.300> need

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
so when the painting has dried you need

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.240 
so when the painting has dried you need
to<00:05:48.660> hold<00:05:48.870> the<00:05:49.020> butterfly<00:05:49.500> in<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.800> seam<00:05:50.009> of<00:05:50.160> a

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
to hold the butterfly in the seam of a

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.610 
to hold the butterfly in the seam of a
kettle<00:05:50.639> this<00:05:51.180> sets<00:05:51.509> the<00:05:51.660> powder<00:05:51.960> color<00:05:52.319> and

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
kettle this sets the powder color and

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.170 
kettle this sets the powder color and
helps<00:05:52.889> to<00:05:53.039> bring<00:05:53.280> out<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:53.610> color<00:05:53.850> in<00:05:54.030> it<00:05:54.150> a

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
helps to bring out the color in it a

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.809 
helps to bring out the color in it a
little<00:05:54.479> bit<00:05:54.860> but<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:55.979> need<00:05:56.160> to<00:05:56.280> take<00:05:56.490> care<00:05:56.759> not

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
little bit but you need to take care not

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.210 
little bit but you need to take care not
to<00:05:57.060> scald<00:05:57.509> yourself<00:05:57.750> over<00:05:58.710> the<00:05:58.800> heat<00:05:58.979> of<00:05:59.130> the

to scald yourself over the heat of the
kettle<00:05:59.639> and<00:06:00.030> you<00:06:00.509> just<00:06:00.720> do<00:06:00.930> it<00:06:01.050> until<00:06:01.289> the

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
kettle and you just do it until the

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.189 
kettle and you just do it until the
powder<00:06:01.770> look<00:06:02.160> slightly<00:06:02.490> down<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:03.150> then<00:06:03.870> leave

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.150 

and<00:06:15.639> the<00:06:16.510> final<00:06:16.900> step<00:06:17.139> is<00:06:17.380> just<00:06:17.440> to<00:06:17.710> place<00:06:17.980> the
