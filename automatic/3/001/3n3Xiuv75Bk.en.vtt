 make that here not only 10,000 liters of packed water every day 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.630
 honda there are three different springs the source of the river and garden that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.700
 that source that from the water the whole valley escharts the source of the 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.650
 torrente san callisto that instead of drinking water here to peoples that 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.440
 that in short I'm seeing I'm drinking these days 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.410
 and then there is the land is the source of the pescara perugia there is a protected area a 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.880
 wonderful place you think the river 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.350
 is born from here it arrives until the sea they enter the city of pescara just from the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.920
 even the same city name is crossed with a flowing pin and create the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.700
 yahoomail longer than the whole of Abruzzo, as a very charming place said 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.270

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.790
 let you know about it look 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.800
 I am here with us Christian Muscat biologist 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.950
 a responsible director of the area's natural reserve springs source 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.780
 protected managed by and opened bubu the account of the municipality of peoples 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.740
 characteristics to buy throughout Italy 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.660
 this is one of the rare 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.940
 natural protected above all 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.750
 hotel region abruzzo 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.000
 cristo considers born in 86 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.180
 mobile phone you have characterized in these years on TV 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.020
 the feature is to have these sources so clear list in 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.090
 this water has this large amount of water that is born 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.490
 at a low altitude 250 meters above sea level 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.220
 this water from where a river that flows on the surface arrives in chains 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.500
 check this point singers 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.120
 filme micro springs that are just distributed over the river bed 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.460
 which is an important body of water to visit 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.190
 it is therefore to this river of the pescara river that it has a scope you think of 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.590
 7000 liters per second 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.119
 this river too, there are animals here 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.439
 even 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:15.979
 and there are so many animals and then this source like all springs 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.670
 of are the wetlands 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.989
 the quantity is very important for the biodiversity value 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:22.969
 diversity 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.979
 yes animal that vegetate with animals there are so many 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:31.829
 surely the one that will be contacted more easily will be the coot that 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.589
 it is also a bit the symbol of our reserve while underground tunnels 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:41.319
 that there is here along the river what he tells me 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.469
 for this one 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.289
 obviously from these large boulders we have in abruzzo abruzzo we have 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:51.169
 open the emperor camp the great stone that is the highest peak of the 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:57.409
 Apennines with 2000 312 while that water the snow that falls on these 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:58.100
 tops 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.129

 from the penis between the inter in the rock due to the karst form of the rivers e 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.449
 underground lakes and for granita this living water inna more areas 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.100
 low as what I feel 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.740
 50 meters above sea level where you can find waterproof restaurants and the 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.340
 question surfaces surfaces on the surface in many 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.550
 microsol people idea hopefully here 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.259
 there are lots of them to distribute right here 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.649
 all along the body of water they are called iphone 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:31.149
