00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.300
 here 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.880
 true 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.810
 now we will promote better 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.400
 century 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.469
 in this dark realm 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.109
 there are some hints of him 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.960
 it's not at all what we need 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.720
 so the light will come out of this way and 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.460
 areas 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.380
 and fall 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.460
 that's all yes 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.829
 on this 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.759
 surface 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.759
 village we use the tool ambassador 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.060
 but not just lasla, but if we press 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.670
 and support this button 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.420
 then choose polygamous mass 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.440
 so that draws straight 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 lines 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.160
 and the Ukrainian court from us will be 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
 the best way is starting the first point 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.550
 clicking the mouse 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.550
 and pulled the line here court 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.270
 another mouse click recorded 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.970
 counting line 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.970
 fix 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.690
 line 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.690
 Shchukin 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.120
 and finally back to 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.070
 original 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.430
 lace appeared near the cursor 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.940
 so we got to the starting point 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.940
 mouse click 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.160
 here is the highlighted 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
 areas coming on on straight lines so 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.380
 serve white color 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.380
 he is actually white 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.670
 doing 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.820
 new layer 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.820
 is empty 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.260
 created by us allotment oao 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
 will be true for the new layer 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.209
 now white light picks 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.209
 choose fill 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.819
 we selected area 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.819
 became white 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.039
 but teach is not very similar 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.639
 choose no transparency for 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.419
 this layer 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.829
 and reducing my 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.809
 Well, you will not 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.809
 percent to ten 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.069
 this is something 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.259
 now remove selection 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.259
 keyboard shortcut kontrol g 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.739
 scientific like 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.319
 somehow very artificially and very 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.319
 sharp border 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.259
 in fact he is more so vague 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:12.599
 fog should be 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.769
 go filters 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.839
 choose development 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.889
 voted master 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.579
 it's all done for 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.439
 new layer in which own 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.439
 there is a ray 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.290
 I hope that here already 19 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.539
 pixels 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.539
 which is basically a good border 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:41.669
 our area of â€‹â€‹steel 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.180
 vague not so low 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.479
 can do more 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.809
 blur 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.809
 it looks like this 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.789
 mackay 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.619
 about the best drew 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:03.619
 if not bright enough 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.309
 are increased 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.309
 opacity 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.889
 so if we now need to do two 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.889
 ray how to be 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 make a copy of this condition 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.120
 dragging on the new layer icon 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.330
 we get exactly the same case 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.979
 now they are superimposed on each other 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.370
 but nothing 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.710
 choose 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.199
 my most favorite tool is free 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.930
 from disbandment 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.930
 keyboard shortcut kontrol time 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.760
 and I must say that 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.509
 keyboard shortcuts 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.099
 only if the English layout is enabled 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.110
 keyboard 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.110
 so the object stood out 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.629
 actually teaches the school itself 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.110
 new code and dining 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.110
 there is a central mark in this way 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.969
 click and drag it to the washers 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.680
 the center of the solar disk is now it 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.240
 there will be a doctor center 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.949
 hunt 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.389
 take any corner 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.389
 and rotate 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.379
 like so 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:36.189
 not only that we draw we can 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:37.919
 to take 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.919
 middle markers 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.669
 and make someone worse 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.409
 at stake we crawled now we reverse 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.409
 the side 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.719
 like that 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.719
 click center and save 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.159
 but in my opinion here 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:04.800
 count road account 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.800
 generally superfluous 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.949
 but the principles of creation here I 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.050
 hopefully 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.740
 is understandable
