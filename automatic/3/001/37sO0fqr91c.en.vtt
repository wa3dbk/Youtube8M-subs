00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.270
 in this opportunity we are going to see this 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.660
 Easy mesh has a very nice design 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.720
 very very easy to make the needles that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.500
 should use are those recommended by 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.800
 The manufacturer of the wool stitch does not 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.130
 it's reversible comes out only on the side 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.130
 of the right 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:42.520
 The sample is woven in 14 points 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.790
 they always have to use points 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.760
 multiples of 2 plus those from the point of 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.450
 step by step edge let's look at how it 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.110
 do this stitch after having 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.750
 mounted or meshed the 14 points 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.380
 we started the race number 1 a point 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.380
 straight 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:09.240
 a loop 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.260
 I pass a point without weaving a point in 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.310
 a right point and I return the point that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:22.400
 do not weave what happened on the point 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:26.750
 exists and loose up there is the design 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.200
 this first point that I made right is 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.870
 the edge point is only once 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.940
 in right point on the right side 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.820
 of the tissue or that is not going to 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.500
 repeat we continue 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.270
 a loop 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.600
 step a point left a point I return the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:55.660
 Nonwoven stitch passing over the stitch 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:58.900
 Loose fabric again a loop 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:03.190
 at the point introducing the needle by 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:07.210
 half of the point I knit the point into a 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:12.070
 right point and I take with the tip of the 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:16.060
 needle the point that it does not weave and it went through 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.850
 over the woven and loose knit 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.130
 the whole race is exactly the same one 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.640
 laced 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.120
 I pass a point 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.630
 yew a point of return to the point no 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.910
 woven over knitted and loose knit 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.410
 a loop 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.340
 step a point left a point I return the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:46.930
 non-woven stitch on the knitted stitch 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:50.470
 a loop passed to a knitted point a point 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.780
 of flight the nonwoven point on the 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.120
 Knitted stitch and I finish my first 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.460
 race with an edge point that what 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.370
 I always always do on the side of 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.740
 right in a right point this race 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.970
 number two is all done at one point 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:10.140
 backwards let's remember it 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.220
 so I put the thread on the needle 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.360
 I put the needle in the middle 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.360
 having the strand above 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:27.720
 and pulled out with the tip of the strand and loose 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.819
 so we remind you how the point is made 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:36.230
 reverse the entire line or row career 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.370
 does exactly the same in a backhand 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.310
 we started the race number 3 of the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:46.330
 next way a right point 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.480
 step a point left a point I return the 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.500
 non-woven stitch on the knitted stitch and 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.350
 loose and a loop 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.800
 remember this first point is the one of 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:03.080
 edge that is made by the right in the 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.530
 race number 3 always on a right 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:12.560
 again we repeat step 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:16.280
 yew I return a loop I pass a point 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.370
 without knitting I make a woven knit in a 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:24.400
 right I return the non-woven stitch 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.400
 over the knitted stitch a lacing 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.530
 step a point left one in a right point 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.280
 I return the nonwoven on the fabric and 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.370
 I make a loop 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.030
 I pass a point without knitting yew 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.200
 next in a right point I return 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.950
 the nonwoven stitch on the knitted stitch 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.280
 and a lav hoe 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:55.529
 I finish my career with 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.379
 step a point left a point 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:02.159
 in right point I return the point no 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:05.309
 woven on the knitted stitch a loop 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.139
 a right point and so ended the 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:10.199
 career number three for the right 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.439
 race number four for the reverse of the 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:16.710
 tissue is made all in one backhand 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:18.960
 all the races are even 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.440
 on the side that are on the wrong side 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.510
 they are made at a point backwards we go back 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.190
 at the front of the fabric our last 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.800
 career was number four for the 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.320
 setback that was all done in a backhand 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.380
 you should always remember that this mesh 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.900
 easy only has four races 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.090
 that go to my page as knitting point 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.610
 com they see the written instructions of 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.610
