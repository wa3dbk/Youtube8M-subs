00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.740
 or diabetes that you do not know I have 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.200
 here I have a very concept 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.310
 different from everything we started 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.780
 nokia we follow android that you think 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.790
 If I tell you that it has not done in the end 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.080
 a device with android yes yes this 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.250
 is one of your representatives 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.220
 the nokia x in fact are nokia x series 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.039
 concretely this is the nokia x that 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.830
 also has operating system nokia x 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.250
 besides nokia x have released the nokia 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.870
 xl and the nokia x3 this is concretely 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.880
 same as the nokia x 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.880
 the only difference of x with x plus 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.640
 it comes with 50% more memory x 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.340
 Plus besides having as standard a 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.780
 microsd card of 4gb eye both 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.780
 they have a slot to incorporate that 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.070
 card but only the x plus comes 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.649
 directly when you buy the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.170
 device but let's see what this is 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.870
 from nokia x he does not want it to be a 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.180
 new operating system that is based 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.920
 in linux is based linux of course 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.050
 has an Android base because android is 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.969
 based on linux and then it has one thing 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.640
 that it's called 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:11.460
 s &amp; p ie android or peret system 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.719
 project so once we have 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.210
 that base 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.039
 s &amp; p what would google people do with 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.229
 your android would put the part of 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.960
 google apps etcetera play store and others 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.090
 what the people of nokia do is put 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.939
 a layer of windows with which the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.030
 Ojito operating system is based on 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.640
 android but the look is very similar 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.130
 to the windows phones that we know as 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 you see many colorines 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.000
 in fact the icons are exactly the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.829
 themselves and what applications are those 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.380
 we will find in this android 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.880
 because they are going to be applications for example 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.459
 from microsoft 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.039
 eye that not of windows phones but of 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.140
 microsoft adapted with this base the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.149
 operating system all these 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.000
 applications we can find them in 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.459
 a specific store and at the moment from 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.159
 nokia have already adapted for example what 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.849
 to hero nokia music or from microsoft already 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.590
 have adapted 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:07.500
 skype or outlook in addition to the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.600
 adapted applications from microsoft and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.130
 Nokia can be used in a way 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.450
 pretty simple 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.000
 you have to do the developers 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.210
 directly for android in this part 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.610
 from above we would have all the appearance of 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.400
 windows phones and in this part below 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.320
 we would have all the appearance of 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.110
 Android apps a smartphone 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.650
 very simple that integrates a processor 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.650
 qualcomm snapdragon to a dual gigahertz 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.120
 concretely in this case specifically 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.650
 are 528 megabytes of ram and 4 gb of 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.940
 expandable internal storage as os 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.040
 I used to say before using microsd cards 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.260
 As you can see, the appearance is also very 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.210
 sencillito is manufactured in 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.480
 polycarbonate here we have control of 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.950
 volume turned off the mini jack and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.360
 in the bottom part the connection 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.280
 microUSB for charging it but then 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:02.160
 where we put the cards then here in 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.900
 this part here we have the first 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.760
 microsim card to which we have the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.680
 second and here we would have the slot for 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.110
 the microsd cards this would be the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.410
 1500 milliampere battery removable and 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.420
 here in this part is the camera of 3 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.920
 megapixels the cases are 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.670
 interchangeable as you see so then 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.050
 you can choose 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.940
 the color that you like the most I'm going to 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.940
 mount so you can see the camera better 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.280
 and chimpÃºn so you already know exactly 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.230
 what is this about nokia xy these 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.640
 new devices although you'll see 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.909
 a lot of those terminals because the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.459
 price of this nokia x is 89 euros the 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.290
 x plus is 99 euros and this has to be 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.540
 then join the taxes depending 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.620
 the country is the VAT or whatever, so 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.870
 well this has been a first contact 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.549
 with the nokia x that premieres a new 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.799
 concept the new operating system and 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.720
 of course android in your guts but 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.700
 we will test it conveniently when 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.329
 come to the clicks in the see you in the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.329
 following drama
