very opium feel proud for that we really
wanted<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.030> give<00:01:01.269> a<00:01:01.449> technology<00:01:01.989> which<00:01:02.140> gives

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
wanted to give a technology which gives

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.380 
wanted to give a technology which gives
maximum<00:01:03.129> traction<00:01:03.399> that<00:01:03.670> every<00:01:03.999> time<00:01:04.239> he's

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
maximum traction that every time he's

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.870 
maximum traction that every time he's
stepping<00:01:04.780> in<00:01:04.900> different<00:01:05.199> directions<00:01:05.500> so<00:01:05.920> so

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
stepping in different directions so so

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.280 
stepping in different directions so so
the<00:01:06.970> sense<00:01:07.180> technology<00:01:07.659> really<00:01:07.840> gives<00:01:08.110> that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
the sense technology really gives that

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.590 
the sense technology really gives that
confidence<00:01:08.829> so<00:01:09.009> again<00:01:09.400> just<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.700> land<00:01:09.880> focus

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
confidence so again just to land focus

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.390 
confidence so again just to land focus
on<00:01:10.750> what<00:01:10.869> he's<00:01:10.990> doing<00:01:11.290> which<00:01:11.770> is<00:01:11.799> getting<00:01:11.950> past

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
on what he's doing which is getting past

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.450 
on what he's doing which is getting past
a<00:01:12.640> defender<00:01:13.090> or<00:01:13.659> attacking<00:01:14.590> down<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:14.920> wing<00:01:15.220> and

on there if you're a footballer it's

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.030 
on there if you're a footballer it's
really<00:01:22.509> important<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:22.990> keep<00:01:23.470> focus<00:01:23.860> in<00:01:23.950> the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
really important to keep focus in the

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.710 
really important to keep focus in the
game<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.490> let<00:01:24.640> your<00:01:24.759> boot<00:01:24.939> take<00:01:25.270> care<00:01:25.509> of<00:01:25.600> all

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
game and let your boot take care of all

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.450 
game and let your boot take care of all
the<00:01:25.840> slippage<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.619> traction<00:01:27.220> you<00:01:27.250> need

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.920 

you<00:01:30.460> need<00:01:30.579> to<00:01:30.670> think<00:01:30.820> about<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.180> biomechanics

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
you need to think about the biomechanics

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.109 
you need to think about the biomechanics
of<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.079> cheetah<00:01:32.320> is<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:33.070> really<00:01:33.369> focus<00:01:33.850> on<00:01:33.969> its

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
of a cheetah is it really focus on its

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.819 
of a cheetah is it really focus on its
prey<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.390> it's<00:01:34.689> body<00:01:34.960> adapts<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.649> the

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
prey and it's body adapts to the

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.330 
prey and it's body adapts to the
different<00:01:36.130> type<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.280> terrain<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:39.100> pleasure

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
different type of terrain the pleasure

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.030 
different type of terrain the pleasure
for<00:01:39.579> me<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.820> course<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.240> make<00:01:40.540> ask<00:01:41.110> me<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.590> few

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
for me of course that make ask me a few

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.429 
for me of course that make ask me a few
things<00:01:42.189> about<00:01:42.579> what<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.420> I<00:01:43.659> feel<00:01:43.930> about<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.259> was

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
things about what I I feel about the was
