24-7 cool um eyeliners and I bought like

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.420 
24-7 cool um eyeliners and I bought like
one<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.290> kids<00:03:51.739> so<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.070> came<00:03:52.160> with<00:03:52.310> like

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
one of the kids so it came with like

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.729 
one of the kids so it came with like
five<00:03:52.760> or<00:03:52.910> six<00:03:53.090> eyeliners<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:54.320> like<00:03:54.530> them

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.760 
but they just smudge a lot and I think
it's<00:03:56.840> because<00:03:56.900> like<00:03:57.140> they're<00:03:57.320> that<00:03:57.500> gel

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
it's because like they're that gel
