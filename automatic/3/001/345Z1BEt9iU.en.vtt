00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
this button up here let's see if I have

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.740 
this button up here let's see if I have
to<00:02:35.020> keep<00:02:35.200> holding<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.710> hold<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.730> says<00:02:36.970> okay<00:02:37.510> and

to keep holding it hold it says okay and
now<00:02:38.350> it's<00:02:38.380> in<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:39.040> believe<00:02:39.100> in<00:02:39.640> pairing<00:02:40.090> mode

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
now it's in I believe in pairing mode

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.940 
now it's in I believe in pairing mode
and<00:02:40.540> let's<00:02:40.660> see<00:02:40.810> if<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.020> actually<00:02:41.050> finds<00:02:41.620> my

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950

find my phone and then finally time

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.250 
find my phone and then finally time

adjustment so I can send the time and

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.530 
adjustment so I can send the time and
date<00:04:05.470> data<00:04:05.739> right<00:04:06.070> from<00:04:06.100> here<00:04:06.670> directly<00:04:07.390> to

the<00:04:07.660> watch<00:04:07.810> now<00:04:08.170> it's<00:04:08.350> already<00:04:08.590> set<00:04:08.950> as<00:04:09.160> you

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
the watch now it's already set as you

the watch now it's already set as you
can<00:04:09.459> see<00:04:09.700> but<00:04:10.239> I'll<00:04:10.360> just<00:04:10.510> send<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.870> again<00:04:11.080> and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
can see but I'll just send it again and

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.199 
can see but I'll just send it again and
it'll<00:04:11.440> reset<00:04:11.950> it<00:04:12.070> I<00:04:12.160> guess<00:04:12.370> even<00:04:12.970> though<00:04:13.060> it's

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
it'll reset it I guess even though it's

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.940 
it'll reset it I guess even though it's
already<00:04:13.450> set<00:04:13.870> one<00:04:14.290> of<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.440> cool<00:04:14.620> things<00:04:14.830> about

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
already set one of the cool things about

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.890 
already set one of the cool things about
the<00:04:15.220> watch<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.730> it<00:04:15.910> will<00:04:16.060> go<00:04:16.209> into<00:04:16.419> sleep<00:04:16.840> mode

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
the watch is it will go into sleep mode

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.560 
the watch is it will go into sleep mode
by<00:04:17.320> itself<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:18.010> if<00:04:18.070> you're<00:04:18.190> not<00:04:18.280> using<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:19.000> it

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
by itself so if you're not using it it

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.090 
by itself so if you're not using it it
will<00:04:19.690> kind<00:04:19.900> of<00:04:19.989> turn<00:04:20.169> itself<00:04:20.440> off<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:20.979> has

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
will kind of turn itself off and it has

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.640 
will kind of turn itself off and it has
a<00:04:21.160> sensor<00:04:21.820> inside<00:04:22.300> so<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.110> when<00:04:23.260> you<00:04:23.410> pick

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
a sensor inside so that when you pick

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.400 
a sensor inside so that when you pick
the<00:04:23.860> watch<00:04:24.070> back<00:04:24.520> up<00:04:24.789> it<00:04:25.410> automatically

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
the watch back up it automatically

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.400 
the watch back up it automatically
reconnects<00:04:27.160> and

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
reconnects and

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.680 
reconnects and
itself<00:04:27.890> back<00:04:28.130> up<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.670> phone<00:04:28.880> so<00:04:29.480> you<00:04:29.570> can

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
itself back up to the phone so you can

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.260 
itself back up to the phone so you can
start<00:04:29.990> using<00:04:30.170> it<00:04:30.410> again<00:04:30.880> let's<00:04:31.880> see<00:04:32.030> what<00:04:32.150> else

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
start using it again let's see what else

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.010 
start using it again let's see what else
is<00:04:32.450> in<00:04:32.600> here

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
is in here

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.590 
is in here
skin<00:04:33.790> let's<00:04:34.790> see<00:04:34.970> if<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.180> want<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:35.390> to<00:04:35.480> be

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
skin let's see if you want it to be

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.560 
skin let's see if you want it to be
white<00:04:35.840> or<00:04:35.870> black<00:04:36.260> that's<00:04:36.620> for<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:36.950> app

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
white or black that's for the app

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.880 
white or black that's for the app
language<00:04:38.570> and<00:04:38.930> then<00:04:39.200> you<00:04:39.230> can<00:04:39.470> remove<00:04:39.680> the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
language and then you can remove the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.330 
language and then you can remove the
pairing<00:04:40.550> process<00:04:40.840> so<00:04:41.890> everything<00:04:42.890> seems<00:04:43.220> to

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
pairing process so everything seems to

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.400 
pairing process so everything seems to
be<00:04:43.460> all<00:04:43.700> connected<00:04:44.420> right<00:04:44.450> now<00:04:44.690> I<00:04:44.900> guess<00:04:45.260> the

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
be all connected right now I guess the

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.560 
be all connected right now I guess the
next<00:04:45.590> step<00:04:45.860> would<00:04:46.010> be<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.400> try<00:04:47.000> an<00:04:47.060> incoming

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
next step would be to try an incoming

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.980 
next step would be to try an incoming
call<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:49.700> let's<00:04:50.000> give<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.240> a<00:04:50.390> whirl<00:04:50.420> I'm<00:04:50.810> going

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
call so let's give it a whirl I'm going

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.440 
call so let's give it a whirl I'm going
to<00:04:51.080> off-camera<00:04:51.830> dial<00:04:52.280> my<00:04:52.520> cell<00:04:52.910> phone<00:04:53.120> number
