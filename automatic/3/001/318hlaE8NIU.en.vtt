00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:10.010
 I 'll solve the first note of this time. 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:13.640
 July 2009 About Us Operation Status of Agents 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.250
 If you look here, it's 24 for the tuition. 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:23.539
 Next is the fee14 here. 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:24.770
 How do these two tuition fees and tuition fees change if 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.949
 What if 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:33.890
 But it's 70,000 won and it's 1 million won. 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:38.629
 10% raise, that is, 10% of tuition fee and tuition fee 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.969
 If you raise 30%, you will have to pay 17,000 won for the departure and then the instructor 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:46.249
 Would be $ 1,100. 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:48.229
 The next 20% or more will be 20% for 14,000 won for the fish, 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.979
 I will do it 84,000 won 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:58.069
 The tuition fee will be 1.2 million won. 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:01:02.239
 If so, here 's how to pay h12 How it fluctuates 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:05.720
 Well, first of all, cell names are my priority. 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.490
 a14 cell is going to define character name 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.490
 Are you supposed to do not know the name definition? 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 Course Prices 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:25.670
 Course 3 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.780
 EntrÃ©e then here is the lecture 3 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.710
 Lecturer 3 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.710
 Then h10 h11 and pay e 3 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:47.450
 Let's define this name. You must name us well. 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:51.229
 Then make it into your own Now you have a tab of data 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.229
 Virtual analysis scenario is managed 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.260
 Now, what do you do first? You have to add a scenario. 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:03.000
 Add character 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:06.750
 And the first myth is a 10% raise, so it's 10% 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.660
 I will be determined to raise. 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:15.750
 Let's change it's important to change where 3 is vertical 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:19.050

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:24.180

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:28.920
 How does it change? It's a Bruce impression. 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.630

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.440
 It will be full. 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:39.110
 That's what I added. 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.620
 10 Give 20% or more 20% 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.620
 21% phosphorus 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:54.050
 Make sure that the change cell is the same. 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:58.220
 Verify and 20% cotton, now that 70,000 14,000 won his coming

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.630
 20% 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.290
 Now 20 manwon pushes haejusimyeon do 1,200,000 won 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:12.230
