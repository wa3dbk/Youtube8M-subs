00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:11.800
 [Music] 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.059
 you guys are gigi entrustment 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.390
 welcome back a built of subjects 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.570
 exclaims point are restrained and state vi 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.739
 I bring a gameplay of my absurd opinion 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.009
 because it has been realized anyway 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:27.009
 prepared it is a 50 60 on cdm 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.119
 that now already with the 100 kg would not be a 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.589
 problem 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.410
 then it was made precisely pre peace 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.359
 so they were only 75 10 didn't make sense 75 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.429
 a nice number considered ice made one 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:43.480
 equivalence 50 67 56 st 75 as hicks 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:46.480
 st100 comes out a number of tournaments 70 75 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.910
 so it's still a great score on 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.879
 gameplay you are seeing in the background is 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.399
 been made with the ball does not ask me 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.019
 of the class because I do n't know that not me 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.449
 I remember it because too much time then 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.789
 use what I know a ball for those who want 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.499
 use a new class use a nice col 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.030
 kick to increased as I am using it 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.180
 I recently because while Guestrooms have balconies 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.800
 good if you have loeb city use the obsidian 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.540
 however, today I wanted to talk to him about one 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.070
 what in particular the first is that the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.870
 my birthday so give me your best wishes 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.000
 have been said formally accomplished 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.680
 17 years in a year I take the car e 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.060
 they are fucking bros then pierce 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.040
 they will take the car and therefore not 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.440
 what do not celebrate birthday because 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.610
 I just want to reserve the money for the 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.590
 next year for the party for the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.600
 machine is this year that is not that not 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.400
 I take presents and tests, that is the gift 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.530
 I take it anyway I take a computer 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.540
 which should replace mine which is 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.430
 quite old and therefore computer 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.660
 however I will need it in the future maybe not 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.830
 I'm going to college anyway 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.380
 I will take a job that I needed at 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.539
 computer then 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.420
 It is something that in the end so useful 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.890
 it serves therefore I don't want to take with itself 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.450
 useless then I will not go to use 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.579
 sorry for the repetition of the words 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.920
 but still the first time I speak 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.210
 in front of 27 thousand members almost everything 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.950
 mila so ok 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.220
 and passed a motorcycle under my house the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.390
 anyway the grand prize is the comment of 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.519
 today it's the ones I play from 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.819
 I call non-commercial that in the end 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:15.580
 they are famous however they detach from games 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.650
 commercial like codjia fifa these 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.830
 crap shit that I always owe 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.130
 but commercial rather than after a while 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.319
 tired but I make a top five of mine 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.319
 opinions on the games I tried is that I'm 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.269
 so try not to take as gold 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.040
 my words do not take as words 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.360
 wise and therefore are those 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.500
 strictly personal then to me 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.750
 they may please you they can't 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.660
 travel so don't start doing i 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.370
 children comments I hope you write are 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.140
 constructive criticism but also charity from 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.970
 make me improve the commentaries because I don't 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.480
 they are great to you then the top five 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.959
 thus begins a decreasing way 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.760
 no less growing from the fifth to the first 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.470
 fifth position 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.450
 assassin's creed of unity which I think 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.030
 it was the flop of this saga because 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.190
 I really enjoyed the history and 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.989
 graphics , however, were as strafiga as if 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.299
 also at the end because on ps4 it can't 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.680
 moreover, it cannot already be 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.220
 otherwise elsewhere 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.299
 I do n't know how they say however they are crooked 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.269
 to speak therefore the graphic that it was 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.870
 quite nice good decent in some 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.160
 points crumbled but it wasn't really 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.359
 let's say to say that it sucked then 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.680
 she was pretty enough that they were there 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.510
 of frame problems so it is not me 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.060
 really liked the story did not catch me 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.890
 so much because they burn 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.080
 he didn't create me much as a character 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.690
 i prefer older auditor there is a 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.280
 great cool like that slutty cow yes 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.440
 finds only implode wheel revelations 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.630
 sin story for neighbor is better 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.550
 at the fourth position there is triumph fusion 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.260
 that you will all recognize the game of 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.810
 he did n't bring it to Italy 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.370
 so really a beautiful game me 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.040
 they passed it I'm passing by 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.349
 sleep on that game then take it 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.660
 buy yourself several nice extras in the third 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:01.140
 position we have blackburn labourne 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.700
 exclusive chapter of the ps4 I do not think 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.319
 only other platforms will be released 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.030
 however it is a game it is very difficult there 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.410
 you have to waste so much time 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.980
 I'm trying to pass it on today 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.430
 in fact there is no map on are 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.229
 distant from each other and therefore is 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.940
 very very very very very difficult 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.580
 however, remembering the maps is not 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.490
 not so easy because the environments 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.520
 they are quite dark and therefore it turns out 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.950
 a little difficult to remember all that me 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.960
 can you a memory that is zero is not 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.000
 I remember a dick so I suck 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.800
 second position is from inlight 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.600
 very little time so I have to do there 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.850
 time light 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.500
 a great game especially that 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.650
 in multiplayer they still passed it to me 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.840
 today I'm playing a lot, you expect 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.120
 of moose and moose pdl yes because they are 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.970
 really beautiful really too much too 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.340
 children in the first position we have destiny 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.570
 lyrics the game in my opinion is more beautiful 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.210
 I've never found 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.590
 because that is why I put myself under play 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.050
 from December 20th 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.910
 today we are June 9th even if the 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.410
 comment and undoing three days before 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.210
 today is June and then I am again 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.280
 I did n't take off, I'm not sick of 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.850
 to play with that I always find something from 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.170
 make the game absurd on that game 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.840
 I think there's a mix in that game 10 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.030
 tam because it is too ethical ie when 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.470
 do the raids I want friends or for whom 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.650
 plays at them can understand the atoll 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:32.430
 the arena shows too many children 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.370
 really too too beautiful too is 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.780
 another thing under infinite play 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.430
 because they were ending up among us because 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.950
 always put things free with chile 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.810
 of course yes I have to pay though 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.910
 however they always put on events 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.640
 such as non-tournament hitch 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.170
 disk to win something in that case 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.520
 you can win rewards that 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.500
 need to get you going on 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.780
 however game is infinite indeed for 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.490
 this they put things every week 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.530
 new always updating stuff for 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.720
 part will make it infinity is a good one 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.690
 fucking moment excuse the word 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.950
 but do the same things every time though 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:11.380
 if they mix well between the various characters 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:14.380
 you can eventually create a 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:18.640
 a fantastic game because with the release 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.560
 of the new dlc and to 1 even or I said 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.730
 a very strange English word or the 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.130
 wolf hunter as you call it 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.390
 really nice anyway I think almost 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.460
 while i hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.710
 commented grafted us better then 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.980
 I imagined 20,000 volts and put on 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.140
 20,000 dislike online 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.120
 so here from all elements he writes 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.570
