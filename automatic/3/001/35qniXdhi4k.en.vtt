00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello my dear friends my dear 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.540
 girls my followers maybe future 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.670
 subscribers and those who see whether the first to all 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello to all 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.240
 today's lesson is a topic of conversation 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.760
 would be then so comprehensive for me 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.250
 problem topic as a double accent 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.130
 there is such an opinion yes among mostly 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.960
 all professional makeup artists that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.410
 it is necessary to put one accent 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:31.480
 either on the lips or on the eyes but on the very 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:36.220
 In fact, this remnants of probably 2006 shooting gallery 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.320
 this year 2011 and you just need to competently 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.390
 be able to put two accents 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.890
 at the same time if you look if you 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.350
 cool glossy magazine look at 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.449
 latest advertising campaigns almost everywhere 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.210
 even in lip gloss advertising campaign 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.559
 from sl laurent anyway bright accent and on 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.960
 eyes and lips 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.059
 another thing that it certainly is not always 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.430
 wear and make-up artists are usually from 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.739
 advise this when teaching lessons 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.760
 make up for myself including myself too 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.440
 I advise you to do this for those who do not have 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.290
 I don’t know how to use any makeup artist 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.680
 do it correctly but there is a certain 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.210
 the size 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.820
 a number of activities for which probably 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.820
 better even go under with such a bright 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.010
 makeup rather than with some simple and in 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.310
 principle two accents it is beautiful it is not 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.150
 mean sure to red lips and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.340
 black such eyes it is admissible 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.750
 dark dark cherry lips and such 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.390
 silver silver violet some 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.190
 here is such a cold range of smokey ice 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.560
 may be such a golden smokey 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.810
 as I have now and such red lips 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.300
 there may be red lips and some other 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.450
 there are dark dark brown eyes such 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.580
 alac ka-akaralova orange lips on 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.340
 dark skin looks very nice it 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.440
 All two accents this not Smokey and this 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.020
 Really 2 and 2 axon makeup but 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.450
 he has a place to be on some 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.350
 events at such as graduation in 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.909
 the university 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.100
 not in school schoolboy can not in no way 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.080
 case in school is the little ones you 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.850
 can not be painted on the prom 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.530
 university when a woman is already close to 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.010
 age girl is close to age 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.620
 women and twenty before and it has 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.670
 place to be at big events 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.230
 high class such as premiere 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.239
 film maybe you have any 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.489
 super rich friends and you go on 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.500
 party on a yacht there or in principle then 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.389
 what does the evening mean 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.450
 Ballroom such an outfit a long dress to the floor 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:32.069
 there treasure strain jewels and so on 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.019
 all this also has a place to attract 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.150
 attention to itself is double the makeup 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.860
 that is, you can make 2 accent 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.860
 make-up double is called war 2 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.470
 accent and this will be the place this will be 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.540
 in the subject it will be beautiful and it will be in 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.250
 principle unobtrusively not so 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.290
 vulgar as you think it is in fact 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.660
 doing looks just is important to do 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.250
 if not to be able to be beautiful 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.319
 Of course it's better to forget about such 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.860
 topic like 2 focus on makeup and throw away 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.500
 her forever because you need to be right 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.459
 shade 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.739
 shades choose the right color 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.290
 gamma of course about the main things 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.769
 I just told you that as a rule 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.480
 shades from red to darker 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.489
 there is a long time going to dark to 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.380
 burgundy with so dark maroon 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.260
 they are combined with cold tones with 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.970
 silver and red and warmer 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.459
 I now have such an average red 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.440
 alla red so well I would even say 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.370
 this is a red rose to that color 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.900
 here comes gold too 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.450
 tint in principle but closer to gold 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.130
 and farther away in warm colors here 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.630
 about a shade of gold like mine 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.260
 now it will fit the principle to 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.120
 all dark lips bright dark to 7 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.359
 lips that emphasize myself 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.040
 attention and further you add 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.130
 colors add a dark shade and 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.840
 get some kind of water dream with 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.030
 makeup that my daughter is like mine now and 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.769
 again, I confirm that it is 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.560
 looks beautiful just it should be 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.190
 it should be technically appropriate and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.579
 must be correctly done correctly 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.019
 from the right position filed and it is not 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.720
 does not look super 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.609
 vulgar there like a prostitute like 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.319
 many cities god dread it erase 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.790
 yourself seven layers of plaster it's just those 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.709
 people who are not distributed makeup for 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.200
 In principle, their makeup is already a sign 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.760
 prostitute but modern make-up he is not 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.700
 standing still will find in long strides 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.320
 forward and in the works of famous western 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.570
 makeup artist such as charlotte uber and 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.599
 who generally their cosmetics under 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.370
 magrat liza and larisa don’t know monica 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.510
 blando who did makeup by the way 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.100
 saying recently for 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.080
 Rosie huntington-whiteley on one of 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.090
 covers or there too was in lactate 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.250
 makeup with bright bloody lips and 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.130
 so super super bronze smoky 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.040
 bright so what 's the food this place be i 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.910
 I wish you success was the performance of the focus 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.460
 on make-up 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.290
 put my hashtag with my name i 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.150

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.360

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.750
 here's another remind you about it started 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.760
 if you are interested see this video 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.280
 start by drawing dark brown 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.490
 shadows from my palette benefit all 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.750
 the title will be signed under the video 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.790
 we draw a corner of the eye and 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.190
 the fold of the upper eyelid also go to 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:25.170
 lower eyelid and of course everything is on top 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:28.210
 feathering usually shading brush 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:32.440
 further I take a beautiful cold golden 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:37.470
 shade from the company on pc and add 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:40.090
 black shadows in the nook to 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:45.580
 deepen our drawing make it more 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:47.110
 dark turn such a time bow now 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.700
 with the usual black pencil 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.430
 I paint over the space between the pages 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.710
 upper century I will go to the lower 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:59.170
 and always painted the bottom 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:01.270
 the mucous here is super neatness 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.190
 matter we will still shock so 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:08.500
 you can especially drive him there 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:12.070
 the arrows now all the same 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:18.760
 feathering the usual brush testiki 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:21.310
 for the shadows and then a little bit warm 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.970
 brown shadows I put on a pattern for 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.070
 to give a warmer shade 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.230
 I still shade a brush further 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.300
 I take the usual black bulk mascara from me 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.090
 from meybelin draw all personalities 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:38.020
 as lower energy so also later 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:40.360
 add overhead cilia on now i 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.340
 same put false cilia and now 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.320
 I treat the area under the eyes with concealer 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.380
 in order to remove the showered shadows and 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:50.620
 give freshness to our box 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.210
 I have content from mac roll on gts 20 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.470

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.540
 great contigo 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.290
 I take the highlighter now from me 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:02.410
 there was a new favorite highlighter for poppy 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:05.770
 which I write under the video and 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.650
 I designate highlighter with a code back 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.290
 spout a little bit above the lip further I take my 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.380
 favorite lipstick that Elena loves so much 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:17.980
 krygina we all know and nuba number zero 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.810
 7 or anything else is also good 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.340
 like any other matte lipstick but 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.920
 she has one plus what she is 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.490
 really gives velvet matte 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.280
 Effect 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.990
 your i would even say buy a bridge 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.510
 can be easily worn without a pencil that i 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.310
 actually and the case without a pencil to i am right 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:41.500
 I use the same applicator to draw the shape and 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:43.240
 I fill it with lipstick itself actually 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.860
