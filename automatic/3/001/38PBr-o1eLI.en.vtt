videos<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.459> show<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:12.620> but<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.739> one<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.340> think

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
videos to show that but this one I think

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.020 
videos to show that but this one I think
of<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.269> is<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.810> another<00:03:16.769> variant<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.549> a

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
of this is a another variant of a

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.199 
of this is a another variant of a
rosewood<00:03:18.989> okay<00:03:19.890> not<00:03:20.430> really<00:03:20.459> rosewood<00:03:21.060> but

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209

it's<00:04:52.000> just<00:04:52.270> corresponding<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.840> 300<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:53.320> 400

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
it's just corresponding to 300 and 400

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.290 
it's just corresponding to 300 and 400
models<00:04:53.890> okay<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:54.610> they're<00:04:54.760> all<00:04:54.880> pretty<00:04:55.030> much<00:04:55.240> a

appointments<00:05:08.020> alright<00:05:08.350> so<00:05:09.340> this<00:05:09.460> one<00:05:09.520> had<00:05:11.400> I'm

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
appointments alright so this one had I'm

not good that this one does the the for

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.450 
not good that this one does the the for
14s<00:05:15.430> before<00:05:16.530> 2003<00:05:17.530> when<00:05:17.890> they<00:05:18.190> made<00:05:18.340> the

14s before 2003 when they made the
Taylor<00:05:18.700> expression<00:05:19.180> system<00:05:19.450> it<00:05:19.540> did<00:05:19.660> come

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
Taylor expression system it did come

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.460 
Taylor expression system it did come
with<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:20.110> fisherman<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:22.660> camera<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.080> Fixman

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
they made the Taylor expression system

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.390 
they made the Taylor expression system
and<00:05:33.850> this<00:05:34.360> is<00:05:34.510> the<00:05:34.660> generation<00:05:35.050> 2<00:05:35.470> Taylor

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
and this is the generation 2 Taylor

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.950 
and this is the generation 2 Taylor
expression<00:05:36.760> systems<00:05:37.060> pretty<00:05:37.300> simple<00:05:37.600> got

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
expression systems pretty simple got

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.310 
expression systems pretty simple got
three<00:05:38.170> knobs<00:05:39.420> got<00:05:40.420> it<00:05:40.540> get<00:05:40.720> a<00:05:40.750> few<00:05:40.990> sensors

to do is play it the volume and that you
got<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.830> base<00:05:48.010> in<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.190> trouble<00:05:48.340> really

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
got the base in the trouble really

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.780 
got the base in the trouble really
simple<00:05:49.570> to<00:05:49.660> play<00:05:49.870> okay<00:05:50.530> so<00:05:51.370> I'm<00:05:51.460> going<00:05:51.640> to<00:05:51.670> go

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
simple to play okay so I'm going to go

not an acoustic amp okay
after<00:06:10.570> that<00:06:10.690> one<00:06:10.900> today<00:06:11.200> for<00:06:11.260> doing<00:06:11.860> that

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
after that one today for doing that

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
but you can see that it's pretty much

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.570 
but you can see that it's pretty much
respect<00:06:16.030> the<00:06:16.930> this<00:06:17.410> Hannity<00:06:17.680> guitar<00:06:17.919> some

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
respect the this Hannity guitar some

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.890 
respect the this Hannity guitar some
people<00:06:18.819> don't<00:06:19.000> like<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.210> tail<00:06:19.360> expression

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
system some do you really need to try it

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.700 
system some do you really need to try it
out<00:06:22.060> put<00:06:22.270> on<00:06:22.389> a<00:06:22.419> really<00:06:22.720> good<00:06:22.870> -<00:06:22.960> acoustic<00:06:23.530> amp

out put on a really good - acoustic amp
that<00:06:23.949> really<00:06:24.220> does<00:06:24.430> help<00:06:24.990> my<00:06:25.990> experience<00:06:26.639> but

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
that really does help my experience but

that really does help my experience but
you<00:06:27.970> can<00:06:28.120> see<00:06:28.360> here<00:06:28.630> just<00:06:28.660> um<00:06:29.139> if<00:06:29.620> we<00:06:29.770> go<00:06:29.889> and

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
you can see here just um if we go and

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.100 
you can see here just um if we go and
get<00:06:30.400> you<00:06:30.729> a<00:06:30.759> song<00:06:31.060> that's<00:06:31.360> more<00:06:31.690> look<00:06:31.900> at<00:06:32.080> that

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
get you a song that's more look at that

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
it does sound like rosewood it's pretty

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.460 
it does sound like rosewood it's pretty
close<00:06:46.110> um<00:06:46.790> compared<00:06:47.790> so<00:06:48.120> if<00:06:48.540> you<00:06:48.840> really<00:06:49.199> are
