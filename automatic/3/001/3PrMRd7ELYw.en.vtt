for 1.3 bill and the reason for it being

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.539 
for 1.3 bill and the reason for it being
so<00:01:36.240> high<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.710> don't<00:01:38.100> want<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.340> sell

so high is because I don't want to sell

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.640 
so high is because I don't want to sell
it<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.540> does<00:01:39.750> sell<00:01:40.020> I'm<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> make

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
it but if it does sell I'm going to make

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.789 
it but if it does sell I'm going to make
a<00:01:40.680> lot<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> GP<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.729> doing<00:01:41.970> nothing<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.930> that's

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
going to be huge you can do estimations

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.189 
going to be huge you can do estimations
and<00:04:04.509> say<00:04:04.870> times<00:04:05.409> this<00:04:05.829> by<00:04:06.310> what<00:04:07.019> this<00:04:08.019> is

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.020 
and say times this by what this is
twenty-five<00:04:08.590> percent<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:09.189> make<00:04:09.609> it<00:04:09.639> a<00:04:09.790> hundred

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
twenty-five percent so make it a hundred

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.270 
twenty-five percent so make it a hundred
percent<00:04:10.239> so<00:04:10.989> by<00:04:11.139> adding<00:04:11.319> three<00:04:11.859> more<00:04:11.889> of<00:04:12.099> these

percent so by adding three more of these
tabs<00:04:12.609> in<00:04:12.879> and<00:04:13.090> see<00:04:13.780> what<00:04:13.959> you<00:04:14.079> would<00:04:14.199> get<00:04:14.409> but<00:04:14.889> I

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
tabs in and see what you would get but I

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:16.379 
tabs in and see what you would get but I
don't<00:04:15.159> honestly<00:04:15.370> think<00:04:15.699> you<00:04:16.030> can<00:04:16.060> do<00:04:16.359> that

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
don't honestly think you can do that

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.140 
don't honestly think you can do that
with<00:04:16.690> this<00:04:16.900> because<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:18.489> drops<00:04:18.789> are<00:04:18.970> so

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
with this because the drops are so

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.610 
with this because the drops are so
random<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.690> that's<00:04:19.840> what<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.019> like<00:04:20.199> about<00:04:20.259> it

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
random and that's what I like about it

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.959 
random and that's what I like about it
like<00:04:21.159> if<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.430> get<00:04:21.489> an<00:04:21.699> ascension<00:04:23.639> if<00:04:24.639> I<00:04:24.789> get<00:04:24.940> a
