00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:05.080
 the theme there is no league because we are going to make a drawing with pencils have you seen look 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.160
 you like 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.099
 but we have not done it with normal pencils and currents not wolves of 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.980
 water soluble chocolate 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.799
 maybe this is what I have and here 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.630
 and who is the specialty that is the new thing that these have 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.650
 what can you paint as if they were paintings and if you are waiting 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.960
 with a brush he added a little water to the drawing 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.210
 and the colored pencils turn into watercolors 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.230
 you get amazing effects 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.050
 A drawing made with colored pencils becomes a painting as per 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.280
 magic art or rather by water art 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.430
 do not forget any details 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.700
 perfect 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.850
 these pencils not only serve to paint also to include 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 last details and yes no 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.030
 the soluble pencils are great for mixing colors beyond the details to 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.050
 your drawing 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.790
 for example in this beautiful hillside I will place a person 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.820
 he drew the pants 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 and the sweater 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.740
 you can use one color on top of another 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.580
 the colors are very intense, even the lightest, which makes them fantastic 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.580
 to add details 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.830
 You can even draw over once dried 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.620
 we have drawn a very cool kite 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.139
 and a little color is missing 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.139
 here 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.819
 perfect very well 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.429
 and here we have the finished drawing seen 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:34.349
 remember 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.549
 to beat pencils soluble salt water and we're still here 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.169
 in silver 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:39.749
 everyone
