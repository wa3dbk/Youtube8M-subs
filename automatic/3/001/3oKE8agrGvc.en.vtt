support<00:01:31.799> you're<00:01:31.950> still<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.280> want<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
support you're still going to want to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.270 
support you're still going to want to
design<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.000> game<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> has<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
design the game so that it has so that

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.890 
design the game so that it has so that
is<00:01:35.369> well<00:01:35.520> optimized<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.119> playing<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.570> Virtual

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
is well optimized for playing in Virtual

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.240 
is well optimized for playing in Virtual
Reality<00:01:36.930> hardware<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.770> terms<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.100> having

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
Reality hardware but in terms of having

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.830 
Reality hardware but in terms of having
basic<00:01:38.670> support<00:01:38.939> we're<00:01:39.150> able<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.450> look<00:01:39.570> around

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
basic support we're able to look around

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
basic support we're able to look around
and<00:01:40.140> also<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.009> know<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:41.400> weapon

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and also have you know what weapon

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.249 
and also have you know what weapon
aiming<00:01:41.850> that's<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.750> really<00:01:42.960> easy<00:01:42.990> if

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
aiming that's going to be really easy if

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.190 
aiming that's going to be really easy if
you're<00:01:43.560> not<00:01:43.740> using<00:01:43.950> Unreal<00:01:44.399> or<00:01:45.079> unreal<00:01:46.079> or

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you're not using Unreal or unreal or

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.319 
you're not using Unreal or unreal or
unity<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:46.799> we're<00:01:47.220> providing<00:01:47.460> code<00:01:47.759> examples

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
unity then we're providing code examples

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.580 
unity then we're providing code examples
and<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> software<00:01:48.869> development<00:01:49.170> kit<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.500> make

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and a software development kit that make

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.719 
and a software development kit that make
it<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:49.740> easy<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> integrate

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
it really easy for you to integrate

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.370 
it really easy for you to integrate
support<00:01:51.210> into<00:01:51.420> those<00:01:51.570> engines<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.110> really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
support into those engines and really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.660 
support into those engines and really
one<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> great<00:01:52.829> things<00:01:53.009> about<00:01:53.100> kinect<00:01:53.549> as

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
one of the great things about kinect as

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.359 
one of the great things about kinect as
the<00:01:53.790> way<00:01:53.880> Microsoft<00:01:54.149> opened<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> SDK<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the way Microsoft opened up the SDK to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.740 
the way Microsoft opened up the SDK to
everyone<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.030> they<00:01:57.270> could<00:01:57.450> build<00:01:57.570> these

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
everyone so they could build these

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.300 
everyone so they could build these
projects<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.439> weren't<00:01:58.649> necessarily<00:01:58.680> for

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
projects that weren't necessarily for

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.399 
projects that weren't necessarily for
games<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.820> we<00:02:00.299> really<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.869> rift<00:02:01.170> is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
games and we really think the rift is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.920 
games and we really think the rift is
going<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> do<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.060> VR<00:02:03.210> space<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
going to do that in the VR space the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.749 
going to do that in the VR space the
thing<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.649> riff<00:02:04.890> does<00:02:05.100> differently

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
thing that the riff does differently

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.069 
thing that the riff does differently
that<00:02:05.969> no<00:02:06.119> other<00:02:06.210> head<00:02:06.420> mount<00:02:06.570> has<00:02:06.689> done<00:02:06.869> really

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
that no other head mount has done really

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.589 
that no other head mount has done really
well<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.530> field<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.979> view<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.479> high

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
well is field of view I think that high

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.940 
well is field of view I think that high
refresh<00:02:09.899> rate<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.470> important<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
refresh rate is really important you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.550 
refresh rate is really important you
know<00:02:11.039> carmax<00:02:11.370> talked<00:02:11.580> about<00:02:11.730> 120<00:02:12.450> Hertz<00:02:12.660> being

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
know carmax talked about 120 Hertz being

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.410 
know carmax talked about 120 Hertz being
really<00:02:13.680> really<00:02:13.830> important<00:02:14.310> for<00:02:14.430> compelling

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
really really important for compelling

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.240 
really really important for compelling
virtual<00:02:15.780> reality<00:02:16.110> experience<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.069> think

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
virtual reality experience and I think

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.680 
virtual reality experience and I think
that<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.459> can<00:02:17.670> make<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.209> really<00:02:18.510> big<00:02:18.630> difference

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
that it can make a really big difference

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.740 
that it can make a really big difference
but<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:19.800> it's<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.160> choice<00:02:20.670> between<00:02:20.750> high

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
but if it's a choice between high

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.660 
but if it's a choice between high
refresh<00:02:22.260> rate<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.800> small<00:02:23.069> field<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.520> view

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
refresh rate in a small field of view

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.640 
refresh rate in a small field of view
and<00:02:23.910> then<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.060> gigantic<00:02:24.690> field<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.110> view<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.560> a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
and then a gigantic field of view and a

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.410 
and then a gigantic field of view and a
normal<00:02:26.280> refresh<00:02:26.670> rate<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:26.970> mean<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.239> still

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
normal refresh rate I mean you still

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.059 
normal refresh rate I mean you still
want<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.840> be<00:02:27.930> running<00:02:28.080> at<00:02:28.260> full<00:02:28.470> 60<00:02:28.830> friends

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
want it to be running at full 60 friends

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.620 
want it to be running at full 60 friends
for<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> second<00:02:29.550> but<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.090> choose<00:02:30.300> between

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
for a second but if you choose between

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.940 
for a second but if you choose between
those<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.080> i<00:02:31.200> think<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.470> wide<00:02:31.620> field<00:02:31.769> have

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
those that i think the wide field have

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.680 
those that i think the wide field have
used<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.190> clear<00:02:32.370> choice<00:02:32.400> oh<00:02:32.880> my<00:02:33.209> gosh<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.630> many

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
used the clear choice oh my gosh so many

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.690 
used the clear choice oh my gosh so many
problems<00:02:34.260> there's<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.860> think<00:02:34.950> there's<00:02:35.519> been

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
problems there's I think there's been

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.900 
problems there's I think there's been
about<00:02:36.140> six<00:02:37.140> major<00:02:37.650> design<00:02:38.160> revisions<00:02:38.700> where

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
about six major design revisions where

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.720 
about six major design revisions where
the<00:02:39.000> design<00:02:39.300> completely<00:02:39.870> changed<00:02:40.560> or<00:02:41.220> or<00:02:41.519> at

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the design completely changed or or at

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.550 
the design completely changed or or at
least<00:02:41.880> changed<00:02:42.300> really<00:02:42.450> significantly<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.470> I

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
least changed really significantly and I

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.740 
least changed really significantly and I
actually<00:02:43.709> started<00:02:44.160> building<00:02:45.090> prototypes<00:02:45.269> in

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
actually started building prototypes in

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.750 
actually started building prototypes in
designating<00:02:46.260> them<00:02:46.380> as<00:02:46.560> PR<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:47.100> prototype<00:02:47.459> one

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
designating them as PR one prototype one

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.759 
designating them as PR one prototype one
prototype<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.390> prototype<00:02:48.870> three<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.590> guess

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
prototype to prototype three and I guess

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.460 
prototype to prototype three and I guess
this<00:02:49.950> would<00:02:50.100> be<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.640> PR<00:02:50.940> six<00:02:51.299> in<00:02:51.630> terms<00:02:52.290> of

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
this would be the PR six in terms of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.289 
this would be the PR six in terms of
major<00:02:52.739> design<00:02:53.160> revisions<00:02:53.549> but<00:02:53.700> for<00:02:53.970> each<00:02:54.120> of

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
major design revisions but for each of

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.850 
major design revisions but for each of
those<00:02:54.360> revisions<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.930> were<00:02:55.080> also<00:02:55.230> usually

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
those revisions that were also usually

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.860 
those revisions that were also usually
at<00:02:56.160> least<00:02:56.310> two<00:02:56.549> or<00:02:56.670> three<00:02:56.700> different<00:02:57.209> minor

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
at least two or three different minor

at least two or three different minor
minor<00:02:58.349> revisions<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:58.830> many<00:02:59.580> many<00:03:00.060> prototypes

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
to destroy its destroyed more building

to destroy its destroyed more building
kept<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.730> think<00:03:05.970> eventually<00:03:06.090> we're<00:03:06.599> going<00:03:06.720> to

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
kept I think eventually we're going to

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.270 
kept I think eventually we're going to
get<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.989> something<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.739> know<00:03:07.830> maybe<00:03:08.069> not

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
get to something that you know maybe not

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.280 
get to something that you know maybe not
a<00:03:08.310> holodeck<00:03:08.790> where<00:03:09.030> your<00:03:09.180> sin<00:03:09.390> simulating

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
a holodeck where your sin simulating

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.009 
a holodeck where your sin simulating
actual<00:03:10.650> synthetic<00:03:11.400> realities<00:03:12.360> perfectly

without<00:03:13.110> any<00:03:13.470> need<00:03:13.680> for<00:03:13.739> hardware<00:03:14.280> but<00:03:14.610> I

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
without any need for hardware but I

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.309 
without any need for hardware but I
think<00:03:14.819> we'll<00:03:14.910> get<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.180> something<00:03:15.390> where<00:03:15.750> you

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
think we'll get to something where you

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.319 
think we'll get to something where you
can<00:03:16.500> get<00:03:16.650> most<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.579> way<00:03:17.700> there<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.180> and

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
can get most of the way there and and

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.720 
can get most of the way there and and
and<00:03:18.930> trick<00:03:19.680> people<00:03:20.010> pretty<00:03:20.250> well<00:03:20.370> that

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
and trick people pretty well that

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.130 
and trick people pretty well that
