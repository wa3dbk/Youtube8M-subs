this video I want to show you how you

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.230 
this video I want to show you how you
can<00:00:10.290> switch<00:00:10.620> colors<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.670> middle<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.090> row

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
can switch colors in the middle of a row

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.799 
can switch colors in the middle of a row
here<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.349> switch<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.860> green<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.280> four<00:00:14.490> stitches

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
here I switch to green for four stitches

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.599 
here I switch to green for four stitches
while<00:00:15.809> doing<00:00:16.080> single<00:00:16.410> crochet<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.279> I'm<00:00:17.400> going

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
while doing single crochet and I'm going

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.980 
while doing single crochet and I'm going
to<00:00:17.670> show<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.850> how<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> switch<00:00:18.359> back<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.630> green

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
to show you how to switch back to green

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.580 
to show you how to switch back to green
again<00:00:20.300> now<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.660> technique<00:00:22.080> holds<00:00:22.410> true

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
again now this technique holds true

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.689 
again now this technique holds true
whether<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.160> first<00:00:23.279> time<00:00:23.490> you've

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
whether it's the first time you've

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.400 
whether it's the first time you've
switched<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> color<00:00:24.330> or<00:00:24.689> whether<00:00:25.170> you're

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
switched to a color or whether you're

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.310 
switched to a color or whether you're
kind<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:25.920> back<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.189> forth<00:00:26.900> I'm<00:00:27.900> going

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
kind of going back and forth I'm going

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.720 
kind of going back and forth I'm going
to<00:00:28.439> start<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> next<00:00:28.920> stitch<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:29.640> I

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to start the next stitch just as I

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.490 
to start the next stitch just as I
normally<00:00:29.789> would<00:00:30.119> inserting<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.109> hook<00:00:31.140> into

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
normally would inserting my hook into

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.530 
normally would inserting my hook into
the<00:00:31.650> next<00:00:31.679> stitch<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.399> pulling<00:00:33.270> up<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.510> loop

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
but before I complete it in order to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
through those two loops in order to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.590 
through those two loops in order to
finish<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.289> stitch<00:00:50.129> I'll<00:00:51.120> need<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> pull<00:00:51.570> down

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.119 
see I finish the stitch with green then
when<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> make<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> next<00:00:56.850> stitch<00:00:57.829> it'll<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.949> all

when I make the next stitch it'll be all
green<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:01.050> let's<00:01:01.199> make<00:01:01.320> another<00:01:01.440> green<00:01:01.859> stitch

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that working end and get a loop of the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.690 
that working end and get a loop of the
color<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.500> want<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> switch<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.520> the

color I want to switch to it can be the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.280 
color I want to switch to it can be the
one<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.000> were<00:01:18.150> using<00:01:18.299> before<00:01:18.450> or<00:01:18.960> something

working double crochets so let's chain a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.910 
working double crochets so let's chain a
few<00:01:43.290> stitches<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.189> pink<00:01:45.920> we'll
