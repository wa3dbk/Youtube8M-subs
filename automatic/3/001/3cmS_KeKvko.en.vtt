 Hey. I thought it would show you how to use the built-in flash on the Nikon D90 and upwards to control the external flash. 

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:30.001
 To control the flash wirelessly, you first need to remove the flash from your camera and set it to your flash drive, remote control location. 

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:37.002
 In the camera you fold up the built-in pop-up flash and through the menu you select the control location. 

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.003
 Now I can show how to set the camera's built-in flash. 

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:55.004
 We start by selecting from the menu, then Bracketing / Flash, and then selecting Connect. flash mode and then select Control Mode. 

00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:07.005
 Here you come to the menu where I guide how different flashes work. I am valikoinut the built-in flash is not triggered at all, but I can also be selected manually or TTL-location-location. 

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:22.006
 Then going to Group A, which I also come to choose in an external flash, here I can also choose TTL, none, manual or automatic aperture. Then I press OK. 

00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:35.007
 Turn on the SB-900 by turning the knob to the REMOTE position. 

00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:43.008
 Here is now the important thing that I choose the same group as the selector in the camera, ie Group A. 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:02:00.009
 So simple it is to control the external flash with the built-in flash on the D90.
