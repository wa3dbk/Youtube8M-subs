00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.850
Bayern Munich's Women are back in training! Coach Thomas WÃ¶rle could welcome

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.000
nearly his complete team, just Nora Holstad, Raffaella Manieri and Katja Schroffenegger were on duty

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.160
with their national teams. 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.250
But for the first time after a long injury break on the pitch 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.920
was Austrian national Carina Wenninger. 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.720
Still not in team training are Lena Lotzen and Sarah Romert who train individually.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.650
More than 30 training sessions are planned until mid of February.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.260
The first real test will be coming Saturday at the DFB Hallenpokal,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.799
the national indoor cup with all 12 first league clubs in Magdeburg.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.720
Then the team will be in Florida for one week at Allianz Winter Camp end of January

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.830
with friendlies against the University of Florida and the USWNT U20 team

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.830

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.579
The second round of the league will continue on February 15th

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.460
with an away match at TSG 1899 Hoffenheim.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.500
One week later the top of the table clash is in Munich when Bayern plays against reigning champions VfL Wolfsburg.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.020

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.020
But there's still a lot to do until then.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.600
