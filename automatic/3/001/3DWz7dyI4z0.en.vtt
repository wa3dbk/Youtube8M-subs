00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.060 
it's got like and it's got a little
liner<00:02:49.090> in<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.360> inside<00:02:49.739> right<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:50.920> then

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
liner in the inside right and then

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.979 
liner in the inside right and then
there's<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.459> shoe<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.209> your<00:02:52.360> heel<00:02:52.600> sets

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
inside of the liner that I guess the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.130 
inside of the liner that I guess the
liner<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.859> just<00:02:57.040> primarily<00:02:57.400> for<00:02:57.609> your<00:02:57.700> heel<00:02:58.140> on
