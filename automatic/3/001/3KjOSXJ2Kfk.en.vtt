at the back around to meet that top

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.250 
at the back around to meet that top
piece<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.580> had<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:46.240> top<00:02:46.540> piece<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:47.140> was

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
piece that I had that top piece that was

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.600 
piece that I had that top piece that was
in<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.470> back<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:48.010> one<00:02:48.160> that's<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.490> little

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
in the back so that one that's a little

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.880 
in the back so that one that's a little
bit<00:02:48.730> longer<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.540> little<00:02:50.260> bit<00:02:50.350> shorter<00:02:50.680> that's

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
bit longer a little bit shorter that's

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.070 
bit longer a little bit shorter that's
about<00:02:51.040> two<00:02:51.280> inches<00:02:51.720> what<00:02:52.720> I'm<00:02:52.780> going<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.930> do

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
about two inches what I'm going to do

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.660 
about two inches what I'm going to do
with<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.320> is<00:02:53.530> take<00:02:53.740> my<00:02:53.860> needle<00:02:54.190> nose<00:02:54.340> pliers

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
with that is take my needle nose pliers

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.010 
with that is take my needle nose pliers
and<00:02:55.140> I'm<00:02:56.140> going<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.320> simply<00:02:56.830> bend<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:58.020> so

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
and I'm going to simply bend that so

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.630 
and I'm going to simply bend that so
that<00:02:59.170> there's<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.440> 90<00:02:59.860> degree<00:03:00.130> bend<00:03:00.400> in<00:03:00.550> it

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
that there's a 90 degree bend in it

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.430 
that there's a 90 degree bend in it
that's<00:03:01.150> going<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.360> sit<00:03:01.630> right<00:03:01.870> on<00:03:01.930> top<00:03:02.050> of<00:03:02.380> the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
that's going to sit right on top of the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.410 
that's going to sit right on top of the
donut<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:03.340> other<00:03:03.550> wire<00:03:03.850> I'm<00:03:04.030> going<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.240> take

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
donut the other wire I'm going to take

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.610 
donut the other wire I'm going to take
and<00:03:04.740> I'm<00:03:05.740> going<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:05.950> coil<00:03:06.280> around<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:08.320> piece

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
and I'm going to coil around that piece

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.590 
and I'm going to coil around that piece
so<00:03:08.920> I'm<00:03:08.980> just<00:03:09.160> doing<00:03:09.280> two<00:03:09.610> coils<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.510> I've

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
so I'm just doing two coils so I've

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.910 
so I'm just doing two coils so I've
taken<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.900> wire<00:03:11.110> from<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.410> front<00:03:11.680> that's<00:03:11.800> a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
taken the wire from the front that's a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.550 
taken the wire from the front that's a
little<00:03:12.130> bit<00:03:12.220> longer<00:03:12.570> coiled<00:03:13.570> around<00:03:13.810> the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
little bit longer coiled around the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.980 
little bit longer coiled around the
shorter<00:03:14.920> piece<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.310> wire<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:16.570> shorter<00:03:16.840> piece

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
shorter piece of wire the shorter piece

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.690 
shorter piece of wire the shorter piece
of<00:03:17.140> wire<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.320> what<00:03:17.590> I'll<00:03:17.709> make<00:03:17.830> my<00:03:18.010> bail<00:03:18.310> out<00:03:18.520> of

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
of wire is what I'll make my bail out of

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.009 
of wire is what I'll make my bail out of
so<00:03:19.120> that's<00:03:19.270> going<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.420> be<00:03:19.540> what<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.660> make<00:03:19.870> this

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
so that's going to be what I make this

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.770 
so that's going to be what I make this
bail<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:21.310> longer<00:03:21.760> piece<00:03:21.940> of<00:03:22.120> wire<00:03:22.300> is<00:03:22.540> what<00:03:22.750> I

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
bail the longer piece of wire is what I

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.870 
bail the longer piece of wire is what I
did<00:03:23.019> this<00:03:23.140> little<00:03:23.440> coil<00:03:23.709> out<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:24.070> so<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:24.610> can<00:03:24.760> do

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
did this little coil out of so I can do

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.280 
did this little coil out of so I can do
that<00:03:25.030> with<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.300> one<00:03:25.510> too<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:26.560> do<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:26.950> coil

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
that with this one too to do that coil

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.290 
that with this one too to do that coil
I'm<00:03:29.290> going<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.650> start<00:03:29.890> at<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.070> very<00:03:30.280> end<00:03:30.610> of<00:03:31.090> my

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
I'm going to start at the very end of my

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.290 
I'm going to start at the very end of my
wire<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:32.040> I'm<00:03:33.040> starting<00:03:33.310> with<00:03:33.489> my<00:03:33.670> round<00:03:33.970> nose

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
wire and I'm starting with my round nose

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.740 
wire and I'm starting with my round nose
pliers<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.790> have<00:03:36.940> my<00:03:37.060> round<00:03:37.330> nose<00:03:37.540> pliers

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
pliers so I have my round nose pliers

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.690 
pliers so I have my round nose pliers
here<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:38.350> what<00:03:38.950> I'm<00:03:39.040> going<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.250> do<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.550> I'm

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
here and what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.449 
here and what I'm going to do is I'm
just<00:03:39.730> going<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.090> roll<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:41.320> wire<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:42.220> make<00:03:42.430> a

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
just going to roll the wire and make a

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.310 
just going to roll the wire and make a
little<00:03:42.730> tiny<00:03:43.030> loop<00:03:43.360> if<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.930> need<00:03:44.080> any<00:03:44.290> more

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
little tiny loop if you need any more

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.430
