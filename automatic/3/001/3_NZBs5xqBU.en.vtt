okay<00:00:01.530> been<00:00:01.920> off-grid<00:00:02.100> for<00:00:03.080> two<00:00:04.080> months<00:00:04.440> now<00:00:04.589> a

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
okay been off-grid for two months now a

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.709 
okay been off-grid for two months now a
little<00:00:05.549> over<00:00:05.819> two<00:00:06.029> months<00:00:06.950> this<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.160> my

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
little over two months this is my

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.810 
little over two months this is my
midnight<00:00:09.719> charge<00:00:10.650> controller<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
midnight charge controller this is the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.960 
midnight charge controller this is the
software<00:00:12.599> interface<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:16.100> I<00:00:19.880> don't<00:00:20.880> know

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
software interface for it I don't know

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.779 
software interface for it I don't know
if<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.240> ever<00:00:21.390> see<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.580> it<00:00:23.580> does

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
if you have ever see this but it does

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.620 
if you have ever see this but it does
keep<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.150> log<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.720> what<00:00:24.869> your<00:00:25.080> daily<00:00:25.260> generating

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
keep a log of what your daily generating

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
keep a log of what your daily generating
amounts<00:00:27.630> are<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.039> easiest<00:00:29.279> way

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
amounts are so this is the easiest way

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.859 
amounts are so this is the easiest way
for<00:00:29.490> me<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.849> find<00:00:30.060> out<00:00:30.210> how<00:00:30.420> long<00:00:30.630> I've<00:00:30.840> been

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
for me to find out how long I've been

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.500 
for me to find out how long I've been
offline<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.850> how<00:00:32.850> long<00:00:33.149> we've<00:00:33.270> been<00:00:33.300> off-grid

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
offline is how long we've been off-grid

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.229 
offline is how long we've been off-grid
action<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.290> offline<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:38.149> it<00:00:41.090> takes<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.210> while

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
action not offline and it takes a while

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.459 
action not offline and it takes a while
for<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.780> download<00:00:43.200> all<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> data<00:00:44.270> but

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.889 

right<00:00:50.469> here<00:00:50.769> looks<00:00:51.010> like<00:00:54.179> just<00:00:55.179> jump<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.780> be

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
right here looks like just jump to be

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.099 
right here looks like just jump to be
back<00:00:56.079> up<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.409> the<00:00:56.500> top<00:00:56.710> again<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.289> right<00:00:59.620> here

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
back up to the top again so right here

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.460 
back up to the top again so right here
five<00:01:02.109> -<00:01:03.030> looks<00:01:04.030> like<00:01:04.210> this<00:01:05.789> yeah<00:01:06.789> well<00:01:07.470> I'll

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
five - looks like this yeah well I'll

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.609 
five - looks like this yeah well I'll
have<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.710> trust<00:01:08.979> me<00:01:09.159> on<00:01:09.280> this<00:01:09.369> one<00:01:09.430> because

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
have to trust me on this one because

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.380 
have to trust me on this one because
until<00:01:11.619> it<00:01:11.770> finishes<00:01:12.070> downloading<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:14.049> won't

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
until it finishes downloading it won't

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.950 
until it finishes downloading it won't
stabilize<00:01:16.390> where<00:01:17.049> I<00:01:17.080> want<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.380> stay<00:01:17.710> at<00:01:17.950> but

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
stabilize where I want to stay at but

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.359 
stabilize where I want to stay at but
there<00:01:19.960> five<00:01:20.350> -<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:21.340> when<00:01:21.550> I<00:01:21.580> switched<00:01:23.069> so<00:01:24.069> it's

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
there five - is when I switched so it's

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.219 
there five - is when I switched so it's
been<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:25.390> it's<00:01:25.569> now<00:01:25.840> uh<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:28.060> put<00:01:28.330> May<00:01:28.539> 2nd<00:01:29.080> and

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
been and it's now uh so put May 2nd and

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.270 
been and it's now uh so put May 2nd and
it's<00:01:29.350> now<00:01:29.590> in<00:01:29.619> June<00:01:30.039> July<00:01:30.600> July<00:01:31.600> 13th<00:01:32.409> so<00:01:32.799> we've

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
it's now in June July July 13th so we've

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.279 
it's now in June July July 13th so we've
just<00:01:33.490> been<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.700> little<00:01:33.850> bit<00:01:34.090> over<00:01:34.450> two<00:01:35.440> months

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.930 

well<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:43.360> says<00:01:43.600> I've<00:01:43.750> generated<00:01:44.110> eat<00:01:44.700> he's<00:01:45.700> out

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
well it says I've generated eat he's out

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.340 
well it says I've generated eat he's out
ate<00:01:46.500> 888<00:01:47.500> kilowatts<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.810> some<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.110> that<00:01:50.200> was

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
ate 888 kilowatts but some of that was

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.080 
ate 888 kilowatts but some of that was
on<00:01:50.440> my<00:01:50.590> twelve<00:01:50.860> volts<00:01:51.280> before<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.670> switched<00:01:51.970> to

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
on my twelve volts before I switched to

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.950 
on my twelve volts before I switched to
48<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:52.840> that<00:01:52.990> was<00:01:53.080> before<00:01:53.229> I<00:01:53.469> went<00:01:53.649> off<00:01:53.829> grid

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
48 so that was before I went off grid

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.370 
48 so that was before I went off grid
typically<00:01:55.960> I<00:01:56.049> think<00:01:56.079> I'm<00:01:56.439> using<00:01:57.869> my<00:01:58.869> base<00:01:59.079> load

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
typically I think I'm using my base load

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.000 
typically I think I'm using my base load
is<00:01:59.560> about<00:01:59.799> six<00:02:00.070> kilowatts<00:02:00.579> a<00:02:00.729> day

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
is about six kilowatts a day

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.010 
is about six kilowatts a day
but<00:02:02.400> effect<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.880> air<00:02:03.090> conditioners<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but effect on air conditioners and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.990 
but effect on air conditioners and
things<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.010> I<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.580> use<00:02:05.730> more<00:02:05.940> than

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
things like that I can use more than

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.720 
things like that I can use more than
that<00:02:07.550> but<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:08.670> system<00:02:09.000> will<00:02:09.150> generate<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.979> at

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that but my system will generate so at

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.700 
that but my system will generate so at
this<00:02:11.910> time<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.240> year<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.780> now<00:02:13.200> June<00:02:13.500> this

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
this time of year this is now June this

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.150 
this time of year this is now June this
is<00:02:13.770> pretty<00:02:14.250> much<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.700> longest<00:02:15.270> days<00:02:15.660> are<00:02:16.160> upon

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
is pretty much the longest days are upon

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.490 
is pretty much the longest days are upon
us<00:02:17.190> they<00:02:17.490> were<00:02:17.660> longest<00:02:18.660> day<00:02:18.810> was<00:02:19.020> whatever<00:02:19.260> a

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
us they were longest day was whatever a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.420 
us they were longest day was whatever a
June<00:02:20.070> 20th<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.890> it's<00:02:22.890> only<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.130> couple<00:02:23.220> weeks

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
June 20th so it's only a couple weeks

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.720 
June 20th so it's only a couple weeks
past<00:02:23.850> that<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.410> generated<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.280> generate

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
past that and I generated I can generate

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.300 
past that and I generated I can generate
about<00:02:27.000> 20<00:02:27.360> kilowatts<00:02:27.810> per<00:02:27.960> day<00:02:28.290> at<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.250> time

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
about 20 kilowatts per day at this time

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.560 
about 20 kilowatts per day at this time
of<00:02:29.670> year<00:02:30.410> again<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:32.400> have<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.240> four

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
of year again it's a I have a four

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.740 
of year again it's a I have a four
kilowatt<00:02:34.020> system<00:02:34.230> or<00:02:34.530> 3600<00:02:35.220> watt<00:02:35.250> system<00:02:35.750> it's

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
kilowatt system or 3600 watt system it's

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.290 
kilowatt system or 3600 watt system it's
almost<00:02:36.990> 4<00:02:37.230> kilowatts<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.670> classic<00:02:39.150> is

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
almost 4 kilowatts on the classic is

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.140 
almost 4 kilowatts on the classic is
3600<00:02:40.050> kilowatts<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.590> I'm<00:02:41.340> getting<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:42.030> know<00:02:42.120> I

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
3600 kilowatts so I'm getting you know I

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.200 
3600 kilowatts so I'm getting you know I
can<00:02:42.420> get<00:02:42.600> six<00:02:43.380> hours<00:02:43.620> almost<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.280> little<00:02:45.090> less

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
can get six hours almost a little less

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.460 
can get six hours almost a little less
than<00:02:45.360> six<00:02:45.570> hours<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.930> day<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.350> sunlight<00:02:48.470> based

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
than six hours a day of sunlight based

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.050 
than six hours a day of sunlight based
on<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.710> rated<00:02:50.010> capacity<00:02:50.160> right<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:50.970> I'm

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
on the rated capacity right so I'm

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.930 
on the rated capacity right so I'm
taking<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.570> 3600<00:02:52.350> watts<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.400> saying<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.820> get

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
taking the 3600 watts and saying I get

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.070 
taking the 3600 watts and saying I get
20<00:02:54.240> kilowatts<00:02:54.780> per<00:02:55.140> day<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.700> it's<00:02:56.700> about<00:02:57.060> 6<00:02:57.510> 6

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
20 kilowatts per day so it's about 6 6

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.920 
20 kilowatts per day so it's about 6 6
hours<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.560> sunlight<00:02:58.800> per<00:02:59.100> day<00:02:59.280> at<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.420> maximum

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
hours of sunlight per day at the maximum

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.310 
hours of sunlight per day at the maximum
rating<00:03:01.910> obviously<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.000> get<00:03:03.209> suddenly<00:03:04.110> for<00:03:04.290> a

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
rating obviously I get suddenly for a

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.720 
rating obviously I get suddenly for a
longer<00:03:04.620> period<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.950> time<00:03:05.160> than<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.400> but<00:03:05.700> I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
longer period of time than that but I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.840 
longer period of time than that but I
don't<00:03:06.000> I'm<00:03:06.090> not<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.330> maximum<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:08.190> fact<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.610> you

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
don't I'm not that maximum in fact I you

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.270 
don't I'm not that maximum in fact I you
don't<00:03:09.030> get<00:03:09.120> Maxim<00:03:09.570> hardly<00:03:09.930> at<00:03:10.050> all

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
don't get Maxim hardly at all

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.729 
don't get Maxim hardly at all
my<00:03:12.239> panels<00:03:12.570> are<00:03:12.690> all<00:03:12.780> fixed<00:03:13.080> panels<00:03:13.560> they're

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
my panels are all fixed panels they're

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.300 
my panels are all fixed panels they're
not<00:03:13.920> they're<00:03:14.340> not<00:03:14.370> tracking<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:16.310> obviously

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
not they're not tracking so obviously

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.470 
not they're not tracking so obviously
that<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.790> reduces<00:03:18.030> your<00:03:18.390> your<00:03:19.050> total<00:03:19.620> output

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
that that reduces your your total output

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.100 
that that reduces your your total output
um<00:03:22.310> but<00:03:23.310> yeah<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:24.209> seems<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.930> work<00:03:24.959> just

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
um but yeah this this seems to work just

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.300 
um but yeah this this seems to work just
fine<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:26.519> interface<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.060> quite<00:03:27.570> nice<00:03:28.310> there

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
fine the interface is quite nice there

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.740 
fine the interface is quite nice there
are<00:03:29.340> some<00:03:29.550> things<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:29.940> just<00:03:29.970> needs<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.600> do

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
are some things that just needs to do

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.080 
are some things that just needs to do
that<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.019> doesn't<00:03:31.320> really<00:03:31.440> do<00:03:31.680> but<00:03:32.090> doesn't

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
that it doesn't really do but doesn't

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.390 
that it doesn't really do but doesn't
doesn't<00:03:33.540> log<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.290> amp<00:03:34.470> hours<00:03:34.890> which<00:03:35.130> will<00:03:35.280> be

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
doesn't log the amp hours which will be

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.280 
doesn't log the amp hours which will be
it<00:03:35.670> logs<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.239> total<00:03:36.540> amp<00:03:36.750> hours<00:03:37.019> but<00:03:37.200> it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
it logs the total amp hours but it

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.900 
it logs the total amp hours but it
doesn't<00:03:37.530> like<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.769> daily<00:03:38.130> amp<00:03:38.370> hours<00:03:38.670> which

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
doesn't like the daily amp hours which

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.900 
doesn't like the daily amp hours which
is<00:03:39.090> sort<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.230> nuisance<00:03:40.560> that's<00:03:40.910> kilowatts

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
is sort of a nuisance that's kilowatts

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.460 
is sort of a nuisance that's kilowatts
is<00:03:42.120> not<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.300> good<00:03:42.510> thing<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.690> track<00:03:43.050> because

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
is not a good thing to track because

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.160 
is not a good thing to track because
your<00:03:44.310> voltage<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:44.850> not<00:03:45.000> constant<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:45.870> when

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
your voltage is not constant so when

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.780 
your voltage is not constant so when
you're<00:03:46.290> off-grid<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:47.220> don't<00:03:47.400> want<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.670> know

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
you're off-grid you don't want to know

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.759 
you're off-grid you don't want to know
your<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.959> don't<00:03:49.050> want<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.320> know<00:03:49.410> how<00:03:49.560> many

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
your you don't want to know how many

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.650 
your you don't want to know how many
kilowatt<00:03:50.310> hours<00:03:50.640> you've<00:03:50.850> used<00:03:51.180> that's<00:03:51.450> not

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
kilowatt hours you've used that's not

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.110 
kilowatt hours you've used that's not
very<00:03:51.780> useful<00:03:52.550> what<00:03:53.550> you<00:03:53.670> need<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:53.910> know<00:03:54.000> is

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
very useful what you need to know is

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.759 
very useful what you need to know is
your<00:03:54.209> amp<00:03:54.420> hours<00:03:54.810> because<00:03:55.110> your<00:03:55.320> voltage<00:03:55.650> is

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
your amp hours because your voltage is

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.190 
your amp hours because your voltage is
not<00:03:55.890> constant<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:57.269> need<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.540> know<00:03:57.630> amp<00:03:57.870> hours

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
not constant you need to know amp hours

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.509 
not constant you need to know amp hours
that's<00:03:58.440> going<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.680> tell<00:03:58.830> you<00:03:58.950> more<00:03:59.100> about<00:03:59.160> what

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
that's going to tell you more about what

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.040 
that's going to tell you more about what
your<00:03:59.670> batteries<00:04:00.030> are<00:04:00.060> doing<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.690> whether

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
your batteries are doing and whether

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.610 
your batteries are doing and whether
your<00:04:01.230> batteries<00:04:01.620> are<00:04:01.790> being<00:04:02.790> depleted<00:04:03.180> or<00:04:03.480> not

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
your batteries are being depleted or not

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.410 
your batteries are being depleted or not
but<00:04:05.620> since<00:04:05.860> I'm<00:04:06.010> over<00:04:06.489> generating<00:04:07.060> here<00:04:07.300> I'm

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
but since I'm over generating here I'm

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.660 
but since I'm over generating here I'm
generating<00:04:07.720> far<00:04:08.020> more<00:04:08.170> than<00:04:08.319> I<00:04:08.380> need

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
generating far more than I need

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.240 
generating far more than I need
basically<00:04:09.670> what<00:04:09.760> happens<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.270> every<00:04:10.300> day<00:04:11.250> the

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
basically what happens is every day the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.120 
basically what happens is every day the
voltage<00:04:12.640> gets<00:04:12.989> goes<00:04:13.989> all<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.230> way<00:04:14.319> to<00:04:14.440> maximum

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
voltage gets goes all the way to maximum

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.420 
voltage gets goes all the way to maximum
and<00:04:15.550> it<00:04:16.450> goes<00:04:16.630> into<00:04:16.810> flow<00:04:17.079> once<00:04:17.410> it<00:04:17.560> gets<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.799> 56

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
and it goes into flow once it gets to 56

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.400 
and it goes into flow once it gets to 56
volts<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:19.329> goes<00:04:19.570> into<00:04:19.780> float<00:04:19.989> mode<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.900> 56

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
volts it goes into float mode and the 56

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.890 
volts it goes into float mode and the 56
volts<00:04:23.740> is<00:04:24.490> just<00:04:24.790> maintained<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.480> it<00:04:25.540> powers

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
volts is just maintained and it powers

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.570 
volts is just maintained and it powers
whatever<00:04:26.260> is<00:04:26.410> on<00:04:26.560> in<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.830> house<00:04:26.980> it'll<00:04:27.430> just

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
whatever is on in the house it'll just

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.440 
whatever is on in the house it'll just
keep<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:28.000> voltage<00:04:28.389> constant<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.450> feeds

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
keep the voltage constant and it feeds

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.980 
keep the voltage constant and it feeds
the<00:04:31.780> feeds<00:04:32.290> directly<00:04:32.530> into<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:33.100> inverter<00:04:33.990> and

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
the feeds directly into the inverter and

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.620 
the feeds directly into the inverter and
then<00:04:35.080> here's<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.560> univer<00:04:35.919> turn<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.389> have<00:04:37.570> a

then here's the univer turn so I have a

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:45.170 
then here's the univer turn so I have a
magnum<00:04:38.080> it's<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.919> 48<00:04:39.280> volt<00:04:39.400> magnum<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.919> has

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
magnum it's a 48 volt magnum and it has

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.120 
magnum it's a 48 volt magnum and it has
the<00:04:46.180> ability<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.600> control<00:04:46.990> generators<00:04:47.919> and

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
the ability to control generators and

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.330 
the ability to control generators and
all<00:04:48.250> sorts<00:04:48.550> of<00:04:48.610> other<00:04:48.729> devices<00:04:49.210> I<00:04:50.100> don't<00:04:51.100> use

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
all sorts of other devices I don't use

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.030 
all sorts of other devices I don't use
it<00:04:51.520> for<00:04:51.700> that<00:04:51.850> I<00:04:52.090> don't<00:04:52.240> have<00:04:52.479> a<00:04:52.630> generator<00:04:53.139> and

it for that I don't have a generator and

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.250 
it for that I don't have a generator and
I'm<00:04:54.220> not<00:04:54.370> connected<00:04:54.850> to<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:55.419> what<00:04:55.960> they<00:04:56.050> call

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
I'm not connected to the what they call

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.980 
I'm not connected to the what they call
Shore<00:04:56.530> power<00:04:56.740> or<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.580> grid<00:04:57.820> I've<00:04:58.630> turned<00:04:58.870> that

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
Shore power or the grid I've turned that

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.740 
Shore power or the grid I've turned that
off<00:04:59.290> so<00:04:59.650> all<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:00.400> need<00:05:00.760> is<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.030> inverter<00:05:01.389> and

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
off so all I need is the inverter and

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.629 
off so all I need is the inverter and
the<00:05:02.410> inverter<00:05:02.680> is<00:05:02.770> directly<00:05:03.040> connected<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.490> my

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
the inverter is directly connected to my

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.290 
the inverter is directly connected to my
batteries<00:05:05.430> but<00:05:06.430> this<00:05:06.610> tells<00:05:06.850> you<00:05:07.090> what's

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
batteries but this tells you what's

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.370 
batteries but this tells you what's
going<00:05:07.540> on<00:05:07.660> in<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.840> inverter<00:05:08.110> you<00:05:08.260> can

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
going on in the inverter you can

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.990 
going on in the inverter you can
actually<00:05:08.500> turn<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.919> inverter<00:05:09.190> on<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:09.580> off<00:05:09.729> by

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
actually turn the inverter on and off by

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.240 
actually turn the inverter on and off by
brushing<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:11.110> inverter<00:05:11.380> button<00:05:11.740> it'll<00:05:11.860> power

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
brushing the inverter button it'll power

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.719 
brushing the inverter button it'll power
the<00:05:12.370> inverter<00:05:12.669> off<00:05:15.810> this<00:05:16.810> is<00:05:17.200> this<00:05:17.800> seems

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
the inverter off this is this seems

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.430 
the inverter off this is this seems
quite<00:05:19.300> robust<00:05:19.660> I've<00:05:19.870> been<00:05:20.020> using<00:05:20.229> it

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
quite robust I've been using it

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.430 
quite robust I've been using it
obviously<00:05:20.770> for<00:05:20.950> two<00:05:21.100> months<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:22.330> it's<00:05:22.510> I've

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
obviously for two months and it's I've

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.409 
obviously for two months and it's I've
had<00:05:23.620> no<00:05:23.800> problems<00:05:24.190> with<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.370> it's<00:05:25.090> working

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
had no problems with it it's working

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.590 
had no problems with it it's working
like<00:05:25.539> a<00:05:25.570> champ<00:05:26.310> this<00:05:27.310> is<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.640> most<00:05:28.390> recent

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
like a champ this is the most recent

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.409 
like a champ this is the most recent
purchase<00:05:29.640> this<00:05:30.640> is<00:05:30.880> a<00:05:32.280> kilowatt<00:05:33.280> meter<00:05:33.460> it's

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
purchase this is a kilowatt meter it's

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.520 
purchase this is a kilowatt meter it's
supposedly<00:05:35.110> similar<00:05:35.710> to<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.870> type<00:05:38.380> that

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
supposedly similar to the the type that

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.990 
supposedly similar to the the type that
you<00:05:38.620> see<00:05:38.770> that<00:05:38.919> spin<00:05:39.190> around<00:05:39.220> I<00:05:39.700> guess<00:05:39.850> those

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
you see that spin around I guess those

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.580 
you see that spin around I guess those
are<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.210> analog<00:05:40.600> version<00:05:40.810> kind<00:05:41.289> of<00:05:41.350> the<00:05:41.410> power

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
are the analog version kind of the power

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.200 
are the analog version kind of the power
company<00:05:42.010> uses<00:05:42.310> yeah<00:05:42.430> people<00:05:42.729> saw<00:05:42.970> them<00:05:43.120> on

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
company uses yeah people saw them on

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.840 
company uses yeah people saw them on
eBay<00:05:43.450> as<00:05:43.510> well<00:05:43.860> where<00:05:44.860> it's<00:05:44.979> got<00:05:45.550> a<00:05:45.580> spinning

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
eBay as well where it's got a spinning

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.040 
eBay as well where it's got a spinning
meter<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.240> it<00:05:46.300> tells<00:05:46.479> you<00:05:46.600> the<00:05:46.630> kilowatt

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
meter and it tells you the kilowatt

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.000 
meter and it tells you the kilowatt
hours<00:05:47.350> that<00:05:47.560> have<00:05:47.680> been<00:05:49.200> generated<00:05:50.200> under<00:05:50.470> on

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
hours that have been generated under on

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.420 
hours that have been generated under on
your<00:05:51.400> teeth<00:05:51.580> under<00:05:51.940> AC<00:05:52.120> side<00:05:52.510> so<00:05:53.229> the<00:05:54.190> the

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
your teeth under AC side so the the

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.700 
your teeth under AC side so the the
midnight<00:05:54.760> is<00:05:55.000> tracking<00:05:55.750> my<00:05:55.900> days<00:05:56.350> of<00:05:56.500> tracking

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
midnight is tracking my days of tracking

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.640 
midnight is tracking my days of tracking
my<00:05:56.919> DC<00:05:57.310> power<00:05:57.580> this<00:05:58.450> unit<00:05:58.870> will<00:05:59.020> track<00:05:59.260> my<00:05:59.410> AC

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
my DC power this unit will track my AC

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.029 
my DC power this unit will track my AC
power<00:06:00.130> well<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.270> obviously<00:06:01.389> from<00:06:01.840> if<00:06:02.770> I<00:06:02.889> look

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
power well and obviously from if I look

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.379 
power well and obviously from if I look
at<00:06:03.130> the<00:06:03.220> two<00:06:03.370> numbers<00:06:03.400> I<00:06:03.850> should<00:06:04.060> be<00:06:04.150> able<00:06:04.240> to

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
at the two numbers I should be able to

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.860 
at the two numbers I should be able to
tell<00:06:04.570> roughly<00:06:05.669> what<00:06:06.669> is<00:06:06.820> the<00:06:07.000> efficiency<00:06:07.720> or

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
tell roughly what is the efficiency or

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.480 
tell roughly what is the efficiency or
overall<00:06:08.200> efficiency<00:06:08.770> of<00:06:08.860> the<00:06:08.950> system<00:06:09.310> between

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
overall efficiency of the system between

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.420 
overall efficiency of the system between
what<00:06:10.419> I<00:06:10.450> get<00:06:10.690> in<00:06:10.870> in<00:06:11.289> DC<00:06:11.770> and<00:06:12.010> then<00:06:12.159> when<00:06:12.310> I<00:06:12.340> get

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
what I get in in DC and then when I get

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.140 
what I get in in DC and then when I get
out<00:06:12.760> in<00:06:13.060> AC

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
out in AC

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.900 
out in AC
so<00:06:14.510> that's<00:06:14.690> kind<00:06:14.930> of<00:06:14.960> why<00:06:15.139> I<00:06:15.169> got<00:06:15.500> it<00:06:15.889> I<00:06:15.919> haven't

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
so that's kind of why I got it I haven't

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.340 
so that's kind of why I got it I haven't
connected<00:06:17.150> it<00:06:17.419> yet<00:06:17.630> because<00:06:17.840> I'm<00:06:18.080> gonna<00:06:18.199> have

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
connected it yet because I'm gonna have

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.520 
connected it yet because I'm gonna have
to<00:06:18.470> disconnect<00:06:19.120> the<00:06:20.120> inverter<00:06:20.840> I'm<00:06:21.350> gonna

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
to disconnect the inverter I'm gonna

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.050 
to disconnect the inverter I'm gonna
have<00:06:21.620> to<00:06:21.680> disconnect<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:22.400> wires<00:06:22.669> from<00:06:22.850> the

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
have to disconnect the wires from the

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.090 
have to disconnect the wires from the
inverter<00:06:23.360> well<00:06:24.290> they're<00:06:24.440> mayor<00:06:24.590> conditioners

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
inverter well they're mayor conditioners

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.790 
inverter well they're mayor conditioners
kicked<00:06:25.340> on<00:06:25.490> now<00:06:25.729> I'm<00:06:25.850> using<00:06:26.000> 21<00:06:26.510> amps<00:06:26.900> so<00:06:27.680> what

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
kicked on now I'm using 21 amps so what

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.010 
kicked on now I'm using 21 amps so what
you<00:06:27.919> see<00:06:28.100> that<00:06:28.250> by<00:06:28.430> the<00:06:28.490> way<00:06:28.699> is<00:06:28.940> this<00:06:29.750> is<00:06:29.900> the

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
you see that by the way is this is the

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.840 
you see that by the way is this is the
voltage<00:06:30.380> of<00:06:30.500> the<00:06:30.620> batteries<00:06:31.070> and<00:06:31.340> this<00:06:31.550> is<00:06:31.729> the

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
voltage of the batteries and this is the

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.120 
voltage of the batteries and this is the
amps<00:06:32.180> being<00:06:32.419> drawn<00:06:32.720> by<00:06:33.320> the<00:06:33.380> inverter<00:06:33.800> right

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
amps being drawn by the inverter right

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.680 
amps being drawn by the inverter right
now<00:06:36.370> but<00:06:37.370> this<00:06:37.580> thing<00:06:37.820> has<00:06:38.000> to<00:06:38.180> be<00:06:38.240> the

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
now but this thing has to be the

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.540 
now but this thing has to be the
basically<00:06:39.260> you<00:06:39.380> all<00:06:39.860> you<00:06:39.949> do<00:06:40.100> is<00:06:40.190> you<00:06:40.280> run<00:06:40.430> the

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
basically you all you do is you run the

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.219 
basically you all you do is you run the
wires<00:06:40.760> right<00:06:41.120> through<00:06:41.510> the<00:06:41.630> bottom<00:06:41.990> of<00:06:42.080> this

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:42.229 
wires right through the bottom of this

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:45.250 
wires right through the bottom of this
and<00:06:42.500> they<00:06:43.070> come<00:06:43.280> out<00:06:43.310> the<00:06:43.550> top<00:06:43.840> so<00:06:44.840> basically<00:06:45.139> I

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
and they come out the top so basically I

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.810 
and they come out the top so basically I
just<00:06:45.530> have<00:06:45.590> to<00:06:45.770> take<00:06:46.130> the<00:06:46.250> wires<00:06:46.460> and<00:06:46.669> run

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
just have to take the wires and run

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.460 
just have to take the wires and run
through<00:06:47.090> here<00:06:47.389> and<00:06:47.570> then<00:06:47.750> there's<00:06:47.930> two<00:06:48.139> screws

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
through here and then there's two screws

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.770 
through here and then there's two screws
to<00:06:48.650> just<00:06:48.860> tighten<00:06:49.100> down<00:06:49.280> and<00:06:50.210> I<00:06:50.330> guess<00:06:50.570> what

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
to just tighten down and I guess what

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.480 
to just tighten down and I guess what
happens<00:06:51.139> what<00:06:51.500> it<00:06:51.620> seems<00:06:51.830> like<00:06:51.979> happen<00:06:52.340> is

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
happens what it seems like happen is

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.760 
happens what it seems like happen is
they<00:06:52.700> pierce<00:06:53.479> the<00:06:53.630> insulation<00:06:54.350> and<00:06:54.380> that

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
they pierce the insulation and that

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.610 
they pierce the insulation and that
makes<00:06:55.130> it<00:06:55.250> gives<00:06:55.460> them<00:06:55.580> connection<00:06:56.000> to<00:06:56.150> the<00:06:56.620> to

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
makes it gives them connection to the to

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.180 
makes it gives them connection to the to
the<00:06:57.710> wire<00:06:59.050> how<00:07:00.050> exactly<00:07:00.470> they're<00:07:00.680> getting<00:07:01.070> the

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
the wire how exactly they're getting the

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.070 
the wire how exactly they're getting the
amp<00:07:01.370> the<00:07:02.240> current<00:07:02.570> out<00:07:02.690> of<00:07:02.810> that<00:07:02.930> I<00:07:02.960> don't

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
amp the current out of that I don't

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.140 
amp the current out of that I don't
really<00:07:03.380> know<00:07:03.620> but<00:07:03.830> this<00:07:03.979> would<00:07:04.130> be<00:07:04.220> 240<00:07:04.760> volts

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150 
really know but this would be 240 volts

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.390 
really know but this would be 240 volts
across<00:07:05.240> this<00:07:05.690> because<00:07:06.020> this<00:07:06.139> is<00:07:06.200> the<00:07:06.560> hot<00:07:07.370> one

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 
across this because this is the hot one

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.520 
across this because this is the hot one
in<00:07:07.760> hot<00:07:07.910> two<00:07:08.150> and<00:07:08.450> they're<00:07:08.720> out<00:07:08.900> of<00:07:08.930> phase<00:07:09.229> by

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
in hot two and they're out of phase by

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.060 
in hot two and they're out of phase by
180<00:07:09.919> so<00:07:10.400> this<00:07:10.850> is<00:07:11.000> 120<00:07:11.539> and<00:07:12.289> this<00:07:12.440> is<00:07:12.560> 120

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
180 so this is 120 and this is 120

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.400 
180 so this is 120 and this is 120
opposite<00:07:13.580> face<00:07:13.760> is<00:07:14.090> gonna<00:07:14.330> be<00:07:14.419> 240<00:07:14.930> across<00:07:15.229> the

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410 
opposite face is gonna be 240 across the

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.790 
opposite face is gonna be 240 across the
two<00:07:15.590> of<00:07:15.710> them<00:07:16.960> you<00:07:17.960> can<00:07:18.080> also<00:07:18.200> get<00:07:18.440> the<00:07:18.590> same

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 
two of them you can also get the same

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.100 
two of them you can also get the same
meter<00:07:19.070> in<00:07:19.250> the<00:07:19.340> 120<00:07:19.850> version<00:07:20.270> where<00:07:20.870> it<00:07:20.990> only

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
meter in the 120 version where it only

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.469 
meter in the 120 version where it only
has<00:07:21.350> one<00:07:21.380> hot<00:07:22.100> but<00:07:22.490> I<00:07:22.639> have<00:07:22.820> two<00:07:23.030> hots<00:07:23.210> because

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 
has one hot but I have two hots because

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:26.680 
has one hot but I have two hots because
I<00:07:23.539> would<00:07:23.690> I<00:07:23.930> have<00:07:24.260> a<00:07:24.850> mile<00:07:25.850> and<00:07:26.180> fertur<00:07:26.479> it<00:07:26.570> is<00:07:26.660> a

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.690 
I would I have a mile and fertur it is a

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.230 
I would I have a mile and fertur it is a
split<00:07:27.050> phase<00:07:27.260> so<00:07:27.560> it's<00:07:27.740> it's<00:07:28.100> being<00:07:28.789> able<00:07:29.060> to

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 
split phase so it's it's being able to

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.600 
split phase so it's it's being able to
generate<00:07:29.479> 240<00:07:30.200> volts<00:07:30.560> if<00:07:30.680> I<00:07:30.800> have<00:07:30.950> 240<00:07:31.430> volt

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610 
generate 240 volts if I have 240 volt

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.950 
generate 240 volts if I have 240 volt
appliances<00:07:32.979> so<00:07:34.210> now<00:07:35.210> I<00:07:35.240> can<00:07:35.479> go<00:07:35.599> down<00:07:35.750> and<00:07:35.900> show

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 
appliances so now I can go down and show

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.620 
appliances so now I can go down and show
you<00:07:36.080> the<00:07:36.229> batteries
