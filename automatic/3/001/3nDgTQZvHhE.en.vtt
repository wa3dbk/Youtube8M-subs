00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:14.510 

make<00:01:05.400> your<00:01:05.610> hand<00:01:05.820> steady<00:01:12.380> give<00:01:13.380> me<00:01:13.650> Godhead

make your hand steady give me Godhead

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.450 
make your hand steady give me Godhead
you<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.870> a<00:01:15.900> pretty<00:01:16.440> good<00:01:16.680> problem<00:01:17.040> right

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you have a pretty good problem right

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.109 
you have a pretty good problem right
here<00:01:17.940> but<00:01:18.830> let's<00:01:19.830> look<00:01:20.070> at<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> first<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.940> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
here but let's look at the first one the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.180 
here but let's look at the first one the
first<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.570> you're<00:01:22.470> doing<00:01:22.590> too<00:01:22.890> narrow

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
first one you're doing too narrow

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.490 
first one you're doing too narrow
because<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.240> very<00:01:24.390> close<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.750> cockeyed

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
because it's very close to cockeyed

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.810 
because it's very close to cockeyed
already<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.820> proportion

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
already so you have to do the proportion

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.810 
already so you have to do the proportion
of<00:01:30.000> cockeyed<00:01:30.690> I<00:01:31.050> cut<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.979> standard<00:01:32.490> size
