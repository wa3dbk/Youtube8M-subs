to<00:00:19.109> being<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.920> far<00:00:20.369> ahead<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.640> things<00:00:20.910> ahead<00:00:21.570> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
to being so far ahead of things ahead of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.870 
to being so far ahead of things ahead of
things<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.529> competition<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.400> actually

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
things in the competition it actually

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.519 
things in the competition it actually
doesn't<00:00:24.240> matter<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.840> pick<00:00:24.990> as<00:00:25.170> long<00:00:25.410> as

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
doesn't matter what you pick as long as

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.050 
doesn't matter what you pick as long as
it's<00:00:25.680> controlled<00:00:26.310> i<00:00:26.490> would<00:00:26.670> say<00:00:26.849> though

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
it's controlled i would say though

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.849 
it's controlled i would say though
because<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.689> can't<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.019> pick<00:00:28.439> five<00:00:28.619> things

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
because you can't just pick five things

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.560 
because you can't just pick five things
that<00:00:28.920> don't<00:00:29.130> work<00:00:29.189> well<00:00:30.029> they<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.210> picked

you've been spamming it so by taking
trundle<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.110> obviously<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> way<00:00:49.800> of

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
trundle you obviously have a way of

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.470 
trundle you obviously have a way of
removing<00:00:50.430> some<00:00:50.730> tank<00:00:50.940> assets<00:00:51.180> from<00:00:51.300> this

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
removing some tank assets from this

removing some tank assets from this
single<00:00:51.870> tank<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.350> often<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.710> from<00:00:53.190> sk<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
single tank we often see from sk at the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.869 
single tank we often see from sk at the
same<00:00:54.480> time<00:00:54.860> when<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.070> twisted<00:00:56.460> fate<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
same time when you have twisted fate and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.180 
same time when you have twisted fate and
tristana<00:00:57.660> that's<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.230> fast<00:00:58.469> push<00:00:58.680> conversation

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
tristana that's a fast push conversation

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.770 
tristana that's a fast push conversation
in<00:00:59.280> terms<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.550> how<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.239> destroy<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.600> out

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
in terms of how you just destroy it out

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.330 
in terms of how you just destroy it out
like<00:01:00.960> early<00:01:01.199> lich<00:01:01.350> bane<00:01:01.530> tristana<00:01:02.039> taking

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
like early lich bane tristana taking

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.640 
like early lich bane tristana taking
down<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.120> use<00:01:03.270> tranquil<00:01:03.719> pillar<00:01:03.930> behind

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
down you can use tranquil pillar behind

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.679 
down you can use tranquil pillar behind
the<00:01:04.799> towel<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.280> zone<00:01:05.580> away<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.479> it's

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the towel to like zone away and it's

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.929 
the towel to like zone away and it's
small<00:01:06.990> things<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.650> i<00:01:07.979> wonder<00:01:08.549> if<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.729> was

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
small things but i wonder if that was

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.490 
small things but i wonder if that was
some<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.270> theory<00:01:09.659> behind<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.229> because

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
some of the theory behind it because

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.140 
some of the theory behind it because
obviously<00:01:10.710> laning<00:01:11.130> phases<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.490> complete

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
obviously laning phases like complete

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.670 
obviously laning phases like complete
trash<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.869> don't<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.229> anything<00:01:13.470> just

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
trash like you don't do anything just

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.320 
trash like you don't do anything just
sit<00:01:13.860> there<00:01:14.010> yeah<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.850> don't<00:01:14.939> think<00:01:15.060> it's

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
sit there yeah I don't think it's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.630 
sit there yeah I don't think it's
completely<00:01:15.600> useless<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.520> just

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
completely useless but like it just

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.370 
completely useless but like it just

critical<00:03:54.959> thinking<00:03:55.020> exercises<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.340> kind<00:03:56.520> of

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
critical thinking exercises to kind of

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.580 
critical thinking exercises to kind of

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
came to split even before that when

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.050 
came to split even before that when
you're<00:04:10.739> in<00:04:10.890> challenger<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.550> lot<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:11.970> people

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
you're in challenger a lot of people

were<00:04:12.420> touting<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.930> as<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.380> mid-tier<00:04:13.980> LCS<00:04:14.790> team

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
were touting you as a mid-tier LCS team

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.430 
were touting you as a mid-tier LCS team
then<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.390> went<00:04:15.570> all<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.840> way<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.200> top

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
then you went all the way to the top

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.680 
then you went all the way to the top
what<00:04:17.070> do<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.280> think<00:04:17.370> in<00:04:17.669> retrospect<00:04:18.090> went

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
what do you think in retrospect went

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.050 
what do you think in retrospect went
well<00:04:18.840> for<00:04:18.870> your<00:04:19.080> team<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.290> split<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:20.310> think<00:04:20.910> what

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
well for your team to split I think what

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.180 
well for your team to split I think what
really<00:04:21.330> went<00:04:21.750> was<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.109> preparation<00:04:22.740> before

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
really went was the preparation before

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.730 
really went was the preparation before
TLC<00:04:23.700> has<00:04:23.729> begun<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.360> feel<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.020> we<00:04:25.320> started

practicing much

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.249 
practicing much
and<00:04:27.259> much<00:04:27.440> harder<00:04:27.710> than<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.310> other<00:04:28.430> LCS<00:04:28.940> team

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
and much harder than the other LCS team

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.899 
and much harder than the other LCS team
teams<00:04:30.259> which<00:04:30.440> sort<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.400> like<00:04:31.520> gave<00:04:31.729> us<00:04:31.879> a

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:31.909 
teams which sort of like gave us a

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.300 
teams which sort of like gave us a
really<00:04:32.150> big<00:04:32.599> lead<00:04:33.139> in<00:04:33.169> the<00:04:33.560> first<00:04:33.800> weeks<00:04:34.099> which

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
really big lead in the first weeks which

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.439 
really big lead in the first weeks which
you<00:04:34.400> could<00:04:34.550> see<00:04:34.699> because<00:04:34.940> we<00:04:35.210> were<00:04:35.300> like

for US isn't very important like I feel
information<00:05:07.460> is<00:05:07.669> extremely<00:05:08.030> crucial<00:05:08.509> in

information is extremely crucial in

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.260 
information is extremely crucial in
playoffs<00:05:09.409> as<00:05:09.560> well<00:05:09.740> if<00:05:10.520> we<00:05:10.699> wouldn't<00:05:11.000> have<00:05:11.090> to

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
playoffs as well if we wouldn't have to

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.450 
playoffs as well if we wouldn't have to
play<00:05:11.419> quarters<00:05:11.960> we<00:05:12.289> have<00:05:12.560> one<00:05:12.770> more<00:05:12.979> week<00:05:13.219> to

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
play quarters we have one more week to

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.730 
play quarters we have one more week to
prepare<00:05:13.639> for<00:05:14.120> it's<00:05:14.360> less<00:05:14.659> stress<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.259> we<00:05:15.560> can

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
prepare for it's less stress and we can

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.490 
prepare for it's less stress and we can
see<00:05:15.889> what<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.159> opponent<00:05:16.639> is<00:05:16.699> doing<00:05:17.319> so<00:05:18.319> it's

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
see what the opponent is doing so it's

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.899 
see what the opponent is doing so it's
very<00:05:18.620> very<00:05:18.770> important<00:05:19.400> for<00:05:19.520> us<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:19.789> if<00:05:19.879> we

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
very very important for us and if we

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.820 
very very important for us and if we
lose<00:05:20.240> we<00:05:20.479> might<00:05:20.659> have<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:21.139> play<00:05:21.500> a<00:05:21.530> tiebreaker
