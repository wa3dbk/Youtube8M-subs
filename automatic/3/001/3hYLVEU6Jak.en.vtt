00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.360
 one thing that I have noticed with 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.879
 too often one thing I notice 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:18.580
 very common in people who I answer the 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.640
 as people suffer as 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.040
 that people live their dilemmas over 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.710
 situations that are no longer 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.230
 How many times are you in a job that 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.990
 It's not the job of your dreams anymore. 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.870
 you often have a marriage that 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.239
 it's not like you imagined it anymore 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.010
 you have a life situation that is not 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.579
 how would you like 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.470
 do you give due importance to the 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.810
 due value for this 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.270
 Do you maybe when you go into 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.059
 contact with these realities that are not 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.730
 plus the reality you'd like 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:59.530
 Maybe you figured one day it would be that 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.739
 Do you believe that food is salvation? 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.829
 many people end up resorting to 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.490
 eating over the counter because they 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:13.329
 believe that food is the way to 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.749
 to alleviate the suffering that food may 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:20.979
 being is an alternative to this scenario 

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:24.039
 it's not now you're real 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.369
 if there is one thing that is for real 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.469
 if there is one thing that is important are the 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.859
 your needs 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.029
 What are your needs? Are they 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.700
 important 

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:39.999
 Look at your life and look at managing 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.849
 in a way that you change that you 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.569
 may have more quality in your 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:45.789
 days 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.099
 Your job is not cool if he's already 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.979
 It's not like it was one day. 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:54.130
 maybe it's worth having some 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.829
 attitude there and change this scenario when 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.889
 I say or maybe I will change jobs but 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:03.270
 sometimes it's just a matter of communicating to 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:07.329
 Sometimes it's just a matter of you. 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.330
 talk not of you to delegate of you to change 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.670
 some behaviors there the same thing 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.510
 for your relationship to be the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.500
 be your marriage, stop and end 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.640
 realize 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.550
 maybe if you do not 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.490
 you're wasting your energy on few 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.060
 facts and situations that are no longer 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.400
 How did you imagine how one day was? 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.650
 possibly you may be losing 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.350
 time wasting energy in what has already 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.530
 do not take your glasses away 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.920
 maybe you are in front of the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.780
 your eyes to perceive reality and 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.370
 modify this reality 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.040
 Are you really your needs? 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.290
 they are for real and that you have the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.200
 desired results in your 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.440
 weight loss so you can achieve the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.920
 ideal weight has the desired body I 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.290
 I need to tell you how important it is. 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.890
 You look inside how much you are 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:13.180
 you need to realize what is 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:17.800
 important to realize your true 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:21.910
 needs take action make different 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.519
 for the sake of your life you are really 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.790
 if you want to develop 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.370
 if you want to grow thrive in scope 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.459
 even more of the sale I'm not 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.250
 strictly speaking the weight loss I 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.730
 I am speaking here of your happiness is 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.840
 Obviously if you lose weight 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.040
 consequently you will feel more 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.160
 more happy, but do not pretend that 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.590
 things are good everything is fine 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.549
 you may be wasting energy 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.230
 you can be totally focused 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.000
 hope in things that are no longer 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.940
 but how would you like 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.579
 let's change this scenario let's put 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.450
 energy in what is in what you 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.000
 deserve 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.410
 in what you really need 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.130
 be happy 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.350
 Are you really your needs? 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.890
 Are they real and the food? 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:21.010
 It is not the solution at this time. 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.500
 fill your soul with food fill in 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.590
 your soul once you respect 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.500
 what is very important to you 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.160
 a kiss and we are very much in 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.370
 brief 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.370
 bye Bye
