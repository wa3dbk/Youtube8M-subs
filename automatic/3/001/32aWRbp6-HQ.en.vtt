00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.890
 222 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:16.900
 Over the last 10 years, the total number of high-profile translator has surpassed 10 million for the first time ever 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.670
 The share of high school graduates in total employment has also rebounded in more than a decade 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.500
 It's turning around. 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.710
 The school employment growth trend and its background being a guardian reporter then 5 w window 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.710
 Report 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.170
 Since the 1980s, memories have been recorded every two or three years 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:40.090
 One million people have surged c 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:46.300
 9,000,000 people beyond 1996, sea urchins, but after the financial crisis, imf Wo 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:50.890
 I have not been able to exceed 10 million people in the global financial crisis. 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:55.989
 For the first time in 18 years, high school graduates topped 10 million last year 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:01:00.670
 Eotneunde increased by 2.7% approximately 270,000 people than the front 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:05.619
 2% higher than the overall increase in the number of employees 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.030
 In particular , half of the 530,000 jobs increased last year, 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.549
 Occupied 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:18.520
 High-school graduates accounted for 39.5% of the total 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:21.040
 This is the first time I've seen this year since 2002 . 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:27.580
 It's reversed. 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:30.759
 On the other hand look at gender male high school graduates employed high school graduates employed women increased by 2% 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.780
 Increased by 3.8% 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:41.020
 I doubled the number of women, especially the number of high school graduate women 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:46.119
 4,090,000 people, more than 4 million people for the first time 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:49.499
 So why do high school graduates increased employment are what is another challenge for any 5 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.499
 Guardian reporter covered 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 After graduating from high tax-related specialization anso Mr. Kim writes to a job in a bank 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.530
 I am going to go to college if I need my job first . 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:09.959
 Dare to first employment than college women speak louder than words, and I by others not 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:14.220
 Then the next thing is even adapt to college in Daegu I am following the situation 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.870
 Increasing number of high- skilled workers is changing the choice of university, not mandatory. 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.239
 because of 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.390
 College enrollment rates, which soared to 84 percent in 2008, have since fallen steadily since last year 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:29.010
 It fell to 71%. 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.370
 Here, three years ago, we have been increasing the number of new recruits 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:37.769
 It is also the cause of the increase in the number of rescue workers 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:42.239
 Last year, out of 530,000 new employees, more than 50 graduates 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:44.040
 The increase in the number of reemployed workers in the 50s or above , 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.629
 I did it. 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:52.950
 The problem is that the salaries of high-paid workers are still low. 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:56.040
 When the average wage of the oral workers is 100, the contract workers are 160 days 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.030
 More than 60% different 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:06.180
 A corporate culture that makes it difficult for high school graduates to be promoted is also a problem. 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:08.760
 We must change the labor market order centered on our success, 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.870
 It is also possible and advanced. 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.620
 There will be 20 million jobs with better jobs . 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.010
 In order for high school graduates to acquire the specialized knowledge required for their job, 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.480
 Companies must support college admission after employment
