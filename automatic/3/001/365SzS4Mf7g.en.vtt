also this may be common knowledge to sum

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.410 
also this may be common knowledge to sum
or<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> lot<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.620> people<00:00:49.950> wild<00:00:50.610> forms<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
or to a lot of people wild forms but it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.639 
or to a lot of people wild forms but it
may<00:00:51.510> not<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.690> common<00:00:51.960> knowledge<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.350> everyone

may not be common knowledge to everyone

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.290 
may not be common knowledge to everyone
because<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.010> wasn't<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.520> me<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.879> example

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
because it wasn't to me for example

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.060 
because it wasn't to me for example
because<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.600> started<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.079> proudmoore<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
because I started out on proudmoore and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.470 
because I started out on proudmoore and
the<00:00:56.190> reason<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.489> started<00:00:56.699> out<00:00:56.969> proud<00:00:57.239> marks

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the reason I started out proud marks

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.750 
the reason I started out proud marks
because<00:00:57.719> was<00:00:57.899> high<00:00:58.410> population<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.219> Alliance

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
because was high population of Alliance

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.760 
because was high population of Alliance
and<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.570> during<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> time<00:01:01.079> when<00:01:01.320> dungeon

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and it was during the time when dungeon

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.860 
and it was during the time when dungeon
fighter<00:01:01.980> came<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.760> want<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.600> server

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
fighter came out I want to be on server

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.109 
fighter came out I want to be on server
with<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> large<00:01:04.619> population<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.610> could<00:01:05.970> take

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
with a large population so I could take

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.880 
with a large population so I could take
advantage<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.810> dead<00:01:07.020> tiger<00:01:07.290> system<00:01:07.740> in

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
advantage of the dead tiger system in

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
advantage of the dead tiger system in
five<00:01:08.189> groups<00:01:08.369> easily<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.299> starting<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
five groups easily so starting on the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
five groups easily so starting on the
assume<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.560> no<00:01:10.590> resources<00:01:11.220> your<00:01:11.490> level

assume you have no resources your level
one<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.060> your<00:01:12.180> brand<00:01:12.420> new<00:01:12.450> server<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.320> what<00:01:13.470> you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
one in your brand new server so what you

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.590 
one in your brand new server so what you
do<00:01:13.799> basically<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> your

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
do basically is you go on to your

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.450 
do basically is you go on to your
