00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600 
so what are three cons of playing jungle
not<00:01:09.869> firstly<00:01:10.380> his<00:01:10.530> early<00:01:10.890> clears<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.460> be

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
not firstly his early clears can be

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.210 
not firstly his early clears can be
pretty<00:01:11.939> tough<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.930> run<00:01:13.200> quite<00:01:13.590> low<00:01:13.950> on

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
pretty tough you do run quite low on

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.100 
pretty tough you do run quite low on
health<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.299> particularly<00:01:15.840> fast

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
health and you're not particularly fast

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.160 
health and you're not particularly fast
especially<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.299> good<00:01:18.720> leash

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
especially if you don't get a good leash

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.380 
especially if you don't get a good leash
secondly<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.250> transformations<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.150> mega

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
secondly your transformations to mega

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.350 
secondly your transformations to mega
gnar<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:21.990> unreliable<00:01:22.380> at<00:01:23.009> best<00:01:23.240> often<00:01:24.240> it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
gnar can be unreliable at best often it

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.179 
gnar can be unreliable at best often it
is<00:01:24.450> wasted<00:01:25.110> when<00:01:25.320> you're<00:01:25.470> clean<00:01:25.830> through<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
jungle and it is very hard to get it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.620 
jungle and it is very hard to get it
ready<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.680> prepared<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.729> anyone<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.360> and

ready and prepared for anyone to go and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.960 
ready and prepared for anyone to go and
gank<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.259> lastly<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.100> no<00:01:32.490> sustained

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
gank and lastly you have no sustained

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.640 
gank and lastly you have no sustained
for<00:01:33.240> your<00:01:33.360> clits<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:34.140> you're<00:01:34.290> staying<00:01:34.470> in
