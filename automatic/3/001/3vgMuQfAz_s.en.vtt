the first three 27 here's the second and
then<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.049> full<00:02:21.320> power<00:02:21.620> was<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:27.100> lot<00:02:28.100> of

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
then the full power was a lot of

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.370 
then the full power was a lot of
difference<00:02:28.519> in<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.760> recoil<00:02:29.180> there<00:02:29.450> but<00:02:29.720> still

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
difference in the recoil there but still

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.530 
difference in the recoil there but still
it's<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.870> not<00:02:33.140> as<00:02:33.350> much<00:02:33.560> as<00:02:33.940> 357<00:02:34.940> Magnum<00:02:35.360> is

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
it's it's not as much as 357 Magnum is

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.479 
it's it's not as much as 357 Magnum is
and<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:38.269> full<00:02:38.480> power<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.950> 327<00:02:39.950> comes<00:02:40.130> pretty

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
and the full power of 327 comes pretty

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.090 
and the full power of 327 comes pretty
close<00:02:40.579> to<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.060> 357<00:02:41.870> Magnum<00:02:42.470> in<00:02:42.620> power<00:02:45.100> okay

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
close to a 357 Magnum in power okay

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.949 
close to a 357 Magnum in power okay
we'll<00:02:46.370> just<00:02:46.579> have<00:02:46.790> try<00:02:47.090> some<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.630> full
