familiar with the platform a lot of nice

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.350 
familiar with the platform a lot of nice
things<00:00:13.590> won't<00:00:13.830> get<00:00:14.040> into<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.700> want<00:00:15.299> to

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
things won't get into that I want to

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.200 
things won't get into that I want to
start<00:00:15.570> off<00:00:15.690> first<00:00:15.990> though<00:00:16.730> when<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.760> was<00:00:17.970> doing

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
start off first though when I was doing

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.349 
start off first though when I was doing
the<00:00:18.270> unboxing<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:20.039> SIM<00:00:20.369> card<00:00:20.670> tray<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.970> found

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the unboxing the SIM card tray I found

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.470 
the unboxing the SIM card tray I found
out<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.779> actually<00:00:22.260> underneath<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:24.210> tray

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
out is actually underneath the tray

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.189 
out is actually underneath the tray
where<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.810> could<00:00:24.960> put<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.140> micro<00:00:26.359> SD<00:00:27.359> card<00:00:27.630> and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
where you could put a micro SD card and

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.339 
where you could put a micro SD card and
I<00:00:28.260> believe<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.619> will<00:00:28.740> take<00:00:28.949> up<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.250> 64<00:00:29.789> gigs

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
I believe this will take up to 64 gigs

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.720 
I believe this will take up to 64 gigs
of<00:00:31.349> storage<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.800> yeah<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.309> slide<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
of storage so yeah you just slide the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.560 
of storage so yeah you just slide the
card<00:00:33.000> right<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:34.579> at<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.640> top<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.210> yeah<00:00:36.360> that's

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
card right in at the top so yeah that's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.840 
card right in at the top so yeah that's
definitely<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:37.050> good<00:00:37.260> thing<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.370> want<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
definitely a good thing if you want to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.840 
definitely a good thing if you want to
expand<00:00:39.780> memory<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.469> only<00:00:40.559> comes<00:00:40.980> with

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
expand memory as it only comes with

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.930 
expand memory as it only comes with
eight<00:00:42.360> gigs<00:00:43.070> while<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:44.160> booting<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.730> up

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
eight gigs while I'm booting this up

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.220 
eight gigs while I'm booting this up
initial<00:00:45.510> impressions<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.760> very<00:00:47.760> good<00:00:48.140> like<00:00:49.140> I

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
initial impressions is very good like I

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.330 
initial impressions is very good like I
said<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.410> mean<00:00:49.620> there<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:49.829> some<00:00:49.920> things<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.280> do

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.780 
say that I think the RAM is is that one
gig<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.530> double<00:01:10.830> check<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.549> I

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
it's pretty much as similar to what

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.460 
it's pretty much as similar to what
Android<00:02:08.429> heads<00:02:08.670> where<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.300> set<00:02:09.569> data

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
Android heads where you can set data

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.710 
Android heads where you can set data
limits<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.910> don't<00:02:12.090> go<00:02:12.239> over<00:02:12.270> your<00:02:12.540> data

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
limits so you don't go over your data

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.430 
limits so you don't go over your data
like

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
like

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.530 
like
set<00:02:13.560> up<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.770> monthly<00:02:13.980> limit<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:15.330> could

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
set up a monthly limit and I could

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.190 
set up a monthly limit and I could
choose<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:16.830> know<00:02:16.950> two<00:02:17.010> gigs<00:02:17.810> let<00:02:18.810> me<00:02:18.900> see<00:02:19.050> how

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.250 
choose you know two gigs let me see how
that<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.820> don't<00:02:20.820> know<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.120> gotta<00:02:21.300> put<00:02:21.570> in<00:02:21.750> well

the HTC 8x but another thing last but
not<00:05:10.340> least<00:05:10.610> one<00:05:11.270> of<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.419> standout<00:05:12.080> apps<00:05:12.290> I

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
not least one of the standout apps I

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.170 
not least one of the standout apps I
will<00:05:12.860> say<00:05:13.220> is<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:14.389> Nokia<00:05:14.600> music<00:05:15.490> and<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:17.030> the

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
will say is the Nokia music and and the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.760 
will say is the Nokia music and and the
reason<00:05:17.450> why<00:05:17.539> I<00:05:17.570> might<00:05:17.720> touch<00:05:17.900> on<00:05:18.020> nokia<00:05:18.380> music

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
reason why I might touch on nokia music

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.350 
reason why I might touch on nokia music
is<00:05:18.889> because<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:20.270> can<00:05:20.479> actually<00:05:20.780> make<00:05:22.360> mix

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
is because you can actually make mix

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.480 
is because you can actually make mix
radio<00:05:23.780> stations<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:24.740> then<00:05:24.919> you<00:05:25.039> could<00:05:25.190> save

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
radio stations and then you could save

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.510 
radio stations and then you could save
them<00:05:25.669> for<00:05:25.850> offline<00:05:26.330> and<00:05:26.750> it's<00:05:27.380> very<00:05:27.830> very<00:05:28.190> nice

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
them for offline and it's very very nice

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.159 
them for offline and it's very very nice
I<00:05:28.880> mean<00:05:29.090> because<00:05:29.270> if<00:05:29.450> you<00:05:29.570> don't<00:05:29.750> want<00:05:29.900> to<00:05:29.990> pay

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169
