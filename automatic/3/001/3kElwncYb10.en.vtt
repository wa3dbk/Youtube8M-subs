00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.160
 but illustrate the illegal reflection 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.839
 light refraction sport chulym 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.779
 a device that calls something washer and 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.759
 despicable Me 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.689
 glass 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.179
 got hit 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.679
 right is flat 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.650
 left convex part 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.190
 attached to the white circle 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.150
 on which 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.470
 applied division 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.040
 old age in every case does not match 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.610
 10 and in angular degree 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.720
 on 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.840
 the convex part of the first strip leandro falls 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.430
 laser ray 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.430
 and passes through 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500
 glass floor at the cylinder 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.760
 we will conduct it 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.650
 as follows 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.900
 the first picture shows the initial 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.140
 card washer position for 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.410
 when turning the puck 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.870
 reflected rays appear 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.120
 the refraction of rubles 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.430
 Opposite corner 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.880
 m corner painted red 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.009
 For the first time, forgive the yellow corner 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.430
 fall is equal to the angle of reflection 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.570
 a scarecrow dummy painted 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.010
 spent in seven years 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.030
 as the beam goes low class 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.030
 air that is and among the optical more 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.930
 dense medium optically less 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.820
 tightly 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.240
 then refracted accounting leans from 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.390
 perpendicular held 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.450
 so the interface is like two medium glass 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.010
 air at the point of incidence 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.430
 normal and he m big role 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.590
 in addition, if you look at the formula 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.640
 bottom left of the screen 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.840
 but you remember that relationship 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.390
 a and remember one of the laws of refraction 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.440
 respect senussi angle of incidence seven 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.140
 capitals 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.090
 fsin service and refraction so that 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.859
 gamma 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.179
 equally 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.059
 relationship rub 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:13.549
 absolute indicators 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.449
 refractive index second 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:16.339
 Wednesday 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:18.289
 absolute church 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:20.819
 refraction first among second medium 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.319
 is one for 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.489
 it is an absolute indicator 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.049
 refraction is almost equal 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:25.849
 unit 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.609
 pato so the ratio of sinuses 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.059
 c health center whether there will be days of bread prices 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:33.079
 we will gradually increase the angle 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.899
 falls along with this will grow and corner 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.079
 refracted gamma brush 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.749
 angles and will be equal to 90 degrees 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.079
 earlier than 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.869
 and reach 90 degrees 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.449
 at the same time, the fracture of the left will better disappear 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:48.629
 will only 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.999
 incident reflected rays this phenomenon 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:52.979
 full reflection 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.899
 outflow 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:58.359
 the initial value of the angle of cyprus which 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.719
 gamma 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.540
 became equal to 90 degrees we 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.049
 marked ivonne 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.799
 screen after 3 0 this is the so-called 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.749
 extreme scared fall while doing 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.919
 very outdated angle of incidence equals one 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.879
 at the right the current formula on 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.869
 the screen 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.869
 let's see the experience itself 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:22.469
 will be 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.469
 turn 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.559
 you will see what happened 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.209
 reflected watch 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.689
 and refraction rays 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:35.969
 let's 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.679
 trace behind has not 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.479
 in the chamber is even better 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.569
 here it is reflected rays 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.179
 and here it is when catching an even ray like you 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:47.869
 see that corner of the fall arawin 30 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.509
 degrees about 30 degrees pep 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.589
 dolls reflection and who has refractions 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:56.259
 now more he is 30 plus 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.979
 twenty fifty degrees 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.319
 gamma more than iniesta because 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.660
 better leaves expired in the air 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.969
 increase the angle of incidence 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.299
 vodka debts and approaching 90 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.479
 degrees and that's gone 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.929
 refracted ray 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.489
 there are only reflected rays 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.569
 and scared of falling it is now extreme and 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:19.590
 scared 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.579
 it is for glass and is like you 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.009
 see about 40 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:25.710
 42 degrees 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.919
 with further 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.309
 increase in dip 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:31.129
 naturally refracted to receive 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.830
 will not be 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.730
 there will be only incident rays reflected 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.289
 that is, we are seeing with you now 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.050
 complete phenomenon 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.900
 reflection
