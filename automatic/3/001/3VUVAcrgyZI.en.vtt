from<00:02:06.680> benfica<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.160> was

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
from benfica I think it was

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.820 
from benfica I think it was
and<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.690> know<00:02:09.810> he's<00:02:10.110> been<00:02:10.289> progressing

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
and you know he's been progressing

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.410 
and you know he's been progressing
attributes<00:02:11.370> we're<00:02:11.850> basically<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.270> look

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
attributes we're basically going to look

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.060 
attributes we're basically going to look
to<00:02:12.510> make<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.690> profit<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.170> him<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.470> think<00:02:14.010> we

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
to make a profit on him I think we

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.980 
to make a profit on him I think we
signed<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.430> about<00:02:14.580> 1.2<00:02:15.210> million<00:02:15.480> we

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
signed up for about 1.2 million we

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.180 
signed up for about 1.2 million we
should<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.350> able<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.560> shift<00:02:16.710> him<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:16.980> for<00:02:17.130> about

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
should be able to shift him on for about

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.280 
should be able to shift him on for about
3.5<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.360> would<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.480> an<00:02:18.600> awesome<00:02:18.720> profit

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
3.5 so that would be an awesome profit

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.860 
3.5 so that would be an awesome profit
but<00:02:19.920> anyway<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:21.090> first<00:02:21.300> game<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.570> have<00:02:21.690> side

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
but anyway the first game you have side

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.450 
but anyway the first game you have side
and<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.140> think<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.530> might<00:02:22.740> be<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.950> only<00:02:23.100> game

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
and I think this might be the only game

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.980 
and I think this might be the only game
the<00:02:23.490> episode<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.180> if<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.420> sorry<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:24.870> out
