along see like now the reason why those
didn't<00:01:58.200> work<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.219> were<00:01:59.280> just

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
didn't work is because they were just

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.340 
didn't work is because they were just
sort<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> references<00:02:00.390> without<00:02:00.840> any<00:02:01.020> sort<00:02:01.290> of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
sort of references without any sort of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.170 
sort of references without any sort of
actual<00:02:01.680> joke<00:02:02.100> attached<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.700> them<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.000> yeah

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
actual joke attached to them like yeah

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.550 
actual joke attached to them like yeah
it<00:02:03.509> was<00:02:03.630> cool<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> first<00:02:04.110> time<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:04.439> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
it was cool the first time because a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.499 
it was cool the first time because a
novelty<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.159> oh<00:02:05.369> Derpy's<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.270> she

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
novelty like oh Derpy's here and she

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.809 
novelty like oh Derpy's here and she
said<00:02:06.719> muffins<00:02:07.110> oh<00:02:07.259> that's<00:02:07.920> cool<00:02:08.129> then<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.580> just

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
said muffins oh that's cool then it just

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.559 
said muffins oh that's cool then it just
goes<00:02:08.940> into<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> territory<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
goes into the territory of

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.270 
goes into the territory of
they<00:02:11.170> referenced<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.799> thing<00:02:12.069> now<00:02:12.519> or<00:02:12.549> less<00:02:13.230> just

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
they referenced a thing now or less just

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.929 
they referenced a thing now or less just
there's<00:02:15.280> no<00:02:15.430> joke

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
there's no joke

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.369 
there's no joke
now<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.090> reason<00:02:16.450> why<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.629> references<00:02:17.230> work

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
now the reason why the references work

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.349 
now the reason why the references work
elsewhere<00:02:17.889> in<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.069> episode<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.760> because<00:02:19.150> they

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
elsewhere in the episode is because they

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.030 
elsewhere in the episode is because they
have<00:02:19.510> actual<00:02:19.959> jokes<00:02:20.139> attached<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.769> them<00:02:20.920> and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
have actual jokes attached to them and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.059 
have actual jokes attached to them and
the<00:02:21.099> jokes<00:02:21.310> are<00:02:21.489> actually<00:02:21.609> really<00:02:22.030> funny<00:02:22.329> and

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
the jokes are actually really funny and

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.739 
the jokes are actually really funny and
yeah<00:02:24.069> like<00:02:24.670> for<00:02:24.879> example<00:02:25.239> when<00:02:25.359> they<00:02:25.450> take<00:02:25.629> the

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:25.749 
yeah like for example when they take the

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.720 
yeah like for example when they take the
real<00:02:25.959> world<00:02:26.230> thing<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.769> bon<00:02:26.950> bon<00:02:27.189> also<00:02:27.519> being

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
real world thing of bon bon also being

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.039 
real world thing of bon bon also being
called<00:02:27.939> sweetie<00:02:28.269> drops<00:02:28.629> and<00:02:28.810> whatnot<00:02:29.019> and

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
called sweetie drops and whatnot and

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.660 
called sweetie drops and whatnot and
they<00:02:29.319> take<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.709> into<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.099> show<00:02:30.189> it's<00:02:30.609> like

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
they take that into the show it's like

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.929 
they take that into the show it's like
oh<00:02:30.879> you<00:02:30.939> know<00:02:31.269> me<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.569> one<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:32.109> IMAX<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:35.680> like

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
and then when liar gets all teared up

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.489 
and then when liar gets all teared up
like<00:02:38.829> no<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.430> bench<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.659> benches<00:02:41.200> though

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:41.499

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
but it's not the point of the scene and

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.379 
but it's not the point of the scene and

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
then they also went the other way with

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.599 
then they also went the other way with
it<00:03:07.719> by<00:03:07.900> having<00:03:08.260> him<00:03:08.439> reference<00:03:08.859> time-travel

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
it by having him reference time-travel

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.789 
it by having him reference time-travel
