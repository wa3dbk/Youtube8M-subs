00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.039 

small<00:00:49.999> jack<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.539> then<00:00:50.629> on<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:50.899> other<00:00:50.929> side

one<00:00:51.530> ton<00:00:51.709> floor<00:00:51.949> jack<00:00:52.159> and<00:00:52.809> then<00:00:53.809> since<00:00:54.170> I

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
one ton floor jack and then since I

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.469 
one ton floor jack and then since I
don't<00:00:54.350> have<00:00:54.469> a<00:00:54.589> center<00:00:54.859> stand<00:00:55.129> I<00:00:56.920> just<00:00:57.920> take<00:00:58.069> a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
don't have a center stand I just take a

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.120 
don't have a center stand I just take a
cinder<00:00:59.479> block<00:00:59.539> under<00:00:59.899> there

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
cinder block under there

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.709 
cinder block under there
and<00:01:01.610> then<00:01:01.760> I<00:01:01.880> had<00:01:02.120> to<00:01:02.920> remove<00:01:05.080> the

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
and then I had to remove the

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.580 
and then I had to remove the
all<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.320> hardware<00:01:08.560> holding<00:01:09.039> the<00:01:09.490> hub<00:01:09.700> on<00:01:09.880> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
all the hardware holding the hub on and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:20.149 
all the hardware holding the hub on and
then<00:01:11.759> loosen<00:01:12.759> up<00:01:13.469> the<00:01:15.450> spindle<00:01:18.569> on<00:01:19.569> this<00:01:19.780> side

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
then loosen up the spindle on this side

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.359 
then loosen up the spindle on this side
tap<00:01:21.159> it<00:01:21.340> out<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:23.259> if<00:01:23.499> I<00:01:23.619> had<00:01:23.770> it<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:24.009> had<00:01:24.280> to

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
tap it out and then if I had it I had to

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.249 
tap it out and then if I had it I had to
actually<00:01:24.459> bump<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:27.780> wheel<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.020> right<00:01:29.140> a

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
actually bump the wheel to the right a

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.949 
actually bump the wheel to the right a
few<00:01:29.439> times<00:01:29.500> just<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.069> get<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.630> gears<00:01:31.630> out<00:01:31.810> of

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
few times just to get the gears out of

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.339 
few times just to get the gears out of
differential<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.399> that<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.609> would<00:01:33.700> fall<00:01:33.880> out

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:34.349 
differential so that it would fall out

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:37.859 
differential so that it would fall out
and<00:01:35.880> whenever<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:37.030> did<00:01:37.179> that<00:01:37.359> the<00:01:37.479> hook<00:01:37.659> came

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
and whenever I did that the hook came

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:38.990 
and whenever I did that the hook came
off<00:01:38.020> with<00:01:38.229> it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
off with it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.600 
off with it
so<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.030> got<00:01:41.039> the<00:01:42.039> new<00:01:42.219> brake<00:01:43.090> pads<00:01:43.119> already<00:01:43.659> on

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
so I got the new brake pads already on

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.999 
so I got the new brake pads already on
these<00:01:45.610> are<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:45.849> old<00:01:45.939> ones<00:01:46.179> and<00:01:46.929> as<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:47.890> can

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
these are the old ones and as you can

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.580 
these are the old ones and as you can
tell<00:01:48.219> that<00:01:48.429> we<00:01:48.549> still<00:01:48.819> have

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.030 

you<00:01:54.520> see<00:01:54.670> if<00:01:54.729> I<00:01:54.790> can<00:01:54.909> get<00:01:55.000> definitely<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:56.040> little

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
you see if I can get definitely a little

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.590 
you see if I can get definitely a little
