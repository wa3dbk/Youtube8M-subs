00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
think about it I was just messing around

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.689

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.369 
with it I'm well I planted by
aftermarket<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.660> now<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.989> sounds<00:00:55.110> pretty

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
aftermarket but now it sounds pretty

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.439 
aftermarket but now it sounds pretty
good<00:00:55.469> right<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.680> too<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.730> I'll<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.120> ahead<00:00:57.149> and

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
good right now too so I'll go ahead and

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.070 
good right now too so I'll go ahead and
start<00:00:57.690> up<00:01:00.829> man<00:01:01.859> cut<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.850> my<00:01:03.000> left<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.719> first

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
start up man cut up my left in on first

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.910 
start up man cut up my left in on first
gear<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.530> won't<00:01:04.739> start<00:01:06.380> left<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.590> first

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
gear so it won't start left in first

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:19.570 
gear so it won't start left in first
gear<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.250> wouldn't<00:01:08.549> roll<00:01:08.640> back<00:01:10.400> there<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.549> go

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.480 

then<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.810> thought<00:01:26.110> as<00:01:26.320> I<00:01:26.500> wouldn't<00:01:27.130> like<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.460> to

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
then I thought as I wouldn't like it to

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.140 
then I thought as I wouldn't like it to
be<00:01:27.760> but<00:01:28.000> you<00:01:28.180> know<00:01:28.210> able<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.890> denna

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.340 

I<00:01:43.740> kind<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.490> how<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.670> grumbles

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350

I kind of like how it grumbles
it<00:01:46.650> growls

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.500 

yep<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.090> that's<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.390> quick<00:01:54.540> video<00:01:54.900> update<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.720 
yep so that's a quick video update in a
comment<00:01:57.510> once<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.050> guys<00:01:58.490> when<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.520> guys

think<00:01:59.970> about<00:02:00.030> it

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
think about it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.200 
think about it
I<00:02:01.770> personally<00:02:02.610> think<00:02:02.730> it's<00:02:02.910> kind<00:02:03.120> of<00:02:03.150> weird

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
I personally think it's kind of weird

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.500 
I personally think it's kind of weird
from<00:02:03.690> behind<00:02:03.900> because<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.320> has<00:02:04.500> four<00:02:05.510> pipes

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
from behind because it has four pipes

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.870 
from behind because it has four pipes
inside<00:02:08.899> but<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.320> know<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> guess<00:02:11.400> it'll<00:02:11.580> do<00:02:11.730> for

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
inside but you know I guess it'll do for

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.390 
inside but you know I guess it'll do for
now<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.240> sounds<00:02:12.570> great<00:02:12.630> for<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.920> little<00:02:14.220> mod
