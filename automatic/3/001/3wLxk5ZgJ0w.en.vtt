00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
learned you a Rhodes Scholar where were

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.589 
learned you a Rhodes Scholar where were
you<00:00:06.560> and<00:00:06.770> how<00:00:06.890> did<00:00:07.009> you<00:00:07.129> find<00:00:07.310> out<00:00:07.460> so<00:00:08.029> I<00:00:08.090> was<00:00:08.389> on

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
you and how did you find out so I was on

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.330 
you and how did you find out so I was on
the<00:00:08.840> football<00:00:08.929> field<00:00:09.139> I<00:00:09.590> was<00:00:09.980> in<00:00:10.190> the

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
the football field I was in the

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.680 
the football field I was in the
apartment<00:00:10.580> of<00:00:10.880> the<00:00:11.000> road<00:00:11.210> selection

apartment of the road selection

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.120 
apartment of the road selection
committee<00:00:11.960> I<00:00:12.200> found<00:00:12.530> out<00:00:12.620> through<00:00:12.830> a<00:00:12.889> text

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
right what was or is the most exciting

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.290 
right what was or is the most exciting
class<00:00:33.440> you<00:00:33.620> take<00:00:33.739> at<00:00:33.920> Harvard<00:00:34.250> that's<00:00:34.790> tough<00:00:35.120> I

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
class you take at Harvard that's tough I

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.760 
class you take at Harvard that's tough I
mean<00:00:35.480> they're<00:00:35.930> all<00:00:36.020> exciting<00:00:36.440> in<00:00:36.500> different

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
mean they're all exciting in different

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.590 
mean they're all exciting in different
ways<00:00:36.920> physics<00:00:37.399> 15<00:00:37.700> a<00:00:37.820> it<00:00:38.149> was<00:00:38.239> probably<00:00:38.510> the

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
ways physics 15 a it was probably the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.360 
ways physics 15 a it was probably the
most<00:00:38.719> exciting<00:00:38.930> physics<00:00:39.829> course<00:00:40.010> I'm<00:00:40.100> taking

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
most exciting physics course I'm taking

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.650 
most exciting physics course I'm taking
right<00:00:40.520> now<00:00:40.550> I<00:00:40.670> really<00:00:41.030> liked<00:00:41.239> it<00:00:41.420> was<00:00:41.480> just

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
right now I really liked it was just

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.910 
right now I really liked it was just
like<00:00:41.750> an<00:00:41.870> uphill<00:00:42.020> struggle<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.559> whole<00:00:42.710> time

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
like an uphill struggle the whole time

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.290 
like an uphill struggle the whole time
and<00:00:43.160> then<00:00:43.280> learning<00:00:43.520> a<00:00:43.700> lot<00:00:43.820> in<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.090> morning

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
and then learning a lot in the morning

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.970 
and then learning a lot in the morning
is<00:00:44.570> fantastic<00:00:45.230> mostly<00:00:45.530> because<00:00:45.649> I<00:00:45.770> don't

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
is fantastic mostly because I don't

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.830 
is fantastic mostly because I don't
understand<00:00:46.370> anything<00:00:46.579> that's<00:00:46.789> going<00:00:47.000> on<00:00:47.210> and

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
understand anything that's going on and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.930 
understand anything that's going on and
you<00:00:48.440> know<00:00:48.530> to<00:00:48.590> finish<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:48.980> off<00:00:49.129> with<00:00:49.340> a<00:00:49.399> big

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
you know to finish it off with a big

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.910 
you know to finish it off with a big
grid<00:00:50.180> quantum<00:00:50.989> field<00:00:51.140> theory<00:00:51.350> I<00:00:51.559> think<00:00:51.739> it<00:00:51.829> was

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
grid quantum field theory I think it was

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.860 
grid quantum field theory I think it was
like<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.100> most<00:00:52.219> rewarding<00:00:52.760> just<00:00:52.940> complete

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
like the most rewarding just complete

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.319 
like the most rewarding just complete
package<00:00:54.260> class<00:00:54.789> when<00:00:55.789> do<00:00:55.910> you<00:00:55.969> usually<00:00:56.059> wake

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
package class when do you usually wake

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.430 
package class when do you usually wake
up<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:56.600> morning<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.079> when<00:00:57.199> they<00:00:57.320> usually

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
up in the morning and when they usually

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.799 
up in the morning and when they usually
get<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.890> bed<00:00:58.039> it<00:00:58.550> depends<00:00:58.940> if<00:00:59.000> we<00:00:59.120> have<00:00:59.210> lift<00:00:59.480> I

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
get to bed it depends if we have lift I

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.900 
get to bed it depends if we have lift I
wake<00:01:00.320> up<00:01:00.410> around<00:01:00.559> 6:00<00:01:00.890> I<00:01:01.100> don't<00:01:01.489> wake<00:01:01.640> up<00:01:01.760> in

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
wake up around 6:00 I don't wake up in

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.289 
wake up around 6:00 I don't wake up in
the<00:01:01.969> morning<00:01:02.210> I<00:01:02.270> wake<00:01:02.420> up<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:04.299> some

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
the morning I wake up and some

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.539 
the morning I wake up and some
experiments<00:01:05.720> before<00:01:05.930> class<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:07.040> depends<00:01:07.520> like

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
experiments before class it depends like

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.120 
experiments before class it depends like
if<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:07.909> have<00:01:08.000> class<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:08.570> get<00:01:08.689> to<00:01:08.780> bed

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
if I have class and I get to bed

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.100 
if I have class and I get to bed
probably<00:01:10.130> 10<00:01:10.460> 11<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.390> they'll<00:01:11.659> usually<00:01:11.840> go<00:01:12.049> to

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
probably 10 11 and they'll usually go to

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.410 
probably 10 11 and they'll usually go to
bed<00:01:12.170> at<00:01:12.409> 4<00:01:12.740> 5

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
night before I flew to San Francisco was

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.770 
night before I flew to San Francisco was
pretty<00:01:36.439> wild<00:01:36.560> uh<00:01:37.329> do<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:38.390> have<00:01:38.479> any<00:01:38.570> pet

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
pretty wild uh do you have any pet
