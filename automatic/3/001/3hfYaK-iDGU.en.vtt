I'm going to show you how to warp the

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.140 
I'm going to show you how to warp the
knit<00:00:07.390> and<00:00:07.570> weave<00:00:07.750> womb<00:00:08.080> it's<00:00:08.440> really<00:00:08.710> simple

yarn you want to hold two strands

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.400 
yarn you want to hold two strands
together<00:00:14.410> this<00:00:15.010> way<00:00:15.309> your<00:00:16.120> fabric<00:00:16.570> comes<00:00:17.230> out

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
together this way your fabric comes out

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.380 
together this way your fabric comes out
nice<00:00:17.650> and<00:00:17.890> thick<00:00:18.100> go<00:00:18.880> ahead<00:00:18.910> and<00:00:19.240> make<00:00:19.360> a

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
place the slip knot on the contrast

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.110 
place the slip knot on the contrast
colored<00:00:33.910> peg<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.950> just<00:00:36.129> want<00:00:36.309> to<00:00:36.400> pull<00:00:36.940> the

then<00:00:42.040> we're<00:00:42.190> going<00:00:42.400> to<00:00:42.520> bring<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.940> yarn<00:00:43.120> down

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
then we're going to bring the yarn down

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.340 
then we're going to bring the yarn down
and<00:00:44.309> wrap<00:00:45.309> it<00:00:45.460> across<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:46.300> first<00:00:46.600> peg<00:00:46.930> on<00:00:47.170> the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
and wrap it across the first peg on the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.610 
and wrap it across the first peg on the
opposite<00:00:47.710> side<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.160> loom<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:53.140> bring<00:00:53.470> it

opposite side of the loom and bring it

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.890 
opposite side of the loom and bring it
back<00:00:53.920> over<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.820> wrap<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:57.940> around<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.600> first

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
back over and wrap it around the first

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.399 
back over and wrap it around the first
peg<00:00:59.260> on<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:01.180> opposite<00:01:01.540> end<00:01:01.720> of<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.870> loom<00:01:02.110> and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
peg on the opposite end of the loom and

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.070 
peg on the opposite end of the loom and
as<00:01:03.280> you're<00:01:03.489> doing<00:01:03.640> this<00:01:03.940> you<00:01:04.600> want<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.869> just

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
as you're doing this you want to just

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.580 
as you're doing this you want to just
make<00:01:05.379> sure<00:01:05.650> that<00:01:06.070> you're<00:01:06.549> keeping<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.590> two

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
make sure that you're keeping the two

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.460 
make sure that you're keeping the two
yarns<00:01:08.950> flat<00:01:09.520> so<00:01:10.450> they're<00:01:10.600> not<00:01:10.780> twisting<00:01:11.320> all

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
yarns flat so they're not twisting all

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.219 
yarns flat so they're not twisting all
over<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.799> place<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:13.869> just<00:01:14.020> keep

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
over the place and you just keep

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.460 
over the place and you just keep
wrapping<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.070> yarn<00:01:15.190> around<00:01:15.520> each<00:01:15.909> peg<00:01:16.470> until

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
wrapping the yarn around each peg until

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.570 
wrapping the yarn around each peg until
you<00:01:17.619> get<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.390> last<00:01:19.630> peg<00:01:19.990> on<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.320> loom<00:01:20.580> so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
you get to the last peg on the loom so

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.520 
you get to the last peg on the loom so
these<00:01:21.700> vertical<00:01:22.330> rows<00:01:22.990> that<00:01:23.200> we're<00:01:23.380> creating

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
these vertical rows that we're creating

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.609 
these vertical rows that we're creating
are<00:01:24.159> called<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.790> warp<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.270> you'll<00:01:26.140> need<00:01:26.380> this

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
are called the warp and you'll need this

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.139 
are called the warp and you'll need this
to<00:01:26.860> do<00:01:27.390> any<00:01:28.390> weaving<00:01:29.380> pattern<00:01:29.770> on<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.040> loom<00:01:30.220> we

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
to do any weaving pattern on the loom we

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.099 
to do any weaving pattern on the loom we
always<00:01:31.390> set<00:01:31.570> up<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.719> warp<00:01:32.229> first<00:01:33.899> now<00:01:34.899> we've

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
always set up the warp first now we've

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.779 
always set up the warp first now we've
worked<00:01:35.350> our<00:01:35.500> way<00:01:35.530> all<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.159> way<00:01:36.189> to<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.579> last

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
worked our way all the way to the last

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.620 
worked our way all the way to the last
peg<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:38.350> finish<00:01:38.679> it<00:01:38.829> off<00:01:38.950> we<00:01:39.310> just<00:01:39.789> wrap<00:01:40.600> it

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
peg to finish it off we just wrap it

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.149 
peg to finish it off we just wrap it
around<00:01:41.520> I'm<00:01:42.520> going<00:01:42.609> to<00:01:42.700> just<00:01:42.909> hold<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.270> yarn

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
around I'm going to just hold the yarn

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.200 
around I'm going to just hold the yarn
we're<00:01:45.159> just<00:01:45.310> going<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.520> grab<00:01:45.700> our<00:01:45.939> pair<00:01:46.179> of

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
we're just going to grab our pair of

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.429 
we're just going to grab our pair of
scissors<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.770> cut<00:01:47.829> our<00:01:48.759> yarn<00:01:49.289> leaving<00:01:50.289> a

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
scissors and cut our yarn leaving a

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.870 
scissors and cut our yarn leaving a
little<00:01:50.649> bit<00:01:50.770> of<00:01:50.859> a<00:01:50.920> tail

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:09.520 

and<00:01:57.880> then<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.290> make<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.440> slipknot

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.710 

we'll<00:02:10.130> place<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.580> slip<00:02:10.850> knot<00:02:11.060> on<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.480> last

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
we'll place the slip knot on the last

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.870 
we'll place the slip knot on the last
peg<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:16.040> pull<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.520> tight

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.120 

and<00:02:18.970> now<00:02:19.540> we've<00:02:19.720> finished<00:02:19.930> warping<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.860> we're

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
and now we've finished warping and we're

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.480 
and now we've finished warping and we're
ready<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.550> start<00:02:21.760> weaving<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.270> weft
