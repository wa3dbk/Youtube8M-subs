I've<00:01:37.000> tried<00:01:37.240> these<00:01:37.450> on<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.200> walked<00:01:38.530> around<00:01:38.710> in

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
I've tried these on and walked around in

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.819 
I've tried these on and walked around in
them<00:01:39.040> and<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:39.610> think<00:01:40.420> I<00:01:40.540> would<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.710> be<00:01:41.799> sure

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
them and I think I would just to be sure

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.630 
them and I think I would just to be sure
I<00:01:41.979> wear<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> plaster<00:01:42.759> on<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:42.909> back<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.579> be

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
I wear a plaster on the back just to be

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.730 
I wear a plaster on the back just to be
sure<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:45.790> don't<00:01:45.970> get<00:01:46.090> any<00:01:46.150> blisters<00:01:46.750> but<00:01:47.079> to<00:01:47.650> be

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
sure I don't get any blisters but to be

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.999 
sure I don't get any blisters but to be
fair<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.159> felt<00:01:48.490> pretty<00:01:49.119> good<00:01:49.360> so<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:50.140> don't<00:01:50.710> know

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
fair it felt pretty good so I don't know

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.609 
fair it felt pretty good so I don't know
if<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.250> would<00:01:51.460> get<00:01:51.640> any<00:01:51.820> qualms<00:01:52.750> smooth<00:01:53.170> but<00:01:53.530> it

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
if I would get any qualms smooth but it

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.170 
if I would get any qualms smooth but it
is<00:01:53.710> still<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.009> little<00:01:54.250> bit<00:01:54.340> textured<00:01:54.970> so<00:01:55.119> you

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
is still a little bit textured so you

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.210 
is still a little bit textured so you
would<00:01:55.420> still<00:01:55.689> get<00:01:55.899> a<00:01:55.960> little<00:01:56.200> bit<00:01:56.439> of<00:01:56.560> grip<00:01:57.009> on

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
would still get a little bit of grip on

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.330 
would still get a little bit of grip on
that<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.700> then<00:01:57.970> there's<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.299> little<00:01:58.600> tiny

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
that and then there's a little tiny

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.240 
that and then there's a little tiny
minut<00:02:00.340> heel<00:02:04.380> workmanship<00:02:05.380> on<00:02:05.560> these<00:02:05.799> is

Campbell<00:02:23.379> shoes<00:02:25.769> yeah<00:02:26.769> let<00:02:26.920> me<00:02:26.950> get<00:02:27.159> the<00:02:27.280> other

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
Campbell shoes yeah let me get the other

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.759 
Campbell shoes yeah let me get the other
one<00:02:27.670> out<00:02:27.939> here<00:02:28.629> they<00:02:28.959> both<00:02:29.170> are

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
one out here they both are

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.550 
one out here they both are
I<00:02:30.299> would<00:02:31.299> have<00:02:31.420> preferred<00:02:31.569> these<00:02:31.989> if<00:02:32.260> they

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
I would have preferred these if they

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.830 
I would have preferred these if they
were<00:02:32.620> silver<00:02:33.340> but<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.939> think<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.659> they<00:02:34.720> will

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
were silver but I think that they will

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.770 
were silver but I think that they will
still<00:02:35.109> go<00:02:35.319> with<00:02:35.500> everything<00:02:36.629> they're<00:02:37.629> not

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
still go with everything they're not

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.319 
still go with everything they're not
sort<00:02:38.019> of<00:02:38.079> spiky<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.799> point<00:02:39.760> where<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.060> would

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
sort of spiky to a point where it would

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.630 
sort of spiky to a point where it would
hurt<00:02:40.659> this<00:02:40.989> one<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.560> big<00:02:41.769> spike<00:02:42.099> is<00:02:42.340> quite

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
hurt this one the big spike is quite

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.399 
hurt this one the big spike is quite
pointy<00:02:43.390> but<00:02:44.109> the<00:02:44.230> rest<00:02:45.150> aren't<00:02:46.150> too<00:02:46.359> bad<00:02:46.689> they

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
pointy but the rest aren't too bad they

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.550 
pointy but the rest aren't too bad they
sort<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:48.510> focus<00:02:49.510> all<00:02:49.659> the<00:02:49.780> biggest<00:02:50.079> spikes<00:02:50.290> in

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
sort of focus all the biggest spikes in

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.009 
sort of focus all the biggest spikes in
the<00:02:50.920> middle<00:02:51.310> part<00:02:51.579> wears<00:02:51.790> around<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.629> outside

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
the middle part wears around the outside

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.890 
the middle part wears around the outside
they're<00:02:53.829> a<00:02:53.859> little<00:02:54.069> bit<00:02:54.280> smaller<00:02:54.579> so<00:02:54.790> if<00:02:55.689> you

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
they're a little bit smaller so if you

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.500 
they're a little bit smaller so if you
were<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.319> accidentally<00:02:57.010> kick<00:02:57.549> someone<00:02:57.939> they

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
were to accidentally kick someone they

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.940 
were to accidentally kick someone they
wouldn't<00:02:58.780> hurt<00:02:58.930> as<00:02:59.079> much<00:02:59.139> somebody<00:02:59.769> was<00:02:59.889> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
wouldn't hurt as much somebody was to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.589 
wouldn't hurt as much somebody was to
stand<00:03:00.189> on<00:03:00.280> your<00:03:00.459> foot<00:03:00.639> they<00:03:00.970> might<00:03:01.209> not<00:03:01.389> have<00:03:01.450> a

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
stand on your foot they might not have a

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.289 
stand on your foot they might not have a
great<00:03:01.840> time<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.349> think<00:03:02.709> I<00:03:02.769> would<00:03:02.919> say<00:03:03.099> about<00:03:03.400> any

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
great time I think I would say about any

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.589 
great time I think I would say about any
Jeffrey<00:03:04.930> Campbell<00:03:05.139> flats<00:03:06.129> and<00:03:06.549> I've<00:03:07.150> ordered

Jeffrey Campbell flats and I've ordered

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.890 
Jeffrey Campbell flats and I've ordered
the<00:03:07.810> martini<00:03:08.739> flats<00:03:09.159> before<00:03:09.629> and<00:03:10.629> ended<00:03:10.870> up

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
the martini flats before and ended up

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.409 
the martini flats before and ended up
send<00:03:11.139> them<00:03:11.290> back<00:03:11.500> because<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:15.790> at<00:03:16.000> my<00:03:16.239> actual

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:16.419 
send them back because this at my actual

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.940 
send them back because this at my actual
shoe<00:03:16.870> size<00:03:17.169> was<00:03:17.799> far<00:03:18.250> too<00:03:18.280> big<00:03:18.790> for<00:03:19.000> me<00:03:19.209> so<00:03:20.139> in

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
shoe size was far too big for me so in

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.800 
shoe size was far too big for me so in
these<00:03:21.159> ones<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.549> ordered<00:03:21.849> a<00:03:21.939> size<00:03:22.120> down<00:03:22.510> and

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
these ones I ordered a size down and

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.890 
these ones I ordered a size down and
these<00:03:23.199> fit<00:03:23.530> perfectly<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.819> I<00:03:25.180> would<00:03:25.389> say<00:03:25.659> if

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
these fit perfectly so I would say if

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.140 
these fit perfectly so I would say if
you<00:03:26.079> are<00:03:26.260> looking<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.370> try<00:03:27.579> these<00:03:27.639> I<00:03:27.819> would

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
you are looking to try these I would

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.710

probably<00:03:29.370> order<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.400> size<00:03:30.699> down<00:03:31.030> but<00:03:31.540> other

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720
