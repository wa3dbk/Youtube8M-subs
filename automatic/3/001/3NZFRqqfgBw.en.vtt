I<00:00:50.860> live<00:00:51.040> I'm<00:00:51.130> playing<00:00:51.370> in<00:00:51.640> this<00:00:51.730> championship

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
I live I'm playing in this championship

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.000 
I live I'm playing in this championship
I<00:00:52.570> think<00:00:53.050> for<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.260> first<00:00:53.410> few<00:00:53.590> games<00:00:53.800> are

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
I think for the first few games are

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.250 
I think for the first few games are
really<00:00:54.160> strong<00:00:54.640> last<00:00:55.060> game<00:00:55.570> against<00:00:55.900> Wales<00:00:56.080> to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
really strong last game against Wales to

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.420 
really strong last game against Wales to
kind<00:00:56.440> of<00:00:56.470> let<00:00:56.590> themselves<00:00:56.770> down<00:00:57.130> especially

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
kind of let themselves down especially

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.790 
kind of let themselves down especially
in<00:00:57.760> first<00:00:58.000> half<00:00:58.150> but<00:00:58.840> if<00:00:58.960> they<00:00:59.110> play<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.560> way

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
in first half but if they play the way

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.200 
in first half but if they play the way
they<00:00:59.950> have<00:01:00.130> been<00:01:00.370> pressed<00:01:00.730> in<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:00.880> last<00:01:01.030> game

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
they have been pressed in the last game

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.270 
they have been pressed in the last game
I<00:01:01.360> think<00:01:01.420> you<00:01:02.080> know<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:02.290> could<00:01:02.500> win<00:01:02.740> us<00:01:02.860> fingers

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
I think you know we could win us fingers

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.369 
I think you know we could win us fingers

deserve<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:29.119> win

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
deserve to win

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.570
