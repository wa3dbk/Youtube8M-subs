00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.530 
have any flakes so um I think what I'm
going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:52.829> now<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.250> probably<00:01:54.060> just

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
going to do right now is probably just

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.690 
going to do right now is probably just
fill<00:01:54.780> my<00:01:54.930> water<00:01:55.079> bottle<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.100> spritz<00:01:56.579> my

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
fill my water bottle up and spritz my

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.280 
fill my water bottle up and spritz my
hair<00:01:56.909> down<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> see<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.600> kind<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.049> takes

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
hair down and see if that kind of takes

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
hair down and see if that kind of takes
the<00:01:58.380> flakes<00:01:58.680> away<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> really<00:02:00.329> have

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420

the<00:02:07.530> curl<00:02:07.770> definition<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> fact<00:02:08.849> that

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the curl definition I like the fact that

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.570 
the curl definition I like the fact that
it<00:02:09.209> bounces<00:02:10.220> but

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
it bounces but

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.280 
it bounces but
and<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.300> should<00:02:12.540> my<00:02:12.660> hair<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.870> don't<00:02:13.110> know<00:02:13.200> if

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
I just I don't know it's just annoying

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.610 
I just I don't know it's just annoying
pet<00:02:20.190> peeve<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> have<00:02:20.880> with<00:02:21.120> hair<00:02:21.360> gel<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.020> I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
pet peeve that I have with hair gel so I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.210 
pet peeve that I have with hair gel so I
can't<00:02:23.490> say<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.210> love<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.810> olive<00:02:25.020> oil<00:02:25.530> gel

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
can't say that I love the olive oil gel

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.850 
can't say that I love the olive oil gel
um<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.300> maximum<00:02:27.990> hole<00:02:28.230> maybe<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.770> should

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
um this is maximum hole maybe I should

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.040 
um this is maximum hole maybe I should
have<00:02:29.160> got<00:02:29.280> soft<00:02:29.760> hole<00:02:30.150> maybe<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.780> would<00:02:30.960> have

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
have got soft hole maybe that would have

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.770 
have got soft hole maybe that would have
made<00:02:31.310> all<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.730> difference<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.630> at<00:02:33.750> that

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
made all the difference but at that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.210 
made all the difference but at that
particular<00:02:34.050> store<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.740> went<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.190> went

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
particular store that I went to I went

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.400 
particular store that I went to I went
to<00:02:35.430> Sally's<00:02:35.760> Beauty<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.210> pick<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.510> up<00:02:36.570> they

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
to Sally's Beauty to pick this up they

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.640 
to Sally's Beauty to pick this up they
only<00:02:37.590> had<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.310> maximal<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.570> maybe<00:02:40.230> that's<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
only had the maximal so maybe that's the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.830 
only had the maximal so maybe that's the
difference<00:02:40.860> if<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.490> can<00:02:41.790> find<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.150> soft<00:02:42.390> hole<00:02:42.660> i

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
difference if I can find a soft hole i

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.690 
difference if I can find a soft hole i
will<00:02:43.020> try<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.320> again<00:02:43.620> or<00:02:44.040> if<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.280> guys<00:02:44.430> can
