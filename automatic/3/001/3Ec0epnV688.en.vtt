that'd<00:01:48.200> be<00:01:48.380> great<00:01:48.650> but<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:49.400> really<00:01:49.640> I<00:01:49.790> want<00:01:50.030> to

with<00:02:02.150> maths<00:02:03.070> I'm<00:02:04.070> not<00:02:04.310> huge<00:02:04.960> there's<00:02:05.960> some

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
with maths I'm not huge there's some

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.710 
with maths I'm not huge there's some
girls<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:06.440> are<00:02:06.650> bigger<00:02:07.149> so<00:02:08.149> I'm<00:02:08.270> just<00:02:08.509> going

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
for the most balanced symmetry that I

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.810 
for the most balanced symmetry that I
can<00:02:11.450> get<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:12.350> think<00:02:12.770> I'm<00:02:12.890> pretty<00:02:13.100> balanced<00:02:13.580> and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
can get I think I'm pretty balanced and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.190 
can get I think I'm pretty balanced and
I'm<00:02:13.910> going<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.090> get<00:02:14.210> as<00:02:14.300> lean<00:02:14.480> as<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.720> can<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
I'm going to get as lean as I can and

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:36.069 
I'm going to get as lean as I can and
hope<00:02:16.070> for<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.250> best
