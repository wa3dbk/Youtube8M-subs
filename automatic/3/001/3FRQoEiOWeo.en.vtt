00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.219
 hey and hello together i am though 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.809
 tom is back from tt.com 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.369
 Today I want to show you how you are 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.869
 quite simply your windows 7 computer 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.390
 reset to factory settings 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.650
 and I can accompany you as long 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.360
 until the new computer again 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.950
 is set up and the whole is synonymous 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.720
 very nimble and you do not have to be professionals 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.980
 Just follow my tips and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.570
 then use your head a bit 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.890
 the whole fun works so too 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.329
 First of all, you click on the windows 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.809
 Taste and then go here in the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.880
 control panel now in the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.840
 Control Panel, we click on the top 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.840
 systems and security 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:48.210
 Click here to save and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.410
 Restore and in the next step 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.940
 Let's go to the bottom and click 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.999
 on system settings on the computer 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.289
 restore 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:58.409
 yes the whole kept well hidden 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.519
 so that one is not for nothing does so 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.600
 then here on advanced again 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.600
 click on the production method 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.810
 and now we can between two 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.010
 options, we use them though 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.060
 previously set up the system image 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.260
 computer or restore 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.550
 computer at factory settings 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.810
 reset we want the computer 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.830
 completely on the factory settings 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 reset to default 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.920
 although all contents on the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.510
 computer deleted and replaced with a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.250
 Restore image to be replaced 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.980
 So practically the computer looks 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.810
 Of course, as new bought only internally 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.060
 outwardly your power he puts in there 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.990
 have had the can how can I 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.670
 Of course not to do 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.080
 Now click on the lower one 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.250
 option and now here again 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.510
 asked if he saved the files 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.250
 like or not because as I said think 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.090
 All things are gone after that and the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.350
 computers back on the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.120
 factory settings I have that 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.260
 I've done that before 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.670
 single just more on the 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.930
 hard drive and this hard drive 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.830
 of course, a computer disconnected 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.310
 That's why I can do this now 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.290
 step on skip click so im 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.570
 now the next step again 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.710
 asked if we the the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.640
 really want to dare restore 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.630
 and unfortunately I have to get on my mobile phone 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.040
 rewrite the software works 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.600
 no longer there the computer now 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.710
 not working anymore so here we are 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.120
 from the phone expensive for the bad 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.160
 picture quality I have on the reboot 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.480
 pressed and now it starts right 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.200
 with the restoration of the computer 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.429
 runs his first time down now invites 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.539
 the computer in the background just a 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.979
 few files but then you still have to 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.790
 do not do anything just wait there 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.959
 as I said that computer 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.959
 Restore that can really be one 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.329
 take a few minutes 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.189
 in the first step we are asked how 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.690
 our keyboard input method should be 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.750
 I once selected German completely 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.550
 deep in the next step we will 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.020
 You have asked the computer 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.940
 factory reset 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.170
 or if he works with a backup 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.520
 I want for the computer as the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.980
 first option completely on 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.300
 Reset factory settings 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.420
 in the next step they will be now 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.740
 given a few more tips that we can 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.370
 everything is lost, all data go 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.050
 lost 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.070
 Of course we do not do that permanently 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.390
 to make fun but for example 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.530
 just a stubborn virus or one 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.700
 it is or on the 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.500
 Computer itself is no longer working then 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.760
 the man is supposed to be the data cable 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.280
 connect and so on and so forth 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.690
 and we are forewarned many times that 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.890
 Now all data is equal to change 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.430
 if we continue but we push 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.030
 continue brave okay now it works 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.130
 really going on 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.330
 we can wait a little moment 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.370
 and then it starts 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.410
 system recovery and also the 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.030
 system update and as I said that 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.140
 can really take an hour 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.170
 So there you have to go now 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.550
 take time and if that's all 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.690
 is completed drives the computer 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.590
 after a certain time by itself 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.360
 back up and then you are allowed to 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.740
 I have to re-elect Germany as 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.570
 Of course, time would be good 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.450
 German and keyboard layout in German 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.010
 selected then you can in the next 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.330
 step in a username 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.580
 for example, in the name or yours 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.300
 specify company or what or creative 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.410
 wanted a password then you can 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.970
 set and you must also 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.320
 password hint for the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.750
 In case you forget and in the next 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.650
 then you may step the recommended 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.840
 update security settings 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.310
 click on it unless you are professionals and 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.950
 knows yourselves and does something different 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.000
 So we take the first option here 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.140
 and Schwuppdiwupp then drives the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.120
 Computer also up again and then 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.250
 he is ready to die like a fresher 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.720
 he should be new computer so now 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.280
 Thank you very much for watching if 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.810
 you need more windows tips or too 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.010
 I'll take a look at my other tech tips 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.650
 Watch the channel on many
