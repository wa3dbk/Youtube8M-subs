00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.600 
ready it's honestly just frustrating
after<00:06:14.990> a<00:06:15.170> while<00:06:15.350> a<00:06:15.380> game<00:06:15.650> can<00:06:15.860> easily<00:06:16.220> go<00:06:16.430> from

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
after a while a game can easily go from

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.280 
after a while a game can easily go from
having<00:06:16.880> that<00:06:16.970> seamless<00:06:17.510> world<00:06:17.780> of<00:06:17.870> warcraft

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
having that seamless world of warcraft

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.780 
having that seamless world of warcraft
feeling<00:06:18.590> to<00:06:18.680> having<00:06:18.890> that<00:06:18.980> choppy<00:06:19.370> gross

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
feeling to having that choppy gross

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.430 
feeling to having that choppy gross
feeling<00:06:20.300> I<00:06:20.450> know<00:06:20.690> I<00:06:21.020> shouldn't<00:06:21.320> complain

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
feeling I know I shouldn't complain

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.350 
feeling I know I shouldn't complain
about<00:06:21.680> this<00:06:22.040> it's<00:06:22.310> mainly<00:06:22.520> technical<00:06:23.150> and<00:06:23.330> I

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
about this it's mainly technical and I

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.550 
about this it's mainly technical and I
don't<00:06:23.510> know<00:06:23.570> how<00:06:23.660> to<00:06:23.720> program<00:06:24.020> but<00:06:24.350> there<00:06:24.470> are

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
don't know how to program but there are

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.020 
don't know how to program but there are
so<00:06:24.740> many<00:06:24.800> games<00:06:25.100> to<00:06:25.250> get<00:06:25.340> it<00:06:25.490> right<00:06:25.700> you'd<00:06:25.910> have

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
so many games to get it right you'd have

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.640 
so many games to get it right you'd have
to<00:06:26.150> think<00:06:26.390> it's<00:06:26.510> all<00:06:26.660> just<00:06:26.840> in<00:06:26.960> good<00:06:27.200> planning

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
to think it's all just in good planning

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.710 
to think it's all just in good planning
so<00:06:28.010> yeah<00:06:28.160> as<00:06:28.370> far<00:06:28.550> as<00:06:28.610> I'm<00:06:28.850> concerned<00:06:29.300> there<00:06:29.570> is

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
so yeah as far as I'm concerned there is

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.600 
so yeah as far as I'm concerned there is
no<00:06:30.050> bigger<00:06:30.470> hit<00:06:30.770> to<00:06:30.890> a<00:06:30.920> game's<00:06:31.190> immersion

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
no bigger hit to a game's immersion

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.090 
no bigger hit to a game's immersion
factor<00:06:31.970> than<00:06:32.090> a<00:06:32.150> bunch<00:06:32.330> of<00:06:32.450> choppy<00:06:32.780> long<00:06:33.440> slow

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
factor than a bunch of choppy long slow
