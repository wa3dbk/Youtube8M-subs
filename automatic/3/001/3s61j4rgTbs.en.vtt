00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.040
 annoying this is our nature is not 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.840
 I do not want to hurt anyone or there's a 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.930
 Sunday to you 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.770
 I do not want to be hurt as it is because of me 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.060

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.100
 worlds that you can not see otherwise 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.250
 if I want to see them 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.430
 I will not look the other way 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.340
 the orange of the smiles the pink of 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.210
 sneezing the blue of tears 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.250
 the purple of the haze and the red of the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.430
 go to 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.600
 even the color of the pain I want to see them 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.000
 all on my own 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.830
 I do not want injuries that come out before 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.690
 Realize that I'm hurt 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.340
 I want to be hurt as it should be 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.340
 I'll estimate it then 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.320
 ah 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.630
 it's red 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.890
 my wounds do not heal as fast as 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.890
 yours 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.130
 because you would not use it 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.180
 never 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.160
 It is unfair 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.770
 they want to be hurt without hurting anyone 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.770
 It is unfair 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.100
 the pain of hurting someone 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.360
 not with pity but without hurting someone 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.560
 that was nothing and you can not even 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.830
 move 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.730
 ah 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.880
 this is useless I can not do it 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.870
 they can go to anyone 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.190
 I can not do it 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.190
 I can not move
