00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 you always wanted to be infinite 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.029
 to spend the compartments without much time 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.799
 then you are right here I explain 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.799
 you everything in detail after the intro 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.970
 the whole thing takes place in solitude abdi 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.189
 take place the northwest of the map 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.960
 if you have arrived there you have to 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.480
 just run straight so far 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.250
 A steep climb takes place if you 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.800
 there you go then you will be the same 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.660
 we find a huge gate in front of you 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.059
 but do not go through the gate but 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.680
 move left to the door out 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.720
 there it is partly the maker 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.610
 the only one there in the heavenly edge 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.409
 if you have to be in there then 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.460
 you talk to him and ask what you have 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.010
 to sell her 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.019
 Now I will offer you some things 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.120
 of course, look at weapons 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.710
 and on the third part we 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.330
 need and we will take them in the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.140
 third part has by far the most 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.870
 damage 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.710
 it costs 14 gold and we will get it 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.360
 buy now 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.250
 then it would have to go out again and through 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.080
 the gate we saw in the beginning 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.210
 Here we will come to a farm where 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.190
 Two people standing with bow 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.320
 Of course you have to take the front one 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.360
 because that's just how it works 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.759
 and you have to get one 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.479
 pickpocketing go and in your the 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:22.469
 Staircase, so to speak, stuck in the bag 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.170
 he would not be punished so could 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.299
 make it easy then it would have to 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.450
 rewind to eight o'clock in the evening and 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.909
 wait until all the weapons go in 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.399
 of course you have to have your weapon of hers 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.679
 has inserted the summit follow 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.810
 and then you will see you can do that 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.549
 take steel parts from him we will 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.829
 of course, and then take it 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.420
 disappear when you kill the next day 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.039
 8 o'clock again there you will notice 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.289
 that the guard at once member 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.700
 This line of trick shoots now 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.140
 is infinitely long so could 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.249
 actually as long as possible too 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.109
 collect 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:56.939
 only the problem with the whole thing is 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.740
 that it takes a long time 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.420
 If I give you a hint 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.460
 must then probably only by the arrows 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.409
 Depend on whether farmers are playing 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.389
 some days ago or something and then 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.389
 returns to solitude
