00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
there is one thing that i'm a little

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.940 
there is one thing that i'm a little
like<00:01:40.689> iffy<00:01:41.139> about<00:01:41.229> i<00:01:41.409> think<00:01:41.770> it's<00:01:41.859> the

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
like iffy about i think it's the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.399 
like iffy about i think it's the
similarity<00:01:42.609> color<00:01:42.819> between<00:01:43.029> the<00:01:43.270> grass<00:01:43.539> or

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
similarity color between the grass or

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.429 
similarity color between the grass or
the<00:01:44.529> dirt<00:01:44.709> and<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.039> water<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.600> i<00:01:46.929> think<00:01:47.289> after

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
the dirt and the water but i think after

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.349 
the dirt and the water but i think after

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
I noticed about this thai spec is that

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.220 
I noticed about this thai spec is that
there<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.560> no<00:02:39.590> Sun<00:02:40.450> not<00:02:41.450> sure<00:02:41.630> about<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.959> moon

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
there is no Sun not sure about the moon

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.130 
there is no Sun not sure about the moon
but<00:02:42.500> there<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.830> no<00:02:43.280> Sun<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:43.910> water<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.930> not

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
but there is no Sun and the water is not

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.170 
but there is no Sun and the water is not
flowing<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.680> think<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.040> has<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.190> do<00:02:46.459> with<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
flowing I think it has to do with the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.120 
flowing I think it has to do with the
fact<00:02:47.209> that<00:02:47.510> i'm<00:02:47.660> using<00:02:47.690> Optifine<00:02:48.560> i'm

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
fact that i'm using Optifine i'm

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.300 
fact that i'm using Optifine i'm
starting<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.489> notice<00:02:49.700> some<00:02:50.000> texture<00:02:50.330> packs<00:02:50.570> uh

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
starting to notice some texture packs uh

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.509 
starting to notice some texture packs uh
you<00:02:52.310> know<00:02:52.459> looking<00:02:53.450> like<00:02:54.440> still<00:02:54.920> water<00:02:55.220> and

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519
