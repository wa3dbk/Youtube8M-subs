00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
while you guys on toyota nation in

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.210 
while you guys on toyota nation in
youtube<00:00:02.750> you<00:00:03.750> all<00:00:03.899> know<00:00:04.080> i<00:00:04.110> bypassed<00:00:04.770> my

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
youtube you all know i bypassed my

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.839 
youtube you all know i bypassed my
intake<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.420> my<00:00:06.569> engine<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.230> i<00:00:07.830> also<00:00:08.490> put<00:00:08.790> a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
intake and my engine and i also put a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.080 
intake and my engine and i also put a
K&amp;N<00:00:09.059> High<00:00:09.480> airflow<00:00:09.929> air<00:00:10.170> filter<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:10.830> there<00:00:11.090> but

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
K&amp;N High airflow air filter in there but

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.169 
K&amp;N High airflow air filter in there but
just<00:00:12.360> recently<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.990> know<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.139> got<00:00:13.380> bored

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
just recently you know I got bored

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.609 
just recently you know I got bored
figured<00:00:15.179> I'd<00:00:15.299> take<00:00:15.509> out<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.839> resonator<00:00:16.320> you

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
figured I'd take out the resonator you

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.950 
figured I'd take out the resonator you
know<00:00:16.770> sounds<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.369> lot<00:00:17.490> better<00:00:17.550> without<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.060> got

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
know sounds a lot better without it got

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.650 
know sounds a lot better without it got
a<00:00:18.990> deeper<00:00:19.380> tone<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.880> bottom

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
a deeper tone this is the bottom

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.140 
a deeper tone this is the bottom
resonator<00:00:22.109> I'm<00:00:22.260> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> take<00:00:22.619> out<00:00:23.119> when<00:00:24.119> a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
resonator I'm going to take out when a

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.439 
resonator I'm going to take out when a
block<00:00:24.420> off<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> passages<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.619> top<00:00:25.859> one

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
block off the passages to the top one

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.390 
block off the passages to the top one
should<00:00:27.449> make<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.660> even<00:00:27.900> deeper<00:00:28.680> those<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
should make it even deeper those are the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.870 
should make it even deeper those are the
two<00:00:29.550> screws<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:29.970> there<00:00:30.390> were<00:00:31.610> it's<00:00:32.610> kind<00:00:32.820> of

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
two screws that there were it's kind of

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.549 
two screws that there were it's kind of
hard<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.660> know<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.840> got<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.079> take<00:00:34.380> off

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
hard to do you know you got to take off

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.580 
hard to do you know you got to take off
the<00:00:34.890> radiator<00:00:35.700> cover<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:37.110> know<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> plastic

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the radiator cover you know the plastic

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.920 
the radiator cover you know the plastic
thing<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.430> got<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.610> remove<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.239> battery<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
thing you got to remove the battery and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.860 
thing you got to remove the battery and
the<00:00:40.230> whole<00:00:40.910> front<00:00:41.910> end<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> intake<00:00:42.660> I'll

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the whole front end of the intake I'll

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.060 
the whole front end of the intake I'll
show<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.469> talking<00:00:43.500> about<00:00:46.070> like

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
show you what I'm talking about like

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.130 
show you what I'm talking about like
this<00:00:47.280> right<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.700> has<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.149> come<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.390> that

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
this right here has to come out that

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.560 
this right here has to come out that
bottom<00:00:49.590> two<00:00:50.100> right<00:00:50.370> there<00:00:50.399> come<00:00:50.910> out<00:00:51.059> battery

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
bottom two right there come out battery

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.799 
bottom two right there come out battery
does<00:00:51.809> all<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:53.180> but<00:00:54.180> if<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.390> look<00:00:54.510> under

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
does all this but if you look under

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.119 
does all this but if you look under
there<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.199> where<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> resonator<00:00:55.890> would

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
there that's where the resonator would

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.150 
there that's where the resonator would
be<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.760> no<00:00:57.180> longer<00:00:57.510> there<00:00:58.010> let<00:00:59.010> me

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
be and you know no longer there let me

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.760 
be and you know no longer there let me
start<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.789> I'll<00:01:00.030> give<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.270> little<00:01:00.420> gas

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
start it up I'll give it a little gas

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.090 
start it up I'll give it a little gas
it's<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> deeper<00:01:02.460> tone<00:01:03.739> it's<00:01:04.739> pretty<00:01:04.979> good

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it's got a deeper tone it's pretty good

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.190 
it's got a deeper tone it's pretty good
for<00:01:05.250> only<00:01:05.549> cost<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.060> about<00:01:06.299> 30<00:01:06.570> bucks<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
for only cost in about 30 bucks for the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:25.360 
for only cost in about 30 bucks for the
filter

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.760 

shut<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.490> door<00:01:26.520> I'll<00:01:26.880> show<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.440> but<00:01:28.440> you<00:01:28.560> hear

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
shut the door I'll show you but you hear

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:40.610 
shut the door I'll show you but you hear
it<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.100> car<00:01:39.020> I'll<00:01:40.020> put<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> counter

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
it in the car I'll put the counter

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.830 
it in the car I'll put the counter
outside<00:01:41.270> right<00:01:42.270> under<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.690> hood<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:45.630> might

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
outside right under the hood this might

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.030 
outside right under the hood this might
even<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.200> better<00:01:46.380> than<00:01:46.620> some<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
even be better than some of the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.770 
even be better than some of the
aftermarket<00:01:47.550> ones<00:01:47.940> because<00:01:48.210> normally

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
aftermarket ones because normally

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.719 
aftermarket ones because normally
they're<00:01:49.020> calm<00:01:49.530> focused<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.190> right<00:01:50.430> years

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
they're calm focused it's right years

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.580 
they're calm focused it's right years
