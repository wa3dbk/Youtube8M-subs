and<00:00:00.539> I<00:00:00.599> think<00:00:00.659> that's<00:00:00.960> probably<00:00:01.290> one<00:00:01.770> thing

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
and I think that's probably one thing

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.090 
and I think that's probably one thing
that<00:00:02.449> so<00:00:03.449> many<00:00:03.480> you<00:00:04.440> know<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.560> sort<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:04.830> time

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
that so many you know I sort of time

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.909 
that so many you know I sort of time
they're<00:00:05.540> interesting<00:00:06.540> too<00:00:06.750> because<00:00:06.830> it's<00:00:07.830> a

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
they're interesting too because it's a

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.610 
they're interesting too because it's a
pretty<00:00:08.069> brilliant<00:00:08.370> boy<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.690> give<00:00:09.929> be<00:00:10.530> an

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
pretty brilliant boy that you give be an

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.160 
pretty brilliant boy that you give be an
example<00:00:10.920> or<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.370> hostile<00:00:11.820> boy<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.599> manages<00:00:13.080> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
example or a hostile boy that manages to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.189 
example or a hostile boy that manages to
balance<00:00:13.549> sport<00:00:14.549> with<00:00:14.940> academic<00:00:15.509> achievements

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
balance sport with academic achievements

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.019 
balance sport with academic achievements
now<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.379> know<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.859> hostile<00:00:17.220> environments<00:00:17.820> but

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
now I know that hostile environments but

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.210 
now I know that hostile environments but
it's<00:00:18.270> gonna<00:00:18.420> be<00:00:18.539> pretty<00:00:18.720> vicious<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:20.010> very

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
it's gonna be pretty vicious and a very

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.550 
it's gonna be pretty vicious and a very
simple<00:00:20.760> manner<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.240> regard<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.900> air<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
simple manner with regard to the air the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.089 
simple manner with regard to the air the
sport<00:00:23.330> the<00:00:24.330> fact<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:25.019> will<00:00:25.590> approximate

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
sport the fact that you will approximate

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.070 
sport the fact that you will approximate
pieces<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.090> school<00:00:27.390> as<00:00:27.599> well<00:00:27.630> as

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
pieces of the school as well as

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.720 
pieces of the school as well as
testament<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:28.980> fact<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.550> either

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
testament to the fact that you either

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.139 
testament to the fact that you either
really<00:00:30.119> really<00:00:30.240> clean<00:00:30.810> up<00:00:31.009> or<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.850> really

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
really really clean up or you really

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
really really clean up or you really
really<00:00:47.780> I<00:00:48.780> think<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.140> proper<00:00:49.320> thing<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
really I think the proper thing that I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.990 
really I think the proper thing that I
wish<00:00:51.000> myself<00:00:51.360> four<00:00:51.719> millimeters<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.969> when<00:00:53.969> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
wish myself four millimeters or when I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.729 
wish myself four millimeters or when I
really<00:00:54.300> came<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.930> school<00:00:55.140> again<00:00:55.379> was

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
really came to the school again was

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.790 
really came to the school again was
working<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:57.079> that's<00:00:58.079> probably<00:00:58.289> quite<00:00:58.410> lucky

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
working out that's probably quite lucky

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.900 
working out that's probably quite lucky
that<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:01:00.000> sort<00:01:00.120> of

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.180 

in<00:01:04.910> a<00:01:05.000> hospital<00:01:05.449> situation<00:01:05.770> if<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:06.920> all<00:01:07.070> you

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
in a hospital situation if it all you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.030 
in a hospital situation if it all you
did<00:01:07.370> was<00:01:07.570> at<00:01:08.570> school<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.990> only<00:01:09.140> confidence

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
did was at school the only confidence

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.280 
did was at school the only confidence
stimulates<00:01:10.700> it<00:01:10.940> you<00:01:11.210> can<00:01:11.420> imagine<00:01:11.600> but

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:57.540 

generally<00:01:15.290> they're<00:01:15.440> better<00:01:15.680> now

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.100 

did<00:01:58.550> we<00:01:58.729> just<00:01:58.759> not<00:01:59.210> do<00:01:59.420> it<00:01:59.450> as<00:01:59.660> well<00:01:59.869> as<00:01:59.990> we

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
did we just not do it as well as we

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.230 
did we just not do it as well as we
shouldn't<00:02:00.410> have<00:02:00.500> missed<00:02:00.940> at<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:01.970> time

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
shouldn't have missed at the time

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.960 
shouldn't have missed at the time
because<00:02:02.539> they<00:02:02.690> were<00:02:03.380> watching<00:02:03.890> you<00:02:04.070> they<00:02:04.670> knew

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
because they were watching you they knew

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:59.260 
because they were watching you they knew
if<00:02:05.360> they<00:02:05.420> pounced<00:02:06.200> was<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:06.979> simple

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.490 

was<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.880> be<00:03:03.000> successful<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.780> was<00:03:03.930> never<00:03:04.170> an

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
was to be successful but it was never an

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.380 
was to be successful but it was never an
option<00:03:04.890> or<00:03:05.430> anything<00:03:05.610> like<00:03:05.820> that<00:03:05.880> and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
option or anything like that and

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.440 
option or anything like that and
absolutely<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.680> lifting<00:03:08.100> sort<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.060> time<00:03:09.300> you

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
absolutely on lifting sort of time you

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.880 
absolutely on lifting sort of time you
know<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.780> then<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.170> record<00:03:10.470> did<00:03:10.620> become<00:03:10.770> a

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
know and then the record did become a
