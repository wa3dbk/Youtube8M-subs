00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Today we are in hamburg for you 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.580
 on the way to the most successful startup 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.560
 in the history of crowdfunding and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.890
 look at their self-built servers 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.540
 on 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.429
 but also the newest, of course 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.710
 for you from the world of technology with 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.599
 car flags robots superfast 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.050
 Memory Cards User Enemy 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.520
 and his potato telephone company has indeed 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.520
 actually potato salad 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.400
 you remember our expert has 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.199
 At that time the EU complains that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 merger of o2 and e-plus 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.670
 let go and now it is 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.170
 as far as the eu says no problem 8 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.239
 billions will take over and 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.920
 so that telefonica is now the largest 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.300
 providers throughout germany and there 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.980
 you thought you can do it 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.780
 save and now catch the landline 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.059
 dsl because there is now that 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.739
 so-called fair use advantage what total 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.539
 nice and great sounds is in truth 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.250
 but again a new throttling 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.039
 offer an average 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.410
 Internet users consume only 21 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.149
 gigabyte a month that was at least before 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.120
 Two years even this study manufactures 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.010
 who now has more than 300 gb hutu 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.369
 It is consumed by his super 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.500
 fast dsl times on whole 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.869
 antediluvian 2000 kbit per second 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.310
 screwed down 300 gb 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.710
 That's about seven and a half hours 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.570
 watch daily in 4k and then you can 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.310
 then for five euros 100 gigabytes again 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.070
 buy it and then again 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.680
 two and a half hours or for 15 euros the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.680
 buy new flat so the flat for the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:34.079
 flat thank you and we really think so 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.090
 so he did not help and where we were at 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.460
 theme speed are here 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.590
 the fastest almost memory card of the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.540
 world transcend has introduced itself and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.060
 This memory card can hold up to 500 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.950
 and read 10 megabytes per second and 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.720
 with up to 370 megabytes per second 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.270
 write that's about the level 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.399
 from ssd save but compared to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.890
 compactflash memory cards that 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.409
 Triple sounds like the ideal 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.359
 memory card for 4k 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.289
 but also has its price so 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:06.740
 a cf x650 with 128 gigabytes costs 550 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.410
 euro the 256 gb version will cost you too 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.019
 but there are already three thousand euros 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.430
 years warranty and the software reworks 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.410
 to restore or data 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.330
 For free I had that too 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.489
 not yet that my memory card almost 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.230
 costs more than the camera what do you say 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.580
 really, there brings making it her 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.040
 maybe only for professionals 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.180
 just below in the comments 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.579
 interested women and parking has 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.140
 the old joke but i have to admit i 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.239
 would also like to park in car parks 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.459
 drive everything to scrap so annoying it 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.500
 Nowhere to find a parking space 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.329
 at least in düsseldorf at the airport is 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.519
 the now snow of yesterday because there 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.069
 automatic park robots do the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.319
 task just gives the car and the 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.510
 robot automatically parks the car completely 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.739
 by itself in the most sensible parking space 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.540
 for android app you can use the robot 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.829
 then order the car to pick up again 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.810
 So you do not have to do that anymore 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.579
 remind us high if we were that time 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.750
 he has no built-in ferris bühler mode 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.819
 has and independently through the city 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.440
 Christian holidays in the most successful 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.030
 kickstarter campaign of the world is coming 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.489
 for once, not from the usa 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.900
 but is almost directly next to the fag 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.120
 LED and indeed it is the hamburger 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.859
 company proton at you have 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.200
 within just three and a half hours 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.209
 get over a million euros together 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.400
 for that you build into the cloud server for the 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.840
 office and on this all only internet 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.350
 hype or is it really worth it? 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.940
 We took a close look at that 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.900
 hello i am many celebrities and me 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.480
 I would like to show a bit what 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.480
 we do where we are here so our things 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.480
 I like cola safety 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.520
 this is our office we are just now 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.670
 moved to another office because of that 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.270
 There is great chaos here in the rain but so 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.270
 work ali me 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:57.000
 pofalla and ceo christopher the other 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.960
 Purchase order software protocol will be here 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.470
 this is a team 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.430
 communication software with integrated 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.750
 file management not easy 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.470
 Together, it works like a cloud 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.590
 service but with full data sovereignty so 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.970
 What we ring the people with is one 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.580
 simplicity and independence 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.140
 whatever you want , we lie to him 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.220
 actually build all the boxes here 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.450
 everyone leaves them all 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.760
 components that exist here at Sun. 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.310
 a box so the cable pair antennas 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.410
 power supply and when he's around here 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.610
 And looking 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.700
 I hope that's how good that is 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.420
 you can see is the mesh 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.310
 cooling our proton adserver and indeed 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.960
 this is a self developed and 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.540
 the patent is active 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.160
 cooling system that gives the leads to it 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.200
 that these servers are very quiet 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.490
 no fans do not need a lot 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.990
 low power consumption 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.730
 so you can also on 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.920
 you can do without server rooms etc and you can 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.310
 Just look at the desk 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.860
 put 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.510
 the special thing about the server is he is 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.700
 totally easy to use so one 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.950
 single button the maya even one 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.620
 single button and there are so to speak 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.110
 the independence of being me 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.580
 So I have to have a cinema 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.170
 I do not have to know about servers 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.720
 no one will pay for it 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.350
 with server knows my product 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.280
 I can handle that 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.470
 just sent home with the 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.960
 post may be a small note here 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.460
 just that only one of these five pages 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.860
 big and there is in principle only in it 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.110
 put it in the power plug internet 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.540
 press the button and and you can 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.210
 It's that easy , too 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.630
 reach small url with over the server 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.790
 can 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.560
 anywhere at anytime worldwide without that 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.510
 what needs to be installed by everyone first 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.310
 terminal the cloud service only at 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.470
 full of data 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.760
 everything else we will do 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.010
 Made locally here that means 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.960
 The items are indeed from the region 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.130
 hamburg or from cologne 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.560
 we write here together we believe 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.350
 made to this local value added 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.670
 for example, own time 3d printer 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.010
 we can interact very quickly 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.460
 and very quickly then we proceed here 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.390
 now a bit hidden 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.260
 so that's nice with it's 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.880
 temperature keeps inman 90 fell to me 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.500
 assembled the small maja 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:09.320
 starts at 1,299 euro net then comes 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.430
 with 256 GB of memory when I go to the 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.430
 I would be an example of a photographer 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.020
 Now buy a larger one that will catch you 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.250
 But 2999 euros is also a stronger one 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.600
 Processor in that means I can too 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.200
 work with several people on it 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.200
 simultaneously 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:32.670
 that costs almost there are however completely 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.110
 other projects also crowdfunding 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.060
 pages how to really succeed 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.950
 and sometimes you do not want that either 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.680
 really believe that is thinking 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.360
 project that is currently at 100000 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.460
 dollar and that is a type of 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.110
 potato salad made the had 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.010
 actually a financing target of 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.210
 10 dollars 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.250
 but then the whole has for 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.890
 independent of the clever guy behind it 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.810
 hot sex shop brown and had 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.640
 This dangerously good idea meanwhile 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.100
 is to make a salad from the idea 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.990
 a huge party with everyone 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.280
 wants to be there and also if he can 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.930
 donate haye 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.400
 The campaign will continue for another two weeks 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:10.530
 you can be there so I want 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.750
 definitely give my money for it or 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.090
 we do something on our own project 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.860
 really stupid is what you something 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.150
 You could call it a crazy idea 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.100
 bring writes the time the 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.230
 make comments and maybe 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.820
 that 's it for today with the technology like 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.690
 did you like writing it down in 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.340
 the comments 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.010
 give us also like a nice 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.720
 thumbs up subscribes to this channel and 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.580
 watch the last videos and 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.650
 Of course, you also have to do the social 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.750
 Check out the media platform because there goes
