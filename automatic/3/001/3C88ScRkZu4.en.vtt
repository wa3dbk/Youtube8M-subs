an<00:00:05.460> electric<00:00:05.819> fence<00:00:05.910> post<00:00:06.180> can<00:00:06.390> be<00:00:06.480> expensive

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
an electric fence post can be expensive

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.379 
an electric fence post can be expensive
or<00:00:07.410> really<00:00:07.770> badly<00:00:08.069> made<00:00:08.400> so<00:00:09.090> if<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.240> buy<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
or really badly made so if you buy the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.299 
or really badly made so if you buy the
ones<00:00:09.630> like<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:10.050> after<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.889> few<00:00:11.040> weeks<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.280> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
ones like this after a few weeks in the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.070 
ones like this after a few weeks in the
sunlight<00:00:11.670> or<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> couple<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.240> moves<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.870> little

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
sunlight or a couple of moves the little

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.390 
sunlight or a couple of moves the little
pins<00:00:13.320> all<00:00:13.530> snap<00:00:13.799> off<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.160> they<00:00:14.219> don't<00:00:14.280> hold

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
pins all snap off and they don't hold

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.099 
pins all snap off and they don't hold
anything<00:00:14.639> anymore<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.509> buy<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.780> ones<00:00:15.960> like

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
anything anymore they buy the ones like

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.109 
anything anymore they buy the ones like
this<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:17.039> was<00:00:17.160> expensive<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.820> those<00:00:17.970> little

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
this that was expensive and those little

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.970 
this that was expensive and those little
fittings<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.690> they're<00:00:18.840> also<00:00:19.020> expensive<00:00:19.439> so

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
fittings on they're also expensive so

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.870 
fittings on they're also expensive so
you<00:00:20.010> might<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.250> spent<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.430> lot<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.580> money<00:00:20.730> if

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
you might have spent a lot of money if

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.800 
you might have spent a lot of money if
something<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.180> really<00:00:21.359> not<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.660> good<00:00:21.779> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
something is really not that good of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.259 
something is really not that good of
quality<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.350> pretty<00:00:22.590> poppy<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.820> how<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.060> do

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
quality and pretty poppy so how we do

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.790 
quality and pretty poppy so how we do
stuff<00:00:24.570> comm<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.170> decided<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> do<00:00:25.650> something

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
stuff comm we decided to do something

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.589 
stuff comm we decided to do something
metal<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.849> made<00:00:27.119> these<00:00:27.269> electric

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
metal and so we made these electric

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.570 
metal and so we made these electric
fence<00:00:27.750> posts<00:00:28.080> here<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:28.980> took<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.160> metal<00:00:29.340> rod

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
fence posts here so we took a metal rod

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.939 
fence posts here so we took a metal rod
piece<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.330> half-inch<00:00:30.539> rebar<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.140> then<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.800> put

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
piece of half-inch rebar and then we put

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.530 
piece of half-inch rebar and then we put
an<00:00:32.070> insulator<00:00:32.309> over<00:00:32.640> top<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.420> that

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
an insulator over top of it what that

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.040 
an insulator over top of it what that
insulator<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.100> simple<00:00:35.899> this<00:00:36.899> is

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
insulator is is it really simple this is

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.799 
insulator is is it really simple this is
half-inch<00:00:37.440> PVC<00:00:38.010> electrical<00:00:38.700> conduit<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
half-inch PVC electrical conduit this is

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.000 
half-inch PVC electrical conduit this is
the<00:00:39.930> gray<00:00:40.079> stuff<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> stuff<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:40.770> designed

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the gray stuff the stuff that's designed

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
the gray stuff the stuff that's designed
for<00:00:41.100> outdoors<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.180> use<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.570> regular

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
for outdoors you don't use just regular

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.910 
for outdoors you don't use just regular
half-inch<00:00:43.110> pipe<00:00:43.260> because<00:00:43.559> it'll<00:00:43.770> break<00:00:43.860> down

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
half-inch pipe because it'll break down

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.529 
half-inch pipe because it'll break down
and<00:00:44.219> something<00:00:44.340> really<00:00:44.640> bad<00:00:44.789> there's<00:00:45.390> stuff

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and something really bad there's stuff

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.940 
and something really bad there's stuff
especially<00:00:45.690> treated<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.379> that'll<00:00:46.620> last<00:00:46.739> in

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
especially treated so that'll last in

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.709 
especially treated so that'll last in
sunlight<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> won't<00:00:47.730> break<00:00:47.820> down<00:00:48.149> even

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
sunlight so it won't break down even

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990 
sunlight so it won't break down even
after<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> long<00:00:49.200> exposure<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.980> sunlight<00:00:50.190> so

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
after a long exposure to sunlight so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.979 
after a long exposure to sunlight so
notice<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.510> piece<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.690> half-inch

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
notice this is a piece of half-inch

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.990 
notice this is a piece of half-inch
3-ball<00:00:52.500> you've<00:00:53.039> got<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> four<00:00:53.399> feet<00:00:53.579> long

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
3-ball you've got a four feet long

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.250 
3-ball you've got a four feet long
you<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.329> make<00:00:54.449> them<00:00:54.570> varying<00:00:54.870> lengths<00:00:55.170> but

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
you can make them varying lengths but

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.510 
you can make them varying lengths but
this<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> good<00:00:55.649> starter<00:00:55.949> length<00:00:56.129> depending

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
this is a good starter length depending

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.410 
this is a good starter length depending
on<00:00:56.579> how<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.000> want<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> go<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
on how the if you want to go in the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.849 
on how the if you want to go in the
ground<00:00:57.570> how<00:00:57.809> hard<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.140> ground<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.710> on

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
ground how hard your ground is and so on

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.860 
ground how hard your ground is and so on
well<00:00:59.430> five<00:00:59.640> feet<00:00:59.820> using<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.210> good<00:01:00.329> average<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
well five feet using a good average and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.049 
well five feet using a good average and
this<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.829> barely<00:01:02.010> fits<00:01:02.309> over<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
this just barely fits over here it's a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.299 
this just barely fits over here it's a
little<00:01:03.090> bit<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.420> clearance<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:05.010> I've<00:01:05.129> cut

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
little bit of clearance so I've cut

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010 
little bit of clearance so I've cut
these<00:01:05.400> pieces<00:01:05.580> six<00:01:05.939> inches<00:01:06.180> long<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.960> you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
these pieces six inches long and you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.469 
these pieces six inches long and you
notice<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.500> slide<00:01:07.680> over<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.189> so

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
notice they just slide over here like so

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.280 
notice they just slide over here like so
what<00:01:09.479> we're<00:01:09.570> gonna<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.930> gonna<00:01:10.049> put<00:01:10.200> some

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
what we're gonna do is gonna put some

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.020 
what we're gonna do is gonna put some
polyurethane<00:01:10.920> or<00:01:11.040> silicone<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.610> here

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
polyurethane or silicone on here

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.670 
polyurethane or silicone on here
and<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:12.450> shove<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.780> down<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.140> top<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and then shove this down on top of it to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.140 
and then shove this down on top of it to
whatever<00:01:13.830> height<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.250> want<00:01:14.430> them<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.700> then

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
whatever height we want them and then

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.700 
whatever height we want them and then
we'll<00:01:15.450> glue<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.750> place<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.619> we'll

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
we'll glue it in place and then we'll

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.200 
we'll glue it in place and then we'll
wrap<00:01:16.860> our<00:01:17.040> electrical<00:01:17.430> wire<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:17.790> tape<00:01:17.970> around

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
wrap our electrical wire or tape around

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.840 
wrap our electrical wire or tape around
here<00:01:18.479> oh<00:01:18.619> okay<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.860> polyurethane<00:01:20.520> this

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
here oh okay this is polyurethane this

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.749 
here oh okay this is polyurethane this
is<00:01:21.000> roofing<00:01:21.270> sealant<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.369> hard

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
is roofing sealant and it's kind of hard

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.429 
is roofing sealant and it's kind of hard
to<00:01:23.880> work<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:24.990> stubborn<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> get

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
to work with it's very stubborn to get

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.350 
to work with it's very stubborn to get
out<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> tomb<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:27.060> sticks<00:01:27.270> on

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
out of the tomb and it sticks on

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.819 
out of the tomb and it sticks on
everything<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.780> sticks<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.799> on

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
everything it sticks to so if you get on

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.020 
everything it sticks to so if you get on
your<00:01:29.040> hands<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.460> really<00:01:29.640> hard<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
your hands and be really hard to get it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.999 
your hands and be really hard to get it
off<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.930> once<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.200> sticks<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.500> something<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
off but once it sticks on something it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.830 
off but once it sticks on something it
really<00:01:32.070> goes<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.610> well<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.150> as<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.570> put<00:01:33.750> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
really goes on well so as you put it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.789 
really goes on well so as you put it
down<00:01:33.900> over<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.439> pushed<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.740> little

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
down over here you just pushed a little

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.969 
down over here you just pushed a little
bit<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.119> gets<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.470> firmly<00:01:37.470> around<00:01:37.740> there

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
bit so it gets it firmly around there

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.050 
bit so it gets it firmly around there
and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:40.290> what<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> wanted<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:41.060> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and then get what you wanted to be and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.730 
and then get what you wanted to be and
leave<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.229> don't<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.500> put<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
leave it and you don't have to put the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.889 
leave it and you don't have to put the
bottom<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:45.329> bottom<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.720> will<00:01:45.840> be

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
bottom in because just bottom in will be

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.210 
bottom in because just bottom in will be
enough<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> hold<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.500> whole<00:01:46.619> thing<00:01:46.799> firmly

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
enough to hold this whole thing firmly

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.539 
enough to hold this whole thing firmly
forever<00:01:47.610> probably<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.310> slide

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
forever probably so now you just slide

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.910 
forever probably so now you just slide
another<00:01:50.759> one<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:50.970> down<00:01:51.149> here

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
another one on down here

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.289 
another one on down here
decide<00:01:52.920> where<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.159> want<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
decide where you want it to be so you

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.880 
decide where you want it to be so you
want<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.600> about<00:01:54.689> there<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.530> another<00:01:55.649> pile

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
want to be about there but another pile

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.350 
want to be about there but another pile
of<00:01:55.920> glue<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.189> or<00:01:56.520> twist<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.820> down<00:01:56.939> over<00:01:57.119> it

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
of glue here or twist it down over it

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.149 
of glue here or twist it down over it
about<00:01:57.570> an<00:01:57.659> inch<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:57.960> over<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.560> glue<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
about an inch or so over the glue and

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.319 
about an inch or so over the glue and
leave<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> good<00:01:59.520> pile<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.909> bottom<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.240> I

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
leave a good pile on the bottom like I

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.359 
leave a good pile on the bottom like I
did<00:02:00.479> over<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:01.500> way<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.680> won't<00:02:01.829> move<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
did over here that way it won't move and

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.980 
did over here that way it won't move and
then<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.060> let<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.299> go<00:02:03.450> set<00:02:03.750> up<00:02:03.869> good

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
then you let this go set up good

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.959 
then you let this go set up good
overnight<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.619> then<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.340> drive<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.700> into

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
overnight and then you drive this into

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.540 
overnight and then you drive this into
the<00:02:06.030> ground<00:02:06.270> I'm<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> show<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> minute

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
the ground I'm going to show in a minute

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.190 
the ground I'm going to show in a minute
you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.670> put<00:02:08.789> up<00:02:08.910> three<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.599> these<00:02:09.840> without

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
you can put up three on these without

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.300 
you can put up three on these without
having<00:02:10.349> much<00:02:10.619> trouble<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.129> you're<00:02:11.220> going

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
having much trouble but if you're going

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.680 
having much trouble but if you're going
to<00:02:11.370> use<00:02:11.520> three<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:12.180> probably<00:02:12.420> simpler<00:02:12.629> just

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
to use three it's probably simpler just

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.840 
to use three it's probably simpler just
to<00:02:12.840> use<00:02:12.989> one

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
to use one

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.010 
to use one
because<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.300> stick<00:02:14.480> will<00:02:14.570> slide<00:02:14.750> all<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.930> way

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
because the stick will slide all the way

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.900 
because the stick will slide all the way
down<00:02:15.170> over<00:02:15.200> there<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.740> just<00:02:16.280> cut<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.730> off<00:02:16.790> at

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
down over there and just cut it off at

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.100 
down over there and just cut it off at
ground<00:02:17.120> level<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.630> that'll<00:02:17.960> be<00:02:18.020> your

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
ground level and that'll be your

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.810 
ground level and that'll be your
insulator<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.040> drive<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.490> ground<00:02:19.670> you

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
insulator so to drive in the ground you

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.100 
insulator so to drive in the ground you
can<00:02:19.850> either<00:02:20.030> use<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.180> regular<00:02:20.420> tee<00:02:20.660> post<00:02:20.870> driver

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
can either use a regular tee post driver

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.660 
can either use a regular tee post driver
just<00:02:21.710> drop<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.010> right<00:02:22.040> over<00:02:22.310> top<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.580> whole

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
just drop it right over top the whole

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.350 
just drop it right over top the whole
thing<00:02:22.910> or<00:02:23.420> just<00:02:23.660> use<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.930> sledgehammer<00:02:25.360> you

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
thing or just use a sledgehammer you

thing or just use a sledgehammer you
want<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.570> wear<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.690> glove<00:02:26.870> with<00:02:26.990> your<00:02:27.140> hand<00:02:27.380> if

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
want to wear a glove with your hand if

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.720 
want to wear a glove with your hand if
you're<00:02:27.620> not<00:02:27.650> using<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.040> claw<00:02:28.250> hammer<00:02:28.280> with

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
you're not using a claw hammer with

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.790 
you're not using a claw hammer with
because<00:02:29.090> if<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.330> don't<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:30.200> vibrations<00:02:30.740> from

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
because if you don't the vibrations from

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.080 
because if you don't the vibrations from
the<00:02:30.920> bar<00:02:31.160> will<00:02:31.400> kind<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.640> be<00:02:31.730> hard<00:02:31.910> on<00:02:31.970> your

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
the bar will kind of be hard on your

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.650 
the bar will kind of be hard on your
hands

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660

like<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.960> glove<00:02:36.140> will<00:02:36.320> help<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.500> little

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
like this the glove will help a little

not<00:02:37.700> enough<00:02:37.910> pestis<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.390> avoid<00:02:38.570> doing<00:02:38.720> that

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
not enough pestis to avoid doing that

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.870 
not enough pestis to avoid doing that
and<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.250> course<00:02:40.430> we'd<00:02:40.580> want<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.760> wait

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
and of course we'd want to wait

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.920 
and of course we'd want to wait
overnight<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.240> do<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:41.570> this<00:02:41.660> looking

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
overnight to do this so this looking

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.970 
overnight to do this so this looking
hard<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.230> good<00:02:42.320> I'm<00:02:42.440> just<00:02:42.530> going<00:02:42.710> ahead<00:02:42.770> and

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
hard and good I'm just going ahead and

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.080 
hard and good I'm just going ahead and
hurried<00:02:43.220> through<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.460> so<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.640> can<00:02:43.790> film<00:02:44.000> this

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
hurried through it so I can film this

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.690 
hurried through it so I can film this
right<00:02:44.270> now<00:02:44.620> now<00:02:45.620> once<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.220> got<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.640> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
right now now once you got it in the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.460 
right now now once you got it in the
ground<00:02:46.820> about<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.120> foot<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:48.230> we're<00:02:48.380> gonna

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
ground about a foot and we're gonna

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.260 
ground about a foot and we're gonna
start<00:02:48.680> wrapping<00:02:48.770> our<00:02:49.010> wire<00:02:49.160> around<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.520> so

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
start wrapping our wire around it so

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.370 
start wrapping our wire around it so
ordinarily<00:02:50.600> I'd<00:02:50.750> have<00:02:50.900> one<00:02:51.080> of<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.230> end<00:02:51.320> of

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
ordinarily I'd have one of the end of

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.780 
ordinarily I'd have one of the end of
this<00:02:51.470> wrapped<00:02:51.860> up<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.100> around<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.400> post<00:02:52.580> already

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
this wrapped up to around a post already

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.520 
this wrapped up to around a post already
of<00:02:53.030> course<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:53.630> then<00:02:54.110> I'm<00:02:54.170> going<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.320> take<00:02:54.470> it

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
of course and then I'm going to take it

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:02.080 
of course and then I'm going to take it
around<00:02:54.680> here<00:02:54.890> wrap<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:55.940> around<00:02:56.030> twice<00:03:01.090> make

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
around here wrap it around twice make

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.610 
around here wrap it around twice make
sure<00:03:02.210> it<00:03:02.330> laps<00:03:02.540> down<00:03:02.750> over<00:03:03.080> itself<00:03:03.320> like<00:03:03.590> that

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
sure it laps down over itself like that

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.650 
sure it laps down over itself like that
so<00:03:04.070> it'll<00:03:04.220> hold<00:03:04.340> tight<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.300> is<00:03:05.450> held

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
so it'll hold tight and this is held

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.970 
so it'll hold tight and this is held
tight<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.110> other<00:03:06.230> fence<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:06.680> will<00:03:06.860> not

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
tight on the other fence this will not

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.320 
tight on the other fence this will not
be<00:03:07.070> very<00:03:07.250> easy<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.490> move<00:03:07.640> up<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.850> down<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.090> even

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
be very easy to move up and down it even

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.440 
be very easy to move up and down it even
possible<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.470> we<00:03:09.560> wrap<00:03:09.680> around<00:03:09.710> like<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:10.450> now

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
possible so we wrap around like that now

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.970 
possible so we wrap around like that now
this<00:03:11.570> is<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.750> concrete<00:03:11.960> tie<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.740> can<00:03:12.800> get<00:03:12.920> these

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
this is a concrete tie you can get these

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.440 
this is a concrete tie you can get these
anywhere<00:03:13.100> concrete<00:03:13.640> supplies<00:03:13.910> are<00:03:14.060> sold<00:03:14.300> they

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
anywhere concrete supplies are sold they

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.090 
anywhere concrete supplies are sold they
use<00:03:14.600> for<00:03:14.750> tying<00:03:14.930> rebar<00:03:15.230> together<00:03:15.530> -<00:03:15.710> fencing

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
use for tying rebar together - fencing

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.350 
use for tying rebar together - fencing
and<00:03:16.220> things<00:03:16.340> like<00:03:16.430> that<00:03:16.490> in<00:03:16.760> concrete<00:03:17.060> pads

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
and things like that in concrete pads

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.360 
and things like that in concrete pads
and<00:03:17.690> also<00:03:18.170> on<00:03:18.290> road<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.709> if<00:03:18.770> Isis<00:03:19.040> like<00:03:19.130> that

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
and also on road and if Isis like that

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.210 
and also on road and if Isis like that
so<00:03:20.000> take<00:03:20.180> these<00:03:20.500> then<00:03:21.500> run<00:03:21.650> around<00:03:21.920> here<00:03:22.190> oh

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
so take these then run around here oh

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.130 
so take these then run around here oh
you<00:03:22.760> want<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:22.940> go<00:03:23.000> under<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.300> on<00:03:23.390> one<00:03:23.570> side<00:03:23.780> and

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
you want to go under it on one side and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.500 
you want to go under it on one side and
over<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.590> on<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.770> other<00:03:24.860> side<00:03:25.240> then<00:03:26.240> bring<00:03:26.420> it

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
over it on the other side then bring it

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.810 
over it on the other side then bring it
back<00:03:26.630> around<00:03:27.010> hook<00:03:28.010> your<00:03:28.160> pigtail<00:03:28.550> tool

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
back around hook your pigtail tool

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.220 
back around hook your pigtail tool
through<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:32.180> then<00:03:32.660> just<00:03:32.840> twist<00:03:33.110> around

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
through it and then just twist around

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.850 
through it and then just twist around
like<00:03:33.470> that

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.140 

let<00:03:36.860> me<00:03:36.950> just<00:03:37.070> Kristen<00:03:37.370> around<00:03:37.550> like<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:37.910> so

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
let me just Kristen around like that so

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.730 
let me just Kristen around like that so
no<00:03:38.270> one's<00:03:38.390> gonna<00:03:38.480> run<00:03:38.660> into<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:38.990> just<00:03:39.140> having

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
no one's gonna run into it just having

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.530 
no one's gonna run into it just having
it<00:03:39.800> sticking<00:03:40.040> out<00:03:40.130> there<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.640> then<00:03:41.209> this<00:03:41.360> is

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
it sticking out there and then this is

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.120 
it sticking out there and then this is
tied<00:03:41.720> onto<00:03:41.930> something<00:03:42.260> like<00:03:42.380> that<00:03:42.620> it'll<00:03:43.040> be

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
tied onto something like that it'll be

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.260 
tied onto something like that it'll be
very<00:03:43.160> hard<00:03:43.520> to<00:03:43.640> move<00:03:43.760> this<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.090> shouldn't

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
very hard to move this you shouldn't

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.730 
very hard to move this you shouldn't
even<00:03:44.450> move<00:03:44.600> it<00:03:44.690> all<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:45.320> will<00:03:45.470> be<00:03:45.530> really

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
even move it all this will be really

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.860 
even move it all this will be really
tight<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.520> that'll<00:03:46.820> hold<00:03:47.090> your<00:03:47.300> tape<00:03:47.690> in<00:03:47.840> that

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
tight so that'll hold your tape in that

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.330 
tight so that'll hold your tape in that
position<00:03:48.050> as<00:03:48.470> long<00:03:48.590> as<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:48.800> want<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.040> be<00:03:49.160> there

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
position as long as you want to be there

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.760 
position as long as you want to be there
and<00:03:49.580> then<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.360> can<00:03:50.480> pick<00:03:50.840> up<00:03:50.959> this<00:03:51.140> take<00:03:51.380> pull

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
and then you can pick up this take pull

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.890 
and then you can pick up this take pull
this<00:03:51.920> part<00:03:52.280> out<00:03:52.400> pull<00:03:53.240> that<00:03:53.360> up<00:03:53.420> drive<00:03:53.780> it

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
this part out pull that up drive it

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.150 
this part out pull that up drive it
someplace<00:03:54.050> else<00:03:54.350> right<00:03:54.530> back<00:03:54.800> down<00:03:54.950> over

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
someplace else right back down over

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.100 
someplace else right back down over
that's<00:03:55.970> all<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.150> need<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.330> do<00:03:56.420> then<00:03:56.990> you<00:03:57.050> can

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
that's all you need to do then you can

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.930 
that's all you need to do then you can
run<00:03:57.290> two<00:03:57.800> three<00:03:58.100> five<00:03:58.340> strands<00:03:58.760> on<00:03:58.850> this

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
run two three five strands on this

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.180 
run two three five strands on this
however<00:03:59.090> many<00:03:59.330> you<00:03:59.420> want<00:03:59.650> so<00:04:00.650> sometimes<00:04:01.040> the

however many you want so sometimes the
end<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:01.459> your<00:04:01.550> run<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.850> electric<00:04:02.150> fence<00:04:02.330> you're

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
end of your run of electric fence you're

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.670 
end of your run of electric fence you're
gonna<00:04:02.540> have<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.720> post<00:04:02.900> like<00:04:03.110> this<00:04:03.320> and<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.560> can

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
gonna have a post like this and you can

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.740 
gonna have a post like this and you can
tie<00:04:03.800> to<00:04:03.860> that<00:04:04.100> and<00:04:04.310> that'll<00:04:04.730> walk<00:04:04.850> fine<00:04:05.090> but

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
tie to that and that'll walk fine but

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.880 
tie to that and that'll walk fine but
most<00:04:05.959> of<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.140> time<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.410> can<00:04:06.530> have<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.680> tree

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
most of the time you can have a tree

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.260 
most of the time you can have a tree
there<00:04:07.100> or<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.430> can<00:04:07.520> have<00:04:07.730> another<00:04:08.030> type<00:04:08.240> of

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
there or you can have another type of

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.850 
there or you can have another type of
fence<00:04:08.540> there<00:04:08.750> that's<00:04:08.930> grounded<00:04:09.320> or<00:04:09.530> something

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
fence there that's grounded or something

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
fence there that's grounded or something
that's<00:04:09.980> not<00:04:10.100> insulated<00:04:10.459> that<00:04:10.640> you<00:04:10.700> can't

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
that's not insulated that you can't

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.729 
that's not insulated that you can't
ordinarily<00:04:11.300> tie<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.570> so<00:04:12.290> what<00:04:12.410> we<00:04:12.470> do<00:04:12.560> is<00:04:12.650> we

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
ordinarily tie to so what we do is we

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.229 
ordinarily tie to so what we do is we
take<00:04:12.830> a<00:04:12.890> piece<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.070> nylon<00:04:13.250> rope<00:04:13.610> quarter-inch

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
take a piece of nylon rope quarter-inch

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:14.890 
take a piece of nylon rope quarter-inch
works<00:04:14.420> fine

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
works fine

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.080 
works fine
wrap<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:15.440> around<00:04:15.470> here<00:04:15.800> and<00:04:16.220> then<00:04:16.340> tie<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:16.549> to

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
wrap it around here and then tie this to

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.430 
wrap it around here and then tie this to
that<00:04:17.270> and<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.690> makes<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.900> great<00:04:18.080> insulator

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
that and that makes a great insulator

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.890 
that and that makes a great insulator
across<00:04:18.739> nothing<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:19.880> do<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.030> make<00:04:20.840> a

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
across nothing so to do that make a

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.170 
across nothing so to do that make a
simple<00:04:21.169> knot<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.560> like<00:04:21.830> this<00:04:21.979> one<00:04:22.190> take<00:04:23.000> both

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
simple knot I like this one take both

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.180 
simple knot I like this one take both
