00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
notice that my springboard icons look

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.650 
notice that my springboard icons look
completely<00:00:17.190> different<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.940> they<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.180> more

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
completely different and they have more

completely different and they have more
rows<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.260> columns<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.130> that's<00:00:20.340> not<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.850> only

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
rows and columns but that's not the only

rows and columns but that's not the only
thing<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.810> tweak<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.470> let's<00:00:22.830> go

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
thing that this tweak can do let's go

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.710 
thing that this tweak can do let's go
ahead<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.220> check<00:00:23.369> out<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.820> settings<00:00:24.240> now

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
ahead and check out the settings now

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.540 
ahead and check out the settings now
right<00:00:24.930> here<00:00:25.170> within<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.619> custom<00:00:26.039> grid<00:00:26.279> to

right here within the custom grid to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.759 
right here within the custom grid to
settings<00:00:27.000> there's<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> ton<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.869> things<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.650> we

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
settings there's a ton of things that we

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.189 
settings there's a ton of things that we
can<00:00:28.949> adjust<00:00:29.310> not<00:00:29.970> only<00:00:30.000> springboard<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.109> we

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
can adjust not only springboard but we

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.410 
can adjust not only springboard but we
can<00:00:31.349> also<00:00:31.500> do<00:00:31.800> folders<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.120> dock

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
can also do folders we can do the dock

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.020 
can also do folders we can do the dock
and<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.140> also<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.100> switcher<00:00:35.579> now

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and we can also do the switcher now

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.000 
and we can also do the switcher now
there's<00:00:36.210> also<00:00:36.390> minor<00:00:36.870> things<00:00:37.260> like<00:00:37.410> hive<00:00:37.829> your

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
there's also minor things like hive your

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.639 
there's also minor things like hive your
page<00:00:38.219> dots<00:00:38.579> or<00:00:38.879> hide<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.329> icon<00:00:39.960> labels<00:00:40.410> so

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
page dots or hide the icon labels so

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.619 
page dots or hide the icon labels so
they<00:00:40.770> don't<00:00:41.040> all<00:00:41.250> get<00:00:41.430> mixed<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.120> you

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
they don't all get mixed up as you

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.420 
they don't all get mixed up as you
notice<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.110> my<00:00:43.260> springboard<00:00:43.620> right<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
notice in my springboard right here you

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.880 
notice in my springboard right here you
can<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.300> icons<00:00:45.899> overlap<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
can see that the icons overlap the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
can see that the icons overlap the
labels<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.610> turning<00:00:47.910> off<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.149> labels<00:00:48.660> could

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
labels so turning off the labels could

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350 
labels so turning off the labels could
be<00:00:49.320> something<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.950> may<00:00:50.160> want<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:50.789> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
be something that you may want to do so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.000 
be something that you may want to do so
right<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.930> within<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.379> springboard<00:00:52.890> just

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
right here within the springboard just

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.799 
right here within the springboard just
the<00:00:53.399> springboard<00:00:53.820> settings<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.570> go<00:00:54.719> ahead

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the springboard settings we can go ahead

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.410 
the springboard settings we can go ahead
and<00:00:54.930> adjust<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> rows<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.280> columns<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:57.270> can

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and adjust the rows the columns we can

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
and adjust the rows the columns we can
adjust<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> horizontal<00:00:58.190> spacing<00:00:59.190> which<00:00:59.399> will

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
adjust the horizontal spacing which will

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.420 
adjust the horizontal spacing which will
be<00:00:59.760> default<00:01:00.539> spacing<00:01:01.109> edge<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.590> edge<00:01:01.739> evenly

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
be default spacing edge to edge evenly

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.000 
be default spacing edge to edge evenly
spaced<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.149> together<00:01:03.570> sing<00:01:04.260> goes<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:04.890> the

spaced or together sing goes for the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.039 
spaced or together sing goes for the
vertical<00:01:05.400> spacing<00:01:05.880> over<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.299> default<00:01:06.840> edge

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
vertical spacing over here default edge

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.310 
vertical spacing over here default edge
to<00:01:07.290> edge<00:01:07.439> evenly<00:01:08.220> spaced<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.850> together<00:01:09.540> now

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
to edge evenly spaced and together now

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.679 
to edge evenly spaced and together now
we<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.590> also<00:01:10.799> invert<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.610> landscape<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.540> if

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
we can also invert for landscape and if

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.240 
we can also invert for landscape and if
we<00:01:12.810> go<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> folder<00:01:13.380> settings<00:01:13.799> will<00:01:14.100> have

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
we go to the folder settings will have

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.859 
we go to the folder settings will have
similar<00:01:14.640> settings<00:01:14.939> since<00:01:15.299> they're<00:01:15.540> basically

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
similar settings since they're basically

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.440 
similar settings since they're basically
hologrid<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> rose<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.030> columns

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
hologrid you have the rose the columns

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.660 
hologrid you have the rose the columns
the<00:01:18.689> spacing<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> hide<00:01:19.890> labels<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the spacing you have the hide labels and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.600 
the spacing you have the hide labels and
also<00:01:21.210> hide<00:01:21.540> folder<00:01:22.080> icon<00:01:22.560> label<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.520> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
also hide folder icon label so if you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.020 
also hide folder icon label so if you
want<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.650> folders<00:01:26.369> so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
want to do to do that on your folders so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.969 
want to do to do that on your folders so
over<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.689> also<00:01:27.900> change<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> dock

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
over here we can also change up the dock

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.890 
over here we can also change up the dock
where<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.579> add<00:01:29.759> columns<00:01:30.360> we<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.750> add

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
where we can add columns we can add

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.929 
where we can add columns we can add
spacing<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.040> make<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> doc<00:01:32.549> look<00:01:32.820> a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
spacing so we can make the doc look a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.520 
spacing so we can make the doc look a
little<00:01:33.119> bit<00:01:33.299> different<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.110> go<00:01:34.350> ahead<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
little bit different if we go ahead and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830 
little bit different if we go ahead and
enable<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:35.729> go<00:01:36.030> ahead<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.600> add

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
enable this and we go ahead and add

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.920 
enable this and we go ahead and add
let's<00:01:37.409> say<00:01:37.799> seven<00:01:38.579> columns<00:01:39.030> which<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> lot

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
let's say seven columns which is a lot
