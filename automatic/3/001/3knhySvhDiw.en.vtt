 accommodation such complaints testifies 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 about periodontal disease which 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.570
 put it suffers 98 percent

 adults and 80 percent of children 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.000
 in medical language, periodontal is 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.100
 complex of tissue that holds za to 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.110
 it refers to alveolar bone tissue 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.020
 root cement connective tissue 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.180
 fiber and sell it infectious 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.150
 disease that causes inflammation 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.640
 vise due to the abundance of giving birth trained 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.530
 food sugar general decline in ecology this 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.630
 not only quite common but 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.370
 Despite this, not every clinic can 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.159
 conduct a comprehensive treatment of this 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.930
 diseases in our clinic doctor 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.210
 serious about treating this 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.130
 problems because the stalk is not only 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.010
 aesthetic problems such as 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.560
 tooth loss and unpleasant smell but 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.420
 and also it can lead to development 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.700
 very unpleasant total somatic 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.770
 pathologies such as the earlier fact of myocardium 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.990
 may be causing septic 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.510
 endocarditis can cause birth 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.390
 first children with body mass deficiency if 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.130
 pregnant woman suffers from it 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.780
 or him and can also lead to 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.409
 permanent immunity reduction 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.360
 besides pathogenic bacteria which 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.380
 is in plaque can cause 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.670
 to gastrointestinal diseases 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.140
 tract 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.789
 most people don't count 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.220
 bleeding gums and bad smell 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.540
 from the mouth to serious diseases therefore 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.760
 do not come for timely treatment 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.920
 this disease although in fact 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.670
 this can lead to serious 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.100
 complication of internal diseases 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.880
 organs such as cardiovascular 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.890
 systems and kidneys despite that 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.510
 the spread of the disease is not all 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.310
 clinics have the ability to provide 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.010
 qualified seller magic 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.410
 full assistance in our clinic 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.660
 there are all conditions for complex 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.280
 treating this problem in our 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.830
 there is a modern 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.730
 equipment for diagnosis and treatment 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.920
 periodontitis 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.190
 all of our doctors own modern 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.570
 technologies allowing to approach 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.730
 treatment of oral diseases 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.800
 complex and protan long in our 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.650
 the clinic involved is attracted to practically 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.450
 for each patient it allows to eliminate 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.150
 like local horns logical 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.920
 problems and generalized that 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.579
 may affect the ability to deliver 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.470
 implants and shorten the life 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.910
 orthopedic treatment 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.930
 periodontitis mild to moderate 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.390
 gravity 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.519
 we apply the vector apparatus using 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.230
 which can be carried out simultaneously 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.570
 closed curettage is a walk 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.390
 periodontal pockets this procedure 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.190
 can be carried out as in aggravation 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.650
 diseases as well as 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.770
 prophylaxis also for treatment 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.990
 product diseases we used 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.210
 she's laser technology and using 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.670
 laser last generation from lead 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.220
 global manufacturer using laser 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.630
 can be sterilized 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.170
 periodontal pockets and in doing so we 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.640
 We are achieving a very stable mission diode 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.440
 laser can be used for 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.770
 surgical treatment of disease 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.230
 periodontal treatment will be less 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.040
 painful and regeneration process 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.040
 will go much faster 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.960
 heavy drug titi 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.790
 when there is significant u at bone 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.050
 fabric must be used 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.150
 surgery 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.400
 aimed at increasing bone volume 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.670
 for this we use modern 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.350
 techniques directed bone regeneration 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.610
 including use and mallow 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.380
 matrix complex 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.450
 which allows you to achieve not only 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.760
 increase in bone tissue 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.880
 but also stimulates ligamentous growth 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.700
 apparatus it allows us to achieve 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.010
 good long-term results drawing 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.560
 almost 20 years experience their work and 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.540
 dynamic observation of patients i can with 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.790
 confidence to say that periodontitis is 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.220
 no sentence for teeth timely

 contacting a doctor correct diagnosis 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.540
 use of modern technology 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.490
 allows not only to prolong live 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.240
 our teeth we create the conditions for 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.920
 other treatments

 deposition of tartar pronounced 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.840
 movable teeth pain when chewing brushing 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.550
 increased sensitivity to chemical 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.380
 temperature stimuli are not 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.200
 self-medicate
