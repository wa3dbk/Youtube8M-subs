the description ok so the most common
mistake<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.900> see<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.320> people<00:00:22.680> who<00:00:23.490> are<00:00:23.519> hopping

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
mistake I see is people who are hopping

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.640 
mistake I see is people who are hopping
on<00:00:24.119> two<00:00:24.330> hands<00:00:24.570> right<00:00:24.810> working<00:00:25.320> their<00:00:25.470> way<00:00:25.500> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
on two hands right working their way to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.830 
on two hands right working their way to
hopping<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.760> you're<00:00:27.330> not<00:00:27.570> being<00:00:27.750> on

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
hopping on just one you're not being on

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230 
hopping on just one you're not being on
two<00:00:28.080> hands<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.680> then<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.160> shift<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.609> one<00:00:29.910> hand

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
two hands and then you shift to one hand

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.790 
two hands and then you shift to one hand
this<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.750> where<00:00:30.990> everything<00:00:31.230> goes<00:00:31.529> south

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
this is where everything goes south

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.490 
this is where everything goes south
right<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.520> what<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.630> when<00:00:34.350> you're

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
right and what it is is when you're

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.410 
right and what it is is when you're
hopping<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:35.010> two<00:00:35.219> hands<00:00:35.489> think<00:00:35.880> about<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
hopping on two hands think about the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.119 
hopping on two hands think about the
center<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.930> balance<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.770> straight

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
center of balance is going straight

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.830 
center of balance is going straight
through<00:00:38.550> your<00:00:38.640> head<00:00:38.820> down<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> ground<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
through your head down to the ground the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.229 
through your head down to the ground the
force<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.410> going<00:00:40.530> an<00:00:40.829> angle<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.670> way<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.149> at

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
force is going an angle this way and at

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.450 
force is going an angle this way and at
an<00:00:42.360> angle<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.840> way<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.890> center<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
an angle this way and the center is

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.459 
an angle this way and the center is
right<00:00:45.030> down<00:00:45.239> your<00:00:45.450> head<00:00:45.600> now<00:00:45.989> when<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.289> go<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
right down your head now when you go to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.590 
right down your head now when you go to
one<00:00:46.739> hand<00:00:47.070> ideally<00:00:47.850> what<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.120> want<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.420> do

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
one hand ideally what you want to do

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.529 
one hand ideally what you want to do
because<00:00:48.870> you're<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.800> from<00:00:49.920> two<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:51.360> just

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
because you're going from two to just

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.160 
because you're going from two to just
one<00:00:52.160> you<00:00:53.160> want<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.550> center<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.090> balance<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> go

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
one you want the center of balance to go

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.680 
one you want the center of balance to go
right<00:00:55.559> directly<00:00:55.949> down<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:56.699> arm<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.270> needs<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
right directly down your arm it needs to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.389 
right directly down your arm it needs to
be<00:00:57.809> right<00:00:58.109> over<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.620> arms<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> stay

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
be right over your arms so you stay

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.430 
be right over your arms so you stay
balanced<00:00:59.850> that's<00:01:00.239> ideally<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
balanced that's ideally but what the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.619 
balanced that's ideally but what the
problem<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.340> when<00:01:02.789> people<00:01:02.940> jump<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> one

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
problem is is when people jump to one

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.590 
problem is is when people jump to one
hand<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.710> keep<00:01:04.949> everything<00:01:05.159> very<00:01:05.729> similar

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
hand they keep everything very similar

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390 
hand they keep everything very similar
to<00:01:06.810> when<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.049> headed<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.470> two<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
to when they headed to two so all of a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.890 
to when they headed to two so all of a
sudden<00:01:08.670> they're<00:01:08.760> senator<00:01:09.060> bends<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.510> still

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
sudden they're senator bends is still

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.890 
sudden they're senator bends is still
going<00:01:10.680> down<00:01:10.799> their<00:01:11.040> head<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:12.000> causes

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
going down their head and this causes

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.350 
going down their head and this causes
them<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> fall<00:01:13.590> okay<00:01:14.310> or<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:14.850> won't

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
them to fall okay or it just won't

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.270 
them to fall okay or it just won't
totally<00:01:15.810> throws<00:01:16.200> them<00:01:16.409> off<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.979> let<00:01:17.220> me

yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah and notice how my
center<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.880> balance<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.329> directly<00:01:36.720> over<00:01:37.110> my

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
center of balance is directly over my

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.770 
center of balance is directly over my
head<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.579> want<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> hop<00:01:38.970> from<00:01:39.180> two

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
head now when I want to hop from two

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
head now when I want to hop from two
hands<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.439> hand<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.460> problem<00:01:41.909> will<00:01:42.060> arise

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
hands to one hand the problem will arise

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.510 
hands to one hand the problem will arise
if<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.990> keep<00:01:43.229> my<00:01:43.380> center<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.710> balance<00:01:43.770> over<00:01:44.399> my

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
if I keep my center of balance over my

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.670 
if I keep my center of balance over my
head<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.930> see<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
head so if I go like this you see that

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.420 
head so if I go like this you see that
boom<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:48.600> immediately<00:01:49.200> pulls<00:01:49.500> me<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> side

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
boom it immediately pulls me to the side

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.969 
boom it immediately pulls me to the side
because<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.270> let<00:01:51.600> go<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.020> arm<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.680> kept

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
because I let go of this arm and I kept

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.340 
because I let go of this arm and I kept
that<00:01:53.159> Center<00:01:53.549> over<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:53.970> head<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
that Center over that head so that's the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.090 
that Center over that head so that's the
problem<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:56.280> shifting<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.479> center<00:01:58.100> to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
problem not shifting the center to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.310 
problem not shifting the center to
directly<00:01:59.549> over<00:01:59.909> your<00:02:00.030> arm<00:02:00.240> okay<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:01.140> good

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
directly over your arm okay so one good

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.170 
directly over your arm okay so one good
way<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> help<00:02:01.649> fix<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.040> problem<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.969> go

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
way to help fix this problem is just go

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.540 
way to help fix this problem is just go
up<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.360> your<00:02:03.540> handstand

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
up in your handstand

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.010 
up in your handstand
and<00:02:04.670> then<00:02:04.820> when<00:02:04.940> I<00:02:04.970> add<00:02:05.360> then<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:05.840> practice

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
and then when I add then just practice

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.160 
and then when I add then just practice
going<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.650> one<00:02:06.950> hand<00:02:07.430> without<00:02:07.880> hopping<00:02:08.600> but

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
going to one hand without hopping but

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.990 
going to one hand without hopping but
work<00:02:09.440> on<00:02:09.650> shifting<00:02:10.190> your<00:02:10.369> whole<00:02:10.610> center<00:02:10.970> of

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
work on shifting your whole center of

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.690 
work on shifting your whole center of
balance<00:02:11.270> over<00:02:11.990> that<00:02:12.170> arm<00:02:12.380> okay<00:02:12.950> remember<00:02:13.520> to

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
balance over that arm okay remember to

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.490 
balance over that arm okay remember to
keep<00:02:13.880> everything<00:02:14.270> tight<00:02:14.600> push<00:02:14.990> out<00:02:15.260> and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
keep everything tight push out and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.520 
keep everything tight push out and
control<00:02:17.380> okay

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
control okay

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.650 
control okay
so<00:02:18.830> we<00:02:18.950> open<00:02:19.280> my<00:02:19.490> handstand<00:02:19.820> like<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.330> all

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
so we open my handstand like this all

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.570 
so we open my handstand like this all
right<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.200> something<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.430> might<00:02:22.520> want

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
right and something that you might want

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.640 
right and something that you might want
to<00:02:22.760> take<00:02:22.940> in<00:02:23.000> consideration<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:24.200> crunching

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
to take in consideration is crunching

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.890 
to take in consideration is crunching
your<00:02:24.770> legs<00:02:25.040> like<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.910> handout<00:02:26.360> position

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
your legs like in the handout position

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.870 
your legs like in the handout position
that<00:02:27.560> way<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.860> get<00:02:28.280> used<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.820> feeling

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
that way you get used to that feeling

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.850 
that way you get used to that feeling
all<00:02:29.660> right<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.020> I'm<00:02:30.230> going<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.410> shift<00:02:30.650> over

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
all right and I'm going to shift over

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.090 
all right and I'm going to shift over
this<00:02:31.010> one<00:02:31.250> arm<00:02:31.630> I'm<00:02:32.630> gonna<00:02:33.260> try<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.650> center<00:02:33.980> it

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
this one arm I'm gonna try and center it

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.040 
this one arm I'm gonna try and center it
you<00:02:34.940> don't<00:02:35.090> have<00:02:35.210> to<00:02:35.270> hold<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.510> for<00:02:35.630> too<00:02:35.810> long

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
you don't have to hold it for too long

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.570 
you don't have to hold it for too long
because<00:02:36.320> in<00:02:36.650> my<00:02:36.800> opinion<00:02:37.280> when<00:02:37.430> you're

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
because in my opinion when you're

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.340 
because in my opinion when you're
hopping<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:38.060> almost<00:02:38.360> easier<00:02:38.840> than<00:02:39.020> doing<00:02:39.140> a

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
hopping it's almost easier than doing a

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.890 
hopping it's almost easier than doing a
one-armed<00:02:40.010> handstand<00:02:40.310> because<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.630> get<00:02:41.780> to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
one-armed handstand because you get to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.680 
one-armed handstand because you get to
shift<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.500> little<00:02:42.980> bit<00:02:43.130> every<00:02:44.060> time<00:02:44.090> to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
shift a little bit every time to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.110 
shift a little bit every time to
maintain<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.410> Center<00:02:45.800> balance<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:47.090> other

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
maintain that Center balance the other

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.450 
maintain that Center balance the other
fix<00:02:47.570> is<00:02:47.690> just<00:02:47.840> going<00:02:47.990> directly<00:02:48.260> up<00:02:48.590> into<00:02:49.310> that

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
fix is just going directly up into that

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.460 
fix is just going directly up into that
or<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:50.180> doing<00:02:50.330> one<00:02:50.600> hop<00:02:50.780> at<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.990> time<00:02:51.230> and

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
or just doing one hop at a time and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.230 
or just doing one hop at a time and
trying<00:02:51.710> to<00:02:51.830> land<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.190> one<00:02:52.430> hop<00:02:52.610> kind<00:02:52.820> of<00:02:53.030> slow

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
trying to land that one hop kind of slow

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.380 
trying to land that one hop kind of slow
and<00:02:54.160> focusing<00:02:55.160> on<00:02:55.280> getting<00:02:55.700> over<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.150> one

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
and focusing on getting over that one

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.210 
and focusing on getting over that one
arm<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:56.900> I'm<00:02:57.140> not<00:02:57.320> even<00:02:57.380> going<00:02:57.740> to<00:02:57.770> use<00:02:57.830> my

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
arm so I'm not even going to use my

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.220 
arm so I'm not even going to use my
other<00:02:58.430> arm<00:02:58.700> okay<00:02:59.120> I'm<00:02:59.330> just<00:02:59.840> going<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.110> use<00:03:00.200> one

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
other arm okay I'm just going to use one

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.560 
other arm okay I'm just going to use one
arm<00:03:00.530> I'm<00:03:00.680> going<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:00.860> force<00:03:01.190> myself<00:03:01.460> to<00:03:01.850> have<00:03:02.420> to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
arm I'm going to force myself to have to

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.150 
arm I'm going to force myself to have to
figure<00:03:02.900> out<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.170> center<00:03:03.500> of<00:03:03.620> balance<00:03:03.830> I'm

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
figure out the center of balance I'm

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.410 
figure out the center of balance I'm
forcing<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.300> all<00:03:05.510> right<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.740> go<00:03:06.950> up<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.550> then

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
forcing it all right so I go up and then

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.150 
forcing it all right so I go up and then
crunch<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.230> forced<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.709> find<00:03:09.920> myself

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
crunch in and I forced to find myself

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.130 
crunch in and I forced to find myself
okay<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.700> want<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.000> find<00:03:11.060> that<00:03:11.330> Center<00:03:11.690> balance

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
okay I want to find that Center balance

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.470 
okay I want to find that Center balance
without<00:03:12.440> even<00:03:12.739> using<00:03:12.950> my<00:03:13.160> other<00:03:13.400> arm<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:14.000> even

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
without even using my other arm to even

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.000 
without even using my other arm to even
start<00:03:14.810> okay<00:03:14.989> we're<00:03:15.290> just<00:03:15.320> avoiding<00:03:15.920> the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
start okay we're just avoiding the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.970 
start okay we're just avoiding the
profit<00:03:16.310> at<00:03:16.400> all<00:03:16.489> costs<00:03:16.910> come<00:03:17.810> in<00:03:17.989> up<00:03:18.230> try<00:03:18.800> and

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
profit at all costs come in up try and

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.930 
profit at all costs come in up try and
try<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.400> crunch<00:03:19.730> in<00:03:19.940> over<00:03:20.330> that<00:03:20.510> are

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
try and crunch in over that are

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.270 
try and crunch in over that are
crunching<00:03:22.940> over<00:03:23.209> there<00:03:23.630> boom<00:03:24.140> boom<00:03:24.560> boom<00:03:24.620> and

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
crunching over there boom boom boom and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.470 
crunching over there boom boom boom and
then<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.550> can<00:03:25.700> start<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.000> do<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.120> couple<00:03:26.420> of

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
then you can start to do a couple of

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:34.120 
then you can start to do a couple of
hops<00:03:26.630> if<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:26.959> want<00:03:32.650> you'll<00:03:33.650> notice<00:03:33.980> that

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
hops if you want you'll notice that

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.030 
hops if you want you'll notice that
every<00:03:34.400> time<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.580> hop<00:03:34.910> I'm<00:03:35.120> I<00:03:35.780> continue<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.830> shift

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
every time I hop I'm I continue to shift

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.430 
every time I hop I'm I continue to shift
my<00:03:37.220> weight<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:38.360> center<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:38.900> balance<00:03:39.320> I

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
my weight and the center of balance I

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.160 
my weight and the center of balance I
press<00:03:39.620> that<00:03:39.830> a<00:03:39.860> million<00:03:40.160> times<00:03:40.520> over<00:03:40.959> this<00:03:41.959> arm

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
press that a million times over this arm

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.020 
press that a million times over this arm
alright<00:03:42.860> now<00:03:43.010> here's<00:03:43.220> another<00:03:43.280> mistake<00:03:43.850> that

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
alright now here's another mistake that

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.990 
alright now here's another mistake that
I<00:03:44.090> see<00:03:44.150> commonly<00:03:44.810> when<00:03:45.200> beginning<00:03:45.620> people<00:03:46.280> who

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
I see commonly when beginning people who

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.120 
I see commonly when beginning people who
are<00:03:47.150> jumping<00:03:47.450> from<00:03:47.870> two<00:03:48.320> hands<00:03:48.650> right<00:03:48.830> you're

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
are jumping from two hands right you're

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.820 
are jumping from two hands right you're
doing<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.370> two<00:03:49.550> handed<00:03:49.940> hand<00:03:49.970> hops<00:03:50.800> what<00:03:51.800> I

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
doing the two handed hand hops what I

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.070 
doing the two handed hand hops what I
see<00:03:52.130> is<00:03:52.310> they're<00:03:53.180> only<00:03:53.209> going<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.630> be<00:03:53.720> jumping

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
see is they're only going to be jumping

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.229 
see is they're only going to be jumping
from<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.470> legs<00:03:54.709> just<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.610> lower<00:03:55.820> part<00:03:56.180> of

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
from the legs just the the lower part of

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.660 
from the legs just the the lower part of
the<00:03:56.300> legs<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:56.959> you<00:03:57.709> right<00:03:57.920> so<00:03:58.430> they're

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
the legs you have you right so they're

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.930 
the legs you have you right so they're
just<00:03:58.940> using<00:03:59.360> this<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.810> jump<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:01.760> can

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
just using this to jump and you can

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.729 
just using this to jump and you can
actually<00:04:02.120> get<00:04:02.690> away<00:04:02.750> with<00:04:03.080> this<00:04:03.200> one<00:04:03.410> on<00:04:03.560> two

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
actually get away with this one on two

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.410 
actually get away with this one on two
hands<00:04:03.950> a<00:04:04.160> lot<00:04:04.310> easier<00:04:04.670> than<00:04:04.820> one<00:04:05.060> hand<00:04:05.269> because

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
hands a lot easier than one hand because

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.120 
hands a lot easier than one hand because
you<00:04:05.690> can<00:04:05.840> use<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:05.989> lot<00:04:06.230> more<00:04:06.260> shoulder<00:04:06.680> strength

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
you can use a lot more shoulder strength

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.740 
you can use a lot more shoulder strength
on<00:04:07.310> two<00:04:07.489> hands<00:04:07.760> but<00:04:08.180> then<00:04:08.330> when<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.480> shake<00:04:08.630> the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
on two hands but then when you shake the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.540 
on two hands but then when you shake the
one<00:04:08.959> hand<00:04:09.290> you're<00:04:09.800> only<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.250> only<00:04:10.340> have<00:04:10.519> half

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
one hand you're only you only have half

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.220 
one hand you're only you only have half
the<00:04:10.880> shoulder<00:04:11.180> strength<00:04:11.420> now<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.840> it's<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:12.050> lot

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
the shoulder strength now and it's a lot

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.560 
the shoulder strength now and it's a lot
harder<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.650> even<00:04:12.890> get<00:04:13.010> a<00:04:13.040> single<00:04:13.370> hop<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:14.300> fix

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
harder to even get a single hop to fix

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.550 
harder to even get a single hop to fix
this<00:04:14.780> when<00:04:15.200> you<00:04:15.290> are<00:04:15.530> practicing<00:04:15.800> I'm<00:04:16.280> too

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
this when you are practicing I'm too

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.560 
this when you are practicing I'm too
hands<00:04:16.709> what<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.310> want<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.609> do<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.359> want<00:04:18.510> to

hands what you want to do is you want to

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.000 
hands what you want to do is you want to
focus<00:04:18.750> on<00:04:19.079> using<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.440> whole<00:04:19.709> lower

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
focus on using the whole lower

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.580 
focus on using the whole lower
extremities<00:04:20.639> and<00:04:20.850> everything<00:04:21.720> actually<00:04:21.900> not

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
extremities and everything actually not

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.980 
extremities and everything actually not
just<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.010> legs<00:04:23.250> don't<00:04:23.910> milk<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.750> want<00:04:24.900> to

just the legs don't milk it you want to

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.230 
just the legs don't milk it you want to
use<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.320> hips<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.860> pop<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.820> hips<00:04:27.030> and

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
everything start practicing that from

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.990 
everything start practicing that from
the<00:04:30.090> two<00:04:30.300> hands<00:04:31.190> before<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:32.220> go<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.460> one<00:04:32.730> hand

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
the two hands before you go to one hand

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.390 
the two hands before you go to one hand
okay<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.630> pop<00:04:34.200> up<00:04:34.350> on<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> handstand<00:04:34.889> right<00:04:35.220> and

okay a pop up on a handstand right and
now<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:35.820> can<00:04:36.090> milk<00:04:36.450> at<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.870> note<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.350> hops<00:04:37.560> just

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
now I can milk at to note the hops just

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.590 
now I can milk at to note the hops just
by<00:04:38.040> using<00:04:38.250> light<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.820> know<00:04:38.940> using<00:04:39.150> these<00:04:39.360> legs

by using light you know using these legs

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.659 
by using light you know using these legs
right<00:04:39.810> here<00:04:40.020> okay<00:04:40.260> so<00:04:40.830> I<00:04:41.010> just<00:04:41.160> felt<00:04:41.280> like<00:04:41.370> this

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
and I use a lot of shoulder strength I

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.220 
and I use a lot of shoulder strength I
could<00:04:43.860> be<00:04:43.950> like<00:04:44.100> oh<00:04:44.540> so<00:04:45.540> what<00:04:45.630> you<00:04:45.750> want<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.050> do
