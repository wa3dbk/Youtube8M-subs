00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
monoliths okay but it seems like the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.190

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
else that it's gonna happen with the end

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.120 
else that it's gonna happen with the end
goal<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.990> flan<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.890> way<00:01:28.979> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
goal like flan because the way this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.830 
goal like flan because the way this
episode<00:01:29.460> was<00:01:29.549> presented<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> us<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.600> pretty

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
episode was presented to us it pretty

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.810 
episode was presented to us it pretty
much<00:01:30.990> shows<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.470> most<00:01:31.680> likely<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.340> model<00:01:32.729> is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
much shows that most likely the model is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.219 
much shows that most likely the model is
coming<00:01:33.000> down<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.600> gonna<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.810> safe<00:01:34.049> till

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
coming down is not gonna be safe till

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.840 
coming down is not gonna be safe till
the<00:01:34.350> end<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.860> series<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.549> most<00:01:35.729> likely

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the end of this series so most likely

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.950 
the end of this series so most likely
