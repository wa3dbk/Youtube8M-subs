00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.510
 Game of Tteyuu play-by-play First What 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:30.610
 Speaking of a single word while playing a game, it is recorded and made it into a video 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:36.250
 Sometimes Kedomo is shit Canaan that are in vogue amazing You know now that say to us in 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:39.000
 Sometimes this kind of person is coming , I 'm still broken because I fell when I hit 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.000
 Naa I was stuck 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.780
 No, I 'm not out there, I'm not out there 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.810
 you know what 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.970
 Different rewards are great And 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:00.570
 It's worth it, but more than that, it looks like that's only for me 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.230
 But taking in the middle of the night we basically game play-by-play in the middle of the night 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.150
 After taking that video 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:12.820
 I'm going to edit I'm already outside when it's edited 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:19.420
 After all I'll come to the next day without sleeping at all, and I 'll still be good if I 'm coming the next day 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.590
 Well, if it's a strong break , there will be an event the next day 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.220
 I wonder if it is here 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.570
 This is this 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:31.640
 Hey I 'm an event I went out without a single sleep, but 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:37.130
 Well it I awesome Well honestly speaking, is a painful inexhaustible supply 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.720
 When I say it's painful, I myself and I love games originally and I really love games 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.650
 Because you are a starting person 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.460
 It's about time I can't play games 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.960
 I watched this one more, but this one 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.290
 Fool Now this mountain 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.010
 N error not from the bottom 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.980
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.750
 Follow 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:01.260
 Because it's all a game, there 's also an unopened one . 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.370
 But I know bad Oh I painful this is it best 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:09.210
 There who are waiting for after all still live videos I guess as when it was down that motivation 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.540
 It's not that I still have to go live in a lively situation but I have to improve my motivation 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.720
 Absent 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.360

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.050

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:41.490
 First of all, first of all this is a bag , but I can not afford a bag 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:44.760
 This is provisionally a fan letter, every time I see it, I see it all. 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.570

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:19.910
 I am from a long time ago I'm a bit easy to have a sore throat 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.740
 It is easy to play in the island, and the game style of playing a game is always good 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.380
 I have to eat while doing 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:31.420
