00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
colors I'm using so I did that myself

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.550 
colors I'm using so I did that myself
they<00:03:12.360> don't<00:03:12.540> come<00:03:12.690> with<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> names<00:03:13.110> printed

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
they don't come with the names printed

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.680 
they don't come with the names printed
on<00:03:13.680> them<00:03:13.950> that's<00:03:14.580> one<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.880> my<00:03:14.970> only<00:03:15.150> grips<00:03:15.450> and

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
on them that's one of my only grips and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.570 
on them that's one of my only grips and
the<00:03:15.750> second<00:03:16.140> thing<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.560> dislike<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.370> that

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
the second thing that I dislike is that

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.250 
the second thing that I dislike is that
some<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.000> images<00:03:18.480> are<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.720> little<00:03:19.019> low

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
some of the images are a little low

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.710 
some of the images are a little low
resolution<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:21.150> probably<00:03:21.450> wouldn't

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
resolution and that probably wouldn't

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.300 
resolution and that probably wouldn't
bother<00:03:22.049> or<00:03:22.500> most<00:03:22.830> people<00:03:22.950> wouldn't<00:03:23.250> even

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
bother or most people wouldn't even

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.160 
bother or most people wouldn't even
notice<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:24.269> have<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.480> history<00:03:24.690> and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
notice that but I have a history and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.229 
notice that but I have a history and
background<00:03:25.739> in<00:03:26.100> graphic<00:03:26.190> design<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.180> do

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
background in graphic design so I do

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.420 
background in graphic design so I do
notice<00:03:27.690> things<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.320> affects<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
notice things like that affects the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.580 
notice things like that affects the
quality<00:03:29.519> not<00:03:30.150> at<00:03:30.360> all<00:03:30.510> it's<00:03:30.840> like<00:03:31.019> it's<00:03:31.290> just<00:03:31.470> a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
quality not at all it's like it's just a

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.660 
quality not at all it's like it's just a
personal<00:03:31.980> thing<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.950> there<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:35.370> it

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
personal thing that that is there but it

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.940 
personal thing that that is there but it
doesn't<00:03:35.940> really<00:03:36.030> bother<00:03:36.209> me<00:03:36.650> it's<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:37.830> a

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
doesn't really bother me it's just a

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.350 
doesn't really bother me it's just a
little<00:03:38.130> some<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.579> images<00:03:38.940> are<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> little

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
little some of the images are a little

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.509 
little some of the images are a little
slow<00:03:39.480> quality<00:03:39.930> but<00:03:40.230> who<00:03:41.160> cares

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
slow quality but who cares

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.220 
slow quality but who cares
I<00:03:41.670> obviously<00:03:41.940> who<00:03:42.329> cares<00:03:42.570> I<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:42.930> wanted<00:03:43.110> to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
I obviously who cares I just wanted to

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.810 
I obviously who cares I just wanted to
mention<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.680> because<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.160> something<00:03:44.430> that

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820
