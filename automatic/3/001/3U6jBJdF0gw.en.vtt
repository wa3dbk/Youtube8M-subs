00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
all the way up and then actually trains

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.749 
all the way up and then actually trains
going<00:05:03.289> crisscross<00:05:04.289> you<00:05:05.280> know<00:05:05.340> on<00:05:05.580> the

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
going crisscross you know on the

going crisscross you know on the
different<00:05:06.060> directions<00:05:06.509> so<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:08.580> can<00:05:08.699> kind<00:05:08.880> of

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
different directions so you can kind of

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.749 
different directions so you can kind of

see here the trains are going this way
and<00:05:12.030> then<00:05:12.930> over<00:05:13.500> here<00:05:13.530> you<00:05:13.919> see<00:05:14.099> this<00:05:14.250> tunnel

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
and then over here you see this tunnel

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.719 
and then over here you see this tunnel
the<00:05:15.120> trains<00:05:15.360> are<00:05:15.509> actually<00:05:15.750> going<00:05:16.550> that<00:05:17.550> way

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
chopping it at the same time this is the

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.779 
chopping it at the same time this is the
outside<00:05:30.870> of<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.650> train<00:05:31.919> station<00:05:32.340> at<00:05:32.490> one<00:05:32.669> of

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
outside of the train station at one of

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.380 
outside of the train station at one of
the<00:05:32.849> sides<00:05:33.180> here<00:05:33.740> you<00:05:34.740> can<00:05:34.860> see<00:05:35.070> how<00:05:35.190> big

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
the sides here you can see how big

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:52.260 
the sides here you can see how big
this<00:05:37.630> place<00:05:38.080> actually<00:05:38.380> is

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.090 

this<00:05:53.270> is<00:05:53.420> the<00:05:53.510> outside<00:05:53.930> of<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.290> train<00:05:54.560> station

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
this is the outside of the train station

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.830 
this is the outside of the train station
actually<00:05:55.430> you<00:05:55.520> can<00:05:55.640> see<00:05:55.820> how<00:05:55.970> big<00:05:56.270> this<00:05:56.540> is<00:05:56.600> one

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
actually you can see how big this is one

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:05.220 
actually you can see how big this is one
of<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:57.020> sides<00:05:57.290> and<00:06:02.140> then<00:06:03.140> there's<00:06:03.410> my<00:06:03.740> place

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
of the sides and then there's my place

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.390 
of the sides and then there's my place
right<00:06:06.230> there<00:06:06.290> I<00:06:06.470> couldn't<00:06:06.830> have<00:06:06.950> got<00:06:07.160> any
