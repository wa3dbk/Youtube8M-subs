00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
stretch out a bit further than perhaps

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.300 
stretch out a bit further than perhaps
some<00:01:21.990> other<00:01:22.140> people<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.830> tend<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> just

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
some other people do we tend to just

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.010 
some other people do we tend to just
write<00:01:23.520> about<00:01:23.790> their<00:01:24.030> own<00:01:24.150> emotions<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
write about their own emotions and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.940

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
relatively small gamut of possibilities

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.109 
relatively small gamut of possibilities
my<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.990> interest<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.950> lot<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.939> other

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
something like thick as a brick that had

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.070 
something like thick as a brick that had
had<00:05:08.069> a<00:05:08.099> newspaper<00:05:08.759> as<00:05:09.029> part<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.479> album<00:05:09.870> art
