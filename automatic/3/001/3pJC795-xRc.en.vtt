00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
lightest one like we did with the skin

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.459 
lightest one like we did with the skin
we're<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.480> gonna<00:00:48.629> because<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> lightest

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
we're just gonna because the lightest

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.450 
we're just gonna because the lightest
one<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.829> sort<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.960> four<00:00:52.190> minus<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.309> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
of gonna flick the pencil or the pen or

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
of gonna flick the pencil or the pen or
the<00:01:52.470> marker<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> crayon<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.240> whatever

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the marker or the crayon or whatever

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.600 
the marker or the crayon or whatever
you're<00:01:54.659> using<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.829> go<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you're using and just to go in the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.940 
you're using and just to go in the
direction<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> flow<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.020> hair<00:01:58.259> now

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
direction or the flow of the hair now

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.590 
direction or the flow of the hair now
here<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.579> an<00:01:59.969> example<00:02:00.570> which<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
here is an example which is

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.420 
here is an example which is
from<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.770> actual<00:02:03.070> tutorial<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:04.119> basically

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
from the actual tutorial so basically

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.090 
from the actual tutorial so basically
it's<00:02:06.430> sort<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.790> just<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.440> all<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.709> areas

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
it's sort of just going in all the areas

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.780 
it's sort of just going in all the areas
curving<00:02:09.819> with<00:02:10.239> like<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.720> flow<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.530> hair

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
curving with like the flow of the hair

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.610 
curving with like the flow of the hair
see<00:02:12.790> how<00:02:12.880> its<00:02:13.060> curving<00:02:13.630> out<00:02:13.780> curving<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.560> way

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
see how its curving out curving this way

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.080 
see how its curving out curving this way
so<00:02:15.580> yeah

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
so yeah

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.850 
so yeah
so<00:02:16.420> basically<00:02:16.780> we're<00:02:17.050> doing<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.620> with<00:02:17.709> our

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
so basically we're doing that with our

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.680 
so basically we're doing that with our
middle<00:02:18.040> tone<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.910> we're<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.150> gonna<00:02:19.330> start

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
middle tone and we're just gonna start

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.780 
middle tone and we're just gonna start
with<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:20.140> sort<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.160> flow<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.610> hair

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
with that sort of the flow of the hair

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.250 
with that sort of the flow of the hair
so<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.090> flow<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.480> hair<00:02:22.630> basically<00:02:23.110> is

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
so the flow of the hair basically is

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.170 
so the flow of the hair basically is
like<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:24.010> way<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:24.520> sort<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.790> coming

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
like the way that it's sort of coming

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.850 
like the way that it's sort of coming
out<00:02:25.300> like<00:02:25.510> here's<00:02:25.840> like<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.080> starting<00:02:26.500> point

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
out like here's like the starting point

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.040 
out like here's like the starting point
and<00:02:27.400> then<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:27.850> sort<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.150> like<00:02:28.300> curving

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
and then it just sort of like curving

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.860 
and then it just sort of like curving
out<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:29.739> area<00:02:30.100> here<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:31.209> just<00:02:31.630> sort<00:02:31.810> of

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
out to this area here and just sort of

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.449 
out to this area here and just sort of
curving<00:02:32.470> like<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.040> you're<00:02:33.190> just<00:02:33.310> gonna

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
curving like that so you're just gonna

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.840 
curving like that so you're just gonna
sort<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.880> flick<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:35.019> pen<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.890> you're<00:02:36.610> leaving

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
sort of flick the pen and you're leaving

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.020 
sort of flick the pen and you're leaving
a<00:02:37.269> lot<00:02:37.569> of<00:02:37.720> space<00:02:38.080> like<00:02:38.350> sort<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.680> light<00:02:39.030> like

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
a lot of space like sort of light like

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.020 
a lot of space like sort of light like
this<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.739> we're<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:41.920> gonna<00:02:42.100> go<00:02:42.400> through<00:02:42.430> all

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
this so we're just gonna go through all

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.190 
this so we're just gonna go through all
the<00:02:43.480> hair<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:44.200> using<00:02:44.530> this<00:02:45.989> motion<00:02:46.989> if<00:02:47.110> you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
the hair just using this motion if you

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.630 
the hair just using this motion if you
want<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.470> know<00:02:47.560> more<00:02:47.830> about<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.220> just<00:02:48.280> go<00:02:48.580> to

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
want to know more about it just go to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.330 
want to know more about it just go to
those<00:02:48.790> other<00:02:49.030> tutorials<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.110> yeah<00:02:50.890> just<00:02:51.190> go

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
those other tutorials and yeah just go

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.610 
those other tutorials and yeah just go
over<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.850> whole<00:02:51.880> area<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> hair<00:02:53.230> doing

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
over the whole area of the hair doing

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.150 
over the whole area of the hair doing
that<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:55.239> we've<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:55.510> used<00:02:55.840> our<00:02:56.470> middle<00:02:56.830> tone

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
that so we've just used our middle tone

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.190 
that so we've just used our middle tone
to<00:02:57.670> go<00:02:57.910> over<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:59.680> hair<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:01.810> like<00:03:01.989> what's

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
to go over the hair so just like what's

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.620 
to go over the hair so just like what's
the<00:03:02.350> flow<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.980> hair<00:03:03.220> following<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.269> line

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
the flow of the hair following that line

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
the flow of the hair following that line
put<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.650> whole<00:03:05.860> thing<00:03:06.220> in<00:03:06.459> like<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.850> back

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
put the whole thing in like the back

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.830 
put the whole thing in like the back
areas<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.769> can<00:03:08.890> just<00:03:09.040> cover<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.459> all<00:03:09.840> just

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
areas you can just cover it all just

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.229 
areas you can just cover it all just
sort<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.079> going<00:03:11.290> over<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.799> over<00:03:12.100> here<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.610> just

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
sort of going over it over here to just

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.930 
sort of going over it over here to just
using<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:13.890> flicking<00:03:14.890> sort<00:03:15.190> of<00:03:15.280> motion<00:03:15.519> and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
using that flicking sort of motion and

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.220 
using that flicking sort of motion and
sort<00:03:16.570> of<00:03:16.660> separating<00:03:17.320> into<00:03:17.500> sections<00:03:18.100> too<00:03:19.230> so

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
sort of separating into sections too so

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.300 
sort of separating into sections too so
yeah<00:03:20.650> that's<00:03:21.280> our<00:03:21.459> first<00:03:22.109> layer<00:03:23.109> of<00:03:23.260> color<00:03:23.560> and

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
yeah that's our first layer of color and

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.870 
yeah that's our first layer of color and
now<00:03:24.430> we're<00:03:24.670> gonna<00:03:24.820> go<00:03:25.150> on<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.690> our<00:03:26.640> darkest<00:03:27.640> one

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
now we're gonna go on to our darkest one

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.420 
now we're gonna go on to our darkest one
which<00:03:28.840> is<00:03:29.049> this<00:03:29.230> which<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:29.530> really<00:03:29.680> like<00:03:30.100> dark

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
which is this which is really like dark

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.310 
which is this which is really like dark
red<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.269> we're<00:03:31.480> just<00:03:31.570> gonna<00:03:31.690> do<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.049> same

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
red and we're just gonna do that same

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.280 
red and we're just gonna do that same
sort<00:03:32.650> of<00:03:32.709> like<00:03:32.769> flicking<00:03:33.280> motion<00:03:34.290> going

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
sort of like flicking motion going

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.710 
sort of like flicking motion going
around<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.799> area<00:03:36.070> but<00:03:36.130> again<00:03:37.120> since<00:03:37.510> it's

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
around the area but again since it's

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.360 
around the area but again since it's
layering<00:03:38.109> colors<00:03:38.290> you're<00:03:38.650> not<00:03:38.769> gonna<00:03:38.890> go<00:03:39.130> over

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
layering colors you're not gonna go over

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.190 
layering colors you're not gonna go over
the<00:03:39.489> whole<00:03:39.760> area<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.239> last<00:03:40.510> one<00:03:40.750> just<00:03:41.019> sort

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
the whole area of the last one just sort

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.949 
the whole area of the last one just sort
of<00:03:41.260> following<00:03:41.709> some<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.250> area<00:03:42.579> so<00:03:43.570> just

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
of following some of the area so just

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.559 
of following some of the area so just
sort<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.470> like<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:45.030> flicking

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
sort of like this flicking

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:55.050 
sort of like this flicking
pushing<00:03:52.349> but<00:03:53.349> not<00:03:53.530> covering<00:03:54.010> all<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.670> area<00:03:54.999> of

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
pushing but not covering all the area of

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.649 
pushing but not covering all the area of
the<00:03:55.180> last<00:03:55.420> time<00:03:56.969> you<00:03:57.969> can<00:03:58.060> follow<00:03:58.389> through

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
the last time you can follow through

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.229 
the last time you can follow through
it's<00:03:58.840> like<00:03:58.959> some<00:03:59.200> lines<00:03:59.499> and<00:03:59.920> sort<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.760> vary<00:04:01.030> it

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
it's like some lines and sort of vary it

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.780 
it's like some lines and sort of vary it
but<00:04:01.689> try<00:04:02.019> not<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.200> cover<00:04:02.499> the<00:04:02.590> whole<00:04:02.920> last<00:04:03.219> area

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
but try not to cover the whole last area

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.520 
but try not to cover the whole last area
so<00:04:04.000> that<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.180> can<00:04:04.450> see<00:04:04.629> like<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.930> layers<00:04:05.170> and

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
so that you can see like the layers and

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.890 
so that you can see like the layers and
these<00:04:05.709> like<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.129> blended<00:04:06.579> color<00:04:06.849> just<00:04:07.719> go

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
these like the blended color just go

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.449 
these like the blended color just go
through<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.379> whole<00:04:08.409> all<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.099> rest<00:04:09.250> of<00:04:09.370> the

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
through the whole all the rest of the

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.069 
through the whole all the rest of the
hair<00:04:09.760> with<00:04:10.120> that<00:04:10.829> darkest<00:04:11.829> tone<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.870> we've

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
hair with that darkest tone so we've

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.430 
hair with that darkest tone so we've
used<00:04:14.349> our<00:04:14.590> darkest<00:04:15.340> pinky<00:04:16.239> maroon<00:04:16.660> tone<00:04:17.079> to<00:04:17.289> go

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
used our darkest pinky maroon tone to go

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.039 
used our darkest pinky maroon tone to go
over<00:04:17.949> the<00:04:18.880> hair<00:04:19.209> and<00:04:19.539> now<00:04:19.690> it's<00:04:19.840> looking

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
over the hair and now it's looking

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:20.999 
over the hair and now it's looking
pretty<00:04:20.320> good

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
pretty good

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.960 
pretty good
it's<00:04:21.190> sort<00:04:21.789> of<00:04:21.880> really<00:04:22.150> shiny<00:04:22.539> and<00:04:22.960> nice<00:04:23.139> you

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
it's sort of really shiny and nice you

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.200 
it's sort of really shiny and nice you
can<00:04:24.970> see<00:04:25.210> over<00:04:25.509> here<00:04:25.780> too<00:04:26.110> so<00:04:26.889> that<00:04:27.340> is<00:04:27.669> like

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
can see over here too so that is like

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.570 
can see over here too so that is like
basically<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.780> hair<00:04:29.110> so<00:04:30.099> there's<00:04:30.370> one<00:04:30.550> more

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
basically the hair so there's one more

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.189 
basically the hair so there's one more
thing<00:04:30.759> that<00:04:31.120> we're<00:04:31.240> gonna<00:04:31.360> do<00:04:31.570> that<00:04:31.720> is<00:04:31.960> also

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
thing that we're gonna do that is also

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.230 
thing that we're gonna do that is also
optional<00:04:32.590> so<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:33.460> don't<00:04:33.639> really<00:04:33.729> have<00:04:33.910> to<00:04:34.090> do

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
optional so you don't really have to do

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.240 
optional so you don't really have to do
like<00:04:34.419> this<00:04:34.570> could<00:04:34.780> be<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.020> final<00:04:35.229> hair<00:04:35.560> though

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
like this could be the final hair though

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.680 
like this could be the final hair though
you<00:04:36.580> don't<00:04:36.729> have<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:37.000> do<00:04:37.150> this<00:04:37.330> you<00:04:37.509> can<00:04:37.630> use

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
you don't have to do this you can use

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.219 
you don't have to do this you can use
your<00:04:38.020> lightest<00:04:38.440> tone<00:04:39.660> which<00:04:40.660> is<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.960> one<00:04:41.110> that

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
your lightest tone which is the one that

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.230 
your lightest tone which is the one that
we<00:04:41.349> haven't<00:04:41.620> used<00:04:41.860> yet<00:04:42.070> lightest<00:04:42.639> one<00:04:42.849> and<00:04:43.090> go

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
we haven't used yet lightest one and go

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.510 
we haven't used yet lightest one and go
over<00:04:43.630> all<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.080> areas<00:04:44.410> of<00:04:44.590> hair<00:04:44.800> so<00:04:45.310> there<00:04:45.460> are

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
over all the areas of hair so there are

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.890 
over all the areas of hair so there are
two<00:04:45.669> things<00:04:45.880> you<00:04:45.970> can<00:04:46.060> actually<00:04:46.210> do<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:46.720> can

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
two things you can actually do you can

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.810 
two things you can actually do you can
go<00:04:47.020> over<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.320> whole<00:04:47.470> area<00:04:47.770> of<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.949> hair<00:04:48.190> and

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
go over the whole area of the hair and

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.339 
go over the whole area of the hair and
like<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.240> all<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.599> shades<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:49.990> everything

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
like the all the shades and everything

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.200 
like the all the shades and everything
to<00:04:50.440> blend<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:50.830> or<00:04:50.979> you<00:04:51.130> can<00:04:51.310> just<00:04:51.430> go<00:04:51.669> over<00:04:51.880> the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
to blend it or you can just go over the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.029 
to blend it or you can just go over the
shading<00:04:52.659> and<00:04:52.840> some<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.259> the<00:04:53.349> area<00:04:53.620> of<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.830> hair

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
shading and some of the area of the hair

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.159 
shading and some of the area of the hair
and<00:04:54.580> we'll<00:04:54.820> still<00:04:55.090> leave<00:04:55.300> a<00:04:55.330> few<00:04:55.599> places<00:04:55.930> right

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
and we'll still leave a few places right

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.390 
and we'll still leave a few places right
which<00:04:56.409> is<00:04:56.530> what<00:04:56.680> we're<00:04:56.860> gonna<00:04:56.949> do

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
which is what we're gonna do

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.649 
which is what we're gonna do
so<00:04:57.820> you're<00:04:58.060> just<00:04:58.090> sort<00:04:58.449> of<00:04:59.099> going<00:05:00.099> over<00:05:00.699> the

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
so you're just sort of going over the

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.409 
so you're just sort of going over the
shading<00:05:02.199> plus<00:05:02.770> some<00:05:03.370> of<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.550> white<00:05:03.759> area<00:05:04.180> the

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
shading plus some of the white area the

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.089 
shading plus some of the white area the
leavings<00:05:04.810> still<00:05:05.229> leaving<00:05:05.470> a<00:05:05.650> little<00:05:05.860> bit

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
leavings still leaving a little bit

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.070 
leavings still leaving a little bit
light<00:05:06.400> so<00:05:07.060> going<00:05:07.210> over<00:05:07.389> the<00:05:07.539> shading

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
light so going over the shading

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.200 
light so going over the shading
basically<00:05:08.590> helps<00:05:08.949> like<00:05:09.159> push<00:05:09.789> all<00:05:10.030> those

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
basically helps like push all those

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.050 
basically helps like push all those
little<00:05:10.389> legs<00:05:10.810> waxy<00:05:11.440> things<00:05:12.310> like<00:05:12.610> into<00:05:12.970> the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
little legs waxy things like into the

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.710 
little legs waxy things like into the
paper<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.750> help<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.229> blend<00:05:14.500> everything<00:05:15.720> it's

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
paper and help it blend everything it's

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.300 
paper and help it blend everything it's
sort<00:05:16.870> of<00:05:16.990> like<00:05:17.169> the<00:05:17.289> colored<00:05:17.680> pencils<00:05:18.130> when

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
sort of like the colored pencils when

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.210 
sort of like the colored pencils when
you<00:05:18.430> like<00:05:18.580> use<00:05:18.880> that<00:05:19.150> light<00:05:19.710> pencil<00:05:20.710> thing<00:05:21.099> to

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
you like use that light pencil thing to

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.469 
you like use that light pencil thing to
like<00:05:21.370> go<00:05:21.520> over<00:05:21.550> everything<00:05:21.970> is<00:05:22.180> sort<00:05:22.360> of<00:05:22.389> like

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
like go over everything is sort of like

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.930 
like go over everything is sort of like
flattens<00:05:22.990> it<00:05:23.139> out<00:05:23.259> so<00:05:23.860> we<00:05:24.070> can<00:05:24.099> go<00:05:24.430> like<00:05:24.639> really

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
flattens it out so we can go like really

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.820 
flattens it out so we can go like really
really<00:05:25.090> lightly<00:05:25.599> in<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:25.960> light<00:05:26.139> areas<00:05:26.560> and

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
really lightly in the light areas and

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.460 
really lightly in the light areas and
just<00:05:27.009> smooth<00:05:27.280> like<00:05:27.430> that<00:05:27.460> sort<00:05:27.940> of<00:05:27.970> pressure

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
just smooth like that sort of pressure

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.710 
just smooth like that sort of pressure
shading<00:05:28.890> and<00:05:29.700> just<00:05:29.970> do<00:05:30.150> that<00:05:30.270> throughout<00:05:30.570> the

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
shading and just do that throughout the

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.600 
shading and just do that throughout the
whole<00:05:30.900> hair<00:05:31.140> this<00:05:31.320> is<00:05:31.500> optional<00:05:32.040> so<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.370> don't

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
whole hair this is optional so you don't

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.350 
whole hair this is optional so you don't
have<00:05:32.850> to<00:05:33.090> do<00:05:33.210> this<00:05:33.390> though<00:05:35.240> obviously<00:05:36.240> it<00:05:36.300> just

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
have to do this though obviously it just
