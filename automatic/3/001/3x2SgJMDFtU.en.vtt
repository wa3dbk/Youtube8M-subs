00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
these turned on turn them on I've also

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.360

realized that if you have on the highest

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.190 
realized that if you have on the highest
number<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.670> best<00:00:47.940> friends<00:00:48.300> possible<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
number of best friends possible that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.709 
number of best friends possible that
it's<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.620> much<00:00:49.800> easier<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.670> send<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.600> your

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.660 
it's so much easier to like send to your
friends<00:00:51.780> who<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.890> know<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.160> want<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.460> send

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
friends who you know you want to send

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.920 
friends who you know you want to send
you<00:00:53.760> instead<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> scrolling<00:00:54.570> scrolling

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you instead of scrolling scrolling

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.869 
you instead of scrolling scrolling
scrolling<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.590> anyway<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.370> how<00:00:56.789> you

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
scrolling but anyway that is how you

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
scrolling but anyway that is how you
turn<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> filters<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.739> does<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
turn on the filters so what that does is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.580 
turn on the filters so what that does is
it<00:00:59.219> basically<00:00:59.370> will<00:00:59.879> use<00:01:00.059> your<00:01:00.809> location<00:01:01.140> I

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
it basically will use your location I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.020 
it basically will use your location I
don't<00:01:01.800> set<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.100> temperature<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.789> if
