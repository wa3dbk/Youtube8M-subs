 Hello everyone and welcome today 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.090
 we will prepare eggplant cordon bleu 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.860
 a really tasty second course 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.190
 let's see the ingredients together 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.610
 a new aubergine for breading 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.760
 big enough round and 200 grams of 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.149
 scamorza or provola 80 g of ham 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.980
 cooked and the breadcrumbs to learn of 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.010
 mobile core 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.420
 let's start by cutting the eggplant slices 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.960
 you will have to get a thickness of about 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.960
 half a centimeter 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.640
 here we are now going to grill them 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.570
 the 34 minutes lined up on each side here are the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.820
 grilled aubergines and what time we will go to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:24.410
 stuffing look for depending on 2 aubergines 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:32.260
 of the same size commit slice 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:32.260
 scamorza cheese is a bit of ham 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.520
 and then cleaned 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:52.650
 once stuffed cordon bleu we can 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:56.570
 beat the egg and then learn them as I have 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.570
 beaten I take the breadcrumbs 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.320
 I promise a dish 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.000
 such sculptor lights in the toilet pass them 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.000
 in breadcrumbs 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.810
 I preferred to shine aubergines 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.880
 instead of frying them so you have a 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.190
 dish a little lighter and indeed 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.000
 leandro also cook in the oven instead 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.000
 destroy them 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.640
 now we're going to add a little oil 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.410
 and we will cross in a preheated oven 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.560
 ventilated at 200 degrees for about 15 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.560
 minutes 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.500
 our eggplant cordon bleu are 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.690
 ready 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.790
 now all that remains is to taste them vi 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.650
