00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.650 
and shitty but I think the reason why is
because<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.910> fell<00:02:13.060> victim<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.390> all<00:02:13.480> that

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
call which is not fair to them so maybe

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.300
