00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
order unit and because I'd shift

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.050

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
moved this guy too and so he can't

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.030 
moved this guy too and so he can't
battle<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.500> I'm<00:03:00.620> going<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:00.830> right<00:03:01.010> click

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
battle and so I'm going to right click

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.600 
battle and so I'm going to right click
again<00:03:01.310> on<00:03:01.640> him<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.420> I'm<00:03:03.260> going<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.590> say<00:03:04.340> no

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
that guy's done he can't do anything

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.120 
that guy's done he can't do anything
else's<00:03:08.630> turn<00:03:08.900> I'll<00:03:09.470> notice<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:09.950> there's

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
else's turn I'll notice that there's

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.920 
else's turn I'll notice that there's
also<00:03:10.250> hot<00:03:10.580> g<00:03:10.820> control<00:03:11.209> end<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.660> could<00:03:11.810> also

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
also hot g control end so I could also

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.410 
also hot g control end so I could also
just<00:03:12.200> select<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.769> unit<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.400> hit<00:03:13.790> control<00:03:14.180> n

just select that unit and hit control n

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.240 
just select that unit and hit control n
and<00:03:15.080> that<00:03:15.230> puts<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:15.590> little<00:03:15.860> know<00:03:15.980> about<00:03:16.220> a

and that puts that little know about a
battle<00:03:16.760> marker<00:03:17.209> on<00:03:17.360> him<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.959> then<00:03:18.739> let's<00:03:18.980> see

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
battle marker on him and then let's see

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.330 
battle marker on him and then let's see
how<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.340> move<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:19.790> guy<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.720> as<00:03:21.110> well<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:22.190> he

should have more cards in this in this

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.640

scenario<00:05:15.680> but<00:05:16.210> so<00:05:17.210> here<00:05:17.509> let<00:05:18.080> me<00:05:18.169> just<00:05:18.349> point

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
scenario but so here let me just point

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.040 
scenario but so here let me just point
something<00:05:18.770> out<00:05:19.190> when<00:05:19.970> I<00:05:20.000> drew<00:05:20.270> this<00:05:20.419> card<00:05:20.750> has

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
something out when I drew this card has

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.620 
something out when I drew this card has
the<00:05:21.500> back<00:05:21.979> of<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:22.250> card<00:05:22.460> on<00:05:22.669> top<00:05:22.699> of<00:05:23.060> it<00:05:23.180> that

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
the back of the card on top of it that

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.749 
the back of the card on top of it that
just<00:05:23.840> means<00:05:23.960> that<00:05:24.169> the<00:05:24.919> opponent<00:05:25.370> if<00:05:25.490> he<00:05:25.580> looks

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
just means that the opponent if he looks

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.790 
just means that the opponent if he looks
at<00:05:25.940> my<00:05:26.120> cards<00:05:26.449> he'll<00:05:27.139> only<00:05:27.320> be<00:05:27.500> able<00:05:27.560> to<00:05:27.650> see

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
at my cards he'll only be able to see

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.830 
at my cards he'll only be able to see
the<00:05:27.889> back<00:05:28.099> of<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.430> card<00:05:28.669> this<00:05:29.330> is<00:05:29.449> important

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
the back of the card this is important

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.270 
the back of the card this is important
because<00:05:29.870> sometimes<00:05:30.409> you<00:05:30.530> want<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:30.919> drag<00:05:31.250> a

because sometimes you want to drag a

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.670 
because sometimes you want to drag a
card<00:05:31.639> onto<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.180> play<00:05:32.389> area<00:05:32.599> to<00:05:33.289> indicate<00:05:33.650> that

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
you're playing it or or sometimes if

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.879 
you're playing it or or sometimes if
you're<00:05:35.810> supposed<00:05:36.050> to<00:05:36.110> draw<00:05:36.259> two<00:05:36.470> cards<00:05:36.680> and

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
you're supposed to draw two cards and

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.710 
you're supposed to draw two cards and
keep<00:05:37.130> one<00:05:37.400> you'd<00:05:37.639> draw<00:05:37.909> two<00:05:38.180> to<00:05:38.419> the<00:05:38.509> play<00:05:38.690> area
