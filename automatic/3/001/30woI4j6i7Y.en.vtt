 affirmed in the survey that the Ukrainian 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.229
 the party does not intend to go on peace 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.759
 resolved this conflict 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.170
 another time we became aware of the attempt 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.190
 sticking out provoke ours 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.640
 military personnel 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.770

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.750
 employee force goes out on open 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.010
 communication channels to an officer of the armed forces 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.170
 DPR with a request to open a mortar 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.750
 or artillery fire by positions 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.980
 Azov Regiment 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.569
 referring to their lack of control 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.400
 aggressiveness towards peace 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.870
 to the population 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.810
 these appeals to open fire we 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.459
 ignored and continue to ignore 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.840
 so as not to violate the obligations taken 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.840
 us when signing the Minsk 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.730
 agreements advise Wesu direct 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.690
 the order of subdivisions their own 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:47.329
 forces by the means but marinka i 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:51.829
 just came from there 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:57.620
 Traditionally the mission center would be everything 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:03:00.900
 recorded 14 funnels mission would all 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.540
 does not speak directly about what it was 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.389
 150r and but they assume that this 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.379
 were 150r and 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:12.349
 caliber hope it is in the report 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.930
 tomorrow or the day after tomorrow it will write 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:20.359
 also as a result of this shelling 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:23.120
 one house 2 was destroyed suffered 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:26.849
 no one was injured 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.989
 the Ukrainian side has already laid out the fact 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:33.680
 allegedly shelling and rso hail from the data 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.690
 positions by locality granite 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.209
 where they recorded hit residential 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.430
 neighborhoods of the village and where 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.590
 people suffered but I want to notice to you that 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.739
 Mission representatives would se 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:53.209
 this is not fixed patrol which 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.209
 left the settlement 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.330
 units of the armed forces of Ukraine with 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.420
 by itself was not taken to these places supposedly where 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.040
 was hitting this statement only 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.080
 makes the Ukrainian side without 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.840
 presence of any organizations 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.790
 that could confirm it just 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:19.570
 obviously do not try to blame us that 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:22.630
 what is not listen to the question well and 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.750
 intensity increased to 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.780
 were only called two points up 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.419
 first 3 there were hot spots this is south 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.600
 Carolina Shirokino area of ​​the city airport 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.169
 Donetsk and Gorlovka now actually x 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.300
 same 4 because the district 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.520
 new marinkin every time it sounds about 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.360
 that there are firing heavy weapons 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.069
 like 122 mm today 150 i 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.370
 I hope all the same mission would be noted 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.889
 this 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.669
 that there was a gap of 150 mm 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.669
 shells 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:07.890
 but everything is very confusing initially 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.870
 the Ukrainian side laid out about what 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:14.350
 there was an attempt to break through on their position 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.770
 three military vehicles or as 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.700
 us militia terrorists dnr 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.470
 the result which was this attempt 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.280
 prevented one person was killed one 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.590
 wounded u-6 flooded called one too 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.930
 locality 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.750
 after and for gum while we started talking 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.370
 what happened in the area shirokino i 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.850
 yesterday there was this nothing was 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.220
 and yet it turns out that this is a humanitarian conqueror 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.830
 who got to the checkpoint 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.870
 how did he get there while it is very difficult 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.960
 say why because this is territory 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.300
 controlled by the Ukrainian side as 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.580
 they could drive to drive 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.970
 while it is difficult to investigate 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.970
 about this
