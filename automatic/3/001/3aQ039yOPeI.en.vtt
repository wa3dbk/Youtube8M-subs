and I had to kind of rescue him pull him

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.160 
and I had to kind of rescue him pull him
out<00:00:43.470> he<00:00:44.470> wanted<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.829> go<00:00:44.920> forwards<00:00:45.430> and<00:00:46.019> I<00:00:47.019> had

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
to pull him out backwards it was a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.560 
to pull him out backwards it was a
pretty<00:00:49.960> good<00:00:50.199> fight<00:00:50.860> but<00:00:51.269> eventually<00:00:52.269> got<00:00:52.420> him

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
pretty good fight but eventually got him

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.390 
pretty good fight but eventually got him
out<00:00:52.830> so<00:00:53.830> I<00:00:53.890> was<00:00:54.040> able<00:00:54.159> to<00:00:54.339> save<00:00:54.610> him<00:00:54.939> and

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
out so I was able to save him and

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.969 
out so I was able to save him and
amazingly<00:00:57.400> as<00:00:57.909> you<00:00:58.150> can<00:00:58.299> see<00:00:58.570> he<00:00:58.869> didn't<00:00:59.170> break

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
amazingly as you can see he didn't break

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.359 
amazingly as you can see he didn't break
himself<00:01:00.250> while<00:01:00.790> trying<00:01:01.089> to<00:01:01.180> get<00:01:01.360> it<00:01:01.509> get<00:01:01.900> free

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:02.369 
himself while trying to get it get free

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:04.560 
himself while trying to get it get free
which<00:01:03.369> they<00:01:03.549> usually<00:01:03.729> do<00:01:04.059> that's<00:01:04.299> why<00:01:04.449> they

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
which they usually do that's why they

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.289 
which they usually do that's why they
call<00:01:04.720> them<00:01:04.750> glass<00:01:05.259> snakes<00:01:06.000> because<00:01:07.000> they're

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
call them glass snakes because they're

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.800 
call them glass snakes because they're
so<00:01:07.570> brittle<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:10.270> they're<00:01:10.420> not<00:01:10.509> really

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
so brittle but they're not really

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.569 
so brittle but they're not really
brittle<00:01:11.170> they<00:01:11.439> break<00:01:11.650> themselves<00:01:12.250> trying<00:01:12.460> to

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
brittle they break themselves trying to

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:17.100 
brittle they break themselves trying to
get<00:01:12.729> loose<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:14.470> before<00:01:15.280> I<00:01:15.630> set<00:01:16.630> him<00:01:16.780> free<00:01:17.079> I

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
get loose but before I set him free I

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.840 
get loose but before I set him free I
figured<00:01:17.560> I'd<00:01:17.649> get<00:01:17.799> some<00:01:17.860> good<00:01:18.220> video<00:01:18.549> of<00:01:18.610> him

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
figured I'd get some good video of him

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.050 
figured I'd get some good video of him
some<00:01:19.060> nice<00:01:19.500> super<00:01:20.500> close-ups<00:01:21.070> I<00:01:23.820> can't<00:01:24.820> see

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
some nice super close-ups I can't see

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.240 
some nice super close-ups I can't see
the<00:01:25.210> viewfinder<00:01:25.420> so<00:01:26.110> I<00:01:26.470> don't<00:01:26.740> know<00:01:26.920> if<00:01:27.070> I've

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
the viewfinder so I don't know if I've

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.730 
the viewfinder so I don't know if I've
got<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.550> on<00:01:27.670> his<00:01:27.820> head<00:01:28.030> or<00:01:28.920> not

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.490 

but<00:01:34.400> they're<00:01:35.390> pretty<00:01:35.540> tame<00:01:35.899> right<00:01:36.200> out<00:01:36.320> of<00:01:36.350> the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
but they're pretty tame right out of the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.249 
but they're pretty tame right out of the
wild<00:01:38.950> they'll<00:01:39.950> try<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.220> get<00:01:40.490> loose<00:01:41.229> quite<00:01:42.229> a

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
wild they'll try to get loose quite a

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.109 
wild they'll try to get loose quite a
bit<00:01:43.689> but<00:01:44.689> I've<00:01:45.619> never<00:01:45.890> had<00:01:46.130> one<00:01:46.340> bite<00:01:46.909> me

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
bit but I've never had one bite me

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.779 
bit but I've never had one bite me
although<00:01:47.420> I'm<00:01:47.570> sure<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:48.610> provoked<00:01:49.610> them

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
although I'm sure you provoked them

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.359 
although I'm sure you provoked them
enough<00:01:50.060> they<00:01:50.270> will<00:01:50.539> bite<00:01:51.159> but<00:01:52.159> they're

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
enough they will bite but they're

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.289 
enough they will bite but they're
definitely<00:01:52.729> friendly<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:54.610> think<00:01:55.610> I've<00:01:56.090> got

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
definitely friendly I think I've got

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:06.100 
definitely friendly I think I've got
them<00:01:56.390> on<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.600> screen<00:01:56.929> now<00:02:00.159> but<00:02:03.850> their<00:02:05.110> worst

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
them on the screen now but their worst

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.039 
them on the screen now but their worst
predator<00:02:06.649> I<00:02:06.679> think<00:02:07.069> is<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.340> lawnmower<00:02:07.989> so<00:02:08.989> I'm

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
predator I think is the lawnmower so I'm

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.309 
predator I think is the lawnmower so I'm
going<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.259> try<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.470> set<00:02:09.739> them<00:02:09.860> free

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:21.160 

in<00:02:13.360> field<00:02:15.010> where<00:02:16.010> there's<00:02:16.219> no<00:02:16.430> lawnmower<00:02:20.170> and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
in field where there's no lawnmower and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.830 
in field where there's no lawnmower and
he's<00:02:21.379> we<00:02:21.920> had<00:02:22.069> him<00:02:22.219> overnight<00:02:22.459> in<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:22.969> cage<00:02:23.480> and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
he's we had him overnight in a cage and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.959 
he's we had him overnight in a cage and
he<00:02:24.620> was<00:02:24.769> fun<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.129> have<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.519> house<00:02:25.670> for<00:02:25.939> a

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:25.969 
he was fun to have in the house for a

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.270 
he was fun to have in the house for a
little<00:02:26.180> while<00:02:26.469> they've<00:02:27.469> got<00:02:27.650> this<00:02:27.829> kind<00:02:28.099> of<00:02:28.159> a

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
little while they've got this kind of a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.770 
little while they've got this kind of a
little<00:02:28.489> flap<00:02:28.879> here<00:02:28.909> as<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:29.390> can<00:02:29.450> see<00:02:29.569> him

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
little flap here as you can see him

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.240 
little flap here as you can see him
breathing<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.870> kind<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.230> an<00:02:33.319> expansion<00:02:33.709> flap

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
breathing it's kind of an expansion flap

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:42.660 
breathing it's kind of an expansion flap
I<00:02:35.079> don't<00:02:36.079> recall<00:02:36.200> offhand<00:02:36.799> what<00:02:37.370> it's<00:02:37.489> called

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.890 

but<00:02:44.409> and<00:02:45.409> I<00:02:45.530> suppose<00:02:45.920> they<00:02:46.129> make<00:02:46.310> great<00:02:46.519> pets

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
but and I suppose they make great pets

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.929 
but and I suppose they make great pets
the<00:02:47.900> crickets<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.709> stuff<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.220> think<00:02:49.670> they<00:02:49.909> even

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
the crickets and stuff I think they even

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:56.740
