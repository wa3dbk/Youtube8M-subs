00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.050
 colleagues and this time we have a 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:09.900
 motorola motorola of 1 914 this motorola 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.780
 comes with some ignition failures what 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.789
 which at the moment does not turn on and when 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.160
 in some occasions manages to light 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.949
 then we enter record and as if 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.920
 some key was pressed but the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.810
 The main fault is that it is very difficult to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.519
 but when you get it on 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.589
 we connect the charger without showing that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.480
 is loading the first thing we have to 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.079
 to do is check that the battery has a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.260
 adequate voltage that is in a voltage 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.270
 similar to 3.7 or higher then when 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.460
 we measure the battery we will take the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.000
 contacts of that device artery the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.609
 first and the last and the last or the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.760
 fourth would then be negative then 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.770
 we tested voltages to see if the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.590
 voltage that is there 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.890
 adequate and there is a voltage of 4 points 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.610
 there we see in the multimeter then the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.680
 is adequate 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.330
 and then what we have to review in the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.400
 power button than it is 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.900
 generating the problem after 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.970
 we have verified the voltage 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.820
 then we are going to analyze the button 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.670
 power if it has a breakdown then I 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.400
 he explained it in other methods in other 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.800
 as videos such as reviewing a 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.630
 button of these 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.760
 because they are multimeter in the scale of 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.540
 continuity then we take 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.940
 here 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.150
 and one of the legs of the poverty button 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.950
 that ends up land and the other one then goes to 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.950
 this line that says power cake 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.380
 this line here must have continuity if 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.660
 everything is fine the button then by 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.060
 continue is fine now when I 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.680
 press the power button and have 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.590
 connected one track to ground and the other 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.780
 touching either this liver or the same 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.750
 that is here must have continuity 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.840
 when we press it there we see that it is fulfilled 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.970
 that the button is good but suddenly 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.710
 this has happened to them and they have not found 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.100
 the option since it says cleaning 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.720
 maintenance and turned on at times and 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.720
 what we are going to review when we have 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.750
 a similar case that we achieve that not 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.850
 turn on because sometimes I did not turn on 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.670
 other times lit but they appeared 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.670
 the letters of so recovery for 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.920
 select either a reset or a 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.040
 programming and did not let in the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.510
 phone in a normal functional mode what 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.310
 what we are going to do is remove these 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.370
 gods all to a god suppressors 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.040
 tension protector god is that when by 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.500
 any occasion can fall moisture 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.180
 or they are sulfated then they go to 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.530
 generate an involuntary pulse very 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.790
 It is probably falling 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.650
 I was generating that pulse and I was not leaving 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.050
 that the processor recognized which function 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.390
 was being fulfilled since they could be 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.550
 press several keys or in a sequence 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.800
 that he did not understand to give 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.750
 turned on the phone after you remove 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.510
 the god each of the god 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.680
 then now if the phone turns on 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.049
 normal 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.180
 and I have already been able to solve this fault and 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.719
 Maybe this information will help some 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.849
 colleague who is with a similar fault and 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:19.099
 even if cleaning has changed 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.930
 the buttons follows the fault here with 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.819
 this method will be able to solve it 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.799
 God-sun again we will remove it 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.040
 if we were to have the 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:32.400
 we would change but without them it is also going to 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.379
 operate the phone normally 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.360
 helpful arauca technical service 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.140
 professional in mobile telephony and 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.140
 mobile devices
