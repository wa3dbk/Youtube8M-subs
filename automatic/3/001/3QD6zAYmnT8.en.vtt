00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.570
 hi everyone knows nerve ball 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.190
 and so it's a little video a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 little presentation video 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.770
 so we're here to talk about my future 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.430
 series on minecraft of course I stay 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.490
 on minecraft 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.130
 so it will be a series concerning my 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.289
 nikon who is of course like you 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.859
 know all the smurfette 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.290
 as we can see here so in fact at 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.700
 this base I have basically I had 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.649
 took this icon because I was looking for 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.149
 unicode who represented a girl 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.879
 so to show you that I was a 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.780
 girl of course to start the series 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.190
 with with majine celine and you 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.890
 must know the little house in the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.149
 hostile meadow so I had 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.559
 found the smurfette I had found 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.360
 it's nice because in my childhood 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.309
 I liked the Smurfs and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.410
 then following 100 actually I have so much 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.899
 well loved to relive as greets this hole 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.610
 all this a little delusion of this fact I 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.330
 decided to launch my my personal series and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.740
 so solo and that is titled as you 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.250
 can see the village of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.939
 Smurfs 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.400
 so basically the goals it's not 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.680
 very hard to know 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.680
 we will finally represent trying to 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.689
 best represent the village of 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.700
 smurfs or so there will be some 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.220
 small decorations you will discover at 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.320
 as and when episodes we go 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.689
 try to keep a little bit of thing 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.860
 for us so I basically did a 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.479
 plain a plain with forests around 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.729
 a bit like the Smurfs finally he 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.020
 was on a kind of small full with 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.450
 their little lake all that so that one 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.430
 will build as and when and with 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.770
 forests around all that so 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.270
 you know a little bit years old and a 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.619
 it's a little bit old, but I 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.549
 so that 's still tracked 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.979
 a few generations, though 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:04.170
 so for the purposes I told myself 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.729
 here we are not going to spend 3000 episode at at 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.420
 leave in the mines to have this 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.760
 we want to make the houses 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.420
 the decorations all that would have happened 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.160
 really a lot of time 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.470
 the time to find all the material of 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.970
 make the hues the Hellenic state for 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.440
 to have everything we wanted so in fact 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.569
 I passed I'm not finally I'm 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.790
 gone on the ban in fact I stole 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.319
 this idea there a little on the stage where 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.970
 you must know the skweres series 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.040
 so in this case like jean cyril 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.510
 did but also those vague who 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.450
 is a little more known so you have to 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.800
 certainly know the series this corner 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.270
 so here I am gone on the base 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.650
 so I gave myself a little more 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.030
 stuff plus a given a kraft table 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.630
 who will really be my kraft table for 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.540
 the whole village 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.280
 defour in case I really should 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.180
 to go undermined thereafter so that's 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.670
 really in case 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.230
 and then so I something so I 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.910
 I put a chest with that of the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.890
 wool 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.560
 so as we can see I started 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.750
 two blocks of 64 using each 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.130
 color plus white blocks so we 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.350
 you will understand why 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.209
 as many white blocks you will understand 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.190
 afterwards episodes we know that a 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.630
 that an announcement so here we go 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.360
 to be able to use all this hate so 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.450
 in fact the goal of the series is going to be 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.650
 really do the village with with 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.480
 all the wool all that so he goes 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.060
 have to use all that offers there 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.530
 will have to use it and so in this 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.780
 frame there I put a little bit of everything and 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.130
 anything so that is to say 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.680
 weapons why should we go to 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.390
 mines and coal on has to use 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.390
 the furnaces to make torches for 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.560
 to illuminate the village of course 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.160
 really you see finally there is really 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.230
 all steps of the eyraud stone 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.269
 Thursday 40 years a carrot an apple of 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.650
 earth to start cultures you 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.510
 will see later I will explain 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.070
 also why I want to cultivate 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.299
 you will understand a little if you 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.239
 know I may find that you 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.760
 understand already so we'll see 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.920
 so that's all that to say that I 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.390
 launches my solo series so that should 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.010
 start next week I hope 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.329
 at worst in two weeks I'm going 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.680
 try to turn two three episodes 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.930
 still in advance to not make you 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.310
 wait too much between each episode and 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.579
 then I'll start the first episode 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.220
 and according to your criticisms of the council 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.930
 I will try to forgive I will try 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.340
 advanced the series while taking in 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.760
 account of what you tell me for 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.280
 evolve 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.739
 so that's how we can see on the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.660
 little on the safe mini map you see 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.820
 already small decorations that I could 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.409
 do to prepare the map so we 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.790
 will make decorations together make a 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:27.160
 duo or so I brothers 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.330
 maybe online to say not to 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
 to waste too much time 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.470
 time still to do and we 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.990
 together we will build the village 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.660
