00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
bacon because we just like harder your

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.270 
bacon because we just like harder your
pieces<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.110> bacon<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.890> our<00:00:50.219> beans<00:00:52.219> now<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
pieces of bacon in our beans now the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.729 
pieces of bacon in our beans now the
next<00:00:53.489> step<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.989> heat<00:00:55.379> your

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
next step is going to be to heat your

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.549 
next step is going to be to heat your
medium<00:00:56.219> sized<00:00:56.460> pot<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.539> least<00:00:57.750> medium<00:00:58.350> high

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
medium sized pot on at least medium high

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.840 
medium sized pot on at least medium high
so<00:00:58.860> that<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.129> could<00:00:59.280> start<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> cooking

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
so that you could start the cooking

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.360 
so that you could start the cooking
process<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.110> do<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.739> medium<00:01:02.070> sized

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
process now I do think a medium sized

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.660 
process now I do think a medium sized
pot<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.910> appropriate<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.800> almost<00:01:04.800> any<00:01:05.160> amount

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
pot is appropriate for almost any amount

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.010 
pot is appropriate for almost any amount
that<00:01:05.850> you're<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.149> make<00:01:06.300> simply<00:01:06.750> because

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
of hours it's very simple just go

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.870
