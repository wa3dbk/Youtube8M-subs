00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
that move even if I were white actually

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.119 
that move even if I were white actually
because<00:02:06.750> look<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.080> pawn<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.380> well-placed<00:02:07.890> to

because look this pawn is well-placed to

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.859 
because look this pawn is well-placed to
limit<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.519> Knight<00:02:08.789> which<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.780> accordance

something choose to later push f4 you

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.519 
something choose to later push f4 you
might<00:02:27.510> not<00:02:27.659> have<00:02:27.749> lost<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.109> tempo<00:02:28.439> because

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:28.529 
might not have lost a tempo because

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:30.470 
might not have lost a tempo because
Queen<00:02:28.889> te8<00:02:29.189> might<00:02:29.519> not<00:02:29.670> be<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:29.879> valuable

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
Queen te8 might not be a valuable

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.839 
Queen te8 might not be a valuable
for<00:02:30.720> black<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.680> after<00:02:31.920> he<00:02:32.010> might<00:02:32.160> be<00:02:32.280> possible

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
for black so after he might be possible

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.820 
for black so after he might be possible
but<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.120> any<00:02:33.209> case<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:34.140> main<00:02:34.349> move<00:02:34.530> here<00:02:34.769> is

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
but in any case the main move here is

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.589 
but in any case the main move here is
Knight<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.190> c3<00:02:35.430> that's<00:02:35.940> what's<00:02:36.150> been<00:02:36.300> played

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
Knight to c3 that's what's been played

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.780 
Knight to c3 that's what's been played
in<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.500> games<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:37.920> I've<00:02:38.040> seen<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.550> line

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
in the games that I've seen in this line

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.660 
in the games that I've seen in this line
and<00:02:39.030> now<00:02:39.959> his<00:02:40.709> opponent<00:02:40.830> played<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.489> move

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
and now his opponent played the move

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.990 
and now his opponent played the move
Knight<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.180> a6<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.370> before<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.519> look<00:02:44.700> at<00:02:44.849> this

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
Knight to a6 and before we look at this

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.759 
Knight to a6 and before we look at this
game<00:02:45.269> I'll<00:02:45.629> quickly<00:02:46.080> show<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.440> another

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
game I'll quickly show you another

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.839 
game I'll quickly show you another
fragment<00:02:47.459> on<00:02:48.680> d5<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.040> most<00:02:50.220> critical<00:02:50.459> move

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
fragment on d5 is the most critical move

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.449 
fragment on d5 is the most critical move
here<00:02:51.150> after<00:02:51.810> Knight<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.230> c3<00:02:52.440> ah<00:02:53.300> for<00:02:54.300> sure<00:02:54.569> I

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
here after Knight to c3 ah for sure I

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.470 
here after Knight to c3 ah for sure I
consistent<00:02:56.459> with<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.819> Queen<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.299> knight

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
consistent with the Queen and the knight

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.559 
consistent with the Queen and the knight
move<00:02:57.720> black<00:02:58.019> quickly<00:02:58.890> attacks<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.730> e4<00:03:00.330> pawn

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
move black quickly attacks this e4 pawn

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.860 
move black quickly attacks this e4 pawn
and<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.049> is<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.349> line<00:03:01.530> which<00:03:01.830> on<00:03:02.569> if<00:03:03.569> it's

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
and this is the line which on if it's

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.620 
and this is the line which on if it's
good<00:03:04.110> for<00:03:04.319> black<00:03:04.560> would<00:03:05.340> would<00:03:05.730> suggest<00:03:06.390> that

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
good for black would would suggest that

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.259 
good for black would would suggest that
white<00:03:06.870> should<00:03:07.019> play<00:03:07.170> Knight<00:03:07.349> c3<00:03:07.590> before<00:03:08.250> d4<00:03:08.819> or

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
white should play Knight c3 before d4 or

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.870 
white should play Knight c3 before d4 or
perhaps<00:03:09.599> f3<00:03:10.260> instead<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.620> Knight<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.799> c3<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.760> I

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
perhaps f3 instead of Knight to c3 and I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.610 
perhaps f3 instead of Knight to c3 and I
think<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.329> line<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.660> actually<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.319> fine

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
think this line is actually like fine

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.729 
think this line is actually like fine
for<00:03:13.860> black<00:03:14.069> um<00:03:14.910> if<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.660> if<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.230> look<00:03:16.440> at<00:03:16.590> it

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
for black um if you if you look at it

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.530 
for black um if you if you look at it
I've<00:03:16.860> seen<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.190> game<00:03:17.459> between<00:03:17.640> two<00:03:18.090> pretty

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
I've seen a game between two pretty

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.699 
I've seen a game between two pretty
strong<00:03:18.810> masters<00:03:19.290> which<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.650> think<00:03:20.099> um<00:03:21.709> think

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
strong masters which I think um think

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.490 
strong masters which I think um think
goes<00:03:23.430> like<00:03:23.640> e<00:03:23.760> 5<00:03:24.209> which<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.750> probably<00:03:25.290> correct

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
goes like e 5 which is probably correct

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.289 
goes like e 5 which is probably correct
and<00:03:25.860> Bishop<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.310> b4<00:03:26.700> which<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.030> probably

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
and Bishop to b4 which is probably

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.610 
and Bishop to b4 which is probably
correct<00:03:27.450> for<00:03:27.750> black<00:03:27.900> because<00:03:28.140> they<00:03:28.410> want<00:03:28.590> to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
correct for black because they want to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.520 
correct for black because they want to
play<00:03:28.799> Knight<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.190> e4<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:30.079> now<00:03:31.079> white<00:03:31.349> plays

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
play Knight to e4 and now white plays

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.479 
play Knight to e4 and now white plays
Bishop<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:32.130> d3<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:33.840> position<00:03:34.170> um<00:03:34.709> I

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
Bishop to d3 and in this position um I

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.520 
Bishop to d3 and in this position um I
don't<00:03:35.700> know<00:03:35.850> if<00:03:36.000> anyone's<00:03:36.329> ever<00:03:36.420> played<00:03:36.810> what

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
I consider to be the best move um which

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.170 
I consider to be the best move um which
would<00:03:41.819> be<00:03:42.000> Knight
