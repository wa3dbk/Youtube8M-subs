00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.610
 hello everyone I'm dan and I'm here 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.559
 new on island minecraft news for 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.720
 bring the latest news of the 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.100
 new version of minecraft first 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.660
 tell you that I have broken the 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.090
 microphone that he had bought me makes a 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.470
 couple of weeks or so or I've been 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.539
 stone this morning not when he's gone to 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.640
 record and it did not work did not detect anything 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.920
 I have restarted the computer has returned to 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.260
 connect the microphone and it does not detect it 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.879
 I've tried on several computers and in 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.860
 none worked so 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.379
 It has definitely broken and I just 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.730
 throw 30 euros in the trash I've been a 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.190
 while looking and I have managed to find 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.980
 a usb microphone in my guitar house 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.200
 hero of 4 or 5 years ago and I do not know how it 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.700
 will hear so I will surely follow 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.680
 with this one until I can buy another 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.840
 that on the one hand I wanted to tell you 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.790
 also another little thing yesterday I went up the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.469
 tutorial on how to install the mods of the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.540
 series of mods that we are making a 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.489
 cooperative script but I 've uploaded one 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.930
 way a little bit weird without wanting it 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.969
 well private and then I put it in 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.259
 public and not everyone got the 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.450
 notification that an 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.520
 video so I'll mention it here 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.979
 I'll leave the links down here and in the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.070
 description of the video and nothing else now 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.080
 yes let's start 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.450
 nathan adams commented on his twitter 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.850
 that extra flat maps will be even more 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.950
 customizable it seems that now 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.950
 we can choose to generate envelopes in them 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.110
 trees and structures like stronghold and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.970
 dungeon as any option of 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.950
 customization this will come perfect 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.950
 for creators of adventure maps 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.640
 let's move on to something else jeff commented yesterday on 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.560
 their twitter they were trying 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.510
 solve several bugs of the red stones 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.920
 but a few minutes ago another 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.600
 tweet in which he said that they have 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.970
 solved many of those books not 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.860
 will be solved in 1.4 since 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.660
 there are so many reston mechanisms that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.850
 they use those books to do what they do 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.040
 that is, if you solve it in 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.780
 many, many mechanisms of 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.240
 very complex rest would stop 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.060
 to work this is a guess of mine 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.610
 but it is quite likely that the 1.5 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.530
 let's see new reston blocks that 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.899
 they suppose what they will remove when 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.700
 solve the bucs is to say that if by 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.710
 example with a book you can make a 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.960
 logical gate may they make blocks of 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.720
 logical doors to avoid having to use 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.310
 that kind of books to make them but 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.480
 as I say this is a guess of mine 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.480
 and we'll see later 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.700
 Finally, tell me what Jeff said yesterday 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.040
 on your twitter that levers doors 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.660
 buttons and other activable objects only 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.600
 they can be activated with the right button 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.670
 of the mouse in this way will prevent 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.050
 we accede without wanting levers and buttons 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.030
 when in reality what we wanted was 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.680
 remove them but above all it will solve the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.750
 bug that occurred when we tried 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.490
 break a wooden door and this one 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.790
 it was opening and closing and I do not know 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.790
 broke 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.209
 and nothing else that has been everything I will be 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.739
 Watch for new developments as always 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.090
 as I recorded this video 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.980
 realized that the microphone does not 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.629
 It works not bad but unfortunately 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.370
 has a pretty bad thing and it is that it is 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.110
 very sensitive to distance changes 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.150
 that is, if I walk away even if it's a 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.980
 little is heard much looser and 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.680
 if I approach even if nothing is a 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.599
 centimeter is heard very very loud well 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.879
 that please forgive that I will try to 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.700
 do not notice and my priority will be to buy 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.440
 a good microphone as soon as possible by 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.150
 last comment that surely today 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.980
 there will be a new snapshot and that 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.410
 there will be another video this afternoon as well 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.430
 that stay tuned and nothing but a greeting and 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.430
 until the next video
