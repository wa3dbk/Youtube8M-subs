 hello everyone and today i'm making a video about 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.420
 face care 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.269
 This video request I have long been asked 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.010
 shoot this kind of video nobody 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.530
 it turned out and now I take off 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.330
 finally your skin care video 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.470
 faces 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 So let's start with the cleansing of the morning usually 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:29.400
 waking up i wipe my skin like this 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:32.940
 here is tonic from lancome is tonic 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.210
 moisturizing it for any skin type and it 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.309
 does not contain alcohol in the summer I of course 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.750
 I use tonics with alcohol 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.660
 because my skin is oily 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.670
 but in the winter it is still dried and I 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.430
 I use this moisturizer 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.340
 I put a tonic on this next morning 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.850
 Here is such a care corrector 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.039
 lancome visionary doesn't like him very much 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.739
 I repeatedly show it 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.460
 separate video just about this one 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.840
 care corrector and he constricts very well 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.740
 pores very well moisturizes the skin it for 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.299
 dry skin 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 I think it needs to be applied 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.549
 under the cream and me as the owners of fat 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.659
 only this is enough skin 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.659
 funds after tonic 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.600
 in the morning after these two remedies I donâ€™t 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.710
 not wear nanoshu not silicon under the eyes are not 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.450
 any other 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.570
 here these two funds in the morning and already 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.090
 starting to apply makeup 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.510
 powder and dinner I paint beautiful eyes 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.220
 bronzer lipstick and all tonal means 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.500
 I try not to use the latter 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.560
 time because i noticed that after all 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.720
 acne and pimple skin problems 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.180
 It begins with me when I use it 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.330
 permanently tonal cream so now 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.640
 evening skin care 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:08.090
 in the evening I wash off makeup like this 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:10.640
 here's mousse from lancome is a gel for 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.940
 cleanup from lancome gel report he 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.810
 called he doesn't like him very much 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.500
 economical it washes well the whole 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.910
 makeup 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.000
 well foams and such skin after it 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.170
 pulled hydrated sole he 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.750
 sometimes I don't wash a mascara 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.290
 eyes but if i put shadows on 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.900
 lower eyelid sometimes it fails 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.060
 with the purification of precisely the lower eyelid therefore 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.910
 I pluck cotton buds 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.230
 a cotton swab and this means this 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:52.330
 both to the purpose of lancome also erase already 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.330
 mascara and residues and cosmetics around the eyes 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.739
 such a tool is in my little 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.440
 probnichki but it takes a very long time to 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.769
 I have literally a year already missing them and 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.870
 and further after cleansing after the gel for 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.900
 washing I use here such a tonic 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.320
 again this moisturizer without content 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:20.750
 alcohol then apply this here 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.700
 Servant same nefig advanced lanka she 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.280
 It has such a pipette and 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.519
 literally two or three drops is enough for everything 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.519
 face 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.370
 when i tried this first time now 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.400
 serum she somehow I like them 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.270
 I liked nothing but understood from her 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.000
 some kind of lasting effect 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.410
 you use it for a week you see the difference 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.080
 before using this serum and after 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.270
 Here this serum means and after 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.080
 serum apply here such a cream from 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.120
 biotherm is a moisturizing night jelly for 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.910
 I already have a little left I will not tell 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.060
 that it is not economical enough 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.100
 cost effective but she is very good 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.280
 moisturizes and nourishes the skin during the day 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.260
 Apply of course I do not put in the afternoon because 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.910
 that all the same face is more fat 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.280
 she becomes nothing very good 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.130
 wear it too cope like with 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:30.870

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:31.680

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.690
 he, too, is also very long enough 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.610
 very well tightens the skin under 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.620
