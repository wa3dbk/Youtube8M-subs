 luxuries on wheels an order for a 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.070
 Russian customer every detail adapted to the 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.549

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.549
 golden 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:26.800
 only the hoop milling for one of the 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:32.160
 wheels took 8 hours it was a lot of work and 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:37.650
 it required a lot of energy and how much it costs 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.650
 this model costs about 17 thousand euros 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.039
 and it was produced in a workshop of this 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.160
 old industrial complex in the city 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.829
 of colony use used machines but 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.809
 the company already has 20 employees and 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.000
 generated income by almost one million 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.519
 euros last year 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.680

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.989
 that one when this engineer lost his 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.909
 work in formula1 used their 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.710
 knowledge to make these 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.710
 stylish grills on wheels 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.570
 this is our way of working not 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.580
 would work otherwise if not 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.070
 we would have to produce at low cost in 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.740
 asia but that is not our goal 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.560
 some people pay five thousand euros for a 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.920
 sofa even when you can buy one for 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.840

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.300

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.000
 300 euro sofa or cook on a grill 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.820
 from price but a grill with 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.880
 Brake tires and double steering is 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.009
 exclusive the basic model costs five 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.009
 thousand euros the extras cost more 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.049
 if you do not want this we can not install it 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.049
 but it gives you a better turning radius 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.159
 the client works in the industry 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.710

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.909

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.569
 challenge for the 34 year old businessman 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.440
 the banks collaborated little from the 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.650
 you go to the bank with the sketch and 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.230
 you tell them I want to build this has 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.690
 future the grayling will cost five thousand 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.739
 euros but the banker tells you not to 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.739
 you are in your senses 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.310
