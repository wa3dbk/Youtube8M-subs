 If you've just created a new ad, make sure you're expecting it to show to your potential customers 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.800
 We always try to get your ads enabled and running on the system 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:29.120
 but these ads will first go through a review process to make sure they are safe and valid 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.160
 We review ads, keywords, landing pages, and mobile applications to ensure that they meet our advertising policies. 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.920
 Whenever you create or edit ads, the system will automatically be sent a review request to us 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.000
 So how often does this process take? We try our best to show your ads as quickly as possible 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.720
 So most ads are reviewed within one business day, and some even within just a few hours 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.520
 Some ads take longer to review because of the higher complexity 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.000
 If your ad is in the review period for more than one business day, be patient 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.400
 To ensure fairness for advertisers, we review ads in the order from before to after 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:20.800
 To check if your ad has been reviewed, see your ad tab and look at the status column. Next to each ad you will see the current status 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.360
 If you want to learn more about ad status, you can look at the AdWords Help Center 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.440
 While considering, your advertising status will be "eligible" or "under review." 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:44.960
 Qualified ads may begin showing up in Google search results immediately, but ads 'under review' won't show until they're reviewed and approved. 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:54.240
 If you created or edited an ad that has been more than 1 business day and is still awaiting review "or" Eligible ", you can fill out the form below to request a review. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.960
 If your ad has a "Denied" status, it means that it doesn't meet our policy requirements. 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.120
 To see more details why ads are not approved you can 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.960
 1. Click the Column button on the toolbar above the statistics table. 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.240
 2. Click the Custom button 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.720
 3. Go to the "Properties" section, click Add Policy Details' 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.160
 4. Click Apply Here you will see the policies that the ads violated 

00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:27.960
 And remember that we also consider paused ads. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.880
 So you can create and stop your ads a few days before they start running 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.040
 That way they can be reviewed and ready to display when you need it. 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.200
 And that is the advertising review process. If you want to start creating an ad, click this link.
