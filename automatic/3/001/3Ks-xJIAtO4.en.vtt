Lakers I've been in that position going
on<00:00:11.340> 29<00:00:11.880> years<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.599> all<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.500> time<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.130> have

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
on 29 years and all that time I have

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.349 

we<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:21.680> countless<00:00:22.760> electoral<00:00:23.760> modalities

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
we have countless electoral modalities

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.060 
we have countless electoral modalities
all<00:00:24.630> sorts<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.109> things<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.500> our<00:00:25.560> training<00:00:26.039> room

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
all sorts of things in our training room

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.099 
all sorts of things in our training room
we<00:00:26.460> get<00:00:26.609> calls<00:00:26.910> from<00:00:27.150> every<00:00:27.900> manufacturer<00:00:28.830> and

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
we get calls from every manufacturer and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.290 
we get calls from every manufacturer and
my<00:00:31.109> feeling<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.430> drive<00:00:32.910> an

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
my feeling is is if you drive an

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
my feeling is is if you drive an
electric<00:00:33.989> current<00:00:34.230> into<00:00:34.649> someone's<00:00:35.340> body

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
electric current into someone's body

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.650 
electric current into someone's body
you're<00:00:35.850> probably<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
you're probably going to get a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.490 
you're probably going to get a
therapeutic<00:00:37.230> effect<00:00:38.180> but<00:00:39.180> there<00:00:39.719> seems<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> be

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
therapeutic effect but there seems to be

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.920 
therapeutic effect but there seems to be
some<00:00:40.890> modalities<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.579> work<00:00:42.149> better<00:00:42.570> than

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
some modalities that work better than

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.060 
some modalities that work better than
others<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.030> in<00:00:45.030> my<00:00:45.270> experience<00:00:45.930> over<00:00:46.170> 29

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
others and in my experience over 29

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.420 
others and in my experience over 29
years<00:00:48.140> nothing<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.320> comes<00:00:49.739> close<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
years nothing really comes close to the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.110 
years nothing really comes close to the
H<00:00:50.670> wave<00:00:51.170> across<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.410> board<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.039> get<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> most

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
H wave across the board I get the most

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000 
H wave across the board I get the most
significant<00:00:54.780> results<00:00:55.260> from<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
significant results from it and it's the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.900 
significant results from it and it's the
best<00:00:59.510> during<00:01:00.510> my<00:01:00.750> tenure<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.609> worked<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.699> some

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
best during my tenure I worked with some

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.140 
best during my tenure I worked with some
of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> greatest<00:01:03.420> athletes<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.830> world

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
of the greatest athletes in the world

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.960 
of the greatest athletes in the world
one<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> keys<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:07.110> not<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.860> making<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.640> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
one of the keys is not just making it to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.450 
one of the keys is not just making it to
the<00:01:09.119> top<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:10.140> staying<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:10.920> I'm<00:01:11.100> coming

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the top but staying there I'm coming

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.359 
the top but staying there I'm coming
back<00:01:11.700> day<00:01:12.330> after<00:01:12.360> day<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.380> being<00:01:13.979> able<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
compete at that love one of the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.219 
compete at that love one of the
modalities<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:20.450> helps<00:01:21.450> me<00:01:21.630> keep<00:01:21.990> our

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
modalities that helps me keep our

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.060 
modalities that helps me keep our
players<00:01:22.740> at<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.189> level<00:01:23.869> is<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.680> H<00:01:25.799> way

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
players at that level is is the H way

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.560 
players at that level is is the H way
then<00:01:26.340> actually<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.450> key<00:01:27.720> modality<00:01:29.570> one

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
then actually it's my key modality one

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.679 
then actually it's my key modality one
of<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.750> beauties<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.170> using<00:01:32.100> H<00:01:32.280> waves<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.119> our

of the beauties of using H waves and our
bag<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.290> tricks<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:35.009> its<00:01:35.909> portability<00:01:36.259> it's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
bag of tricks is its portability it's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.569 
bag of tricks is its portability it's
easy<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:38.430> take<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.479> around<00:01:39.570> its<00:01:40.110> small<00:01:40.579> its

you<00:02:03.180> can't<00:02:03.420> always<00:02:03.540> do<00:02:03.810> that

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
you can't always do that

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.200 
you can't always do that
with<00:02:04.200> some<00:02:04.410> of<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.620> other<00:02:04.770> modalities<00:02:05.490> I've

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
with some of the other modalities I've

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.040 
with some of the other modalities I've
taken<00:02:06.630> pictures<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.280> electrode<00:02:08.280> placement<00:02:09.050> on

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
exactly what to do it and they get home

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.320 
exactly what to do it and they get home
it's<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.600> simple<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.290> use<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:23.120> always<00:02:24.120> try<00:02:24.300> to

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
it's that simple to use I always try to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.620 
it's that simple to use I always try to
go<00:02:24.540> H<00:02:24.720> wait<00:02:24.990> first<00:02:25.440> there's<00:02:25.980> no<00:02:26.160> downside<00:02:26.630> but

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
go H wait first there's no downside but

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.240 
go H wait first there's no downside but
there's<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.900> very<00:02:28.050> good<00:02:28.200> chance<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.920> might<00:02:29.070> be

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
there's a very good chance you might be

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.210 
there's a very good chance you might be
able<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.580> use<00:02:29.820> an<00:02:30.270> H<00:02:30.450> wave<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.080> not<00:02:31.260> have<00:02:31.590> to

myself telling you how simple the H wave
is<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.940> use<00:03:03.620> but<00:03:04.620> that's<00:03:04.799> in<00:03:05.070> no<00:03:05.489> way<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:07.230> be

is to use but that's in no way to be

now<00:03:29.930> we<00:03:30.930> use<00:03:31.170> lots<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.650> different<00:03:31.799> things<00:03:32.190> but

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
now we use lots of different things but

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.300 
now we use lots of different things but

them in the compression wrap and use the

them in the compression wrap and use the

the unit off and I was very surprised

that the next morning I expected some

that the next morning I expected some
