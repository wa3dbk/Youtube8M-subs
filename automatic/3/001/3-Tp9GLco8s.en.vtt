 Today it is a Muscovite tone of such white 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.490
 my color was rare enough 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.930

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.489
 here's a taxi in my rather rare 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.560

 defect tail light broken off too 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.710
 the consequences of playing action with 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.119
 the other side here so in general she 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.770
 well preserved no scratches 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.770

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.950
 wheels 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.370
 here these model does not open anything to 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.370
 Sorry, that is, no trunk, no door 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.250

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:28.370

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:34.760

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.070
 internal parts 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.570
 not like the block that I showed 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:48.290
 in the past video here it is included as well 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.240
 everything is easier done here but nonetheless 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.990
 uniformly like giving actually 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:58.370

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:19.220
 Here is a machine, but here I have a box 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.860

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.850
 such a box has already caused from time 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:57.830

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.690

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:12.260
 not a dimensional model I could purchase here 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.740
