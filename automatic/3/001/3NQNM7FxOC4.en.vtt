00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.560
 What are you doing here ? 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.080
 I just came to take ... 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.680
 I wanted to ... 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.280
 Do you... ? You cry ? 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.320
 A little. I just spoke with my mother. 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.360
 I think she has big problems. 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.800
 It's been a while since she's in shape. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.840
 She is sure she will die. 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.920
 - She is sick ? - I do not believe. 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.080
 Doctors do not find him anything. 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.760
 But when I hear her so frightened and so alone, I ... 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.480
 She hurt me. 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.600
 I'll go in a few days to see that. 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.640
 It's up to me to go. 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.480
 - I'll go see Grandma. - And your work ? 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.280
 I write porn. I can do it in Michigan. 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.680
 It does not require superhuman efforts. 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.600
 And it will give me the opportunity to write this thing that I always wanted. 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.600
 On Genghis Khan? 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.920
 - No, the other. - On your high school? 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.440
 Yes, but said like that, it's easy. 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.280
 It's been 15 years since you said you'll do it. 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.320
 The only way to get started 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.040
 it's leaving Los Angeles, getting out of my life. 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.080
 How is Sofia going to take it? 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.240
 She will be delighted. She just broke up with me. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.360
 Sofia dropped me. 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.720
 You're kidding ? When? 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.000
 An hour ago. I had plugs. 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.080
 - Maybe it's ... - No, it's not. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.200
 It's finish. She left. 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.680
 - Can you pull yourself together? - Unimaginable. 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.320
 Please stop playing it end of the world. 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.000
 Sorry, darling. Excuse me. 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.320
 It's just that she's so beautiful. And funny, and great.
