it's<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:06.860> subtle<00:02:07.130> difference<00:02:07.670> but<00:02:07.790> you<00:02:08.360> can

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
it's a subtle difference but you can

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.690 
it's a subtle difference but you can
hear<00:02:08.960> it's<00:02:09.110> got<00:02:09.320> just<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.770> bit<00:02:10.009> more<00:02:10.160> depth<00:02:10.429> and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
hear it's got just a bit more depth and

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.020 
hear it's got just a bit more depth and
it's<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.600> really<00:02:11.810> really<00:02:12.620> nice<00:02:12.770> sound<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.910> I'll

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
it's a really really nice sound so I'll

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.710 
it's a really really nice sound so I'll
take<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.360> off<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.930> move<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.590> gain<00:02:16.070> knob

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
take that off and move the gain knob

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.310 
take that off and move the gain knob
towards<00:02:17.720> one<00:02:18.560> or<00:02:18.590> two<00:02:18.890> o'clock<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.140> bridge

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
towards one or two o'clock on the bridge

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.940 
towards one or two o'clock on the bridge
humbucker<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:22.040> then<00:02:22.750> move<00:02:23.750> tube<00:02:24.200> mix<00:02:24.500> to

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
humbucker and then move tube mix to

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.850 
humbucker and then move tube mix to
blend<00:02:25.520> of<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.820> 66<00:02:26.420> actually<00:02:27.140> I'll<00:02:27.380> move<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.740> to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
blend of the 66 actually I'll move it to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.699 
blend of the 66 actually I'll move it to
the<00:02:27.980> e<00:02:28.010> r84<00:02:28.520> side<00:02:29.060> things<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.200> get<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> much

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
the e r84 side things so you get a much

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:45.149 
the e r84 side things so you get a much
more<00:02:31.280> British<00:02:31.880> sound

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.270 

which<00:02:46.159> sounds<00:02:46.640> pretty<00:02:46.969> monstrous<00:02:47.659> and<00:02:48.280> then

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
which sounds pretty monstrous and then

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.349 
which sounds pretty monstrous and then
you<00:02:50.000> engage<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.689> tight<00:02:50.900> smoke<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:52.939> sounds

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
you engage the tight smoke and it sounds

00:02:53.359 --> 00:03:02.830 
you engage the tight smoke and it sounds
probably

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.630 

got<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> lot<00:03:04.020> more<00:03:04.230> depth<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.740> then<00:03:05.130> take<00:03:05.490> that

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
got a lot more depth and then take that

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.340 
got a lot more depth and then take that
off<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:05.850> put<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.270> bright<00:03:06.450> switch<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:06.960> this

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
off and put the bright switch on this

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:24.020 
off and put the bright switch on this
