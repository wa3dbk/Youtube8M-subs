that I was gonna remember a whole lot
from<00:00:17.699> last<00:00:17.910> year<00:00:18.210> if<00:00:19.699> it's<00:00:20.699> starting<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.180> sink

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
from last year if it's starting to sink

wanted<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:25.220> was<00:00:26.220> practicing<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:26.849> these

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
wanted to was practicing with these

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.150 
wanted to was practicing with these
speedometer<00:00:27.720> calibration<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:29.010> you're

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
speedometer calibration so you're

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.910 
speedometer calibration so you're
running<00:00:29.369> 20<00:00:29.849> okay<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.080> she<00:00:31.140> accelerates<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
running 20 okay so she accelerates the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.120 
running 20 okay so she accelerates the
20<00:00:32.250> she<00:00:32.820> drives<00:00:33.090> through<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.450> sign<00:00:33.780> at<00:00:34.110> 20<00:00:34.590> but

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
20 she drives through the sign at 20 but

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.270 
20 she drives through the sign at 20 but
you<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.700> stop<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.149> watch<00:00:36.860> sign

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
you you stop the watch sign

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.610 
you you stop the watch sign
and<00:00:39.790> I'm<00:00:39.970> gonna<00:00:40.150> start<00:00:40.510> at<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.900> first<00:00:41.080> marker

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
and I'm gonna start at the first marker

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.110 
and I'm gonna start at the first marker
tracking<00:00:42.250> how<00:00:42.520> a<00:00:42.550> lot<00:00:42.730> of<00:00:42.760> things<00:00:43.000> are

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
tracking how a lot of things are

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.229 
tracking how a lot of things are
different<00:00:43.240> to<00:00:44.050> be<00:00:44.230> on<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.840> exactly

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
different to be on and exactly

00:00:48.239 --> 00:01:03.570 
different to be on and exactly
okay

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.740 

it<00:01:04.580> seemed<00:01:04.760> like<00:01:04.790> we<00:01:04.909> progressively<00:01:05.479> like

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
it seemed like we progressively like

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.120 
it seemed like we progressively like
started<00:01:06.080> getting<00:01:06.290> worse<00:01:06.500> all<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:06.799> time

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
started getting worse all the time

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.740 
started getting worse all the time
well<00:01:07.549> this<00:01:07.700> is<00:01:07.820> really<00:01:08.030> but<00:01:08.299> this<00:01:08.390> is<00:01:08.510> really

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
well this is really but this is really

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.700 
well this is really but this is really
close<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.710> something<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:10.909> it's<00:01:11.840> only<00:01:12.170> like<00:01:12.440> one

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
close so something it it's only like one

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.039 
close so something it it's only like one
time<00:01:12.979> was<00:01:13.369> like<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.670> little<00:01:14.030> faltered<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.840> they

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
time was like a little faltered and they

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.390 
time was like a little faltered and they
don't<00:01:15.259> want<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:15.560> I<00:01:15.680> don't<00:01:15.860> want<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.070> say<00:01:16.220> that

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
don't want it I don't want to say that

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.640 
don't want it I don't want to say that
you're<00:01:16.850> wrong<00:01:17.090> or<00:01:17.330> you're<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.600> reason<00:01:17.750> it

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
you're wrong or you're the reason it

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.980 
you're wrong or you're the reason it
could<00:01:19.009> be<00:01:19.220> like<00:01:19.550> where<00:01:19.909> you<00:01:20.240> clicked<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:20.840> in

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
could be like where you clicked it in

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.760 
could be like where you clicked it in
relation<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.560> car<00:01:21.920> Oh<00:01:22.310> point<00:01:22.640> four<00:01:22.970> zero

seven<00:01:38.570> we<00:01:39.410> might<00:01:39.649> have<00:01:39.800> seen<00:01:40.039> anything<00:01:40.429> off

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
seven we might have seen anything off

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.139 
seven we might have seen anything off
that<00:01:41.810> point<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:43.190> know<00:01:43.280> like<00:01:43.460> four<00:01:43.700> tenths<00:01:44.000> of

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
that point you know like four tenths of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.719 
that point you know like four tenths of
a<00:01:44.270> second<00:01:44.750> for<00:01:45.409> this<00:01:45.530> calibration<00:01:45.979> money<00:01:46.490> but

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
a second for this calibration money but

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.279 
a second for this calibration money but
over<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.149> course<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.720> an<00:01:48.110> hour<00:01:48.429> that's<00:01:49.429> gonna

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
over the course of an hour that's gonna

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.290 
over the course of an hour that's gonna
I'm<00:01:51.289> an<00:01:51.500> idiot<00:01:51.619> I<00:01:54.460> had<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:55.610> set<00:01:55.970> at<00:01:56.090> three

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
I'm an idiot I had it set at three

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.389 
I'm an idiot I had it set at three
seventy<00:01:56.720> five<00:01:56.750> point<00:01:57.319> two<00:01:57.440> because<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:58.039> didn't

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
seventy five point two because I didn't

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.130 
seventy five point two because I didn't
change<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.759> down<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.149> zero<00:01:59.450> when<00:01:59.659> we<00:01:59.780> decided

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
change it down to zero when we decided

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.529 
change it down to zero when we decided
to<00:02:00.380> change<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.009> we<00:02:01.759> need<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.030> change<00:02:02.300> it<00:02:02.420> to

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
to change it so we need to change it to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.719 
to change it so we need to change it to
three<00:02:02.929> seventy<00:02:03.319> five<00:02:03.350> point<00:02:03.800> four<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.490> mean

well<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.000> think<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.510> at<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.900> point<00:02:24.019> in<00:02:24.230> time

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
well I think that at this point in time

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.110 
well I think that at this point in time
is<00:02:24.590> where<00:02:24.799> Tabitha<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.549> I<00:02:25.610> are<00:02:25.730> really<00:02:25.880> going

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
is where Tabitha and I are really going

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.070 
is where Tabitha and I are really going
to<00:02:26.209> get<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.600> learn<00:02:26.840> what<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.320> car

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
to get to learn what the car

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.960 
to get to learn what the car
actually<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:28.530> capable<00:02:28.710> of<00:02:29.100> doing<00:02:29.340> I'm

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
actually it's capable of doing I'm

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.840 
actually it's capable of doing I'm
feeling<00:02:30.330> better<00:02:30.480> after<00:02:30.750> today

we went on the second run it's not

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.630 
we went on the second run it's not
difficult<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.240> it's<00:02:39.420> very<00:02:40.020> time-consuming

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
difficult but it's very time-consuming

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.110

we'll<00:02:42.360> probably<00:02:42.510> have<00:02:43.020> at<00:02:43.170> least<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.530> good

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
we'll probably have at least a good

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.700 
we'll probably have at least a good

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
anywhere from five to eight hours in in

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.670 
anywhere from five to eight hours in in
building<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.340> time<00:02:47.550> chart<00:02:47.850> because<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.270> do

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
building the time chart because you do

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.360 
building the time chart because you do
each<00:02:49.680> difference<00:02:50.160> be<00:02:50.840> accelerating<00:02:51.840> to

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
each difference be accelerating to

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.280 
each difference be accelerating to
decelerating<00:02:53.370> two<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.820> five<00:02:54.030> mile<00:02:54.990> an<00:02:55.020> hour

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
decelerating two and five mile an hour

decelerating two and five mile an hour

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
increments from zero to fifty and you do

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.050 
increments from zero to fifty and you do
five<00:02:58.650> runs<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.190> each<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.520> those<00:02:59.640> so<00:02:59.880> that<00:02:59.910> you

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
five runs of each of those so that you

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.910 
five runs of each of those so that you
get<00:03:00.270> your<00:03:00.480> average<00:03:02.180> consistency<00:03:03.180> there<00:03:03.920> yeah

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
get your average consistency there yeah

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.770 
get your average consistency there yeah
so<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.940> last<00:03:06.150> day<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.570> Tricia
