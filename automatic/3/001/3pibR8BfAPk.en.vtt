00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.640
The places filled from the fluttering snow

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.580
Have slowly started to lessen, and now

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.760
We are on toward a world filled with color

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:10.620
Long, long... Woven over long months

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.940
Old, old... and years, old tales

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:29.960
Distant, distant... enter the distant sky

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.900
Far, far... far over each and every place

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:48.480
Basking in warm sunlight rays

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.340
Pink blossoms soar

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.440
The fairies that come to bring word

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.280
Of the end to the season of dancing snow

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.640
Appear, fluttering here and there

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.300
Fresh leaves and buds blossom from trees

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.040
Which had nothing, a florid scene

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:40.140
A transcluent coat of seven colors

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.980
Shallow, shallow mists, their

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:38.680
Curtains I feel disappearing

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:47.220
Intersecting pillars of light

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:57.200
Their layers increasing over and over

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.220
The clouds as if waking from a dream,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.860
Are swept away as the spring wind breaks in

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:17.060
Together with the cherry blossoms in full bloom

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.200
The gates of silence open and

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.800
I race up the steps to where

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:38.920
My memories are brilliantly projected

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.640
Wandering the nine worlds locked out of paradise

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.640
From the gaps appear...

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.240
The places filled from the fluttering snow

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:47.000
Have slowly started to lessen, and now

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.740
We are on toward a world filled with color

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.680
Playing in a blizzard of cherry blossoms

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.240
I remember what happened that day

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:17.080
As the seasons are ever repeated
