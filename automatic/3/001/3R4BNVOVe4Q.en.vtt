00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.110 
set up and I'm set a top dead center
right<00:00:41.960> now<00:00:42.290> we<00:00:42.350> installed<00:00:42.980> our<00:00:43.070> pointer<00:00:43.489> and

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
right now we installed our pointer and

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
right now we installed our pointer and
I'm<00:00:44.270> just<00:00:44.390> gonna<00:00:44.480> give<00:00:44.719> you<00:00:44.809> kind<00:00:44.930> of<00:00:45.020> a<00:00:45.110> quick

I'm just gonna give you kind of a quick

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.810 
I'm just gonna give you kind of a quick
overview<00:00:45.680> now<00:00:46.010> this<00:00:46.190> is<00:00:46.370> just<00:00:46.550> a<00:00:46.640> quick

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
overview now this is just a quick

overview to show you how its installed a

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.029 
overview to show you how its installed a
basics<00:00:50.300> of<00:00:50.420> how<00:00:50.539> it<00:00:50.660> works<00:00:50.870> but<00:00:51.710> when<00:00:51.829> we<00:00:51.920> get

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
basics of how it works but when we get

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.069 
basics of how it works but when we get
the<00:00:52.190> bike<00:00:52.399> back<00:00:52.700> up<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:53.329> running<00:00:53.629> this<00:00:53.750> engine

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
the bike back up and running this engine

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.660 
the bike back up and running this engine
goes<00:00:54.230> back<00:00:54.410> in<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.620> frame<00:00:54.800> we<00:00:54.980> install<00:00:55.520> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
goes back in the frame we install the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.920 
goes back in the frame we install the
ignition<00:00:56.090> which<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.390> going<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.570> be<00:00:56.629> a<00:00:56.660> Dyna

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
ignition which is going to be a Dyna

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.200 
ignition which is going to be a Dyna
electronic<00:00:57.559> ignition<00:00:57.829> at<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:58.699> point<00:00:59.030> then

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
electronic ignition at that point then

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.360 
electronic ignition at that point then
we'll<00:00:59.329> actually<00:00:59.510> start<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.109> bike<00:01:00.289> set<00:01:01.160> it<00:01:01.280> up

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
we'll actually start the bike set it up

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.520 
we'll actually start the bike set it up
with<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.699> timing<00:01:02.359> light<00:01:02.539> and<00:01:02.750> actually<00:01:03.320> show

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
with the timing light and actually show

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.490 
with the timing light and actually show
you<00:01:04.300> true<00:01:05.300> timing<00:01:05.750> rather<00:01:05.930> than<00:01:06.170> just<00:01:06.410> the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
you true timing rather than just the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.560 
you true timing rather than just the
static<00:01:06.890> timing<00:01:07.160> or<00:01:07.490> just<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.000> purpose<00:01:08.330> of<00:01:08.479> the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
static timing or just the purpose of the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.180 
static timing or just the purpose of the
degree<00:01:08.840> wheel<00:01:09.050> here<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:09.860> what<00:01:09.979> I'm<00:01:10.039> going<00:01:10.130> to

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
degree wheel here so what I'm going to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.350 
degree wheel here so what I'm going to
do<00:01:10.310> first<00:01:10.580> of<00:01:10.729> all<00:01:10.789> is<00:01:10.850> I'm<00:01:11.060> going<00:01:11.149> to<00:01:11.240> go<00:01:11.330> over

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
do first of all is I'm going to go over

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.300 
do first of all is I'm going to go over
here<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:12.080> we've<00:01:12.259> got<00:01:12.289> our<00:01:12.500> special<00:01:12.890> tool<00:01:13.069> to

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
here and we've got our special tool to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.650 
here and we've got our special tool to
take<00:01:13.459> the<00:01:13.580> timing<00:01:13.789> plug<00:01:14.119> out<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.539> should

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
take the timing plug out you should

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.089 
take the timing plug out you should
always<00:01:14.810> use<00:01:14.959> this<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:15.709> don't<00:01:15.800> do<00:01:15.950> any

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:16.099 
always use this so you don't do any

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:17.770 
always use this so you don't do any
damage<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.670> timing<00:01:17.000> plug<00:01:17.209> on<00:01:17.390> top<00:01:17.569> of<00:01:17.720> the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
damage to the timing plug on top of the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.130 
damage to the timing plug on top of the
engine

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
engine

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.380 
engine
now<00:01:18.679> this<00:01:19.399> is<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.580> little<00:01:19.849> tighter<00:01:20.060> when<00:01:20.270> the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
now this is a little tighter when the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.999 
now this is a little tighter when the
carburetors<00:01:20.959> are<00:01:21.110> on<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:21.410> it's<00:01:21.500> in<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.740> frame

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
carburetors are on and it's in the frame

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.830 
carburetors are on and it's in the frame
but<00:01:22.670> for<00:01:22.819> our<00:01:22.910> intents<00:01:23.209> and<00:01:23.300> purposes<00:01:23.630> right

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
but for our intents and purposes right

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.690 
but for our intents and purposes right
now<00:01:23.899> you'll<00:01:24.410> get<00:01:24.649> to<00:01:24.770> see<00:01:24.950> exactly<00:01:25.310> how<00:01:25.429> it's

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
now you'll get to see exactly how it's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.600 
now you'll get to see exactly how it's
set<00:01:25.880> up<00:01:26.349> if<00:01:27.349> we<00:01:27.500> look<00:01:27.679> down<00:01:27.709> in<00:01:28.039> this<00:01:28.220> timing

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
set up if we look down in this timing

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.419 
set up if we look down in this timing
hole<00:01:28.789> once<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:29.300> take<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.020> plug<00:01:30.229> out<00:01:30.440> here<00:01:30.709> you

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
hole once I take the plug out here you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:32.919 
hole once I take the plug out here you
should<00:01:31.670> be<00:01:31.819> able<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.030> see<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.450> mark<00:01:32.660> there<00:01:32.899> and

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
should be able to see the mark there and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.020 
should be able to see the mark there and
we're<00:01:33.170> lined<00:01:33.410> up<00:01:33.590> at<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.860> t<00:01:34.099> mark<00:01:34.789> which<00:01:35.000> is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
we're lined up at the t mark which is

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.730 
we're lined up at the t mark which is
top<00:01:35.300> dead<00:01:35.509> center<00:01:35.899> for<00:01:36.080> cylinder<00:01:36.319> one<00:01:36.590> and

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
top dead center for cylinder one and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.120 
top dead center for cylinder one and
four<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.630> once<00:01:38.899> we've<00:01:39.050> got<00:01:39.229> that<00:01:39.440> set<00:01:39.679> up<00:01:39.709> we

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
four and once we've got that set up we

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.550 
four and once we've got that set up we
come<00:01:40.280> back<00:01:40.489> around<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.000> front<00:01:41.300> here<00:01:41.560> and

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
come back around to the front here and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.109 
come back around to the front here and
we<00:01:42.649> look<00:01:42.800> at<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:42.979> degree<00:01:43.280> wheel<00:01:43.489> and<00:01:43.819> we<00:01:43.940> see

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
we look at the degree wheel and we see

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.120 
we look at the degree wheel and we see
that<00:01:44.239> we're<00:01:44.390> set<00:01:44.660> with<00:01:44.899> our<00:01:45.170> pointer<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.890> zero

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
that we're set with our pointer to zero

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.859 
that we're set with our pointer to zero
degrees<00:01:46.459> which<00:01:46.729> is<00:01:46.759> top<00:01:47.060> dead<00:01:47.270> center<00:01:47.690> on

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
degrees which is top dead center on

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.729 
degrees which is top dead center on
cylinders<00:01:48.709> one<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.220> two<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:50.440> you<00:01:51.440> can<00:01:51.590> see

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:51.739 
cylinders one and two and you can see

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.260 
cylinders one and two and you can see
how<00:01:51.860> that's<00:01:52.009> marked<00:01:52.429> right<00:01:52.640> there<00:01:52.880> we<00:01:53.239> have

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
how that's marked right there we have

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.609 
how that's marked right there we have
two<00:01:53.509> additional<00:01:53.750> marks<00:01:54.229> here<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:54.530> they're

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
two additional marks here and they're

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.260 
two additional marks here and they're
gonna<00:01:54.709> be<00:01:54.890> for<00:01:55.099> timing<00:01:55.520> this<00:01:55.729> is<00:01:55.880> gonna<00:01:56.000> be<00:01:56.179> the

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
gonna be for timing this is gonna be the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.330 
gonna be for timing this is gonna be the
five<00:01:56.450> degree<00:01:56.810> mark<00:01:57.050> which<00:01:57.679> is<00:01:57.709> actually<00:01:58.190> what

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
five degree mark which is actually what

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.309 
five degree mark which is actually what
you<00:01:58.459> will<00:01:58.610> set<00:01:58.789> out<00:01:58.940> at<00:01:59.060> idle<00:01:59.360> this<00:02:00.080> is<00:02:00.229> the

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
you will set out at idle this is the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.380 
you will set out at idle this is the
full<00:02:00.530> advanced<00:02:00.860> mark<00:02:01.280> which<00:02:01.819> is<00:02:01.970> thirty<00:02:02.179> seven

top dead center and the beauty of this

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.949 
top dead center and the beauty of this
is<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:07.580> can<00:02:07.910> do<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.209> with<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.690> engine

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
is you can do this with the engine

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.990 
is you can do this with the engine
running<00:02:09.289> in<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.560> frame<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.129> you<00:02:10.640> can<00:02:10.759> put<00:02:10.910> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
running in the frame and you can put the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.240 
running in the frame and you can put the
plug<00:02:11.209> back<00:02:11.239> in<00:02:11.660> here<00:02:11.989> on<00:02:12.379> top<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.220> don't

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
plug back in here on top and you don't

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.220 
plug back in here on top and you don't
have<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.700> try<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:13.970> fiddle<00:02:14.780> around<00:02:14.930> with

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
have to try to fiddle around with

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.020 
have to try to fiddle around with
looking<00:02:15.980> through<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.310> hole<00:02:16.520> having<00:02:16.880> either

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
looking through that hole having either

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.530 
looking through that hole having either
an<00:02:17.180> oil<00:02:17.330> spray<00:02:17.690> coming<00:02:17.990> out<00:02:18.230> of<00:02:18.380> it

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
an oil spray coming out of it

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.580 
an oil spray coming out of it
while<00:02:18.659> you're<00:02:18.810> trying<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.140> use<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> timing

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
while you're trying to use a timing

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.100 
while you're trying to use a timing
light<00:02:19.739> or<00:02:20.189> if<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.120> use<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.510> factory<00:02:21.900> Honda

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
light or if you use the factory Honda

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.440 
light or if you use the factory Honda
tool<00:02:22.469> which<00:02:22.739> was<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> clear<00:02:23.250> acrylic<00:02:23.670> plug<00:02:24.239> that

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
tool which was a clear acrylic plug that

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.020 
tool which was a clear acrylic plug that
went<00:02:24.629> in<00:02:24.750> there<00:02:25.159> those<00:02:26.159> things<00:02:26.430> get<00:02:26.640> fogged<00:02:26.939> up

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
went in there those things get fogged up

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.429 
went in there those things get fogged up
with<00:02:27.209> oil<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.540> are<00:02:27.629> very<00:02:27.780> hard<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.140> see<00:02:28.319> as

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
with oil and are very hard to see as

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.130 
with oil and are very hard to see as
well<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.609> this<00:02:29.939> really<00:02:30.180> does<00:02:30.480> simplify<00:02:31.079> this

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
well so this really does simplify this

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.869 
well so this really does simplify this
considerably<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.549> bit<00:02:32.700> more

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
considerably and it's a bit more

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.789 
considerably and it's a bit more
accurate<00:02:33.420> because<00:02:33.599> now<00:02:33.959> we've<00:02:34.170> actually<00:02:34.409> got

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
accurate because now we've actually got

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.830 
accurate because now we've actually got
all<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.819> our<00:02:35.879> degrees<00:02:36.180> broken<00:02:36.659> down

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
all of our degrees broken down

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.479 
all of our degrees broken down
throughout<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.379> full<00:02:37.560> range<00:02:37.799> here<00:02:38.189> and<00:02:38.220> you

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
throughout the full range here and you

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.099 
throughout the full range here and you
can<00:02:38.640> see<00:02:38.819> what<00:02:38.970> each<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.359> the<00:02:39.450> four<00:02:39.629> cylinders

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
can see what each of the four cylinders

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.080 
can see what each of the four cylinders
is<00:02:40.260> doing<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.400> what<00:02:41.549> we're<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.819> do<00:02:41.970> is

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
is doing so what we're going to do is

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.369 
is doing so what we're going to do is
I'm<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.239> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.540> roll<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.870> through<00:02:43.079> here

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
I'm just going to roll it through here

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.440 
I'm just going to roll it through here
we<00:02:44.370> need<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.549> go<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.849> direction<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.299> rotation

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
we need to go the direction of rotation

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.809 
we need to go the direction of rotation
which<00:02:46.049> looking<00:02:46.349> at<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.650> front<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.159> actually

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
which looking at the front is actually

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.910 
which looking at the front is actually
going<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.450> be<00:02:48.540> clockwise<00:02:48.810> now<00:02:49.379> normally<00:02:49.799> we

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
going to be clockwise now normally we

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.080 
going to be clockwise now normally we
would<00:02:50.069> be<00:02:50.189> doing<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.639> off<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:51.000> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
would be doing this off of the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.839 
would be doing this off of the
alternator<00:02:51.540> back<00:02:52.500> here<00:02:52.709> at<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.889> back<00:02:53.099> but

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
alternator back here at the back but

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.580 
alternator back here at the back but
because<00:02:54.060> everything's<00:02:54.659> apartments<00:02:55.290> out<00:02:55.379> here

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
because everything's apartments out here

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.899 
because everything's apartments out here
in<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.739> open<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.220> little<00:02:56.430> easier<00:02:56.669> for<00:02:56.700> me

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
in the open it's a little easier for me

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.089 
in the open it's a little easier for me
to<00:02:57.000> demonstrate<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.599> this<00:02:57.720> way<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:58.769> we<00:02:58.889> turn

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
to demonstrate it this way so as we turn

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.800 
to demonstrate it this way so as we turn
this<00:02:59.340> through<00:02:59.669> we're<00:03:00.269> gonna<00:03:00.359> come<00:03:00.629> around

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.770 

right<00:03:03.810> about<00:03:04.409> here<00:03:05.099> we<00:03:05.639> should<00:03:05.700> see<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> mark<00:03:06.599> on

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
right about here we should see a mark on

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.270 
right about here we should see a mark on
the<00:03:06.900> flywheel<00:03:07.019> now<00:03:07.650> if<00:03:07.709> we<00:03:07.799> go<00:03:07.919> back<00:03:08.099> and<00:03:08.220> we

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
the flywheel now if we go back and we

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.849 
the flywheel now if we go back and we
look<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.549> here<00:03:08.879> we<00:03:09.260> see<00:03:10.260> our<00:03:10.290> full<00:03:10.500> advance

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
look in here we see our full advance

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.199 
look in here we see our full advance
mark<00:03:11.250> that's<00:03:12.180> for<00:03:12.450> cylinder<00:03:12.870> number<00:03:13.260> two<00:03:14.209> now

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
mark that's for cylinder number two now

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.879 
mark that's for cylinder number two now
I'm<00:03:15.329> gonna<00:03:15.450> roll<00:03:15.629> it<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.840> little<00:03:16.019> bit<00:03:16.200> more<00:03:16.409> and

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
I'm gonna roll it a little bit more and

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.379 
I'm gonna roll it a little bit more and
we<00:03:17.099> should<00:03:17.280> be<00:03:17.430> coming<00:03:17.760> up<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.030> we'll<00:03:18.150> see<00:03:18.299> the

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
we should be coming up and we'll see the

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.720 
we should be coming up and we'll see the
F<00:03:18.540> mark<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.709> there<00:03:19.889> we<00:03:20.010> go<00:03:20.159> right<00:03:20.400> there<00:03:20.700> and

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
F mark and there we go right there and

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.460 
F mark and there we go right there and
that<00:03:20.939> corresponds<00:03:21.569> with<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.780> orange<00:03:22.049> mark<00:03:22.290> on

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
that corresponds with the orange mark on

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.699 
that corresponds with the orange mark on
the<00:03:22.560> front<00:03:22.799> here<00:03:23.930> then<00:03:24.930> we<00:03:25.079> go<00:03:25.169> to<00:03:25.199> top<00:03:25.500> dead

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
the front here then we go to top dead

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.399 
the front here then we go to top dead
center<00:03:26.159> and<00:03:27.060> we<00:03:27.239> should<00:03:27.449> see<00:03:27.629> a<00:03:27.659> t<00:03:27.870> mark<00:03:28.109> again

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
center and we should see a t mark again

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.439 
center and we should see a t mark again
and<00:03:28.590> that's<00:03:28.709> for<00:03:28.919> cylinder<00:03:29.280> two<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.359> will

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
and that's for cylinder two and it will

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:35.070 
and that's for cylinder two and it will
meet<00:03:30.659> me<00:03:30.840> marked<00:03:31.139> two<00:03:31.379> three

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.070 

then<00:03:35.680> we'll<00:03:35.800> continue<00:03:35.950> on<00:03:36.340> around<00:03:37.020> do<00:03:38.020> the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
then we'll continue on around do the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.660 
then we'll continue on around do the
same<00:03:38.350> again<00:03:40.620> we'll<00:03:41.620> see<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:41.920> F<00:03:42.010> mark<00:03:42.310> go<00:03:42.460> by

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
same again we'll see the F mark go by

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.100 
same again we'll see the F mark go by
and<00:03:43.000> then<00:03:43.120> we'll<00:03:43.240> be<00:03:43.360> back<00:03:43.540> at<00:03:43.720> top<00:03:43.900> dead

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
and then we'll be back at top dead

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:51.790 
and then we'll be back at top dead
center<00:03:45.150> around<00:03:46.150> one<00:03:46.480> more<00:03:46.660> time

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.770 

should<00:03:52.370> be<00:03:52.490> a<00:03:52.520> top<00:03:52.760> dead<00:03:52.970> center<00:03:53.240> mark<00:03:53.480> again

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
should be a top dead center mark again

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.360 
should be a top dead center mark again
and<00:03:53.990> then<00:03:54.080> finally<00:03:54.500> we're<00:03:54.620> going<00:03:54.710> to<00:03:54.770> go<00:03:54.950> this

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
and then finally we're going to go this

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.090 
and then finally we're going to go this
would<00:03:55.550> be<00:03:55.610> one<00:03:55.880> full<00:03:56.390> revolution<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.950> we're

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
would be one full revolution and we're

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.450 
would be one full revolution and we're
back<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.550> top<00:03:58.760> dead<00:03:59.000> center<00:03:59.360> mark<00:04:00.460> four

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
back to the top dead center mark four

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.840 
back to the top dead center mark four
cylinders<00:04:01.910> one<00:04:02.270> and<00:04:02.450> two<00:04:02.600> now<00:04:03.670> obviously<00:04:04.670> once

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
cylinders one and two now obviously once

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.940 
cylinders one and two now obviously once
we<00:04:04.970> get<00:04:05.180> ready<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.480> set<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.690> timing<00:04:06.200> back<00:04:06.470> here

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
we get ready to set the timing back here

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.160 
we get ready to set the timing back here
with<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.580> diamond<00:04:07.850> ignition<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:08.930> if<00:04:09.050> you're

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
with the diamond ignition and if you're

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.260 
with the diamond ignition and if you're
using<00:04:09.320> points<00:04:09.830> it<00:04:10.340> basically<00:04:10.730> follows<00:04:10.970> the

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
using points it basically follows the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.210 
using points it basically follows the
same<00:04:11.420> procedure<00:04:11.800> then<00:04:12.800> we'll<00:04:12.980> have<00:04:13.100> an

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
same procedure then we'll have an

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.710 
same procedure then we'll have an
accurate<00:04:13.550> representation<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:14.360> where<00:04:14.480> we're

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
accurate representation of where we're

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.199 
accurate representation of where we're
at<00:04:14.870> we<00:04:15.650> can<00:04:15.800> actually<00:04:15.980> set<00:04:16.370> our<00:04:16.489> marks<00:04:16.790> here

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
at we can actually set our marks here

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.000 
at we can actually set our marks here
and<00:04:17.300> then<00:04:17.840> we'll<00:04:17.989> know<00:04:18.170> that<00:04:18.440> everything<00:04:18.860> is

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
and then we'll know that everything is

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.220 
and then we'll know that everything is
exactly<00:04:19.610> precise<00:04:20.090> particularly<00:04:21.020> if<00:04:21.080> we're

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
exactly precise particularly if we're

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.380 
exactly precise particularly if we're
running<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:22.400> electronic<00:04:22.850> ignition<00:04:23.090> where

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
running the electronic ignition where

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.630 
running the electronic ignition where
both<00:04:23.890> pickups<00:04:24.890> are<00:04:25.100> independently

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
both pickups are independently

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.280 
both pickups are independently
adjustable<00:04:26.060> just<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.450> same<00:04:26.630> as<00:04:26.810> this<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.170> the

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
adjustable just the same as this so the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.960 
adjustable just the same as this so the
points<00:04:27.590> are<00:04:27.740> when<00:04:28.280> you're<00:04:28.400> running<00:04:28.520> two<00:04:28.760> sets

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
points are when you're running two sets

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.320 
points are when you're running two sets
points<00:04:29.740> again<00:04:30.740> much<00:04:31.370> more<00:04:31.610> accurate<00:04:32.060> than<00:04:32.090> the

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
points again much more accurate than the

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.180 
points again much more accurate than the
original<00:04:32.750> factory<00:04:32.930> settings<00:04:33.350> sometimes<00:04:33.830> they

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
original factory settings sometimes they

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.770 
original factory settings sometimes they
can<00:04:34.340> be<00:04:34.460> off<00:04:34.580> by<00:04:34.790> a<00:04:34.820> degree<00:04:35.180> or<00:04:35.330> two<00:04:35.480> which

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
can be off by a degree or two which

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.120 
can be off by a degree or two which
doesn't<00:04:36.200> sound<00:04:36.350> like<00:04:36.500> much<00:04:36.710> but<00:04:36.740> with<00:04:37.040> the

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
doesn't sound like much but with the

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.410 
doesn't sound like much but with the
Goldwing<00:04:37.490> it's<00:04:37.610> pretty<00:04:37.790> critical<00:04:37.970> that<00:04:38.240> the

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
Goldwing it's pretty critical that the

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.870 
Goldwing it's pretty critical that the
timing<00:04:38.630> side<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.080> side<00:04:39.260> is<00:04:39.500> very<00:04:40.400> accurate

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
timing side to side is very accurate

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.220 
timing side to side is very accurate
because<00:04:41.000> it's<00:04:41.300> not<00:04:41.450> the<00:04:41.720> engine<00:04:41.990> will<00:04:42.080> make

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
because it's not the engine will make

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.750 
because it's not the engine will make
some<00:04:42.410> funny<00:04:42.620> noises<00:04:42.860> they'll<00:04:43.250> usually<00:04:43.370> knock

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
some funny noises they'll usually knock

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.310 
some funny noises they'll usually knock
a<00:04:43.790> little<00:04:44.060> bit<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.570> your<00:04:44.720> performance<00:04:45.170> will

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
a little bit and your performance will

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.110 
a little bit and your performance will
suffer<00:04:45.680> as<00:04:45.800> well<00:04:46.010> so<00:04:46.670> that's<00:04:46.760> where<00:04:46.970> we're<00:04:47.090> at

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
suffer as well so that's where we're at

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.800 
suffer as well so that's where we're at
right<00:04:47.180> now

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
right now

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.420 
right now
again<00:04:48.170> just<00:04:48.350> a<00:04:48.530> quick<00:04:48.710> overview<00:04:49.130> of<00:04:49.280> it

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
again just a quick overview of it

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.370 
again just a quick overview of it
actually<00:04:49.790> installed<00:04:50.390> setup<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.050> everything

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
actually installed setup and everything

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.350 
actually installed setup and everything
is<00:04:51.500> done<00:04:51.680> right<00:04:51.950> I<00:04:52.220> also<00:04:52.700> want<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.060> preface

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
is done right I also want to preface

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.940 
is done right I also want to preface
this<00:04:53.510> with<00:04:53.570> of<00:04:54.020> course<00:04:54.230> we<00:04:54.380> are<00:04:54.500> using<00:04:54.830> new

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
this with of course we are using new

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.770 
this with of course we are using new
parts<00:04:55.340> here<00:04:55.610> but<00:04:56.150> if<00:04:56.240> you're<00:04:56.360> going<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.660> do

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
parts here but if you're going to do

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.570 
parts here but if you're going to do
this<00:04:56.930> on<00:04:57.110> your<00:04:57.290> bike<00:04:57.500> you<00:04:57.830> should<00:04:58.040> definitely

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
this on your bike you should definitely

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.910 
this on your bike you should definitely
have<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:59.420> timing<00:04:59.720> belts<00:05:00.020> properly<00:05:00.470> adjusted

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
have the timing belts properly adjusted
