00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
outline process so I grabbed a little

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.699 
outline process so I grabbed a little
bit<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.729> want<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.970> grab<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.530> mostly<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.619> the

tip because everything on its going to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.420 
tip because everything on its going to
collide<00:02:12.330> better

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
this part towards this bottom point here

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.229 
this part towards this bottom point here
a<00:03:18.319> little<00:03:19.319> bit<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:20.009> little<00:03:20.400> harder<00:03:20.729> part<00:03:21.030> is

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
a little bit the little harder part is

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.240 
a little bit the little harder part is
going<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:21.419> be<00:03:21.509> that<00:03:22.500> liner<00:03:22.769> on<00:03:22.979> the<00:03:23.009> tear<00:03:23.340> duct

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
going to be that liner on the tear duct

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.710 
going to be that liner on the tear duct
it's<00:03:26.250> hard<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.609> get<00:03:26.699> into<00:03:26.849> that<00:03:27.030> site<00:03:27.329> there

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
it's hard to get into that site there

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.860 
it's hard to get into that site there
but<00:03:28.709> we<00:03:28.799> would<00:03:28.949> I<00:03:28.979> start<00:03:29.370> with<00:03:29.519> a<00:03:29.579> tip<00:03:30.569> of<00:03:30.780> the

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
but we would I start with a tip of the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.479 
but we would I start with a tip of the
brush<00:03:31.019> look<00:03:31.859> straight<00:03:32.009> up<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:33.799> then<00:03:34.799> color<00:03:35.370> it

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
brush look straight up and then color it

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.969 
brush look straight up and then color it
in<00:03:36.019> having<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.109> angle<00:03:37.409> brush<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.739> keeps

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:37.979 
in having the angle brush it keeps

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.349 
in having the angle brush it keeps
because<00:03:38.189> you<00:03:38.310> can<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.459> press<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.180> brush

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
because you can just press the brush

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.059 
because you can just press the brush
down<00:03:39.389> and<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:39.900> already<00:03:40.019> have<00:03:40.229> the<00:03:40.259> line<00:03:40.500> what

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
down and you already have the line what

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.149 
down and you already have the line what
you<00:03:41.159> have<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> do<00:03:41.489> next<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.419> just<00:03:42.689> fill<00:03:42.959> in<00:03:43.169> let

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
you have to do next is just fill in let

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.189 
you have to do next is just fill in let
that's<00:03:44.340> pretty<00:03:44.549> much<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:45.750> can<00:03:45.930> stretch

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
that's pretty much it you can stretch

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.349 
that's pretty much it you can stretch
that<00:03:46.259> line<00:03:46.919> all<00:03:47.189> the<00:03:47.220> way<00:03:47.400> out<00:03:47.489> as<00:03:47.819> much<00:03:48.060> as<00:03:48.209> you
