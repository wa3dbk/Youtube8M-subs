pokemons<00:02:11.200> there<00:02:11.380> are<00:02:11.530> equal<00:02:12.370> evolutions<00:02:13.350> so

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
pokemons there are equal evolutions so

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.860 
pokemons there are equal evolutions so
let's<00:02:14.590> get<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.799> New<00:02:15.040> yes<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.640> we<00:02:16.480> are<00:02:16.600> going<00:02:16.750> to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
let's get to New yes and we are going to

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.490 
let's get to New yes and we are going to
raise<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.880> speed<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.150> attack<00:02:19.840> but<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.380> have

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
raise the speed and attack but you have

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.559 
raise the speed and attack but you have
already<00:02:20.709> seen<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.850> are<00:02:22.000> watching<00:02:22.209> to

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.610 
shoot again being at school but II
beulah<00:02:39.550> evolutions<00:02:40.330> are<00:02:40.690> much<00:02:41.110> cooler<00:02:41.380> than

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
beulah evolutions are much cooler than

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.700 
beulah evolutions are much cooler than
even<00:02:42.420> Eevee<00:02:43.420> evolution

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.830 

and<00:02:50.710> for<00:02:51.010> pixel<00:02:51.400> sales<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> hurricane

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
and for pixel sales for the hurricane

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.030 
and for pixel sales for the hurricane
and<00:02:53.440> let's<00:02:54.010> boost<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.550> speed<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.820> little<00:02:55.060> bit

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
and let's boost the speed a little bit

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.820 
and let's boost the speed a little bit
there<00:02:57.040> we<00:02:57.190> go<00:02:57.840> we're<00:02:58.840> going<00:02:58.960> to<00:02:59.020> switch<00:02:59.350> all

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
there we go we're going to switch all

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.230
