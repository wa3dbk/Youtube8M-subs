00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.100
 Who are you? 

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:30.801
 My name is Roy Miller, General. I'm a US Army officer. 

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.702
 Why are you here, Miller? 

00:00:32.703 --> 00:00:34.503
 I'm here to show you. 

00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:37.004
 FROM BOURN'S DIRECTOR ULTIMATE AND BOURN'S MYTH 

00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:49.805
 What do you think you're doing here, Miller? Are you here for some reason? 

00:00:49.806 --> 00:00:52.306
 I'm here to find weapons and save lives. 

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:55.907
 - That's a little more complicated. - Not for me. 

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:57.508
 HAS BEEN DEPENDED TO YOUR MIS 

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:58.909
 Lawrie Dayne, Wallstreet Journal. 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.510
 - Is it worth returning with empty hands? - No. 

00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:03.711
 I read your articles. 

00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:07.212
 You are quoting a resource named Magellan. Could it be the US envoy during the war? 

00:01:07.213 --> 00:01:08.813
 I'm sorry, I'm not talking about resources. 

00:01:08.814 --> 00:01:10.214
 BUT NOT HAVING ANSWERS 

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:11.015
 Who is Magellan? 

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:12.616
 Magellan is the best source we've ever had. 

00:01:12.617 --> 00:01:15.317
 - Have you ever been to Magellan's tips? - No. 

00:01:15.318 --> 00:01:16.318
 There's nothing there. 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.519
 Boss, we're just doing our job here. The reasons don't matter. 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 Yes, I do. 

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:22.121
 People out there are dying. I want to know why. 

00:01:22.122 --> 00:01:23.522
 There was no other option 

00:01:23.523 --> 00:01:26.323
 If you want to know what really happened, you have to find Magellan. 

00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:28.824
 Do what you have to do. I'll show him. 

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:32.425
 I know what you did. 

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:35.426
 We have a problem. 

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:38.027
 - As long as he lives, he's a threat to us. - We have a plan. 

00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:40.928
 - Is it left? - 12 minutes, sir. 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.629
 - Remove him. - I have got him. 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.830
 The command is to kill, not capture. No shots off. 

00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:50.931
 You have no idea what you're playing with. 

00:01:50.932 --> 00:01:52.532
 Deal with it or get out of the way! 

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:53.633
 NEVER EYE BEFORE THE CONSEQUENCES 

00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:02.234
 You're my prisoner. You will be shown. 

00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:05.335
