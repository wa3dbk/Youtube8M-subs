00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:10.269
 but they have been in for so long 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.290
 but they are just fine and 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.940
 yes i have tried i have been painting over the years 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.439
 but every time I come back to the first Paris and Bossche 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.119
 yes especially of natural ice could be important for the rail in this just sit 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.699
 yes like a house 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.800
 yes I swear by natural ice 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.090
 well i know there is yesterday that is the one who always made it 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.680
 from my driver ago and 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.320

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.450
 yes I am always very satisfied there so no bottleneck you and 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.430
 year cell for nature also demands precisely 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.340
 The band consists the hardness of the school shoes for the first time is good 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.670
 they are not too hard and do not soften 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.960
 and i just never and never very good 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.590
 that is also the national debt that won the clock in Sweden last year 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.580
 Yes is not European requirement is I have 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.390
 from nowadays without put 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.770
 well he hit combination himself 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.840
 the experimental film ets walk with curves and with rain and rain 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.080
 positions and 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.510
 days to wait yes what in Japan delayed a material truck for 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.710
 explain that it is over the two performances anyway is suspected 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.720
 shortly before that natural ice and a few for the artificial ice 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.590
 and we still have a separate pair of tube with a special use for it 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.380
 bidding houses 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.660
 of many other circumstances 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.350
 and the agents 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.670
 enough enough material to choose from 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.400
 these tubes are everything you need for this project 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.260
 yes the site 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.820
 in even as long as I like the marathon skating goes scallop 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.120
 in the front that works just fine 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.570
 you are and you are free again 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.950
 in the fitting to your shoes and 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.770
 so what do you want me to be very important 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.749
 I always have that with an emotional material band 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.020
 that's why i'm worried about spending time yes that's just up to that 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.450
 me and that we are actually selling to someone and I think I think so 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.670
 that then again skates are those that have it
