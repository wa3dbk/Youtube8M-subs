00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.750
 download a file that will leave you 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:31.830
 in the description that was going to be this 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.340

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.340
 they open it 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.059

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.340
 being that the one that takes so much 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.810

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.720
 of this program called horizon 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.850

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.880

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.420

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.500
 searching 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.500
 and then we open it 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.000
 and this will look like this 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.660
 and we are going to give it 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.360
 we're going to give you here on device explorer and 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.240
 here is the government

 here I already have about 16 gigas 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.830
 be as long as it is greater 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.830
 and we give in yenin file 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.370
 then we look in the writing and the pack 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.370
 of pictures 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.569

 well, now 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.919
 to put it on the xbox I do not think it's 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.520
 Need to say it but they have to go to 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:23.919
 the last tab of the interface start 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:26.440

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.050
 choose the ucb 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.950
