00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 all right 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.019
 Boys girls that as designed 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.760
 consumer welcome to a new calculation 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.680
 with what is the same thing I let go of 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.330
 sheet metal while driving do not worry 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.920
 everything is controlled I'm looking at the 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.660
 highway today on the highway all right 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.599
 although it seems that he is in heaven 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.130
 interstellar why the white light that 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.990
 it comes on the outside, actually, I'm in the 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.820
 planet earth okay okay there are 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.339
 I want to tell you about money , money is 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.829
 good subject a bit always controversial 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.900
 rough sometimes even uncomfortable 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.370
 talk but appreciate me I feel like 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.410
 approach it from a point of view a 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.760
 little different I do not want to talk about one 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.010
 I just want to talk about the youtubers not 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.330
 you should earn money or things like that is a 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.100
 topic that I tried sometimes in my 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.530
 blog but I wanted to do it in a 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.270
 video took time thinking about this and I 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.440
 I wanted to do it and how I was doing in the 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.240
 I was carrying the camera, I'm going to 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.310
 seize good let's start with 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.600
 say that luckily unfortunately not 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.730
 be here to talk about systems 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.920
 politicians or history but luckily 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.930
 unfortunately we need the money to 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.790
 live in accordance there is no way to live 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.159
 without money we need to eat if we do not 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.270
 we die and the food normally 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.920
 normally you have to pay 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.960
 the pay is why it's because the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.170
 Belt is you and if the belt you need 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.090
 buying the seeds is quite difficult 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.009
 I imagine there will be people in the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.990
 world that lives without money but they are 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.289
 obviously the exception is normal 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.030
 that you need money to buy food 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.469
 to find a place to live in 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.509
 Sometimes there are people because they already have the house 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.000
 paid for whatever you normally need 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.219
 money for that to eat for 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.619
 live to go pulling with your expenses 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.450
 normal if you're lucky you need a 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.630
 little money to live you settle for 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.700
 little and if you have little luck then no 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.170
 you need more you need it more you have it 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.090
 the ambition to have more or spend more 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.950
 luciano but the reality is that 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.450
 we need the money then my 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.569
 statement asks me what do I do to you 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.819
 Today it is you who live those who 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.729
 You are watching this video that you live 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.079
 said in English it is said not nourished forum 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.509
 living what she does is to live 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.490
 or in Spanish it feels that you live not 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.560
 we are talking about 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.349
 of anything other than how you earn the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.150
 enough money to live this way 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.170
 important is the money in our in 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.209
 our life that they are even in 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.730
 language not such that my you 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.620
 you write if you are students 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.060
 you are young again for all 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.099
 your parents are very good from where 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.380
 your parents do not take my money 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.269
 father is employed in a store of no 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.459
 I know how good then your father takes out 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.870
 the profit money that the store gives 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.569
 The benefit that the store gives is the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.519
 difference between what the 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.200
 products and what they charge the 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.120
 Clients according to a difference 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.280
 legitimate because it's okay for the shopkeeper 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.600
 will be in life but of that difference 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.819
 that is, of the people who will buy the 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.319
 store is what your father lives not 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.319
 my father is a public employee is 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.030
 teacher teachers is doctor is police 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.489
 Well, then live from the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.500
 taxes that is to say of towels that money 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.870
 that we do not like to pay 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.580
 VAT is talking about Spain 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.950
 everything that I know you but not in all 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.100
 countries is quite similar from the VAT of 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.010
 the irpf taxes of all that is from 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.660
 what your father does not live or not I 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.610
 I'm unemployed and I'm charging unemployment 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.560
 Well, then you also come from 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.780
 the taxes that are paying another 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.580
 people or the slave you paid for 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.600
 you while you worked but not at the end 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.230
 of the taxes is not that I am 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.480
 comic for example I'm not an actor or I'm not 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.580
 clown at parties better then you live 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.560
 of what people pay to see your 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.050
 show with which is is something 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.930
 quite direct you 're not in the screenwriter 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.610
 You are a writer or you are 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.560
 Well then you live what the 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.050
 people pay directly or I'm a musician 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.140
 example of what people people pay 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.520
 directly by what you do is not 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.390
 a more direct way but in the end it's 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.739
 the same is you generate a welfare in 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.010
 the people I put my hand because I'm 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.230
 taking the camera placed in a curve 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.480
 people pay directly from their money 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.150
 to give you live because you like what 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.400
 that you offer so if you notice that 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.500
 is a little bit ready you will see that always 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.090
 we live from what other people do 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.000
 not the money that other people give us 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.829
 one way or another has not always been 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.590
 said in Spain and that has a logic 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.750
 historical but I do not want to go into that 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.419
 that hard work and work with 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.699
 hands the effort work is more 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.760
 well seen and it seems that it is more dignified and 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:28.310
 that deserves more pay or that is 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.229
 he deserves more the money he earns in another 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.380
 kind of work, that's not a mentality 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.690
 for me a little old and it seems to me that 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.370
 outdated is not saying I do not want to remove 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.789
 the merit there are people in my family who 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.789
 who works in very hard jobs 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:46.400
 difficult physical manuals little 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.350
 qualified and poorly paid and it seems to me 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.789
 that those who deserve what they deserve 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.229
 better and they deserve that money they earn 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.840
 no, but it is true that there is a 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.580
 mentality especially in Spain of good 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.919
 what they always tell us not like youtube 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.080
 you should not make money because my father 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.590
 gets up at 5 to go to 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.689
 apply stone to the mine does not seem 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.699
 well I admire the work your 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.539
 father but I think that work 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.550
 physical and hard and suffered should not be 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.379
 more honest than in any other there is no 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.729
 I admire people who are capable of 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.479
 earn a living for example with your 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.740
 music 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.860
 someone who learns to touch a 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.599
 instrument that creates music that offers 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.250
 that music and what that music 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.080
 causes in other people leads them to 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.340
 those other people to pay you money 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.310
 so that they live from that for me that 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.280
 It seems more admirable and it gives you more 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.379
 people can not be debatable 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.900
 but does not agree on final 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:41.449
 in to catalog the ways to win 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.449
 money I do not think bad money is 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:48.199
 the one you win cheating or cheating or that 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.580
 or charging exorbitant prices or as 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.259
 has happened with the preferred ones or with the 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.150
 banks that cheating customers 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.909
 making them think that one thing was 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.069
 one way and then that out of another 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.409
 is that yes I think it's a bad money 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.509
 won then that would be my reflection 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.760
 that because I 've done it not exactly 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:07.760
 the money that I need to live 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.650
 where comes who pays it is legitimate 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.080
 I earn it I deserve what I do 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.000
 contributes to society I do not know have I'm going to 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.680
 put the description I have my book 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.960
 also a reflection once I did by 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.120
 twitter and we collected the opinions on 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.680
 how much how to become attention because 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.720
 I have to change the primer and here one 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.400
 a super truck now I'm going to die in 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.560
 direct is fired is going to have more 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.930
 visits of the expected youtuber dies 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:35.360
 live I got between three between 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:37.730
 three incredible trucks my mother now 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.310
 the one from the back that will go forward my mother 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.650
 let's all die here in front 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.470
 is dedicated to selling marbles and granite 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.180
 this is a very worthy job too 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.890
 Well, what that I have 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.300
 raised where does the money come from that 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.650
 it serves me to live is not well 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.140
 cattle is not well earned I deserve it 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.030
 I do not deserve it and that reflection I think 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.330
 which is interesting and the one that I quote you in 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.410
 the description is a reflection on 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.210
 how much should people earn who 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.920
 should win more than more who contributes 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.420
 more it generates how much a 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.610
 footballer when he should win a 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.880
 neurosurgeon not how much should a 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.620
 dump 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.260
 how much should you earn in your company 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.670
 what generates what your company earns in 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.010
 function of the hours depending on your 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.480
 qualification qualification excuse me 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.220
 all that debate seems interesting and 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.960
 that I wanted to simply give you this 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.240
 reflection on money and then by 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.100
 last to finish the money I think not 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.590
 it's bad I think money can 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.750
