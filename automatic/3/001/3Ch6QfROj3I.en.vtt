in<00:00:00.110> fact<00:00:01.110> when<00:00:01.350> we<00:00:01.500> take<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:01.740> closer<00:00:02.129> look<00:00:02.310> at

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
in fact when we take a closer look at

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.900 
in fact when we take a closer look at
the<00:00:02.879> very<00:00:03.120> essence<00:00:03.659> of<00:00:03.810> L<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.799> bullgod<00:00:05.310> we

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
the very essence of L the bullgod we

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.419 
the very essence of L the bullgod we
also<00:00:06.150> see<00:00:06.629> deeper<00:00:07.500> meanings<00:00:07.919> into<00:00:08.160> the

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
also see deeper meanings into the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.520 
also see deeper meanings into the
dualistic<00:00:08.820> principle<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.840> polarities

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
dualistic principle of the polarities

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.660 
dualistic principle of the polarities
which<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.250> why<00:00:11.460> he<00:00:11.730> had<00:00:12.000> two<00:00:12.630> wives<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.889> why<00:00:14.429> he

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
which is why he had two wives and why he

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.790 
which is why he had two wives and why he
was<00:00:14.849> found<00:00:15.240> at<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.660> fountains<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.410> two

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
was found at the fountains of the two

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.290 
was found at the fountains of the two
rivers<00:00:17.250> at<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.300> spring<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.439> two<00:00:19.800> deeps<00:00:20.789> or

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
rivers at the spring of the two deeps or

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.130 
rivers at the spring of the two deeps or
the<00:00:21.990> depths<00:00:23.060> so<00:00:24.060> basically<00:00:24.630> if<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.930> pay

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the depths so basically if you pay

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.679 
the depths so basically if you pay
attention<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.430> Bible<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.660> will

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
attention to the Bible you will

attention to the Bible you will
understand<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:28.830> dualistic<00:00:29.570> polarities<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
understand it's dualistic polarities the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.350 
understand it's dualistic polarities the
message<00:00:31.980> they're<00:00:32.219> actually<00:00:32.790> trying<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.149> get

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
message they're actually trying to get

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.340 
message they're actually trying to get

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.220 
across and the very word Bible itself
tells<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.790> dualistic<00:00:39.210> principle<00:00:39.989> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
tells you the dualistic principle of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.729 
tells you the dualistic principle of
duality<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.309> polarities<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> find<00:00:43.620> it

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
duality and the polarities so I find it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.709 
duality and the polarities so I find it
amazing<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.399> people<00:00:44.730> do<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.239> want<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
amazing that people do not want to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.470 
amazing that people do not want to
accept<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.800> ugaritic<00:00:47.340> God<00:00:47.550> L<00:00:47.850> the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.970 
the very foundation and truth of the
hidden<00:02:36.500> meaning<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.610> parallel<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:39.500> have<00:02:39.770> to

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
hidden meaning of parallel you have to

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.720 
hidden meaning of parallel you have to
understand<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.850> entire<00:02:41.270> scope<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.230> what

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
understand the entire scope of what

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.110 
understand the entire scope of what
parallel<00:02:43.900> actually<00:02:44.900> means<00:02:45.490> so<00:02:46.490> perhaps<00:02:46.700> now

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
parallel actually means so perhaps now

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.580 
parallel actually means so perhaps now
you'll<00:02:47.330> understand<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.930> etymology<00:02:48.560> of

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
you'll understand the etymology of

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.300 
you'll understand the etymology of

polarities and aloes which means other

anyways over your sermon I can also form

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.550 
anyways over your sermon I can also form
you<00:03:42.380> would<00:03:42.590> would<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.299> anyways<00:03:44.299> which<00:03:45.290> is

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
you would would you anyways which is

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.039 
you would would you anyways which is
from<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:45.980> greek<00:03:46.190> parallel<00:03:47.000> else<00:03:47.209> because

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
from the greek parallel else because

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.199 
from the greek parallel else because
this<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.320> a<00:03:48.350> really<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.620> greek<00:03:48.890> word<00:03:48.920> okay<00:03:49.700> which

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
this is a really a greek word okay which

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.770 
this is a really a greek word okay which
means<00:03:50.450> parallel<00:03:51.080> from<00:03:51.560> para<00:03:51.860> ella<00:03:52.400> joyce

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
means parallel from para ella joyce

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.949 
means parallel from para ella joyce
beside<00:03:53.780> one<00:03:54.049> another<00:03:54.080> from<00:03:54.950> para<00:03:55.430> beside<00:03:56.000> plus

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
beside one another from para beside plus

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.140 
beside one another from para beside plus
ella<00:03:57.200> joyce<00:03:57.440> each<00:03:57.799> other<00:03:58.070> from<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.580> lowes<00:03:58.820> other

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
ella joyce each other from a lowes other

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.710 
ella joyce each other from a lowes other
so<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.739> word<00:04:00.920> parallel<00:04:01.519> is<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.760> Greek<00:04:02.090> word<00:04:02.120> and

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
so the word parallel is a Greek word and

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.470 
so the word parallel is a Greek word and
it<00:04:02.930> consists<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.799> two<00:04:04.070> basic<00:04:04.580> Greek<00:04:04.850> words<00:04:05.150> two

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
it consists of two basic Greek words two

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.930 
it consists of two basic Greek words two
very<00:04:05.720> simple<00:04:06.049> words<00:04:06.380> para<00:04:06.830> or<00:04:07.190> power<00:04:07.430> however

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
very simple words para or power however

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.870 
very simple words para or power however
you<00:04:08.030> want<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.180> say<00:04:08.269> in<00:04:08.600> a<00:04:09.350> lowes<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:10.670> word

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
you want to say in a lowes the word

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.539 
you want to say in a lowes the word
parallel<00:04:11.450> is<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.660> Greek<00:04:12.019> word<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:13.340> word

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
parallel is a Greek word the word

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.450
