00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.370
 very good guys and girls welcome to 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.170
 a new video of face you already know that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.820
 approximately once a week or 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.230
 every two weeks upload a video 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.690
 related to face either in attack or 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.680
 in defense mainly of clash of 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.720
 plants or do it 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.279
 usually of clan war but 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.830
 this time I bring you a boom bit video 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.810
 it's worth the thing is that I've been attacked three 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.609
 times to the same resource base to this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.859
 from here we will explore the so that the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.870
 you go previously is a resource base 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.460
 conquiste recently with tanks not 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.200
 it's easy is not easy simply 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.300
 because he has five throw reels of 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.800
 level 5 the rest defenses are six 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.410
 machine gun level 5 9 565 5 565 of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.140
 level 5 and one level 6 then to 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.370
 priori it's easy it's easy the only thing that you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.750
 can complicate a little the thing are 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.640
 the rocket launchers but you know that 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 they take little life then what comes to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.210
 be a tank attack I think that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.620
 I lost a tank or I do not know if like many 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.780
 two to good and since a tower 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.010
 Sniper Level 6 but is not 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.510
 complicated in itself 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.309
 Well, the player who is removed 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.330
 He said I'm going to take off again 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.760
 then I arrive 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.200
 from the university and I find that 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.140
 he has attacked me three times and the three 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.420
 sometimes I have defended the three times with 24 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.340
 level 3 warriors or I think that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.990
 I have them level 2, this is to say 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.970
 player is better than me level 29 I think 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.190
 that I'm level 27 right now where good 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.190
 let's see the battle and let's see the 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.680
 first the first feil comes begins with 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.230
 the gunship demolishing that tower of 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.360
 sniper and a machine gun yo 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.740
 personally I would not focus on 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.180
 knock down those defenses because they are 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.220
 defenses that the warriors do not 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.960
 cost to knock them off say 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.700
 less life than they can go 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.410
 recovering for every blow but good at 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.900
 missiles on has been changed has been 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.220
 loaded another machine gun the level one 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.229
 6 I think it's this one here 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.510
 let's say it's the one that's going to take the most life 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.160
 is the one that also leaves alive but good 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.260
 sends them directly to a death 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.390
 sure it is believed that taking them there that 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.310
 directly go to the barracks 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.630
 general is going to be enough then that 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.729
 Healing has also been very bad 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.229
 thrown and is that you can not pretend that 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.180
 having five rocket launchers and using 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.650
 between two giving you their warriors go to 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.479
 survive it is clear that they recover by 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.940
 hit are level 3 are not also level 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.080
 14 well I do not really know how many level 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.400
 it can go up but now 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.590
 is that with the simple fact of being 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.420
 le 4 rocket launchers attacked the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.910
 warriors are going to die then let's say 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.980
 so far he has checked the first 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.150
 way of how you do not have to attack this 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.310
 resource base 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.740
 Well, it says you can not conquer 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.600
 with 24 meters of level 3 what if what 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.410
 we try again with 24 warriors of 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.080
 level 3 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.570
 again hehe good you are already 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.000
 seeing this time he says I'm going to charge 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.610
 a rocket launcher after all yes with 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.530
 four are killing me the warriors if 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.270
 had one and I get inside the radius of 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.300
 no action of another already as much 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.620
 can attack three equal so can 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.810
 hold up well is an option has been 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.000
 loaded one the thing is to go groping not 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.620
 I think the easiest thing is when you 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.060
 attack with an army and clod based 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.830
 of resources more or less using the same 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.240
 army and the same strategy 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.830
 It usually works if one works 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.270
 because to another not good because it can be 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.730
 a new defense may have a little 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.380
 over their defenses level but if you 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.670
 you realize the great majority of people 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.440
 against which I face has more 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.630
 level that I because I am very tall of 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.250
 medals but hey there he's going to knock down a 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.170
 leaf rockets were expected to be hanging 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.519
 between these two neither can 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.080
 act and the other two were 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.550
 too far to attack 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.220
 you know that exploring the village before 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.410
 or the island you can see if it will take you 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.910
 or not arrived at this point is going well 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.080
 there are two rocket launchers the warriors 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.420
 then you will have about 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.620
 half alive but here the exit a little 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.390
 I do not know what happened here 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.370
 exactly that he sent them again to 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.750
 medium is to say going through half of 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.980
 all mag machine guns the others 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.740
 two that are giving them of which 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.090
 one died and it was believed that they were going to 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.830
 survive you that journey the 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.720
 enough to come to this 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.640
 point to knock down the rocket launchers and 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.340
 then the machine guns were not 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.960
 thought but clearly cross let's say all 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.660
 the island while they are hurting you 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.160
 that come here 34 good have come more 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.320
 but sufficiently damaged so that 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.600
 survive then he also returns to 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.160
 send to the other side tells me how not to 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.630
 there are three that I am going to extensively 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.760
 two weeks to be giving them sent here 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.020
 that there is only one and how much I have left 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.640
 of prisoners who only have three left 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.680
 good on the way with some luck 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.390
 they survive it was very clear that not 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.190
 be this player is bad is not what 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.470
 next but good says 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.209
 if the second one we did not get to the 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.000
 third is the winner 'this time 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.950
 I will even take 24 of rovella 23 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.560
 because I'm going over the me more too with 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.740
 24 face one least I'll get 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.030
 but good return to the same this time 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.920
 follow the strategy of the second attack 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.820
 will try to tear down that 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.370
 rocket launcher 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.600
 I personally wearing warriors 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.280
 would take and go rocket launcher after 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.470
 rocket launchers turning around but not for 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.600
 medium but outside while I go 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.190
 freezing the furthest rocket launchers 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.500
 because the closest ones are not going to 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.880
 can attack or the machine guns but 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.140
 not this player since I 'm at 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.970
 practically all the energy in 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.920
 knock down a rocket launcher not even the 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.020
 sniper tower and well I think that 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.210
 is already going to launch the attack to see if not 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:03.010
 I'm wrong because he's running out of 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:05.340
 time itself there are 23 warriors this time 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.780
 it does not indicate the way they say good 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.340
 is that it is a good choice herd is 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.690
 machine guns are loaded more 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.520
 recovering life and they are already defenses that 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.260
 they are taking off is not going wrong 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.240
 the problem is that the machine guns 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.550
 if they had the gnashing ian level 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.940
 but good to have little level more or 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.440
 least it costs them enough to send it 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.270
 so that they recover life but of course 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.220
 we continue counting that there are four 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.640
 level 5 rocket launchers hitting them 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.110
 because they have not survived 2 and justito 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.000
 justito or a second more and surely 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.290
 I would have died then nothing 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.480
 here we have the face of the week 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.640
 we started Monday with full energy if 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.620
 they are emerging more either from a bug or 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.790
 of Classes already in the head or 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.560
 any other game keeps going up 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.060
 but not this is all for today I hope that 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.810
 you liked it and see you in the 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.810
 next video 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.990
 yes 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.990
 state
