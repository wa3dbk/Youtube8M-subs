00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
smelled really good when I poured it in

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.420 
smelled really good when I poured it in
the<00:04:38.180> mold<00:04:38.530> hopefully<00:04:39.530> it'll<00:04:39.800> be<00:04:39.830> really<00:04:40.280> good

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
the mold hopefully it'll be really good

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.270 
the mold hopefully it'll be really good
when<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:40.940> comes<00:04:41.180> out<00:04:41.450> it's<00:04:42.410> also<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.860> small

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
when it comes out it's also a small

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.520 
when it comes out it's also a small
batch<00:04:43.490> when<00:04:43.820> i<00:04:43.850> try<00:04:44.180> my<00:04:44.210> new<00:04:44.390> oils<00:04:44.990> that<00:04:45.110> i<00:04:45.290> buy

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
i try them in the small batches like

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.070 
i try them in the small batches like
this<00:04:48.350> because<00:04:48.860> I<00:04:49.550> never<00:04:49.970> know<00:04:50.510> what's<00:04:50.930> going

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
this because I never know what's going

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.540 
this because I never know what's going
to<00:04:51.140> happen<00:04:51.230> if<00:04:51.680> it's<00:04:51.830> going<00:04:51.980> to<00:04:52.040> work<00:04:52.100> or<00:04:52.430> if
