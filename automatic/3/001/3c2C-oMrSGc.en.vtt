thought of and how it works and what to
do

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
do

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.150 
do
take<00:00:59.739> it<00:00:59.860> over<00:00:59.950> print<00:01:00.340> right<00:01:00.630> okay<00:01:01.630> so<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.320> shelf

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
take it over print right okay so a shelf

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.920 
take it over print right okay so a shelf
see<00:01:03.520> stack<00:01:03.850> can<00:01:04.600> three<00:01:05.170> or<00:01:05.290> four<00:01:05.500> high<00:01:05.740> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
see stack can three or four high and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.830 
see stack can three or four high and
just<00:01:07.930> by<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.560> nature<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.189> second<00:01:10.060> can<00:01:10.270> they're

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
just by the nature of second can they're

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.240 
just by the nature of second can they're
gonna<00:01:11.049> fall<00:01:11.380> over<00:01:11.409> they're<00:01:11.920> gonna<00:01:11.979> fall

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
gonna fall over they're gonna fall

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.620 
gonna fall over they're gonna fall
behind<00:01:12.399> your<00:01:12.700> shelf<00:01:12.970> they're<00:01:13.210> gonna<00:01:13.299> fall<00:01:13.479> the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
behind your shelf they're gonna fall the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.480 
behind your shelf they're gonna fall the
ground<00:01:13.869> where<00:01:14.560> it's<00:01:14.680> hard<00:01:14.829> to<00:01:14.950> get<00:01:15.159> to<00:01:15.310> them

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
ground where it's hard to get to them

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.069 
ground where it's hard to get to them
and<00:01:15.700> it's<00:01:16.119> not<00:01:16.270> going<00:01:16.389> to<00:01:16.479> be<00:01:16.569> an<00:01:16.659> efficient

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
and it's not going to be an efficient

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:23.389 
and it's not going to be an efficient
way<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.200> store<00:01:17.469> can<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:19.119> instead<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:22.299> use

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
way to store can so instead you use

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.840 
way to store can so instead you use
cardboard<00:01:24.399> soda<00:01:25.030> boxes<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.950> sort<00:01:27.789> of

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
cardboard soda boxes now sort of

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.349 
cardboard soda boxes now sort of
Austin's<00:01:28.329> can<00:01:28.600> hold<00:01:28.810> 12<00:01:29.469> regular<00:01:29.950> suck<00:01:30.399> in<00:01:30.670> but

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
Austin's can hold 12 regular suck in but

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.480 
Austin's can hold 12 regular suck in but
then<00:01:31.569> these<00:01:31.929> are<00:01:32.380> bigger<00:01:32.649> in<00:01:32.859> diameter<00:01:33.039> at<00:01:33.459> the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
then these are bigger in diameter at the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.080 
then these are bigger in diameter at the
base<00:01:33.749> there<00:01:34.749> they<00:01:35.740> don't<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.609> boxes<00:01:36.969> don't

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
base there they don't the boxes don't

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.769 
base there they don't the boxes don't
hold<00:01:37.329> quite<00:01:37.749> as<00:01:37.929> many<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:40.090> when<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.569> load

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:40.779 
hold quite as many so when you load

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:43.379 
hold quite as many so when you load
these<00:01:41.459> you<00:01:42.459> kind<00:01:42.639> of<00:01:42.759> have<00:01:42.909> to<00:01:43.029> let<00:01:43.119> gravity

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:43.389 
these you kind of have to let gravity

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:45.840 
these you kind of have to let gravity
work<00:01:43.600> for<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.139> you<00:01:44.350> can't<00:01:44.560> just<00:01:44.889> slide<00:01:45.700> them

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
work for you you can't just slide them

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.459 
work for you you can't just slide them
in<00:01:45.969> there<00:01:46.149> and<00:01:46.270> try<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.479> get<00:01:46.719> them<00:01:46.869> to<00:01:46.959> fit<00:01:47.319> up

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
in there and try to get them to fit up

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.609 
in there and try to get them to fit up
on<00:01:47.619> top<00:01:47.829> it<00:01:48.039> doesn't<00:01:48.340> work<00:01:48.450> yeah<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:49.810> turn<00:01:50.499> it

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
on top it doesn't work yeah you turn it

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.429 
on top it doesn't work yeah you turn it
up<00:01:50.709> on<00:01:50.859> end<00:01:51.219> like<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:54.060> Jenna<00:01:55.229> jiggles<00:01:56.229> leave

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
up on end like this Jenna jiggles leave

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:05.170 
up on end like this Jenna jiggles leave
it<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.799> just<00:01:59.979> let<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:00.819> go

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.910 

so<00:02:05.630> instead<00:02:05.870> of<00:02:05.930> forcing<00:02:06.350> them<00:02:06.500> in<00:02:06.650> there<00:02:06.800> you

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
so instead of forcing them in there you

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.440 
so instead of forcing them in there you
just<00:02:06.950> let<00:02:07.250> gravity<00:02:07.490> do<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.820> work<00:02:07.940> for<00:02:08.330> you

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
just let gravity do the work for you

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.150 
just let gravity do the work for you
right<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:08.869> just<00:02:09.050> let<00:02:09.740> it<00:02:09.770> fall<00:02:10.130> down

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
right and just let it fall down

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.780 
right and just let it fall down
naturally<00:02:11.470> gravity<00:02:12.470> let<00:02:12.650> them<00:02:12.770> settle<00:02:13.070> and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
naturally gravity let them settle and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.630 
naturally gravity let them settle and
they'll<00:02:14.150> go<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.770> now<00:02:15.770> for<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.160> last<00:02:16.370> couple

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
they'll go in now for the last couple

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.920 
they'll go in now for the last couple
you<00:02:16.970> can<00:02:17.180> turn<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.510> back<00:02:17.780> down<00:02:18.440> once<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.130> get<00:02:19.490> a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
you can turn it back down once you get a

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.270 
you can turn it back down once you get a
couple<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.200> there<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.650> said<00:02:25.010> can<00:02:25.130> hold

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
couple in there and so I said can hold

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.720 
couple in there and so I said can hold
ten<00:02:25.520> cans<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.090> can't<00:02:26.360> but<00:02:27.520> right<00:02:28.520> now<00:02:28.670> you

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
ten cans and it can't but right now you

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.340 
ten cans and it can't but right now you
only<00:02:28.910> have<00:02:29.060> nine<00:02:29.240> in<00:02:29.420> there<00:02:29.570> but<00:02:29.900> as<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.230> can

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
only have nine in there but as you can

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.280 
only have nine in there but as you can
see<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:33.470> can<00:02:33.590> hold<00:02:34.750> one<00:02:35.750> more

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
see it can hold one more

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.640 
see it can hold one more
so<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.650> makes<00:02:36.830> ten<00:02:37.130> can<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:38.900> it's<00:02:39.500> about

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
so that makes ten can and so it's about

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.240 
so that makes ten can and so it's about
six<00:02:40.130> inches<00:02:40.550> here<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:43.630> six<00:02:44.630> inches<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.650> you

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
six inches here so six inches and you

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.020 
six inches here so six inches and you
can<00:02:46.280> stack<00:02:46.700> these<00:02:46.970> two<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:47.630> it's<00:02:47.810> six<00:02:48.020> inches

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
can stack these two so it's six inches

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.980 
can stack these two so it's six inches
with<00:02:50.030> about<00:02:51.160> ten<00:02:52.160> cans<00:02:52.490> backed<00:02:53.270> up<00:02:53.510> three
