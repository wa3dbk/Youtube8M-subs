gonna have to show you cuz it sounds a
bit<00:00:16.539> odd<00:00:16.810> what<00:00:17.110> it<00:00:17.260> is<00:00:17.410> and<00:00:17.820> let's<00:00:18.820> start

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120 
bit odd what it is and let's start

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.550 
bit odd what it is and let's start
you've<00:00:19.270> got<00:00:19.450> betraying<00:00:19.840> normal<00:00:20.170> game<00:00:20.350> and

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
you've got betraying normal game and

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.900 
you've got betraying normal game and
training<00:00:20.920> mode<00:00:21.100> and<00:00:21.310> basically<00:00:21.610> normal

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
training mode and basically normal

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.250 
training mode and basically normal
difference<00:00:22.240> in<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.360> game<00:00:22.540> the<00:00:22.750> training<00:00:23.110> mode

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
difference in the game the training mode

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.960 
difference in the game the training mode
you<00:00:23.410> just<00:00:23.440> choose<00:00:23.800> an<00:00:23.890> enemy<00:00:24.100> to<00:00:24.160> fight<00:00:24.370> then

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
you just choose an enemy to fight then

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.340 
you just choose an enemy to fight then
you<00:00:25.060> can<00:00:25.210> put<00:00:25.360> it<00:00:25.450> on<00:00:25.540> one<00:00:25.720> player<00:00:25.990> two<00:00:26.320> player

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
you can put it on one player two player

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.890 
you can put it on one player two player
co-op<00:00:26.590> or<00:00:27.100> to<00:00:27.280> play<00:00:27.490> competitive<00:00:28.060> co-op<00:00:28.780> we

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
co-op or to play competitive co-op we

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.320 
co-op or to play competitive co-op we
compared<00:00:29.289> over<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:29.590> same<00:00:29.800> thing<00:00:30.130> but<00:00:30.490> it<00:00:31.000> just

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
compared over the same thing but it just

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.000 
compared over the same thing but it just
means<00:00:31.450> it<00:00:31.660> allows<00:00:31.900> friendly<00:00:32.379> fire<00:00:32.559> one<00:00:32.770> so<00:00:32.950> you

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
means it allows friendly fire one so you

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.470 
means it allows friendly fire one so you
can<00:00:33.129> hit<00:00:33.280> each<00:00:33.430> other<00:00:33.550> so<00:00:33.879> if<00:00:34.120> you<00:00:34.239> want<00:00:34.390> to

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
can hit each other so if you want to

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.700 
can hit each other so if you want to
fight<00:00:34.629> each<00:00:34.780> other<00:00:34.899> then<00:00:35.170> that's<00:00:35.320> pretty<00:00:35.559> much

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
fight each other then that's pretty much

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.410 
fight each other then that's pretty much
any<00:00:35.859> way<00:00:35.980> you're<00:00:36.070> going<00:00:36.190> to<00:00:36.249> do<00:00:36.309> it<00:00:36.429> you<00:00:37.300> do

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
any way you're going to do it you do

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.209 
any way you're going to do it you do
actually<00:00:37.719> get<00:00:37.780> fifty<00:00:38.140> five<00:00:38.320> lives<00:00:38.620> loss<00:00:38.920> so<00:00:39.129> if

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
actually get fifty five lives loss so if

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:40.349 
actually get fifty five lives loss so if
you<00:00:39.309> want<00:00:39.429> to<00:00:39.460> bait<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.820> game<00:00:39.969> then<00:00:40.210> that's

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
you want to bait the game then that's

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.180 
you want to bait the game then that's
probably<00:00:40.539> the<00:00:40.749> best<00:00:40.929> way<00:00:41.079> to<00:00:41.109> do<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.499> even

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
probably the best way to do it even

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.169 
probably the best way to do it even
though<00:00:42.280> you<00:00:42.399> can<00:00:42.550> hit<00:00:42.699> each<00:00:42.819> other<00:00:43.030> you'll

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
though you can hit each other you'll

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.180 
though you can hit each other you'll
just<00:00:43.329> have<00:00:43.449> to<00:00:43.539> be<00:00:43.629> careful<00:00:44.050> now<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:44.920> can<00:00:45.069> then

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
just have to be careful now you can then

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.889 
just have to be careful now you can then
choose<00:00:45.399> control<00:00:45.850> methods<00:00:46.210> for<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.420> stick<00:00:46.809> to

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
choose control methods for a stick to

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.029 
choose control methods for a stick to
the<00:00:46.989> first<00:00:47.170> one<00:00:47.409> the<00:00:47.499> games<00:00:47.679> have<00:00:47.859> enough

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
the first one the games have enough

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.160 
the first one the games have enough
control<00:00:48.339> as<00:00:48.489> it<00:00:48.579> is<00:00:48.699> and<00:00:49.449> then<00:00:49.780> you<00:00:49.839> can<00:00:49.960> choose

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
control as it is and then you can choose

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.959 
control as it is and then you can choose
the<00:00:50.319> music<00:00:50.409> and<00:00:50.949> their<00:00:51.129> difficulty<00:00:51.579> many

the music and their difficulty many

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.579 
the music and their difficulty many
people<00:00:52.300> like<00:00:52.659> here<00:00:52.960> at<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.109> music<00:00:53.409> on<00:00:53.469> this

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
people like here at the music on this

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.379 
people like here at the music on this
game<00:00:53.800> but<00:00:54.039> many<00:00:54.159> people<00:00:54.370> hear<00:00:54.729> the<00:00:54.879> game<00:00:55.059> and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:55.389 
game but many people hear the game and

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:56.969 
game but many people hear the game and
per<00:00:55.539> say<00:00:55.719> I<00:00:55.749> don't<00:00:56.050> think<00:00:56.289> out<00:00:56.379> of<00:00:56.530> about<00:00:56.710> bad

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
per say I don't think out of about bad

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.979 
per say I don't think out of about bad
and<00:00:57.249> I<00:00:57.909> think<00:00:58.239> this<00:00:58.359> game<00:00:58.510> gets<00:00:58.719> a<00:00:58.780> lot<00:00:58.960> of

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
and I think this game gets a lot of

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.509 
and I think this game gets a lot of
flack<00:00:59.260> that<00:00:59.440> it<00:00:59.530> doesn't<00:00:59.800> deserve<00:01:00.039> it's<00:01:00.339> one

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
flack that it doesn't deserve it's one

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.099 
flack that it doesn't deserve it's one
of<00:01:00.609> them<00:01:00.699> things<00:01:00.729> that<00:01:01.059> if<00:01:01.239> you<00:01:01.329> just<00:01:01.479> persist

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
of them things that if you just persist

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.079 
of them things that if you just persist
with<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.409> and<00:01:02.620> learn<00:01:02.799> its<00:01:03.039> moves<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.639> controls

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
with it and learn its moves and controls

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.360 
with it and learn its moves and controls
then<00:01:04.720> you'll<00:01:05.140> you'll<00:01:05.650> be<00:01:05.799> able<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.040> have<00:01:06.159> a<00:01:06.190> bit

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
then you'll you'll be able to have a bit

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.040 
then you'll you'll be able to have a bit
fun<00:01:06.610> with<00:01:06.730> it<00:01:06.850> one<00:01:07.420> player<00:01:07.690> that<00:01:07.720> would<00:01:07.960> be

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
about getting an instruction manual to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.300 
about getting an instruction manual to
help<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.350> out<00:02:47.470> with<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.709> controls<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.220> the

help you out with the controls of the
gadgets<00:02:48.730> then<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.330> honestly<00:02:49.810> wouldn't<00:02:50.080> bother

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350

instruction manual I've ever seen in my

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.760 
instruction manual I've ever seen in my
life<00:02:54.850> as<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.750> example<00:02:55.840> there<00:02:56.380> were<00:02:56.440> such

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
life as for example there were such

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.010 
life as for example there were such
things<00:02:57.010> like<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.760> use<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.270> think<00:02:58.450> it's<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
things like to use I think it's a the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.780 
things like to use I think it's a the
Robin<00:02:59.620> sticky<00:02:59.980> goo<00:03:00.220> or<00:03:00.370> something<00:03:00.640> like<00:03:00.730> that

you<00:03:01.120> have<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.390> do<00:03:01.540> down<00:03:02.110> forward<00:03:02.709> why<00:03:02.920> and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
you have to do down forward why and

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.520 
you have to do down forward why and
that's<00:03:04.450> what<00:03:04.630> it<00:03:04.720> says<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.020> booklet<00:03:05.230> you

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
that's what it says in the booklet you

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.690 
that's what it says in the booklet you
actually<00:03:05.950> have<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.190> do<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.520> rack

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
actually have to do it in the rack

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.510 
actually have to do it in the rack
forward<00:03:07.030> down<00:03:07.390> X<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.830> controls<00:03:09.310> are

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
forward down X so the controls are

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.640 
forward down X so the controls are
completely<00:03:09.700> different<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.780> as<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.200> said<00:03:11.410> it's

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
completely different so as I said it's

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.990 
completely different so as I said it's
not<00:03:11.830> something<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.550> be<00:03:12.640> honest<00:03:12.880> like

not something that to be honest like

not something that to be honest like

real in real controls if not then just

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.080 
real in real controls if not then just
sit<00:03:20.980> down<00:03:21.010> for<00:03:21.190> half<00:03:21.489> an<00:03:21.610> hour<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:21.970> it's

sit down for half an hour and it's

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.180 
sit down for half an hour and it's
pretty<00:03:22.300> easy<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.660> work<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:23.050> out<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.709> took<00:03:23.980> me<00:03:24.160> a

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
pretty easy to work it out it took me a

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.100 
pretty easy to work it out it took me a
mean<00:03:24.430> friend<00:03:24.700> last<00:03:24.880> night<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.360> about<00:03:25.450> 15

minutes<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.530> pretty<00:03:26.920> much<00:03:27.040> work<00:03:27.250> out<00:03:27.370> how<00:03:27.489> to

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
minutes to pretty much work out how to

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.009 
minutes to pretty much work out how to
use<00:03:27.700> all<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.060> gadgets<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.660> work<00:03:28.840> out

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
use all of the gadgets and work out

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.570 
use all of the gadgets and work out
which<00:03:29.170> ones<00:03:29.350> we<00:03:29.500> were<00:03:29.769> actually<00:03:30.160> useful<00:03:30.340> and

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
which ones we were actually useful and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.330 
which ones we were actually useful and
likes<00:03:31.620> all<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.739> time<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.100> play<00:03:33.220> and

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
likes all the time that you play and

likes all the time that you play and
it's<00:03:33.730> as<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.209> say<00:03:34.330> it's<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.540> final<00:03:34.750> fight<00:03:35.019> style

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
it's as I say it's a final fight style

it's as I say it's a final fight style
game<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.680> whole<00:03:35.800> point<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.100> bad<00:03:36.370> guys<00:03:36.400> just

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
game the whole point is bad guys just

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.370 
game the whole point is bad guys just
pop<00:03:36.970> out<00:03:37.150> their<00:03:37.450> energy<00:03:37.690> meter<00:03:37.870> comes<00:03:38.140> up<00:03:38.290> at

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
pop out their energy meter comes up at

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.020 
pop out their energy meter comes up at
the<00:03:38.470> top<00:03:38.620> there<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.489> whole<00:03:39.640> point<00:03:39.820> is

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
the top there and the whole point is

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.030 
the top there and the whole point is
that<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.420> just<00:03:40.780> beat<00:03:41.290> them<00:03:41.440> up<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.739> kill<00:03:41.920> them

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
that you just beat them up and kill them

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.110 
that you just beat them up and kill them
and<00:03:42.100> then<00:03:42.190> go<00:03:42.340> on<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.550> next<00:03:42.730> section

and then go on to the next section
there's<00:03:43.780> Riddler's<00:03:44.350> question<00:03:44.860> marks<00:03:45.160> all

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
there's Riddler's question marks all

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.650 
there's Riddler's question marks all
over<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.580> place<00:03:45.850> which<00:03:46.090> can<00:03:46.299> be<00:03:46.480> quite

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
over the place which can be quite

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.710 
over the place which can be quite
irritating<00:03:47.320> because<00:03:47.470> like<00:03:48.310> yeah<00:03:49.000> well<00:03:49.510> I

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
irritating because like yeah well I

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.060 
irritating because like yeah well I
suppose<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.200> there<00:03:50.470> can<00:03:50.590> be<00:03:50.620> kind<00:03:50.920> of

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
suppose that there can be kind of

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.009 
suppose that there can be kind of
helpful<00:03:51.280> at<00:03:51.700> certain<00:03:52.239> points<00:03:52.600> because<00:03:52.870> it

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
helpful at certain points because it

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.840 
helpful at certain points because it
lets<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.410> know<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:53.799> in<00:03:54.220> here<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.610> have<00:03:54.670> to

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
lets you know like in here you have to

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.729 
lets you know like in here you have to
go<00:03:54.970> up<00:03:55.120> but<00:03:55.720> at<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.930> same<00:03:56.049> time<00:03:56.320> it's<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.560> type

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
go up but at the same time it's a type

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.229 
go up but at the same time it's a type
of<00:03:56.860> thing<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.070> you<00:03:57.549> pretty<00:03:57.820> much<00:03:57.910> know<00:03:58.209> that

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
of thing that you pretty much know that

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.050 
of thing that you pretty much know that
you<00:03:58.510> have<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.750> go<00:03:58.870> up<00:03:58.989> so<00:03:59.830> there<00:04:00.519> can<00:04:00.700> be<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:00.880> bit

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
you have to go up so there can be a bit

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.640 
you have to go up so there can be a bit
tearing<00:04:01.360> but<00:04:01.510> I<00:04:01.570> suppose<00:04:01.959> if<00:04:02.140> you've<00:04:02.350> never

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
tearing but I suppose if you've never

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.930 
tearing but I suppose if you've never
played<00:04:02.799> the<00:04:02.950> game<00:04:03.070> before<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.400> can<00:04:03.640> be<00:04:03.760> quite

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
played the game before that can be quite

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.810 
played the game before that can be quite
helpful<00:04:04.150> um<00:04:05.250> don't<00:04:06.250> really<00:04:06.459> know<00:04:06.580> what<00:04:06.700> else

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.990 
though is there left to say really I
mean<00:04:08.230> this<00:04:08.380> they're<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:09.160> only<00:04:09.370> other<00:04:09.519> control

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
mean this they're the only other control

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.280 
mean this they're the only other control
thing<00:04:10.180> I've<00:04:10.299> been<00:04:10.330> said<00:04:10.660> which<00:04:10.840> isn't

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
thing I've been said which isn't

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.810 
thing I've been said which isn't
actually<00:04:11.620> in<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:11.920> instruction<00:04:12.400> book<00:04:12.549> again

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
actually in the instruction book again

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.940 
actually in the instruction book again
is<00:04:13.060> if<00:04:13.390> you<00:04:13.510> hold<00:04:13.630> R<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.260> push<00:04:14.440> it<00:04:14.560> down<00:04:14.590> then

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
is if you hold R and push it down then

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.680 
is if you hold R and push it down then
you<00:04:15.040> go<00:04:15.160> down<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.519> floor<00:04:15.730> there's<00:04:16.299> all<00:04:16.419> sorts

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
you go down the floor there's all sorts

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.390 
you go down the floor there's all sorts
of<00:04:16.750> other<00:04:16.900> things<00:04:16.959> like<00:04:17.350> grab<00:04:17.739> moves<00:04:18.070> which

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
of other things like grab moves which

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.250 
of other things like grab moves which
can<00:04:19.090> be<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.239> pain<00:04:19.479> in<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.690> butt<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:19.870> pull<00:04:20.140> off

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
can be a pain in the butt to pull off

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.050 
can be a pain in the butt to pull off
it's<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.590> likes<00:04:20.769> of<00:04:20.919> forward<00:04:21.280> forward<00:04:21.519> en<00:04:21.910> and

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
it's the likes of forward forward en and

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.450 
it's the likes of forward forward en and
you<00:04:22.090> have<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.270> keep<00:04:22.419> calling<00:04:22.870> it

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
you have to keep calling it

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.700 
you have to keep calling it
so<00:04:23.759> anyway<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.780> think<00:04:25.020> I've<00:04:25.229> said<00:04:25.350> enough<00:04:25.560> about

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
so anyway I think I've said enough about

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.409 
so anyway I think I've said enough about
how<00:04:25.949> the<00:04:25.979> controls<00:04:26.430> in<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.610> game<00:04:26.759> I'm<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:27.000> big

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
how the controls in the game I'm a big

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.120 
how the controls in the game I'm a big
black<00:04:27.720> but<00:04:27.960> then<00:04:28.110> again<00:04:28.229> who<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.710> hell<00:04:28.949> hasn't

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
black but then again who the hell hasn't

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.620 
black but then again who the hell hasn't
said<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.580> over<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:29.880> over<00:04:29.970> again<00:04:30.210> over<00:04:30.360> the

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
said that over and over again over the

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.200 
said that over and over again over the
10<00:04:30.780> years<00:04:31.280> gonna<00:04:32.280> shut<00:04:32.460> up<00:04:32.550> for<00:04:32.669> a<00:04:32.729> few<00:04:32.850> seconds

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
10 years gonna shut up for a few seconds

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.670 
10 years gonna shut up for a few seconds
and<00:04:33.330> let<00:04:33.419> you<00:04:33.509> listen<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.780> some<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.199> music

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
and let you listen to some of the music

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.680 
and let you listen to some of the music
that<00:04:34.710> is<00:04:35.039> available<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.820> us<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:36.060> being<00:04:36.360> some<00:04:36.600> of

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
that is available to us it being some of

00:04:36.690 --> 00:05:03.460 
that is available to us it being some of
the<00:04:36.750> worse<00:04:36.930> than<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.229> video<00:04:37.740> game<00:04:37.860> history

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.520 

so<00:05:04.470> evolving<00:05:04.919> problems<00:05:05.280> with<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.520> music<00:05:05.910> and

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
so evolving problems with the music and

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.450 
so evolving problems with the music and
that's<00:05:07.530> pretty<00:05:07.889> much<00:05:07.979> all<00:05:08.099> you're<00:05:08.250> gonna<00:05:08.340> be

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
that's pretty much all you're gonna be

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.520 
that's pretty much all you're gonna be
here<00:05:08.639> in<00:05:08.759> the<00:05:08.849> entire<00:05:09.150> time<00:05:09.479> it<00:05:09.720> never<00:05:10.110> really

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
here in the entire time it never really

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.439 
here in the entire time it never really
changes<00:05:10.979> it's<00:05:11.160> like<00:05:11.400> just<00:05:11.669> a<00:05:11.820> minute<00:05:12.240> long<00:05:12.419> and

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
changes it's like just a minute long and

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:13.909 
changes it's like just a minute long and
it<00:05:12.660> just<00:05:12.840> constantly<00:05:13.169> repeats<00:05:13.470> itself

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
it just constantly repeats itself

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.439 
it just constantly repeats itself
so<00:05:14.310> again<00:05:14.610> that's<00:05:14.789> why<00:05:15.000> there's<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.270> music

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
so again that's why there's the music

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.890 
so again that's why there's the music
off<00:05:15.690> option<00:05:15.870> that<00:05:16.199> um<00:05:17.180> this<00:05:18.180> eight<00:05:18.449> levels<00:05:18.810> of

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
off option that um this eight levels of

off option that um this eight levels of
all<00:05:19.139> on<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:19.380> game<00:05:19.560> and<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:19.919> do<00:05:20.070> fight<00:05:20.430> famous
