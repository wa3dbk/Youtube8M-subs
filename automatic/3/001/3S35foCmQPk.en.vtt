interconnect connection one picture on a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.509 
interconnect connection one picture on a
really<00:02:34.410> fast<00:02:34.620> internet<00:02:34.860> connection<00:02:35.310> here<00:02:35.459> in

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
really fast internet connection here in

cool ps3 parts if you enable DLNA which
we<00:02:43.470> just<00:02:43.650> did<00:02:43.890> now<00:02:44.819> your<00:02:45.030> ps3<00:02:45.840> which<00:02:46.050> also<00:02:46.290> has

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
we just did now your ps3 which also has

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.660 
we just did now your ps3 which also has
DLNA<00:02:47.510> can<00:02:48.510> find<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.170> wirelessly<00:02:49.980> when<00:02:50.519> they're

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
DLNA can find it wirelessly when they're

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.820 
DLNA can find it wirelessly when they're
on<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.879> same<00:02:51.030> network<00:02:51.170> see<00:02:52.170> there<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.560> the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
YouTube and Picasa it works really well

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.619 
YouTube and Picasa it works really well
executed<00:03:08.010> really<00:03:08.519> well<00:03:08.640> really<00:03:09.030> easy<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.450> do

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
executed really well really easy to do

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.550 
executed really well really easy to do
but<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:11.190> slow<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.959> could<00:03:13.080> see<00:03:13.260> here

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
but it is so slow so you could see here

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.500 
but it is so slow so you could see here
it's<00:03:13.709> taking<00:03:13.890> forever<00:03:14.220> just<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:15.000> load<00:03:15.269> the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
it's taking forever just to load the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.890 
it's taking forever just to load the
thumbnails<00:03:15.930> now<00:03:19.730> there's<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.790> media<00:03:21.330> card<00:03:21.569> slot

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
thumbnails now there's a media card slot

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.630 
thumbnails now there's a media card slot
in<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.140> front<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.409> the<00:03:22.470> ps3<00:03:23.010> if<00:03:23.129> you<00:03:23.220> pop<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
in the front of the ps3 if you pop the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.850 
in the front of the ps3 if you pop the
memory<00:03:24.510> stick<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:24.900> there<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.230> runs<00:03:25.409> so<00:03:25.680> much

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
memory stick in there it runs so much

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.990 
memory stick in there it runs so much
faster<00:03:26.129> and<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.519> probably<00:03:26.670> wouldn't<00:03:26.970> have

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
faster and you probably wouldn't have

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.990 
faster and you probably wouldn't have
the<00:03:27.090> patience<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.599> do<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:27.959> again<00:03:28.280> but<00:03:29.280> it

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
the patience to do this again but it

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.960 
the patience to do this again but it
works<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.629> it<00:03:30.720> works<00:03:30.750> well<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.890> it's<00:03:32.489> really

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
works and it works well but it's really

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.600 
works and it works well but it's really
really<00:03:33.569> slow<00:03:33.900> here<00:03:34.159> we<00:03:35.159> go<00:03:35.250> now<00:03:35.430> we're<00:03:35.519> gonna

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
really slow here we go now we're gonna

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.399 
really slow here we go now we're gonna
actually<00:03:35.790> load<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.360> picture<00:03:36.629> there<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.290> is
