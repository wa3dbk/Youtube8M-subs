00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 only the Ukrainians themselves do not want to go on 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.820
 they do not understand the war for what they need 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.080

 recruiting soldiers in the army in Ukraine 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.500
 just takes off and take away the stupid arrogant 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.600

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.030
 13 people died in the blast of a bus 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.170
 the president accused the tragedy of the militias 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.409

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.200
 Immobilization will be successful under the flag 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.720

 take up arms but the weaker sex 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.299
 will serve as a medical profession 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.400
 telephone technicians cartographers 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.290
 the list of professions is so long that not 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.909
 leaves no loopholes to dodge 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.070
 front though even ukrainian television 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.799
 recognizes to serve anyone 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.420
 our region here in our region is very 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.939
 a lot of people who live on 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.460
 today in russia and very many 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.380
 went to work in Odessa mother 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.329
 recruits stormed military registration and enlistment offices to 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.970
 protect her children from being called she 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.760
 simply 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.730
 Here is the legalization exists 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.510
 setting people against each other we 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.880
 Slavs can not 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.110
 understand and can understand against whom 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.110
 or what we ate 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.790
 Ludmila Voropaeva and already 50 years old but yesterday 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.980
 she got a subpoena from her mother 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.470
 Kiev recruiting office and women are not 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.420
 understand and the patient could call 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.920
 in the army somehow so a woman about what can 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.410
 help women then you are still in such 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.050
 aged I certainly won't go to like this 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.220
 I can go what I will do 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.560
 prayer special price to 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.959
 there break out to these sentiments among 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.150
 youth panic they stood on 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.220
 Independence is not for war but for the world they 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.260
 wanted prosperity in their own country but for now 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.350
 see only devastation and lawlessness 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.270
 In general, this is happening in our country on 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.180
 in fact, this person is allowed without 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.690
 assigned it took 100 ms caught or 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.630
 somehow 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.870
 but so during the day do subscription 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.050
 you matter was not passed and so on 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.209
 fact look normal sends everything 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.550
 soldiers of the national guard like and 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.380
 happy long-awaited rotation but do not understand 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.239
 why are their parts going to bring 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.050
 recruits not yet prepared for 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.060
 military service 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.890
 who will train them and will there be 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.709
 is it time to go to battle tomorrow 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.260
 I insert some where there is no second 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.900
 shelling throw weapons well as active 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.390
 among those who would not want this place here 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.250
 boundless snow covered field under 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.500
 Dnepropetrovsk and graves with mourning 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.450
 wreaths in this cemetery are buried and 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.519
 hundreds of ukrainian soldiers on many 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.470
 Crosses do not even have names but hangs modest 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.570
 name plate unspecified defender 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.239
 Ukraine a little further to the horizon 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.890
 tie up rows of dug graves along 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.410
 Essentially they are prepared for those who 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.030
 call in the army of today all 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.160
 men of military age already 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.650
