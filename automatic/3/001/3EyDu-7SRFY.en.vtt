off<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.780> little<00:01:47.049> bit<00:01:47.289> so<00:01:48.009> what<00:01:48.219> I<00:01:48.250> like<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.579> do<00:01:48.729> is

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
off a little bit so what I like to do is

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.630 
off a little bit so what I like to do is
just<00:01:48.880> kind<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.240> lift<00:01:49.539> up<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.899> top<00:01:50.079> one<00:01:50.350> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
just kind of lift up the top one and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.609 
just kind of lift up the top one and
place<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.939> and<00:01:52.329> just<00:01:52.630> constantly<00:01:53.140> be<00:01:53.350> kind<00:01:53.560> of

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
place it and just constantly be kind of

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.349 
place it and just constantly be kind of
lifting<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.100> up<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:54.369> placing<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:54.819> making<00:01:55.119> sure

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
lifting it up and placing it making sure

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.559 
lifting it up and placing it making sure
that<00:01:55.869> these<00:01:56.049> two<00:01:56.319> edges<00:01:56.469> stay<00:01:57.100> just<00:01:57.819> perfectly

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
that these two edges stay just perfectly

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.260 
that these two edges stay just perfectly
right<00:01:58.990> on<00:01:59.140> top<00:01:59.319> of<00:01:59.350> each<00:01:59.530> other<00:01:59.670> now<00:02:00.670> is<00:02:00.939> it<00:02:01.149> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
right on top of each other now is it the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.699 
right on top of each other now is it the
end<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.600> world<00:02:01.750> if<00:02:02.020> they<00:02:02.170> get<00:02:02.469> off<00:02:02.679> a

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
end of the world if they get off a

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.010 
end of the world if they get off a
little<00:02:03.009> bit<00:02:03.189> no<00:02:03.549> this<00:02:04.030> is<00:02:04.209> just<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.569> rail<00:02:04.750> fence

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
little bit no this is just a rail fence

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.349 
little bit no this is just a rail fence
block<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:06.039> it's<00:02:06.219> not<00:02:06.429> going<00:02:06.819> to<00:02:06.969> make<00:02:07.149> or<00:02:07.329> break

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
block so it's not going to make or break

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.869 
block so it's not going to make or break
anything<00:02:07.780> if<00:02:08.259> this<00:02:08.619> gets<00:02:08.979> off<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.610> it's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
anything if this gets off of it it's

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.000 
anything if this gets off of it it's
just<00:02:10.060> one<00:02:10.179> of<00:02:10.209> those<00:02:10.330> things<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:11.500> nice<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.980> be

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
just one of those things it's nice to be

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.680 
just one of those things it's nice to be
in<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.459> good<00:02:12.640> habit<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:14.099> piecing<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:15.690> keeping

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
in a good habit of piecing and keeping

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.720 
in a good habit of piecing and keeping
these<00:02:16.810> edges<00:02:17.230> together<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.010> way<00:02:18.250> it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
these edges together so that way it

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.860 
these edges together so that way it
works<00:02:18.940> out<00:02:19.120> well<00:02:19.299> for<00:02:19.540> all<00:02:19.569> of<00:02:19.930> our<00:02:20.019> locks<00:02:21.870> ok

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
works out well for all of our locks ok

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.920 
works out well for all of our locks ok
so<00:02:22.930> send<00:02:23.349> it<00:02:23.500> through

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.949 

so<00:02:27.930> repeat<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.590> step<00:02:28.980> lining<00:02:29.819> up<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.360> two

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
so repeat that step lining up the two

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.199 
so repeat that step lining up the two
pieces<00:02:31.200> together<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:32.040> stitching<00:02:32.849> them<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
pieces together and stitching them the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.520 
pieces together and stitching them the
accurate<00:02:33.720> quarter<00:02:34.049> of<00:02:34.110> an<00:02:34.170> inch<00:02:34.230> seam

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
accurate quarter of an inch seam

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.399 
accurate quarter of an inch seam
allowance<00:02:34.560> for<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.730> C<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.180> D<00:02:36.629> piece<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.230> our

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
allowance for the C and D piece of our

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.530 
allowance for the C and D piece of our
rail<00:02:37.620> fence<00:02:37.890> block<00:02:38.220> now<00:02:39.030> we're<00:02:39.239> going<00:02:39.450> to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
rail fence block now we're going to

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.690 
rail fence block now we're going to
connect<00:02:40.019> these<00:02:40.170> two<00:02:40.440> pieced<00:02:40.860> units<00:02:41.459> together

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
connect these two pieced units together

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.390 
connect these two pieced units together
and<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.709> point<00:02:43.860> where<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.190> really

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
and this is the point where you really

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.369 
and this is the point where you really
want<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.670> kind<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:44.849> make<00:02:45.060> sure<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.870> you're

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
want to kind of make sure that you're

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.030 
want to kind of make sure that you're
whiter<00:02:47.010> strip<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.140> outer<00:02:49.379> edge<00:02:49.650> and

whiter strip is on this outer edge and

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.460 
whiter strip is on this outer edge and
it's<00:02:50.190> on<00:02:50.940> both<00:02:51.120> sides<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.230> we<00:02:52.440> are

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
it's on both sides so that we are

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.300 
it's on both sides so that we are
piecing<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.069> narrower<00:02:53.579> strip<00:02:54.090> on<00:02:55.079> both<00:02:55.500> units

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.250 
piecing the narrower strip on both units
together<00:02:56.790> we<00:02:57.540> want<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> make<00:02:57.900> sure<00:02:57.930> those

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
together we want to make sure those

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.520 
together we want to make sure those
narrower<00:02:58.739> strips<00:02:59.160> are<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.579> middle<00:03:00.530> it's

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
narrower strips are to the middle it's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.350 
narrower strips are to the middle it's
