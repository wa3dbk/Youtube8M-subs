00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
will not adhere to the gutters typically

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.359 
will not adhere to the gutters typically
after<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.050> first<00:01:14.259> winner<00:01:14.560> up<00:01:14.920> here<00:01:15.100> I<00:01:15.310> know

after the first winner up here I know

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.450 
after the first winner up here I know
they'll<00:01:15.670> start<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:16.030> peel<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:17.170> we<00:01:17.290> got<00:01:17.410> a<00:01:17.460> gun

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
they'll start to peel so we got a gun

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.260 
they'll start to peel so we got a gun
loaded<00:01:18.820> up<00:01:18.970> almost<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.450> full<00:01:19.690> pressure<00:01:21.270> I've

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
loaded up almost a full pressure I've

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.910 
loaded up almost a full pressure I've
got<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.570> gutters<00:01:22.840> here<00:01:23.170> we've<00:01:23.619> got<00:01:23.800> it

got the gutters here we've got it
instead<00:01:24.640> of<00:01:24.759> a<00:01:24.820> downspout<00:01:25.270> there's<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.660> chain

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
instead of a downspout there's a chain

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.510 
instead of a downspout there's a chain
over<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.680> corner<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.070> we<00:01:27.340> actually

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
over in the corner and we actually

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.630 
over in the corner and we actually
masked<00:01:27.970> off<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.420> chain<00:01:28.690> to<00:01:29.470> keep<00:01:30.430> any

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
masked off the chain to keep any

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.789 
masked off the chain to keep any
overspray<00:01:31.030> off<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.420> chain<00:01:31.659> and<00:01:32.020> we<00:01:32.440> got<00:01:32.620> this

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
overspray off the chain and we got this

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.860 
overspray off the chain and we got this
length<00:01:33.070> I've<00:01:33.250> got<00:01:33.430> her<00:01:33.549> now<00:01:33.729> that<00:01:34.450> we<00:01:34.600> can

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
length I've got her now that we can

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.820 
length I've got her now that we can
spray<00:01:35.440> this<00:01:35.620> whole<00:01:35.799> thing

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
spray this whole thing

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.650 
spray this whole thing
and<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:38.030> first<00:01:38.240> thing<00:01:38.360> I'm<00:01:38.420> gonna<00:01:38.510> do<00:01:38.630> is

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
and the first thing I'm gonna do is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.650 
and the first thing I'm gonna do is
spray<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.590> bottom<00:01:39.800> in<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.580> ends<00:01:41.090> want<00:01:41.570> to

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
spray the bottom in the ends want to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.150 
spray the bottom in the ends want to
spray<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.990> end<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.860> could<00:01:43.010> actually

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
spray the end of it and I could actually

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.750 
spray the end of it and I could actually
reach<00:01:44.350> with<00:01:45.350> my<00:01:45.380> gun<00:01:46.100> without<00:01:46.370> getting<00:01:46.610> on<00:01:46.670> the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
reach with my gun without getting on the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.670 
reach with my gun without getting on the
ladder

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
ladder

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.890 
ladder
in<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.670> bottom<00:01:49.060> there's<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.750> actual

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
in the bottom there's the actual

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.740 
in the bottom there's the actual
backside<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.250> gutter<00:01:51.460> that<00:01:51.790> you<00:01:52.240> can<00:01:52.450> see

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
backside of the gutter that you can see

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:12.980 
backside of the gutter that you can see
that<00:01:53.380> we<00:01:53.470> got<00:01:53.620> to<00:01:53.710> spray<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.070> inside<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:54.940> box

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.540 

so<00:02:13.990> we've<00:02:14.140> hit<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.350> bottom<00:02:14.740> of<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.400> gutter

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
so we've hit the bottom of the gutter

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.490 
so we've hit the bottom of the gutter
once<00:02:15.910> now<00:02:16.180> now<00:02:16.750> we're<00:02:16.870> going<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.020> go<00:02:17.110> back<00:02:17.290> and

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
once now now we're going to go back and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:34.420 
once now now we're going to go back and
hit<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.710> face<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.160> it

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.380 

anytime<00:02:35.430> you're<00:02:35.580> spraying<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.940> face<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.330> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
anytime you're spraying the face of the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.300 
anytime you're spraying the face of the
gutters<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.810> want<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.020> try<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> do<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.980> all<00:02:38.250> in

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
gutters you want to try to do it all in

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.550 
gutters you want to try to do it all in
one<00:02:38.540> sweep<00:02:39.540> without<00:02:39.840> releasing<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.320> trigger

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
one sweep without releasing the trigger

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.470 
one sweep without releasing the trigger
and<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.220> way<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.430> will<00:02:41.670> have<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.880> start<00:02:42.330> and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
and that way you will have a start and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.720 
and that way you will have a start and
stop<00:02:42.690> points<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.740> betters<00:02:44.070> will<00:02:44.280> look<00:02:44.460> just

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
stop points the betters will look just

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.260 
stop points the betters will look just
like<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.390> naturally<00:02:46.370> done<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.790> factory

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270

in one sweep without actually using a

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.930 
in one sweep without actually using a
ladder<00:03:16.170> we've<00:03:16.770> got<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.040> downspout<00:03:17.670> for

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
ladder we've got the downspout for

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.300 
ladder we've got the downspout for
another<00:03:18.270> gutter<00:03:18.540> now<00:03:18.810> right<00:03:19.620> here<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
another gutter now right here and the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.700 
another gutter now right here and the
downspouts<00:03:20.970> actually<00:03:21.360> mounted<00:03:21.810> on<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.530> house

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
it's different color than the gutter so

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.270 
it's different color than the gutter so
we<00:03:27.120> actually<00:03:27.240> remove<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.810> downspout<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:29.130> we

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
we actually remove the downspout so we

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.430 
we actually remove the downspout so we
can<00:03:29.460> paint<00:03:30.000> behind<00:03:30.240> where<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.870> downspout<00:03:31.410> is

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
can paint behind where the downspout is

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.970 
can paint behind where the downspout is
mountain<00:03:31.920> mountain<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.730> then<00:03:33.830> we<00:03:34.830> can

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
mountain mountain and then we can

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.890 
mountain mountain and then we can
actually<00:03:35.100> paint<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.550> downspout<00:03:36.120> itself<00:03:36.540> and

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
actually paint the downspout itself and

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.490 
actually paint the downspout itself and
