we do find out and I'm optimistic we

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.150 
we do find out and I'm optimistic we
will<00:02:29.480> when<00:02:29.989> we<00:02:30.019> do<00:02:30.260> find<00:02:30.500> out<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.799> think<00:02:31.040> it's

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
will when we do find out I think it's

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160 
will when we do find out I think it's
going<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.430> be<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.610> tipping<00:02:32.060> point<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.569> the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
going to be a tipping point in the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.559 
going to be a tipping point in the
crisis<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:34.069> East<00:02:34.400> Ukraine<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:35.090> think<00:02:35.330> when<00:02:35.480> you

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
crisis in East Ukraine I think when you

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.380 
crisis in East Ukraine I think when you
mess<00:02:35.810> with<00:02:36.319> civilian<00:02:37.129> airliners<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.000> kind<00:02:38.239> of

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
mess with civilian airliners you kind of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.570 
mess with civilian airliners you kind of
mess<00:02:38.569> with<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.959> whole<00:02:39.140> world<00:02:39.349> you<00:02:40.069> know<00:02:40.190> the

mess with the whole world you know the
whole<00:02:40.760> world<00:02:41.000> feels<00:02:41.299> it<00:02:41.629> so<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.930> think<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.319> is

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
whole world feels it so I think this is

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.080 
whole world feels it so I think this is
going<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.769> be<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> tipping<00:02:43.280> point<00:02:43.310> we

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
going to be a tipping point we

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.360 
going to be a tipping point we
personally<00:02:44.840> have<00:02:44.989> been<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.440> far<00:02:45.680> removed<00:02:45.860> from

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
personally have been so far removed from

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.130 
personally have been so far removed from
what's<00:02:46.670> happening<00:02:46.819> in<00:02:47.269> Ukraine<00:02:47.660> with<00:02:47.900> Russia

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
what's happening in Ukraine with Russia

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.350 
what's happening in Ukraine with Russia
and<00:02:48.380> Ukraine<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.890> miss<00:02:49.010> ukraine<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:50.060> this

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
and Ukraine and miss ukraine that this

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.229 
and Ukraine and miss ukraine that this
is<00:02:50.690> really<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.709> drives<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.400> point<00:02:52.579> home<00:02:52.760> now

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
is really just drives the point home now

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.880 
is really just drives the point home now
we<00:02:53.299> care<00:02:53.870> right<00:02:54.140> we<00:02:54.290> thought<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.620> couldn't

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
we care right we thought it couldn't

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.680 
we care right we thought it couldn't
hurt<00:02:54.920> us<00:02:55.280> some<00:02:55.519> halfway<00:02:56.209> around<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:56.599> world

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
hurt us some halfway around the world

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.289 
hurt us some halfway around the world
but<00:02:57.500> now<00:02:57.680> it's<00:02:57.920> just<00:02:58.010> brought<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.549> so<00:02:59.030> close

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
but now it's just brought this so close

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.990 
but now it's just brought this so close
to<00:02:59.450> home<00:02:59.660> it's<00:02:59.930> affected<00:03:00.440> us<00:03:00.560> all<00:03:00.799> here<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.489> I

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
to home it's affected us all here and I

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.150 
to home it's affected us all here and I
think<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:02.720> four<00:03:03.049> months<00:03:03.260> 10<00:03:03.650> days<00:03:03.680> after

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
think just four months 10 days after

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.509 
think just four months 10 days after
mh370<00:03:05.090> we're<00:03:05.540> still<00:03:05.780> raw<00:03:06.110> from<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.370> this

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
mh370 we're still raw from that so this

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.330 
mh370 we're still raw from that so this
is<00:03:07.640> really<00:03:07.849> kind<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.390> hitting<00:03:09.200> us<00:03:09.590> when<00:03:10.129> we're

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
is really kind of hitting us when we're

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.640 
is really kind of hitting us when we're
down<00:03:10.549> already<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.299> would<00:03:11.660> also<00:03:11.690> be<00:03:12.079> remiss<00:03:12.349> if<00:03:12.530> I

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
down already I would also be remiss if I

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.110 
down already I would also be remiss if I
didn't<00:03:12.920> tell<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.190> of<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.370> have<00:03:13.549> a<00:03:13.640> big<00:03:13.819> story

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
didn't tell you of you have a big story

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.379 
didn't tell you of you have a big story
now<00:03:14.560> mh17<00:03:15.560> has<00:03:15.709> probably<00:03:16.160> Eclipse<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.359> a

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
now mh17 has probably Eclipse this a

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.050 
now mh17 has probably Eclipse this a
little<00:03:17.600> bit<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:19.060> israeli-palestinian

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
little bit but the israeli-palestinian

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.150 
little bit but the israeli-palestinian
conflict<00:03:20.090> has<00:03:20.690> also<00:03:20.870> escalated<00:03:21.260> overnight

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
conflict has also escalated overnight

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.400 
conflict has also escalated overnight
now<00:03:22.400> after<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:22.760> 10-day<00:03:23.000> offensive<00:03:23.660> Israeli

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
now after a 10-day offensive Israeli

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.009 
now after a 10-day offensive Israeli
forces<00:03:24.829> have<00:03:25.670> mounted<00:03:26.209> a<00:03:26.299> ground<00:03:26.630> invasion

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
forces have mounted a ground invasion

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.830 
forces have mounted a ground invasion
they<00:03:27.650> rolled<00:03:27.950> in<00:03:28.130> tanks<00:03:28.519> into<00:03:28.700> Gaza<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.420> I

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
they rolled in tanks into Gaza and I

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.339 
they rolled in tanks into Gaza and I
think<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.349> body<00:03:30.620> count<00:03:30.859> is<00:03:31.099> now<00:03:31.310> 230<00:03:32.180> after<00:03:33.079> 10

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
think the body count is now 230 after 10

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.500 
think the body count is now 230 after 10
days<00:03:33.380> so<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.280> think<00:03:34.400> it's<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.760> day<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:35.060> really<00:03:35.299> bad

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
days so I think it's a day of really bad

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.110 
days so I think it's a day of really bad
news<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.500> I'm<00:03:36.709> hoping<00:03:37.010> gets<00:03:37.280> better<00:03:37.549> over<00:03:38.030> the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
news and I'm hoping gets better over the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.210 
news and I'm hoping gets better over the
weekend<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> weeks<00:03:39.109> ahead<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.620> hope<00:03:39.980> that

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
weekend and the weeks ahead I hope that

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.729
