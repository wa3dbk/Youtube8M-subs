just like kind of goes on your ear but
it's<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:38.180> think<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.390> guys<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:39.930> from<00:01:40.110> it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
it's I think you guys can see from it

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.660 
it's I think you guys can see from it
how<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> super<00:01:42.030> ro<00:01:43.220> because<00:01:44.220> it's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
how it's really a super ro because it's

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.300 
how it's really a super ro because it's
not<00:01:44.939> too<00:01:45.829> big<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> use<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.950> really

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
not too big for the use and it's really

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.569 
not too big for the use and it's really
shallow<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.810> guess<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.040> really<00:01:53.100> shallow

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
shallow I guess it's not really shallow

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.319 
shallow I guess it's not really shallow
like<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> HP<00:01:54.570> X<00:01:54.780> which<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:56.329> beyond

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
like the HP X which is just beyond

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.330 
like the HP X which is just beyond
uncomfortable<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.500> use<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.890> yet<00:01:59.070> but

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
uncomfortable at and use the yet but

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.840 
uncomfortable at and use the yet but
that's<00:01:59.490> look<00:01:59.759> I've<00:02:00.299> heard<00:02:01.610> it's<00:02:02.610> got<00:02:02.820> a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that's look I've heard it's got a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.800 
that's look I've heard it's got a
retractable<00:02:04.340> microphone<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.210> turtle

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
retractable microphone like the turtle
