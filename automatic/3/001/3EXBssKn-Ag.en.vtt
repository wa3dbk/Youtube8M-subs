a<00:02:29.370> bigger<00:02:29.670> scope<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.270> there<00:02:30.420> because<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> lot<00:02:31.080> of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
a bigger scope on there because a lot of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.330 
a bigger scope on there because a lot of
times<00:02:31.380> scopes<00:02:31.710> will<00:02:31.950> go<00:02:32.040> beneath<00:02:34.190> g36<00:02:35.190> does

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
times scopes will go beneath g36 does

times scopes will go beneath g36 does
have<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> very<00:02:35.850> high<00:02:36.150> mount<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:36.750> their<00:02:36.870> sights

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
have a very high mount for their sights

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.160 
have a very high mount for their sights
and<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.400> lot<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.610> times<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.900> get

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
and a lot of times you have to get

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.100 
and a lot of times you have to get
really<00:02:40.410> high<00:02:40.590> mounts<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.250> larger<00:02:41.640> scope<00:02:42.110> so

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
really high mounts for a larger scope so

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.260 
really high mounts for a larger scope so
you<00:02:43.920> don't<00:02:44.070> have<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.370> get<00:02:44.490> very<00:02:44.730> large<00:02:44.850> amounts

you don't have to get very large amounts

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.090 
you don't have to get very large amounts
to<00:02:45.390> mount<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.690> big<00:02:45.930> scope<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.530> one<00:02:46.680> now<00:02:46.830> and

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
we're gonna be rewiring it we've rewired

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.140 
we're gonna be rewiring it we've rewired
it<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.770> Dean<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.220> far<00:02:50.460> well<00:02:50.640> actually<00:02:50.850> not

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
it to Dean so far well actually not

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.440 
it to Dean so far well actually not
technically<00:02:51.720> but<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:53.640> was<00:02:53.820> done<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.210> can

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
technically but this was done with a can

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.630 
technically but this was done with a can
of<00:02:54.480> spray<00:02:54.600> paint<00:02:54.780> yes<00:02:55.470> let<00:02:56.190> me<00:02:56.220> get<00:02:56.430> some

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
of spray paint yes let me get some

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:17.449 
of spray paint yes let me get some
closer<00:02:58.850> can<00:02:59.850> of<00:02:59.970> spray<00:03:00.180> paint<00:03:13.640> works<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:17.280> this

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
closer can of spray paint works so this

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.280 
closer can of spray paint works so this
is<00:03:17.640> Mikey's<00:03:17.970> gun<00:03:18.180> it's<00:03:18.510> gonna<00:03:18.750> be<00:03:18.930> shooting

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
is Mikey's gun it's gonna be shooting

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.760 
is Mikey's gun it's gonna be shooting
probably<00:03:19.680> around<00:03:19.940> 500<00:03:23.870> pretty<00:03:24.870> fast<00:03:25.080> like<00:03:25.320> 450

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
probably around 500 pretty fast like 450

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.310 
probably around 500 pretty fast like 450
so<00:03:28.770> yeah<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.970> pretty<00:03:30.090> much<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.420> we<00:03:30.660> may

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
so yeah so this is pretty much it we may

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.790 
so yeah so this is pretty much it we may
put<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.770> s<00:03:31.890> elite<00:03:32.310> stock<00:03:32.730> on<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.620> think<00:03:34.620> that

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
put it s elite stock on it I think that

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.070 
put it s elite stock on it I think that
would<00:03:34.950> make<00:03:35.100> this<00:03:35.310> gun<00:03:35.670> complete<00:03:36.150> let<00:03:36.480> me<00:03:36.840> know
