the<00:00:00.989> best<00:00:01.199> of<00:00:01.350> 60<00:00:01.680> 50<00:00:02.010> so<00:00:02.639> we<00:00:02.879> have<00:00:03.090> some<00:00:03.330> new

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
the best of 60 50 so we have some new

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.420 
the best of 60 50 so we have some new
options<00:00:03.750> available<00:00:04.259> with<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.770> system<00:00:04.980> from

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
options available with this system from

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.369 
options available with this system from
NCIX<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.210> guys<00:00:06.359> remember<00:00:06.629> we<00:00:06.899> showed<00:00:07.080> you<00:00:07.259> the

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
NCIX you guys remember we showed you the

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.980 
NCIX you guys remember we showed you the
prototype<00:00:07.890> process<00:00:08.429> as<00:00:08.639> well<00:00:09.300> as<00:00:09.480> some<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
prototype process as well as some of the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.900 
prototype process as well as some of the
design<00:00:10.590> procedures<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.460> go<00:00:11.639> through

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
design procedures that we go through

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.209 
design procedures that we go through
here<00:00:12.120> at<00:00:12.240> NCIX<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.290> we<00:00:13.440> actually<00:00:13.590> have<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> new

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
here at NCIX so we actually have a new

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.460 
here at NCIX so we actually have a new
graphics<00:00:14.490> card<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.509> came<00:00:15.750> out<00:00:15.929> today<00:00:16.080> this

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
graphics card that came out today this

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.450 
graphics card that came out today this
is<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.970> nvidia<00:00:17.970> geforce<00:00:18.630> gtx<00:00:19.320> 570<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.310> we've

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
is the nvidia geforce gtx 570 so we've

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.800 
is the nvidia geforce gtx 570 so we've
got<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> couple<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.150> those<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.480> we're<00:00:21.630> showing

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
got a couple of those so we're showing

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.609 
got a couple of those so we're showing
the<00:00:21.930> performance<00:00:22.800> edition<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:24.619> tower

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the performance edition of this tower

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.099 
the performance edition of this tower
which<00:00:26.130> features<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.849> TX<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.359> 50<00:00:27.720> watt<00:00:27.840> power

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
which features the TX a 50 watt power

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
as well as faster memory alright so this

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.260 
as well as faster memory alright so this
all<00:00:35.160> comes<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> fractal<00:00:35.969> design<00:00:36.120> define

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
all comes in the fractal design define

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.180 
all comes in the fractal design define
XL<00:00:36.870> case<00:00:37.140> now<00:00:37.320> there's<00:00:37.500> another<00:00:37.620> thing<00:00:38.010> that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
XL case now there's another thing that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.970 
XL case now there's another thing that
came<00:00:38.340> out<00:00:38.520> today<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.629> wish<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.230> video<00:00:40.620> was

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
came out today and I wish this video was

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.130 
came out today and I wish this video was
a<00:00:41.010> little<00:00:41.340> bit<00:00:41.520> better<00:00:42.090> than<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.660> because

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
a little bit better than it is because

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.340 
a little bit better than it is because
what<00:00:43.800> happened<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.489> 3dmark11<00:00:45.480> came<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.200> we

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
what happened is 3dmark11 came out we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.819 
what happened is 3dmark11 came out we
were<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.559> yeah<00:00:46.770> okay<00:00:47.250> let's<00:00:47.550> throw<00:00:47.760> some<00:00:47.940> gtx

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
were like yeah okay let's throw some gtx

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.160 
were like yeah okay let's throw some gtx
570<00:00:49.829> s<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> Vesta<00:00:50.670> 6050<00:00:51.329> prototype<00:00:51.840> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
570 s in the Vesta 6050 prototype and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.260 
570 s in the Vesta 6050 prototype and
let's<00:00:52.350> find<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.680> how<00:00:52.829> well<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.129> runs<00:00:53.280> except

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
let's find out how well it runs except

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.889 
let's find out how well it runs except
the<00:00:54.449> SLI<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.140> not<00:00:55.440> supported<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.149> 3dmark<00:00:57.149> 11<00:00:57.420> on

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the SLI is not supported in 3dmark 11 on

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.299 
the SLI is not supported in 3dmark 11 on
the<00:00:57.960> gtx<00:00:58.620> 570<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.670> yet<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:01.199> got<00:01:01.469> under<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the gtx 570 just yet so we got under the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.560 
the gtx 570 just yet so we got under the
extreme<00:01:02.699> preset<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> score<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:04.939> 1687<00:01:05.939> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
extreme preset a score of 1687 so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.780 
extreme preset a score of 1687 so
remember<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.110> are<00:01:07.260> running<00:01:07.470> an<00:01:07.680> i7<00:01:07.890> 950

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
remember we are running an i7 950

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.210 
remember we are running an i7 950
processor<00:01:09.689> we've<00:01:09.869> got<00:01:10.110> 12<00:01:10.380> gigs<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.799> ram<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
processor we've got 12 gigs of ram and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.520 
processor we've got 12 gigs of ram and
we've<00:01:11.729> also<00:01:11.939> got<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.140> intents<00:01:13.530> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
we've also got for all intents and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.359 
we've also got for all intents and
purposes<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.340> single<00:01:15.240> gtx<00:01:15.900> 570<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.009> i<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.250> go

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
purposes a single gtx 570 so i can go

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.630 
purposes a single gtx 570 so i can go
ahead<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.259> let's<00:01:19.259> start<00:01:19.590> running<00:01:20.009> 3dmark11

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
ahead and let's start running 3dmark11

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.880 
ahead and let's start running 3dmark11
here<00:01:21.299> i<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.840> figure<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.200> how<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.710> there

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
here i can figure out how to do it there

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.550 
here i can figure out how to do it there
we<00:01:22.979> go<00:01:23.100> run<00:01:23.310> extreme<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> want<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.659> obviously

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
we go run extreme so I want to obviously

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.450 
we go run extreme so I want to obviously
we're<00:01:25.680> not<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.009> make<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.369> way

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
we're not going to make it all the way

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.649 
we're not going to make it all the way
through<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> test<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.210> want<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> talk<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
through the test but I want to talk a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.420 
through the test but I want to talk a
little<00:01:27.960> bit<00:01:28.200> about<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> different<00:01:29.040> tests<00:01:29.220> so

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
little bit about the different tests so

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.700 
little bit about the different tests so
test<00:01:29.729> number<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.210> has<00:01:30.659> no<00:01:30.990> tessellation

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
test number one has no tessellation

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.670 
test number one has no tessellation
heavy<00:01:32.369> lighting<00:01:32.939> from<00:01:33.150> multiple<00:01:33.659> sources<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
heavy lighting from multiple sources and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.330 
heavy lighting from multiple sources and
so<00:01:34.979> remembered<00:01:35.460> 3dmark11<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> directx<00:01:37.590> 11

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
so remembered 3dmark11 is a directx 11

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.249 
so remembered 3dmark11 is a directx 11
benchmark<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.180> we're<00:01:39.360> actually<00:01:39.540> even<00:01:40.110> though

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
benchmark so we're actually even though

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.810 
benchmark so we're actually even though
test<00:01:40.710> number<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:41.159> doesn't<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.520> any

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
test number one doesn't have any

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.690 
test number one doesn't have any
tessellation<00:01:42.450> other<00:01:42.810> tests<00:01:43.710> are<00:01:43.890> using

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
tessellation other tests are using

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.910 
tessellation other tests are using
tessellations<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.479> tests<00:01:45.899> two<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> test3

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
tessellations so tests two and test3

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.060 
tessellations so tests two and test3
both<00:01:47.670> use<00:01:47.970> medium<00:01:48.540> tessellation<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.530> media

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
both use medium tessellation with media

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.710 
both use medium tessellation with media
lighting<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:50.970> light<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
lighting and then with one light and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350 
lighting and then with one light and
then<00:01:52.140> test<00:01:52.380> number<00:01:52.649> four<00:01:52.950> uses<00:01:53.360> extensive

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
then test number four uses extensive

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.899 
then test number four uses extensive
tessellation<00:01:55.079> with<00:01:55.590> many<00:01:56.130> different<00:01:56.399> lights

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
tessellation with many different lights

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.670 
tessellation with many different lights
so<00:01:57.149> actually<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:57.659> yeah<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.200> see<00:01:58.409> test

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
so actually here yeah you can see test

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.959 
so actually here yeah you can see test
number<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.340> running<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.290> whopping<00:02:01.290> nine

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
number one is running at a whopping nine

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.389 
number one is running at a whopping nine
FPS<00:02:03.079> so<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.350> check<00:02:04.500> out<00:02:04.680> those<00:02:04.860> submarines

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
FPS so we can check out those submarines

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.180 
FPS so we can check out those submarines
I<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.240> can't<00:02:06.479> wait<00:02:06.689> until<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.799> every

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
I I can't wait until it's like every

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.279 
I I can't wait until it's like every
every<00:02:08.640> 3dmark<00:02:09.209> releases<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.110> you're

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
every 3dmark releases like this you're

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.530 
every 3dmark releases like this you're
like<00:02:10.440> oh<00:02:10.619> man<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.489> looks<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.819> cool<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.090> can't

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
like oh man this looks so cool I can't

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.070 
like oh man this looks so cool I can't
wait<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.810> like

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
wait to like

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.830 
wait to like
actually<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:14.210> see<00:02:15.210> what's<00:02:15.420> going<00:02:15.690> on

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
actually like see what's going on

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.290 
actually like see what's going on
because<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.770> have<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> decent<00:02:17.490> framerate<00:02:17.880> so

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
because I have a decent framerate so

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.560 
because I have a decent framerate so
yeah<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.230> can't<00:02:19.530> wait<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.710> like<00:02:20.100> GTX<00:02:20.700> 980<00:02:21.330> or

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
yeah I can't wait for like GTX 980 or

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.120 
yeah I can't wait for like GTX 980 or
whatever<00:02:21.900> we're<00:02:22.170> finally<00:02:22.710> going<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.890> be<00:02:23.040> able

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
whatever we're finally going to be able

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.500 
whatever we're finally going to be able
to<00:02:23.370> see<00:02:23.550> what<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.790> looks<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.150> when<00:02:24.330> it's

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
to see what it looks like when it's

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.870 
to see what it looks like when it's
running<00:02:24.660> butter<00:02:25.020> smooth<00:02:25.410> anyway<00:02:26.190> there's<00:02:26.550> two

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
running butter smooth anyway there's two

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.200 
running butter smooth anyway there's two
cpu<00:02:27.510> tests<00:02:27.840> which<00:02:27.960> has<00:02:28.110> been<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.380> tradition

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
cpu tests which has been the tradition

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.370 
cpu tests which has been the tradition
well<00:02:30.210> at<00:02:30.300> least<00:02:30.390> for<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.690> last<00:02:30.720> release<00:02:31.230> of

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
well at least for the last release of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.080 
well at least for the last release of
3dmark<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.160> first<00:02:32.370> one<00:02:32.550> does<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.820> lot<00:02:33.030> of

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
3dmark so the first one does a lot of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.900 
3dmark so the first one does a lot of
rigid<00:02:33.450> body<00:02:33.660> physics<00:02:34.430> there's<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.520> fixed

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
rigid body physics there's a fixed

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.610 
rigid body physics there's a fixed
resolution<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:36.690> no<00:02:36.810> matter<00:02:36.930> what<00:02:37.050> preset

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
resolution so no matter what preset

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.810 
resolution so no matter what preset
you're<00:02:37.740> running<00:02:38.040> at<00:02:38.160> it's<00:02:38.340> going<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.550> run<00:02:38.670> at

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
you're running at it's going to run at

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.120 
you're running at it's going to run at
the<00:02:38.940> same<00:02:39.120> low<00:02:39.570> res<00:02:39.900> because<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.620> only

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
the same low res because it is only

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.190 
the same low res because it is only
testing<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.000> physics<00:02:42.360> calculations<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
testing the physics calculations and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.220 
testing the physics calculations and
then<00:02:43.500> unlike<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.670> previous<00:02:44.880> 3dmark<00:02:45.660> Vantage

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
then unlike the previous 3dmark Vantage

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.880 
then unlike the previous 3dmark Vantage
the<00:02:46.770> other<00:02:47.070> physics<00:02:47.910> test<00:02:48.270> also<00:02:48.870> has<00:02:49.140> by<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
the other physics test also has by the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.530 
the other physics test also has by the
way<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.190> supports<00:02:50.550> direct<00:02:50.850> compute<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.420> that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
way it supports direct compute so that

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.760 
way it supports direct compute so that
means<00:02:51.720> your<00:02:51.900> graphics<00:02:52.290> card<00:02:52.350> is<00:02:52.590> going<00:02:52.709> to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
means your graphics card is going to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.230 
means your graphics card is going to
chip<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.130> whether<00:02:53.340> you're<00:02:53.550> using<00:02:53.700> nvidia<00:02:54.180> or

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
chip in whether you're using nvidia or

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.070 
chip in whether you're using nvidia or
ati<00:02:54.770> but<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:56.070> also<00:02:56.550> runs<00:02:57.000> at<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.570> resolution

ati but it also runs at the resolution

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.080 
ati but it also runs at the resolution
of<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> rest<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.709> tests<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.310> does<00:02:59.790> some

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
of the rest of the tests it does some

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.600 
of the rest of the tests it does some
physics<00:03:00.600> stuff<00:03:00.870> but<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.470> also<00:03:01.650> has<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.400> lot<00:03:02.580> of

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
physics stuff but it also has a lot of

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
physics stuff but it also has a lot of
other<00:03:02.820> stuff<00:03:02.910> going<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.450> including

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
other stuff going on including

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.480 
other stuff going on including
tessellation<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.709> including<00:03:05.160> lighting

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
tessellation and including lighting

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.070 
tessellation and including lighting
effects<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.030> that's<00:03:06.240> pretty<00:03:06.570> cool<00:03:06.810> because

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
effects so that's pretty cool because

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.650 
effects so that's pretty cool because
that<00:03:07.950> one<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.310> probably<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.940> closest<00:03:09.450> out<00:03:09.600> of

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
that one is probably the closest out of

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.550 
that one is probably the closest out of
everything<00:03:10.020> here<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.620> what<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> real<00:03:11.610> gaming

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
everything here to what a real gaming

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.660 
everything here to what a real gaming
workload<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.709> going<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> look<00:03:14.100> like<00:03:14.130> because

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
workload is going to look like because

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.810 
workload is going to look like because
it<00:03:14.850> relies<00:03:15.090> both<00:03:15.390> on<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.720> CPU<00:03:16.230> as<00:03:16.470> well<00:03:17.280> as<00:03:17.550> the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
it relies both on the CPU as well as the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.500 
it relies both on the CPU as well as the
GPU<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.660> order<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.500> do<00:03:19.890> all<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.850> rendering

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.030 
GPU in order to do all of the rendering
and<00:03:21.720> calculations<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.560> all<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.830> good<00:03:22.980> stuff

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040
