00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.389
 O 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.360
 They want to go under the street in Cannes 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.279
 That's why the excavator has to be repaired first 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.279
 once dig a very deep hole 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.820
 he shovels the song into the 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.820
 small body 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.520
 and shovel 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.430
 and banker 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.440
 [Applause] 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.750
 because the keeper is behind the excavator 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.480
 the excavator must always be at the top 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.809
 turn if he wants to dump the 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.809
 sand 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.390
 Now we drive on the ball with it and 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.200
 turn us around 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.670
 [Music] 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.840
 there is the little keeper 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.990
 already quite full with camouflage guide 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.320
 measures how deep you already dug 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.450
 to have 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.439
 They are on a big thick pipe 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.630
 pushed 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.899
 You can not do that with the excavator 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.049
 dig up the shovel you have to 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.509
 otherwise it will break but that is still 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.080
 not the pipe that they fix 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.950
 should 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.049
 that's a lot deeper after that 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.050
 Carl and Tarnow already worked so much 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.830
 First you have to have breakfast 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.830
 Enjoy your meal 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.850
 have a look 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.390
 what is that thing that looks like 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.390
 a frame 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.910
 that will be done with the excavator 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.360
 pulled up exactly 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.190
 now is still heard passed the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:30.990
 helps gaal and gaetano to work 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.430
 that fits exactly in the hole now 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.370
 the excavator has something else to do 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.370
 pull up so funny share third 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.160
 These are the sheet piling that you need 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.240
 so that the hole does not collapse just like 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.920
 in the sandbox 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.020
 if you dig a deep hole there 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.350
 the sand always slips from the side 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.630
 purely so here too and so that 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.990
 The sheet piles are not passed 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.620
 based the old reingeschoben then the 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.620
 sand 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.070
 after the sheet piling can be in it 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.020
 you really deep dig carefully 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.080
 because the scoop of the excavator 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.520
 exactly fits into the hole and there's 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.520
 even the thick tube in the way 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.150
 once not even pay attention to the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.150
 rod popped 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.650
 gaetano controls in balve who has for it 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.020
 so small lever 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.080
 So he can get the shovel up and up 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.230
 let go down and close in 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.050
 and swaying as karl helps hanno 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.940
 because he can not see anything in the hole he 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.240
 Show him where to move the shovel in 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.580
 should 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:55.070
 so finished in between the dredge 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.680
 if you like to go back and down 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.470
 the sheet piling after rose down with it 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:09.269
 not the sand slips into the hole 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:09.269
 [Music] 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.780
 then that's quite safe and karl 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.450
 came down and together with gaetano 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.640
 once to measure whether it is deep enough 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:27.420
 still does not have to be one again 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.950
 swing wool sandhaus look deep 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.580
 he already has his shovel there 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.580
 must plug in 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.020
 one more way then you can fix it 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.410
 once again
