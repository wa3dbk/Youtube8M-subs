00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.159
 overcooked trying to give an explanation about the clash 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.479
 the price is in with buckley's product gama 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:18.869
 absolutely the strongest braided line that we have, it looks almost 600th 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.869
 has eleven kilos of pulling power 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.720
 have in the range 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.310
 bright colors of orange color 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.279
 and that orange color that is perfectly visible to the fish 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.760
 and under water actually through the color spectrum I was actually just sitting 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.930
 such as a green or a blue or a Berlin call 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.710
 fast away for the club 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 hey orange color 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.470
 it is therefore very perceptible to the fish, which makes it optimal 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.710
 able to see where it is fishing 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.840
 and where 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.810
 if a fish is taken out of the water he has perfect control over it 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.880
 moment he tries to land the us 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.260
 In addition, we have one 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.590
 green color 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.200
 that is actually the original wiplash 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.040
 gronk is a perfectly covered color importer places where water plants 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.380
 be available 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.390
 those aquatic plants 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.140
 will be this color 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.100
 actually 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.370
 fully absorbed and therefore you do not see the line again under water 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.200
 above water seas where a sort of black stripe element 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.240
 that black line that is the line that was visible at the time is but 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.120
 against a dark background it is absolutely powerful or should I say yes 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.810
 is absolutely no longer perceptible so the control of your line is above water 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.130
 a lot less 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.520
 then 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.150
 click with crystal lesson 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.220
 and that with crystal clear light approaching as little as possible 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.900
 more visible from your line 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.900
 the crystal color reminds you of molo liner 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.990
 however here you have a mono 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.410
 appearance 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.890
 interwoven in a braided line 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.390
 and that line is already there 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.300
 practically not visible under water 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.590
 but also difficult to spot above the water for the fish 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.570
 that is not every club under all circumstances 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.590
 to use 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.449
 and hence an extensive range 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:10.389
 in bruckheimer price
