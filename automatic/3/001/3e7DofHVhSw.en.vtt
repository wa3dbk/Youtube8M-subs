all<00:00:01.199> right<00:00:01.410> now<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.620> want<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.920> talk<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.129> little

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
all right now I want to talk a little

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.100 
all right now I want to talk a little
bit<00:00:02.550> about<00:00:02.730> fermentation<00:00:03.090> okay<00:00:03.780> the

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
bit about fermentation okay the

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.960 
bit about fermentation okay the
conversion<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:04.650> pyruvate<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.190> lactate<00:00:05.339> and

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
conversion of pyruvate to lactate and

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.940 
conversion of pyruvate to lactate and
the<00:00:06.150> conversion<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.690> pyruvate<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.200> ethanol

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
the conversion of pyruvate to ethanol

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.310 
the conversion of pyruvate to ethanol
those<00:00:08.790> are<00:00:08.970> two<00:00:09.450> different<00:00:09.480> fates<00:00:10.050> that

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
those are two different fates that

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.200 
those are two different fates that
pyruvate<00:00:10.500> can<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.370> course<00:00:11.550> pyruvate

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
pyruvate can have so of course pyruvate

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.570 
pyruvate can have so of course pyruvate
can<00:00:12.420> go<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.750> make<00:00:12.929> acetyl<00:00:13.320> co<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.559> enter<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
can go on to make acetyl co a enter the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.279 
can go on to make acetyl co a enter the
citric<00:00:14.880> acid<00:00:15.000> cycle<00:00:15.240> all<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.839> sort<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.230> stuff

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
citric acid cycle all that sort of stuff

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.490 
citric acid cycle all that sort of stuff
but<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:16.980> can<00:00:17.070> also<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.760> used<00:00:18.359> under<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.260> then

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
but it can also be used under and then

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.519 
but it can also be used under and then
converted<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.250> lactate<00:00:20.970> under<00:00:21.900> anaerobic

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
converted to lactate under anaerobic

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.740 
converted to lactate under anaerobic
conditions<00:00:22.890> okay<00:00:23.609> when<00:00:23.789> oxygen<00:00:24.359> there's<00:00:24.600> no

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
conditions okay when oxygen there's no

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.019 
conditions okay when oxygen there's no
oxygen<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.039> converted<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.550> lactate

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
oxygen it can be converted to lactate

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.620 
oxygen it can be converted to lactate
okay<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:27.900> ethanol<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.699> our<00:00:29.880> human<00:00:30.119> bodies

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
okay or ethanol but in our human bodies

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.269 
okay or ethanol but in our human bodies
lactate<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.230> someone<00:00:31.619> would<00:00:31.800> mostly<00:00:32.189> be

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
lactate is someone would mostly be

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.639 
lactate is someone would mostly be
talking<00:00:32.790> about<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.719> anyway<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.350> final

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
talking about so anyway the final

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.830 
talking about so anyway the final
reaction<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.640> reduction<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.270> pyruvate<00:00:36.780> to

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
reaction is the reduction of pyruvate to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.780 
reaction is the reduction of pyruvate to
lactate<00:00:37.020> okay<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:38.399> drawing

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
lactate okay and I have a little drawing

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.119 
lactate okay and I have a little drawing
here<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.899> from<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> textbook<00:00:40.739> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
here of it this in from the textbook it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.030 
here of it this in from the textbook it
says<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.480> know<00:00:42.600> here's<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> pyruvate<00:00:43.530> molecule

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
says you know here's a pyruvate molecule

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.850 
says you know here's a pyruvate molecule
and<00:00:44.280> here's<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> lactate<00:00:45.660> molecule<00:00:46.140> ok<00:00:46.800> so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and here's a lactate molecule ok so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.770 
and here's a lactate molecule ok so
we're<00:00:47.100> converting<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.910> enzyme<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.570> called

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
we're converting it the enzyme is called

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.869 
we're converting it the enzyme is called
lactate<00:00:49.289> dehydrogenase<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.370> might<00:00:50.579> not<00:00:50.760> be

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
lactate dehydrogenase you might not be

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.430 
lactate dehydrogenase you might not be
able<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.149> see<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.020> I'm<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
able to see that so I'm just going to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.619 
able to see that so I'm just going to
say<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.620> again<00:00:52.890> lactate<00:00:53.550> dehydrogenase<00:00:54.090> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
say it again lactate dehydrogenase I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.479 
say it again lactate dehydrogenase I
notice<00:00:55.289> an<00:00:55.440> interesting<00:00:55.890> little<00:00:56.010> fact<00:00:56.129> here

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
notice an interesting little fact here

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.439 
notice an interesting little fact here
look<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:56.960> NADH<00:00:57.960> okay<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.410> got<00:00:58.530> NADH<00:00:59.190> +<00:00:59.489> h+<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
look here NADH okay we got NADH + h+ and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.139 
look here NADH okay we got NADH + h+ and
we're<00:01:01.350> making<00:01:01.649> any<00:01:01.800> d+<00:01:02.309> now<00:01:02.969> that's

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
we're making any d+ now that's

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.570 
we're making any d+ now that's
interesting<00:01:03.449> right<00:01:03.870> i<00:01:04.080> mean<00:01:04.140> where<00:01:05.129> did<00:01:05.309> we

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
interesting right i mean where did we

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.670 
interesting right i mean where did we
need<00:01:05.900> NAD+<00:01:06.900> before<00:01:07.590> i<00:01:07.830> don't<00:01:08.640> know<00:01:08.850> let's<00:01:09.150> say

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
need NAD+ before i don't know let's say

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.520 
need NAD+ before i don't know let's say
anyone<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.490> reaction<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.299> exergonic<00:01:12.780> meaning

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
anyone the reaction is exergonic meaning

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.880 
anyone the reaction is exergonic meaning
it<00:01:13.770> gives<00:01:13.950> off<00:01:14.159> energy<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.689> know<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.590> has

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it gives off energy it's you know it has

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.789 
it gives off energy it's you know it has
a<00:01:16.920> large<00:01:17.430> negative<00:01:18.060> Delta<00:01:18.750> G<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.650> see

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
a large negative Delta G as you can see

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.859 
a large negative Delta G as you can see
I<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.310> exact<00:01:20.640> value<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.390> Delta<00:01:21.689> G<00:01:21.840> is

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
I have the exact value the Delta G is

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.249 
I have the exact value the Delta G is
negative<00:01:22.670> 25.1<00:01:23.670> kilojoules<00:01:24.270> per<00:01:24.360> mole<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.930> I

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
negative 25.1 kilojoules per mole and I

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.929 
negative 25.1 kilojoules per mole and I
think<00:01:25.470> that's<00:01:25.590> about<00:01:25.710> negative<00:01:26.220> 6<00:01:26.490> kcals<00:01:26.939> per

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
think that's about negative 6 kcals per

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.789 
think that's about negative 6 kcals per
mole<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.689> prefer<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.490> um<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.799> lactate

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
mole if you prefer that um and lactate

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.670 
mole if you prefer that um and lactate
is<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> dead<00:01:32.369> end<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.850> muscle<00:01:33.450> metabolism<00:01:33.810> okay

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
is a dead end in muscle metabolism okay

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.830 
is a dead end in muscle metabolism okay
but<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.820> recycled<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> liver<00:01:36.720> to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
but it can be recycled in the liver to

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.990 
but it can be recycled in the liver to
form<00:01:37.170> pyruvate<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.740> even<00:01:38.159> glucose<00:01:38.549> by

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
form pyruvate and even glucose by

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.609 
form pyruvate and even glucose by
gluconeogenesis<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.200> we'll<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.470> talking

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
gluconeogenesis and we'll be talking

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.130 
gluconeogenesis and we'll be talking
about<00:01:40.860> gluconeogenesis<00:01:41.329> shortly<00:01:42.329> all<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.780> want

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
about gluconeogenesis shortly all I want

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.770 
about gluconeogenesis shortly all I want
to<00:01:43.229> say<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.640> pyruvate<00:01:44.640> might<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.689> mean

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
to say is that pyruvate might be I mean

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.840 
to say is that pyruvate might be I mean
pyruvate<00:01:46.530> excuse<00:01:46.950> me<00:01:47.040> black<00:01:47.310> tape<00:01:47.520> might<00:01:47.729> be

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
pyruvate excuse me black tape might be

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.789 
pyruvate excuse me black tape might be
useless<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.299> dead<00:01:48.540> end<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> muscles<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.710> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
useless a dead end in the muscles but it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.230 
useless a dead end in the muscles but it
can<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.040> converted<00:01:50.310> by<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> liver<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:50.939> even

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
can be converted by the liver and even

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.429

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.780 
3-phosphate so here's what I said oh I
remember<00:02:46.610> where<00:02:47.450> did<00:02:47.570> we<00:02:47.690> see<00:02:47.870> NAD+<00:02:48.440> well<00:02:49.100> we

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
remember where did we see NAD+ well we

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.690 
remember where did we see NAD+ well we
remember<00:02:50.209> we<00:02:50.330> oxidize<00:02:50.959> we<00:02:51.170> reduced<00:02:51.830> NAD+<00:02:52.670> to

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
remember we oxidize we reduced NAD+ to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.540 
remember we oxidize we reduced NAD+ to
NADH<00:02:52.900> okay<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.110> there's<00:02:55.040> no<00:02:55.130> way<00:02:55.400> of

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
NADH okay and there's no way of

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.410 
NADH okay and there's no way of
recycling<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.110> what<00:02:57.320> this<00:02:57.470> does<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:58.420> it

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
recycling that so what this does is it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.820 
recycling that so what this does is it
allows<00:02:59.450> for<00:02:59.980> recycling<00:03:00.980> of<00:03:01.269> NADH<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.570> nadp+<00:03:03.470> or

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
allows for recycling of NADH to nadp+ or

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.600 
allows for recycling of NADH to nadp+ or
NAD+<00:03:04.640> rather<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:06.560> it's<00:03:06.739> used<00:03:07.010> up<00:03:07.250> there's<00:03:07.549> no

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
NAD+ rather so it's used up there's no

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.270 
NAD+ rather so it's used up there's no
net<00:03:07.970> change<00:03:08.209> in<00:03:08.450> relative<00:03:08.870> amounts<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.560> nadh

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
net change in relative amounts of nadh

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.860 
net change in relative amounts of nadh
and<00:03:10.549> nadph<00:03:11.500> ok<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.790> regulation<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:14.480> needed

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
and nadph ok so the regulation is needed

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.620 
and nadph ok so the regulation is needed
under<00:03:15.170> anaerobic<00:03:15.680> conditions<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.820> cell

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
under anaerobic conditions in the cell

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.039 
under anaerobic conditions in the cell
so<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.290> nad<00:03:18.799> +<00:03:19.070> will<00:03:19.370> be<00:03:19.519> present<00:03:20.060> for<00:03:20.450> future

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
so that nad + will be present for future

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.500 
so that nad + will be present for future
or<00:03:21.290> further<00:03:21.829> glycolysis<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.940> take<00:03:23.090> place<00:03:23.299> so

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
or further glycolysis to take place so

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.530 
or further glycolysis to take place so
you<00:03:23.540> need<00:03:23.900> nad<00:03:24.380> plus<00:03:24.620> if<00:03:24.829> there's<00:03:25.820> no<00:03:25.940> nad<00:03:26.299> plus

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
you need nad plus if there's no nad plus

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.440 
you need nad plus if there's no nad plus
plus<00:03:26.959> a<00:03:27.110> new<00:03:27.260> way<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.470> make<00:03:27.560> NAD+<00:03:28.400> then<00:03:29.239> you're

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
plus a new way to make NAD+ then you're

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.990 
plus a new way to make NAD+ then you're
going<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.600> be<00:03:29.900> in<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.290> bad<00:03:30.470> position<00:03:30.940> okay<00:03:31.940> so

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
going to be in a bad position okay so

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.380 
going to be in a bad position okay so
you<00:03:32.180> gotta<00:03:32.329> find<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.600> way<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.750> do<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:34.390> so

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
you gotta find a way to do that so

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.930 
you gotta find a way to do that so

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.150 
pathway leads to the production of
ethanol<00:04:07.940> okay<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.079> this<00:04:09.500> is<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.680> two-part

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
ethanol okay and this is a two-part

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.479 
ethanol okay and this is a two-part
process<00:04:10.940> okay<00:04:11.889> this<00:04:12.889> is<00:04:13.100> one<00:04:13.310> alternative

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
process okay this is one alternative

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.950 
process okay this is one alternative
fate<00:04:14.180> also<00:04:14.449> for

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
fate also for

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.370 
fate also for
pyruvate<00:04:15.440> as<00:04:15.620> I<00:04:15.800> said<00:04:16.010> before<00:04:16.420> and<00:04:17.420> in<00:04:18.320> the

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
pyruvate as I said before and in the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.770 
pyruvate as I said before and in the
first<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.830> two<00:04:18.950> reactions<00:04:19.490> which<00:04:20.360> leads<00:04:20.630> to

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
first of two reactions which leads to

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.750 
first of two reactions which leads to
the<00:04:20.870> production<00:04:21.020> of<00:04:21.380> ethanol<00:04:21.610> pyruvate<00:04:22.610> is

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
the production of ethanol pyruvate is

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.340 
the production of ethanol pyruvate is
decarboxylated<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:23.930> what<00:04:24.110> I<00:04:24.140> mean<00:04:24.200> by

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
decarboxylated and what I mean by

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.990 
decarboxylated and what I mean by
decarboxylated<00:04:25.250> in<00:04:25.400> case<00:04:25.550> you<00:04:25.640> didn't<00:04:25.910> know

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
decarboxylated in case you didn't know

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.250 
decarboxylated in case you didn't know
is<00:04:26.270> it's<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.570> loss<00:04:26.780> of<00:04:26.960> co2<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.910> that<00:04:29.630> produces<00:04:30.230> a

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
is it's a loss of co2 so that produces a

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.830 
is it's a loss of co2 so that produces a
molecule<00:04:30.590> known<00:04:30.890> as<00:04:31.190> acetaldehyde<00:04:31.880> okay

molecule known as acetaldehyde okay

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.990 
molecule known as acetaldehyde okay
acetaldehyde<00:04:33.400> so<00:04:34.400> first<00:04:34.640> we<00:04:34.850> make

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
acetaldehyde so first we make

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.350 
acetaldehyde so first we make
acetaldehyde<00:04:35.510> from<00:04:35.990> pyruvate<00:04:36.230> and<00:04:37.360> the

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
acetaldehyde from pyruvate and the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.270 
acetaldehyde from pyruvate and the
enzyme<00:04:38.720> that<00:04:38.870> catalyzes<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.560> reaction<00:04:39.620> is

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.180 
enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is
pyruvate<00:04:41.090> decarboxylase<00:04:41.800> okay<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:43.040> the

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
pyruvate decarboxylase okay and the

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.840 
pyruvate decarboxylase okay and the
enzyme<00:04:43.490> requires<00:04:43.820> mg<00:04:44.660> 2<00:04:44.900> plus<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:46.220> the

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
enzyme requires mg 2 plus and the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.680

why the ensign you know requires that Co
fat<00:04:57.290> those<00:04:57.470> particular<00:04:57.950> cofactors<00:04:59.290> but<00:05:00.760> it's

fat those particular cofactors but it's

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.640 
fat those particular cofactors but it's
just<00:05:02.000> worth<00:05:02.180> noting<00:05:02.570> because<00:05:03.080> I<00:05:03.170> doubt<00:05:03.410> that

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
see this ass acid at the front here this

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.470 
see this ass acid at the front here this
when<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:26.300> see<00:05:26.450> acid<00:05:26.930> or<00:05:27.110> form<00:05:27.620> you<00:05:28.430> know<00:05:28.550> acid

when you see acid or form you know acid

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.020 
when you see acid or form you know acid
always<00:05:29.810> means<00:05:30.080> two<00:05:30.410> carbons<00:05:30.920> okay<00:05:31.520> and<00:05:31.760> look

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
always means two carbons okay and look

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.390 
always means two carbons okay and look
one<00:05:32.390> two<00:05:32.420> carbons<00:05:33.020> perfectly<00:05:33.770> logical<00:05:34.960> now

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
one two carbons perfectly logical now

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.100 
one two carbons perfectly logical now
I'd<00:05:37.400> rather<00:05:37.700> talk<00:05:38.000> about<00:05:38.060> it<00:05:38.420> before<00:05:38.630> show<00:05:38.900> the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
I'd rather talk about it before show the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.700 
I'd rather talk about it before show the
next<00:05:39.380> part<00:05:39.650> but<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:41.330> reduction<00:05:41.900> reactions<00:05:42.470> in

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
next part but the reduction reactions in

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.830 
next part but the reduction reactions in
alcoholic<00:05:43.250> fermentation<00:05:43.400> is<00:05:44.180> very<00:05:44.510> similar

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
alcoholic fermentation is very similar

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.720 
alcoholic fermentation is very similar
to<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.140> reduction<00:05:45.500> of<00:05:45.830> pyruvate<00:05:46.460> to<00:05:46.640> lactate

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
to the reduction of pyruvate to lactate

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.480 
to the reduction of pyruvate to lactate
in<00:05:47.360> the<00:05:48.080> sense<00:05:48.320> that<00:05:48.410> it<00:05:48.680> provides<00:05:49.070> for

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
in the sense that it provides for

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.670 
in the sense that it provides for
recycling<00:05:50.090> of<00:05:50.180> NAD+<00:05:50.690> so<00:05:50.990> look<00:05:51.200> here's<00:05:51.590> another

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
recycling of NAD+ so look here's another

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.130 
recycling of NAD+ so look here's another
reaction<00:05:52.280> that<00:05:53.000> is<00:05:53.150> providing<00:05:53.660> for<00:05:53.900> the

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
reaction that is providing for the

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.090 
reaction that is providing for the
recycling<00:05:54.770> of<00:05:54.860> NAD+<00:05:55.430> okay<00:05:56.890> again<00:05:57.890> we<00:05:58.070> need

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
recycling of NAD+ okay again we need

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.880 
recycling of NAD+ okay again we need
that<00:05:58.580> we<00:05:58.910> need<00:05:59.240> NAD+<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.200> continue<00:06:00.740> going

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
that we need NAD+ to continue going

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.550 
that we need NAD+ to continue going
through<00:06:01.520> further<00:06:01.970> fermentation<00:06:02.960> reactions

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560
