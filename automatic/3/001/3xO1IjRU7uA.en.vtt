00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
but there are many other ways that we

but there are many other ways that we
can<00:01:03.390> use<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.809> today<00:01:04.559> we've<00:01:04.830> got<00:01:04.979> Windows<00:01:05.549> 8

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
can use this today we've got Windows 8

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.380 
can use this today we've got Windows 8
that<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:07.049> touch<00:01:07.890> enabled<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:09.030> almost

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
that is very touch enabled it's almost

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.050 
that is very touch enabled it's almost
awkward<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:10.170> use<00:01:10.350> without<00:01:10.619> touch<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.729> can

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
awkward to use without touch this can

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.230 
awkward to use without touch this can
add<00:01:12.270> touch<00:01:12.659> capabilities<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.890> any<00:01:14.070> system<00:01:14.430> so

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
add touch capabilities to any system so

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.359 
add touch capabilities to any system so

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.090 
much like you would use a mouse kind of
about<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.780> level<00:01:46.170> theorists<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:46.979> be

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
about that level theorists can be

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.350 
about that level theorists can be
probably<00:01:47.340> ergonomically<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.000> much<00:01:48.180> better

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
probably ergonomically a much better

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.330 
probably ergonomically a much better
solution<00:01:48.630> there's<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.619> few<00:01:49.799> other<00:01:49.950> things<00:01:50.189> that

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
solution there's a few other things that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.999 
solution there's a few other things that
we<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.950> we

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
we can do with it and that is that we

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.460 
we can do with it and that is that we
can<00:01:53.040> use<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> digitizer<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.930> has<00:01:55.079> true

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
can use it as a digitizer so it has true

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.800 
can use it as a digitizer so it has true
pen<00:01:55.710> support<00:01:56.189> plus<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> digitizer<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:57.659> I'm

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
pen support plus a digitizer so if I'm

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.020 
pen support plus a digitizer so if I'm
working<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.380> Photoshop<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:59.399> graphics<00:01:59.909> or

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
working in Photoshop with graphics or

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.520 
working in Photoshop with graphics or
something<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.899> need<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.259> trace

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
something like that I need to trace

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.429 
something like that I need to trace
around<00:02:01.710> an<00:02:02.009> object<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.119> much<00:02:03.630> more

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
around an object this is much more

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.499 
around an object this is much more
natural<00:02:05.070> much<00:02:05.310> easier<00:02:05.880> than<00:02:06.060> using<00:02:06.299> a

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
natural much easier than using a

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.270 
natural much easier than using a
traditional<00:02:06.689> digitizer<00:02:07.439> pad<00:02:07.770> with<00:02:08.250> a

be tracing an object here while you're

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.790 
be tracing an object here while you're

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.350 
around the object around which I'm

soon yes and feel how light it is I

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.700 
soon yes and feel how light it is I
always<00:03:07.450> expect<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.840> be<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.110> lot<00:03:08.320> heavier<00:03:08.500> than

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
always expect to be a lot heavier than

always expect to be a lot heavier than
that<00:03:08.770> right<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:09.490> it's<00:03:09.640> two<00:03:09.760> pounds<00:03:10.000> feels

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
that right so it's two pounds feels

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.930 
that right so it's two pounds feels
great<00:03:10.660> has<00:03:10.930> soft<00:03:11.410> touch<00:03:11.710> paint<00:03:12.010> on<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:12.370> feels

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
great from a weight and a tactile point

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.520 
great from a weight and a tactile point
of<00:03:15.520> view<00:03:15.670> also<00:03:16.390> looks<00:03:16.630> great<00:03:16.810> but<00:03:17.050> also<00:03:17.200> feels

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
of view also looks great but also feels

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.440 
of view also looks great but also feels
very<00:03:17.709> very<00:03:17.830> solid<00:03:18.190> coming<00:03:18.820> out<00:03:18.940> in<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.090> second

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
very very solid coming out in the second

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.090 
very very solid coming out in the second
quarter<00:03:19.690> all<00:03:20.080> right<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.440> sounds<00:03:20.590> really
