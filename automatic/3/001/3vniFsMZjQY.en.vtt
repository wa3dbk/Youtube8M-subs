right<00:06:13.729> for<00:06:14.270> that<00:06:14.419> dance<00:06:14.690> I<00:06:15.110> think<00:06:15.500> he<00:06:15.590> was

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
right for that dance I think he was

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.880 
right for that dance I think he was
rushing<00:06:16.250> to<00:06:16.280> I<00:06:16.760> mean<00:06:17.450> his<00:06:17.720> timing<00:06:18.289> was<00:06:18.320> off<00:06:18.620> in

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
rushing to I mean his timing was off in

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.090 
rushing to I mean his timing was off in
a<00:06:18.950> few<00:06:18.979> spots<00:06:19.280> like<00:06:20.030> he<00:06:20.180> was<00:06:20.300> technically<00:06:20.780> good

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
a few spots like he was technically good

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.010 
a few spots like he was technically good
yeah<00:06:22.100> but<00:06:22.460> the<00:06:22.580> mood<00:06:22.789> of<00:06:23.000> the<00:06:23.060> dance<00:06:23.390> did<00:06:23.870> not

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
yeah but the mood of the dance did not

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.840 
yeah but the mood of the dance did not
feel<00:06:24.320> like<00:06:24.470> a<00:06:24.500> jive<00:06:24.800> and<00:06:25.100> don't<00:06:25.490> say<00:06:25.640> it<00:06:25.760> was
