this drill is going to be in three

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.100 
this drill is going to be in three
different<00:01:35.009> sections<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.119> first<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.840> drop

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
different sections the first is the drop

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.069 
different sections the first is the drop
step<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.159> accelerate<00:01:38.700> backwards<00:01:39.540> we've

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
step as you accelerate backwards we've

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.870 
step as you accelerate backwards we've
got<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> be<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> good<00:01:40.799> position<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.340> turn<00:01:41.670> our

with<00:02:00.540> proper<00:02:00.960> form<00:02:01.200> by<00:02:02.009> moving<00:02:02.369> laterally<00:02:02.790> we

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
with proper form by moving laterally we

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.370 
with proper form by moving laterally we
can<00:02:03.299> work<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.659> our<00:02:03.689> lateral<00:02:04.140> quickness

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
can work on our lateral quickness

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.950 
can work on our lateral quickness
developing<00:02:05.189> our<00:02:05.310> hips<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.299> also<00:02:06.540> work

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
developing our hips but we can also work

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.050 
developing our hips but we can also work

is<00:02:12.680> gonna<00:02:13.040> be<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> slides<00:02:13.849> through<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.450> lines

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
is gonna be the slides through the lines

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.619 
is gonna be the slides through the lines
of<00:02:15.080> combs<00:02:15.580> be<00:02:16.580> sure<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.090> keep<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.390> great
