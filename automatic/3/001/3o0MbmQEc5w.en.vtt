00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
seem perfect but anyway I'm going to do

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.960 
seem perfect but anyway I'm going to do
that<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:05.920> then<00:04:06.040> I'll<00:04:06.160> check<00:04:06.489> back<00:04:06.730> and

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
that and then I'll check back and

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.009 
that and then I'll check back and
actually<00:04:09.970> I'm<00:04:10.300> going<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.510> probably<00:04:10.720> make<00:04:10.989> a

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
actually I'm going to probably make a

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.630 
actually I'm going to probably make a
video<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:11.830> you'll<00:04:12.160> see<00:04:12.310> that<00:04:12.430> here<00:04:12.610> a

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
video of that so you'll see that here a

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.110 
video of that so you'll see that here a
