00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.250
 and this 100 meter freestyle course 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.490
 also with Daniela Schreiber who is now in 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.679
 this finale in asten today the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.750
 absolute top favorite has become and 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.309
 if I look at their best then 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.900
 We have little doubt that you 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.460
 that will also manage frank embacher 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.689
 her trainer from the sv hall at the saale 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.980
 spectator 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.119
 We hope that in the next year 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.219
 will be different again 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.940
 and then they come for 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.620
 this final over 100 meters freestyle 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.329
 have qualified by one 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.030
 young swimmer in the front 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.030
 Magdeburg this is Julia Tielmann

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.210

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.040

 annika brÃ¼nn from sv bietigheim last 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.920
 year here she was fourth only before 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.900
 the short track has been successful 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.090
 Paula Schmiedel from Essen Kurzbahn 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.340
 European champion with the 4 x 50 m 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.750
 laystaffel that was it then probably 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.660
 daniela writer 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.360
 your biggest success 2011 the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.830
 World Cup third with the 4 x 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.840
 100 meter freestyle season 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.520
 the school has done it now 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 they pack that again in finland 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.820
 a train remains free there britta 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.300
 steffen would have done then we do 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.460
 just continue 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.860
 6 this is alexandra world of the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.869
 stadtwerke munich multitasking 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.330
 woman of this championship you already the 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.680
 Most competitions for you too are 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.740
 a side track here 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.350
 bright scholtyssek from tsv hohenbrunn with 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.350
 15 years the youngest here in the finale 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.979
 a ground near they realize it is 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.810
 quite something going on, that's where ten 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.620
 swimmers in the water as well as in the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.600
 already introduced last year 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.350
 also with kerstin long of the sg 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.550
 dortmund and at the top then comes the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.460
 ninth track that's a bit 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.900
 confusing here it starts with 0 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.220
 At the top ends with nine below 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.220
 Franziska Jansen 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.909
 our yellow train daniela schreiber 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.180
 a ground about it I must go now 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.180
 Nothing 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.160
 Britta Steffen also seems to like this 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.630
 championships right blow ins 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.800
 to be water 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.720
 the weak performance of this morning 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.490
 is explained now and if I have the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.650
 Executions by Bundestrainer Henning 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.630
 lambertz just followed correctly 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.390
 followed by a wild one 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.670
 card give for the wm in barcelona end 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.420
 july provided that they until then 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.300
 completely recovered is so first volumes 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.239
 clear thing 26 23 seconds the 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.860
 transit time for daniela schreiber im 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.420
 Last year, she is only from 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.160
 britta steffen was defeated at the 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.200
 past german championships 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.840
 This morning she was faster too 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.910
 faster than steffen and this looks 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.500
 after a very undisputed race 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.069
 From now on we look at the time 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.880
 she has to fulfill and that is 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.739
 54.86 seconds 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.739
 if she grabs the ticket she has 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.650
 for barcelona and there she is 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.440
 half a second faster German 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.299
 master and qualifier for the 100th 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.250
 meter freestyle track in barcelona 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:39.819
 daniela schreiber from hall on place 2 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.310
 alexandra wenk of stadtwerke with 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.470
 55 51 seconds are then already seven 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.959
 tenth in between so Christian that 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.790
 is exactly the final as well as what us 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.700
 expected after the cancellation of 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.630
 britta yes she is her favorite role 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.590
 actually lived up to it 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.120
 daniela schreiber the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.290
 trainings colleagues also from britta 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.269
 steffen you can see the underwater 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.400
 as she was very powerful at 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.470
 the arms then swim through their arms 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.459
 water lashes and it is with her 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.799
 really making her a nice one 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.970
 aesthetics is here on the last 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.380
 In the middle you can see the meters 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.329
 daniela also now in this red 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.100
 no more air brought the area witnesses 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.600
 Of course, also from a very very good 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.940
 conditions of a very very good 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.130
 perseverance and what you are saying 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.870
 thomas is where time just pleased 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.100
 of course about her title but the 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.720
 second place does not have the norm 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.280
 fulfilled and if I hold third asbestos 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.590
 very much the three seconds faster than 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.789
 just the two-place alexandra wenk 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.500
 then I think of step by step 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.610
 direction stagger that up here 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.849
 britta steffen in no way 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.039
 can do without 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.110
 I can imagine that yourself 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.879
 dorothea may now fire up 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.899
 a little annoying because that is today 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.339
 built second tomorrow 

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:43.770
 It was in a very good time 

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:45.110
 on the way here would be the ticket 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.580
 can easily manage 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.289
 she would not have to be the best then 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.169
 the second place would be over 100 meters 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.860
 Freistil forgiven and that would be 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.839
 then also for britta steffen 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.279
 may become a problem though 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:57.330
 she has renounced because she wants to 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.129
 right on the sprint tracks 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.939
 concentrate frank embacher looks 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.009
 of course now to the 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.689
 display board can be satisfied with daniela 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.209
 but now the building is not there 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:07.919
 his athlete britta will hopefully be her 

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:08.759
 he can be there and daniela very much 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.429
 be satisfied 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.569
 but again on dorothea he fires 

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:14.039
 already with the swimming anyway 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.659
 World Cup is there because yes 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.539
 yesterday qualified over the 50 meters 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:20.039
 chest and henning lambertz is doing very well 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.110
 check it next to daniela 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.939
 Schreiber here again at the stop 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.860
 that they actually dorothea 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.899
 fires over the 100 meter freestyle 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.219
 place nominated for the season he 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:30.990
 swum faster than one second 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.360
 is considered the second-placed in addition 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.330
 then you have three months again 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.069
 check the optimal situation and then 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.069
 just take doro brand into account 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.860
 Dorothea it has meanwhile arrived 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.780
 had to get away pretty much now 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.690
 it is at alexander Antoniadis is 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.240
 be able to explain to us how that is and we 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.259
 congratulations to the wm title was like that 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.259
 easy as it looked 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.550
 the time 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.130
 54 if you have stayed over debris and 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.570
 in Berlin 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.310
 Of course, now we have one over 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.900
 Do not talk while racing 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.150
 how much did she miss the start of 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.320
 Britta Steffen was surprised when it was already 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.900
 I am very surprised that I have a training 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.270
 seen how strong chile is assistant 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.550
 very well in shape 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.750
 escada is visa why I lied 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.110
 I hope it will be back soon 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.800
 going 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.800
 Thank you very much
