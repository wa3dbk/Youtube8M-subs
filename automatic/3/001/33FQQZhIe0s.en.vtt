00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.530 
research online
you<00:02:11.530> could<00:02:11.650> look<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:11.920> up<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.310> find<00:02:12.550> out<00:02:12.820> what

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
you could look it up and find out what

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.930 
you could look it up and find out what
kind<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.840> information<00:02:14.250> you're<00:02:15.250> looking<00:02:15.280> for

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
kind of information you're looking for

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.150 
kind of information you're looking for
but<00:02:16.390> through<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> research<00:02:17.230> I've<00:02:17.500> done<00:02:17.560> as

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
but through the research I've done as

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.920 
but through the research I've done as
well<00:02:18.340> as<00:02:18.520> talking<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:19.090> lot<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.540> other<00:02:19.690> people

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
well as talking a lot of other people

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.250 
well as talking a lot of other people
about<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.620> um<00:02:21.490> it's<00:02:21.940> just<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.480> really<00:02:23.020> really

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
about it um it's just a really really

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.610 
about it um it's just a really really
good<00:02:23.730> way<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.790> stay<00:02:25.270> healthy<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:26.020> keep

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
good way to stay healthy and keep

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.530 
good way to stay healthy and keep
burning<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.670> ketones<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:30.390> that's<00:02:31.390> pretty

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
burning the ketones and that's pretty

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.270 
burning the ketones and that's pretty
much<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.810> I'm<00:02:32.500> not<00:02:32.650> going<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.860> get<00:02:33.010> into<00:02:33.130> the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
much it I'm not going to get into the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.130 
much it I'm not going to get into the
whole<00:02:33.400> physiology<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.870> wanted

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
whole physiology of it but I just wanted

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.360 
whole physiology of it but I just wanted
to<00:02:35.200> show<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.710> don't<00:02:35.830> show<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.310> you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
to show it to I don't show it to you

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.680 
ice cold glass of water 30 minutes upon
waking<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.489> helps<00:03:25.180> boost<00:03:25.480> your

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
waking and that helps boost your

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.540 
waking and that helps boost your
metabolism<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:26.530> little<00:03:26.769> bit<00:03:26.920> because<00:03:27.160> your

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
metabolism a little bit because your

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.000 
metabolism a little bit because your
body<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:27.880> warm<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.660> now<00:03:28.959> you're<00:03:29.200> adding<00:03:29.440> in<00:03:29.769> a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
body is warm and now you're adding in a

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.090 
body is warm and now you're adding in a
giant<00:03:30.400> bit<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.940> cold<00:03:31.300> water<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.050> your<00:03:32.769> body

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
giant bit of cold water and your body

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.840 
giant bit of cold water and your body
needs<00:03:33.550> to<00:03:34.350> process<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.739> cold<00:03:36.010> in<00:03:36.370> conjunction

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
needs to process the cold in conjunction

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.370 
needs to process the cold in conjunction
with<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.180> heat<00:03:37.330> of<00:03:37.420> your<00:03:37.450> body<00:03:37.570> anyway<00:03:38.200> it

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
with the heat of your body anyway it

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.610 
with the heat of your body anyway it
raises<00:03:38.739> your<00:03:38.769> metabolism<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:40.170> I'm<00:03:41.170> all<00:03:41.410> for<00:03:41.560> a
