just say maybe tomorrow maybe tomorrow

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.280 
just say maybe tomorrow maybe tomorrow
now<00:01:32.850> she<00:01:32.910> did<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> hard<00:01:33.720> life<00:01:33.899> growing<00:01:34.170> up

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
now she did have a hard life growing up

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.680 
now she did have a hard life growing up
her<00:01:34.470> mom<00:01:34.740> did<00:01:35.100> die<00:01:35.340> when<00:01:35.580> she<00:01:35.610> was<00:01:35.880> younger<00:01:36.180> so

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
her mom did die when she was younger so

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.440 
her mom did die when she was younger so
I'm<00:01:36.930> assuming<00:01:37.410> that<00:01:37.649> it<00:01:38.039> sent<00:01:38.460> her<00:01:38.640> into<00:01:39.119> some

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
I'm assuming that it sent her into some

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
I'm assuming that it sent her into some
form<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.990> depressive<00:01:40.740> mindset<00:01:41.430> where<00:01:41.700> she

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
form of depressive mindset where she

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
form of depressive mindset where she
just<00:01:42.060> didn't<00:01:42.270> know<00:01:42.390> how<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.660> respond<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.440> then

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
just didn't know how to respond and then

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.290 
just didn't know how to respond and then
eventually<00:01:43.800> her<00:01:44.070> mind<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.460> began<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.060> shut

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
eventually her mind just began to shut

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.510 
eventually her mind just began to shut
