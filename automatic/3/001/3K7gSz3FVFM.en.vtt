00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 the importance of the micro nutrients 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.950
 solo the accompaniment of a professional 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.510
 not to err at the time of correction are 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.620
 the main guidelines that you 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.269
 follow now 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.610
 we usually have a connotation 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.410
 nutrient chemistry by being required in 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.570
 small quantities are not important 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.320
 such as macronutrients in large 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.570
 amount 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.670
 wanted to show to show that today we 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.250
 micronutrients are solid quoted in the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.869
 micro-nutrient in the time of 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.670
 utility has no quality then 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.520
 importance of micronutrients and 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.160
 both macronutrients and then 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.380
 People can not show here the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.170
 reasons that lead to disability as a 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.670
 of micronutrients the consequences that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.399
 this chaos in productivity and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.710
 mainly on the quality of products 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.230
 and also the resistance they give to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.840
 certain pests and diseases as well as the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.850
 appropriate management of them used in 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.160
 appropriate doses taking into account that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.590
 our insurance mainly analysis 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.510
 foliar and soil analysis so that the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.090
 viewer since we have a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.760
 great honor we are in a region 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.250
 producer so that he has a little 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.700
 more knowledge and understanding than 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.090
 what actions he or she should take to 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.040
 that it is not occurring in rice 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.690
 very good, only question first thing is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.700
 diagnosis begins 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.110
 in the management of an agriculture 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.030
 sustainable 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.910
 the correct sampling flat soles analysis 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.580
 of a reliable laboratory soil 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.470
 after obtaining these results from the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.380
 soil analysis you will look for a 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.630
 and interpret these 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.550
 results if they are adequate in 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.680
 micronutrients are low are 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.860
 excessive and will make the 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.350
 correct according to the type of soil and 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.300
 type of culture and today it has been 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.070
 that the main micronutrients 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.700
 Productivity is limited to those already 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:05.110
 specifically are zinc 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:08.450
 boron manganese covers and is so 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.640
 elementary what additional contest 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.920
 minimum connect you can get around 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.590
 problems through knowledge of the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.170
 be via the seed in some of them 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.030
 either via leaf and through soil then 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.060
 available technician we have for this 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.860
 mainly by jataÃ­, lower rate of 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.650
 which is a very short and very 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.570
 needs and can be a good deal 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.750
 as well as in medicine to self medication 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.700
 does not work in agronomy you need 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.280
 have trained professionals and 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.620
 specialized for each area to 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.400
 that makes the diagnosis and also orient 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.910
 this producer 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.709
 remember that planted served like us 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.239
 the difference between us is the plant 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.820
 basically three 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.610
 plant as a head to plant 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.500
 no soul for the moment you have 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.950
 good and bad on the ground and plant does not speak 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.810
 So it's a lot more so we'll say like this is 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.910
 difficult to work with a campus that 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.989
 work with humans though 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.150
 a lot of people much much bigger 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.060
 value logically but the plant serves 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.260
 like us and the plant is so important that 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.290
 We are here talking now 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.900
 Because everything comes from the plant. 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.730
 plant the food come from the plant clothes 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.810
 cotton to fiber comes from the plant 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.010
 energy that is the plant life car 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.890
 evident that the plant has treated 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.100
 affection with the exact 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.100
 Bro
