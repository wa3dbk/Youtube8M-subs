a<00:00:00.359> lot<00:00:01.020> of<00:00:01.140> glue<00:00:01.290> that<00:00:01.500> takes<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:02.000> trigger

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
a lot of glue that takes a trigger

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.120 
a lot of glue that takes a trigger
assembly<00:00:03.210> apart<00:00:03.870> as<00:00:04.049> we<00:00:04.170> record<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.799> delays

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:24.279 

all<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.280> comes<00:00:14.490> up<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:14.910> let<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.179> dry<00:00:15.420> anyway

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.450 

you<00:00:25.289> guys<00:00:25.410> should<00:00:25.470> try<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.800> again<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.430> can

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
you guys should try it again so I can

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.099 
you guys should try it again so I can
get<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.820> video<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> little<00:00:28.769> video<00:00:29.039> policy

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
get it on video so a little video policy

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:55.010 
get it on video so a little video policy
if<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.410> do<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:53.270> it's<00:00:54.270> tricky<00:00:54.510> remembering

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
if I can do this it's tricky remembering

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:53.290 
if I can do this it's tricky remembering
which<00:00:55.199> way

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.940 

seems<00:01:54.300> like<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> tips<00:01:54.870> of<00:01:55.110> those<00:01:55.230> exactly

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
seems like the tips of those exactly

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:15.949 
seems like the tips of those exactly
hold<00:01:56.160> it<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.460> there<00:01:56.640> too<00:02:14.750> all<00:02:15.750> right

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
hold it in there too all right

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.459 
hold it in there too all right
yep<00:02:16.590> squeeze<00:02:17.280> them
