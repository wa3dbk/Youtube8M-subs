00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.940 

and<00:00:01.030> here<00:00:02.030> we<00:00:02.179> have<00:00:02.420> a<00:00:02.450> video<00:00:02.930> on<00:00:03.230> shifting

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:03.950 
and here we have a video on shifting

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.450 
and here we have a video on shifting
gears<00:00:04.360> not<00:00:05.360> how-to<00:00:05.660> but<00:00:06.259> just<00:00:06.560> shifting<00:00:07.190> gears

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
gears not how-to but just shifting gears

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.859 
gears not how-to but just shifting gears
so<00:00:07.609> you<00:00:07.700> can<00:00:07.819> see<00:00:08.059> what<00:00:08.210> it<00:00:08.299> looks<00:00:08.480> like<00:00:08.539> if<00:00:08.839> you

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:08.869 
so you can see what it looks like if you

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:12.789 
so you can see what it looks like if you
were<00:00:09.079> trying<00:00:09.349> to<00:00:09.379> figure<00:00:09.650> that<00:00:09.799> out<00:00:11.650> right<00:00:12.650> now

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
were trying to figure that out right now

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.060 
were trying to figure that out right now
I<00:00:12.860> am<00:00:13.219> in<00:00:13.249> first<00:00:14.089> gear<00:00:14.589> I'm<00:00:15.589> sitting<00:00:15.949> on<00:00:16.010> a

to be allowed to stop and go I'm gonna

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.990 
to be allowed to stop and go I'm gonna
go<00:01:46.140> ready<00:01:46.460> because<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.610> don't<00:01:47.790> feel<00:01:47.940> like

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
go ready because I don't feel like

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.600

now we accelerate noting the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.190 
now we accelerate noting the
air-conditioning<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.180> on<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.630> have<00:02:13.840> less

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
air-conditioning is on so I have less

accelerate a little too quickly than it
well<00:03:22.190> fashioned<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.610> wanted<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:23.180> much<00:03:23.240> put

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
well fashioned I wanted to so much put

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.190 
well fashioned I wanted to so much put
it<00:03:23.600> right<00:03:23.810> up<00:03:24.050> there<00:03:25.810> we<00:03:26.810> are

how the clutch works but just what it
looks<00:05:00.080> like<00:05:00.439> to<00:05:01.009> shift<00:05:01.219> gears<00:05:01.309> while<00:05:01.729> driving

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:01.969 
looks like to shift gears while driving
