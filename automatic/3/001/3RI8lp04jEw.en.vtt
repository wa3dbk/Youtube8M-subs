for<00:04:33.310> some<00:04:33.820> time<00:04:34.060> now<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:34.840> felt<00:04:35.259> like<00:04:35.350> that

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
for some time now and I felt like that

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.189 
for some time now and I felt like that
was<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.680> game<00:04:35.970> we<00:04:36.970> really<00:04:37.270> really<00:04:37.870> coulda<00:04:38.020> came

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
was a game we really really coulda came

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.749 
was a game we really really coulda came
out<00:04:38.410> established<00:04:38.889> ourselves<00:04:39.009> made<00:04:39.550> some

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
out established ourselves made some

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.240 
out established ourselves made some
noise<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.449> you<00:04:41.410> know<00:04:41.530> got<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.710> city<00:04:42.070> behind

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
noise and you know got the city behind

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.129 
noise and you know got the city behind
the<00:04:42.550> team<00:04:42.789> so<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.090> think<00:04:43.210> that's<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.930> real

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
the team so I think that's the real

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.680 
the team so I think that's the real
reason<00:04:44.169> I<00:04:44.500> was<00:04:44.620> at<00:04:44.770> more<00:04:44.979> or<00:04:45.910> less<00:04:46.479> the

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
reason I was at more or less the

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.920 
reason I was at more or less the

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
Harrison wow that was a terrible guess

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.170

so<00:06:11.500> these<00:06:11.650> flashback<00:06:12.310> and<00:06:12.430> throwback<00:06:12.699> players

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
so these flashback and throwback players

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.850 
so these flashback and throwback players
match<00:06:13.419> see<00:06:13.630> why<00:06:13.750> there's<00:06:13.960> so<00:06:14.169> few<00:06:14.199> up<00:06:14.560> on<00:06:14.710> the

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
match see why there's so few up on the

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.460 
match see why there's so few up on the
block<00:06:15.070> there's<00:06:15.580> not<00:06:15.759> really<00:06:16.380> incentive<00:06:17.380> the

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
block there's not really incentive the

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.950 
block there's not really incentive the
full<00:06:17.710> form<00:06:18.099> right<00:06:18.310> now

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
full form right now

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.559 
full form right now
and<00:06:19.259> I<00:06:20.069> guess<00:06:20.400> because<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:20.940> elite<00:06:21.120> badges<00:06:21.449> are

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
and I guess because the elite badges are

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:23.570 
and I guess because the elite badges are
also<00:06:21.750> so<00:06:22.259> cheap<00:06:22.620> but<00:06:23.130> I<00:06:23.190> hope<00:06:23.310> you<00:06:23.430> guys
