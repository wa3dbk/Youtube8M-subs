00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.560
 but that is already stored on our background 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.230
 but here is also the music from Grüttner one buys with four except

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.550
 and there a title 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.550
 this opens immediately 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.270
 Christine Clauß now has four left-handers 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 his 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.580
 the music of Kirstin loudspeaker 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.210

 in the list view 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.400
 we can now start a reliable gift here and we 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.670
 can set a repeat play here 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.570
 Besides, here we have our plans home button 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.740
 we can jump back and forth between the winners 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.329

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.050
 as forward and rewind 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.790
 if I pressed the button in the middle then I have to continue here 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.590
 Option I have the entire library here once 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.530
 I've got a few here for sure I can feel the song to a certain extent 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.200
 it's too much 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.350
 besides, not every song can call that and associations 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.350
 or delete

 Parkour 5-millimeter jack connection 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.359
 Unfortunately, the quality with this head is very very bad 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:30.359
 So I would recommend that you prefer your own headphones 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.539
 use 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:36.249
