the Romanian Nike shoes this actually
slope<00:01:32.610> solar<00:01:33.000> rim<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.659> our<00:01:33.780> solar<00:01:34.079> air<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
slope solar rim so our solar air and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.560 
slope solar rim so our solar air and
being<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.920> actually<00:01:35.100> has<00:01:35.430> black<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.150> well<00:01:36.180> too
