design elements in the n97 only that

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.589 
design elements in the n97 only that
this<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.490> my<00:00:05.640> thing<00:00:06.410> ever<00:00:07.410> yeah<00:00:08.280> palestro<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
baddest girl so the keyboard it is now

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.419 
baddest girl so the keyboard it is now
larger<00:00:12.200> so<00:00:13.200> it's<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.620> big<00:00:13.769> team<00:00:13.950> comes<00:00:14.219> to

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
larger so it's a big team comes to

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.880 
larger so it's a big team comes to
usability<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.089> table<00:00:15.470> and<00:00:16.470> then<00:00:16.710> we

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
usability of the table and then we

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.800 
usability of the table and then we
change<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.220> be<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> design<00:00:17.789> sense<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.270> now<00:00:18.420> you

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
change to be the design sense so now you

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.300 
change to be the design sense so now you
know<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.109> have<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.439> back<00:00:19.619> cover<00:00:19.859> which<00:00:20.189> is

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
know we have the back cover which is

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.490 
know we have the back cover which is
metallic<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.970> which<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.869> matching<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.410> outer

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
metallic and which is matching the outer

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.599 
metallic and which is matching the outer
rim<00:00:23.420> and<00:00:24.560> generally<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.740> device<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.279> smaller

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
rim and generally the device it smaller

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.550 
rim and generally the device it smaller
and<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:28.519> the<00:00:29.519> way<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.390> less<00:00:30.720> than<00:00:31.050> 9<00:00:31.260> x-7

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
and it's the way it is less than 9 x-7

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:48.069 
and it's the way it is less than 9 x-7
can<00:00:31.949> feel<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.369> mean<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.180> feel<00:00:33.329> it
