00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.520
 good afternoon dear friends with you 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.040
 Laboratories he my name is Stanislav 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.990
 if you really want to have a tablet but 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.880
 sorry to spend a lot of money on it 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.480
 look at this acer device 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.520
 iconia b1 711 is exactly the case 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.560
 when the manufacturer compromised 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.110
 and tried to do as much as possible 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.210
 minimum functional device 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.550
 price 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.960
 something happened but no 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.570
 case is in my hands now 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.820
 really budget worthy 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.440
 a device that is designed to solve and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.730
 numerous tablet tasks and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.290
 please your owner 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.090
 tablet as you see it appeared 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.890
 plump enough plump 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.399
 weighty its size is 198 by 129 by 12 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.230
 millimeters and weighs 330 grams more 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.420
 part of the front panel takes you 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.190
 see a 7 inch screen though 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.770
 manufacturer left very large 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.200
 not at all functional fields apparently this 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.039
 need for ips matrix design with 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.600
 1024 by 600 pixels resolution 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:10.109
 16 to 9 aspect ratio 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.299
 in the corner of the screen is a camera peephole 0 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:15.119
 3 megapixels for video calls 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.609
 on the top you see a nest for 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.700
 headphone three and a half millimeter on 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:25.319
 back cover numerous logos 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.270
 speaker slot and the lid itself by 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.459
 Do you know the classics ? 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.490
 plastic as if slightly dull though with 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:35.700
 mind normal gloss it is white like mine 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.069
 in the hands well, it is black or dark blue 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.469
 all controls are gathered on 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.979
 right side of the device lives here and 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:47.099

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.749
 as well as the volume adjustment key way 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:50.969

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:52.469
 rocker and this is a special button with 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.109

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:58.409
