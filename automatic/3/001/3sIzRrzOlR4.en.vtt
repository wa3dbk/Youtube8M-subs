00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.940
 It is a problem of relatives 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:15.160
 The structure with the empty space is Eiger guardian Nes 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.270
 So that there is the city v 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.720
 Furthermore, in the part where the head is simultaneous 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.960
 Because sign language is an adjective and there is no Meiji era around 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:32.009
 This is working in the water of protection 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:37.760
 Please pay attention to the point where he makes two cheap regardless of the point this time 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:41.440
 Since the first of the President of each other works as he for the love of the subject 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:46.610
 Patron for the second of is not of simultaneous 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.810
 In other words, we can see that the relative pronouns of the nominatives enter the void 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.810
 The correct answer is the best 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:01.280
 When I actually substituting the seal 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:02.220
 The horizontal form for the sv to get in like this problem right after the pronoun relative pronoun 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.780
 Looks like 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.140
 The lens is a relative pronoun of this 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.960
 If you try to hide love, you are a shure 2 pro 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.350
 Person who always disputes 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.560
 Whenever I substitute for trying to fit there 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.159
 Affiliation Too that will dispute 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.060
 I will be the person I thought 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.070
 I can see the precedence like this 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:36.340
 I can see the relative pronouns of the subject 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:39.880
 After that I see the subject + verb again 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.810
 The form of the head of a predicate verb 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.110
 Since such laser relationship problems is quite difficult 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.290
 Please check the minute structure 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:57.710
 It is not the subject because the second Humer wood is accurate 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:02.140
 No. 3 and 4 are also previous values ​​+ related pronouns, so of course they can not be the subject 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.140
 Then let's reconfirm with another example 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:11.030
 He's the only person 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.480
 i think swing princess chan i say 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:20.840
 He can help you 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.440
 The antecedent is Rion Ri-soo So this Yori princess is subject to use because it becomes a subject naturally 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.410
 I am 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:35.370
 I need the person who i Sen侠 Fe bo because this has changed in the wind 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:37.500
 As with work, we can see the common of pronouns relative pronouns and then sv such as icing 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.810
 And then again 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.810
 We continued to scan help he 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.780
 This ice inc as a way of thinking 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:55.239
 The point is that the first wind against him over this sv 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.239
 It is about to become a can help 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:08.400
 The only person who can hide you and help you 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:11.170
 So I think that I can help you by adding the swing nuances 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.640
 Will be the only person 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:19.580
 This kind of problem seems to be a crimson tree and it seems that English is taking a moment 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.280
 Inadvertently even though the wind is also prone to the correct answer 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.790
 He is doing 5 consecutive 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.040
 Again, paint the can help have been connected twice 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.880
 Between the subject of the first one of the real joint magazine 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:40.300
 It is a guardian sum style of the unit loop of the second predicate verb 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.300
 Please try to make Akikita here in the continuation of this part 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:49.150
 It looks like the problem is that the tree child is taking a moment . 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:53.230
 Do you inadvertently tend to correct the No. 2 maple 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:58.420
 So Toro Words is a continuously he crab 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:02.810
 Please do firmly understood as say that this money-sized Chakukan 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:09.130
 Let's listen to the sound of the problem part last 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.130
