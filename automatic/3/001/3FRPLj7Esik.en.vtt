00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
even know really what it is maybe a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:58.440 
even know really what it is maybe a
scraper<00:00:44.899> have<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> knife

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:06.360 

petes<00:00:59.080> these<00:00:59.650> pieces

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.720 

this<00:01:06.970> would<00:01:07.180> have<00:01:07.270> been<00:01:07.360> pretty<00:01:07.600> cool<00:01:07.900> I<00:01:08.730> call

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
this would have been pretty cool I call

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.230 
this would have been pretty cool I call
that<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:09.940> stone<00:01:10.780> square<00:01:11.230> stemmed<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:13.030> pretty

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
that a stone square stemmed it's pretty

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.600 
that a stone square stemmed it's pretty
much<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.510> same<00:01:13.840> as<00:01:14.140> a<00:01:14.170> an<00:01:15.360> deadly<00:01:16.360> but<00:01:17.610> there's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
much the same as a an deadly but there's

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.650 
much the same as a an deadly but there's
a<00:01:18.700> slight<00:01:19.060> difference<00:01:19.090> I<00:01:19.660> think<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:20.170> it's<00:01:20.290> I

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
a slight difference I think and it's I

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.210 
a slight difference I think and it's I
don't<00:01:22.660> know<00:01:22.840> at<00:01:23.050> least<00:01:23.080> seen<00:01:23.440> bill<00:01:23.650> maybe<00:01:24.130> a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
don't know at least seen bill maybe a

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.810 
don't know at least seen bill maybe a
little<00:01:24.400> bit<00:01:24.610> more<00:01:25.140> refined<00:01:26.140> in<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:27.040> chipping

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.520 

that's<00:01:30.820> a<00:01:30.940> pretty<00:01:31.120> pretty<00:01:31.810> good-sized<00:01:32.170> point

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
that's a pretty pretty good-sized point

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.290 
that's a pretty pretty good-sized point
and<00:01:33.400> then<00:01:34.180> this<00:01:34.360> oh<00:01:35.100> no<00:01:36.100> I'm<00:01:36.850> kind<00:01:37.030> of<00:01:37.090> ball

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
and then this oh no I'm kind of ball

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.290
