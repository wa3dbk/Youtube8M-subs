you're trying to do is pass this and
this<00:01:22.740> bit<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.100> line<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.790> around<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.869> two

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
this bit of line here around the two

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
this bit of line here around the two
bits<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.500> line<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.310> obviously<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> shank<00:01:26.939> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
bits of line and obviously the shank of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.300 
bits of line and obviously the shank of
the<00:01:27.150> hook<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.689> okay<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.590> gripping<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.159> there

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the hook and okay so gripping it there

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.270 
the hook and okay so gripping it there
we<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.670> around<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.159> then

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
we go around and then we go up and then

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
we go around and then we go up and then
you've<00:01:32.400> got<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> turn<00:01:32.759> your<00:01:32.909> fingers<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.229> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you've got to turn your fingers so it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
you've got to turn your fingers so it
can<00:01:34.500> go<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.829> again<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.490> need<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:35.939> up

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
can go up again and we need to go up

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.789 
can go up again and we need to go up
seven<00:01:36.900> times<00:01:38.000> whipping<00:01:39.000> around<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.960> spinning

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
seven times whipping around and spinning

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.730 
seven times whipping around and spinning
it<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.299> around

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.800 

so<00:01:46.670> okay<00:01:47.649> then<00:01:49.240> moistening<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.420> night<00:01:50.600> light

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
so okay then moistening the night light

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.609 
so okay then moistening the night light
should<00:01:50.990> do<00:01:51.140> all<00:01:51.320> knots<00:01:52.030> grip<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.180> there<00:01:53.619> and

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
should do all knots grip it there and

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.039 
should do all knots grip it there and
then<00:01:56.049> pull<00:01:57.049> in<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:58.030> exit<00:01:59.030> Loveline<00:01:59.750> there

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
then pull in the exit Loveline there

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.310 
then pull in the exit Loveline there
through<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.380> eye<00:02:01.720> cheese<00:02:02.720> or<00:02:02.960> up<00:02:05.200> don't<00:02:06.200> put

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
through the eye cheese or up don't put

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.920 
through the eye cheese or up don't put
it<00:02:06.439> too<00:02:06.590> tight<00:02:06.860> at<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.070> point<00:02:10.840> tension<00:02:11.840> the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
it too tight at this point tension the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.870 
it too tight at this point tension the
other<00:02:12.050> end<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:13.010> then<00:02:13.130> you've<00:02:13.250> got<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.489> barrel

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
other end and then you've got the barrel

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.449 
other end and then you've got the barrel
on<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.569> shank<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.050> hook<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:16.010> tease<00:02:16.220> this

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
on the shank of the hook you tease this
