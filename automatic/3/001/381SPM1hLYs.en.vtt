agree Canyon have put an awful lot of
effort<00:00:20.580> into<00:00:20.970> their<00:00:21.090> aerodynamics<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.840> the

there integrate brakes front and back

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.970 
there integrate brakes front and back
but<00:00:27.180> there's<00:00:27.630> some<00:00:27.810> really<00:00:28.289> really<00:00:28.769> special

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
but there's some really really special

mechanical doesn't get it's a massive
massive<00:00:41.550> advantage<00:00:42.180> now<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> gearing<00:00:43.050> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
massive advantage now the gearing is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.420 
massive advantage now the gearing is
particularly<00:00:43.559> interesting<00:00:43.950> he's<00:00:44.100> running<00:00:44.370> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
particularly interesting he's running a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.520 
particularly interesting he's running a
55<00:00:45.090> tooth<00:00:45.420> pain<00:00:45.719> anon<00:00:45.960> there<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.260> doesn't

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
55 tooth pain anon there that doesn't

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.490 
55 tooth pain anon there that doesn't
mean<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.950> he's<00:00:47.160> being<00:00:47.399> able<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.820> spin<00:00:48.210> out

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
mean that he's being able to spin out

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.840 
mean that he's being able to spin out
5511<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.010> means<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.370> he's<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
5511 what it means is that he's going to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.209 
5511 what it means is that he's going to
spend<00:00:51.030> more<00:00:51.210> time<00:00:51.270> using<00:00:52.199> slightly<00:00:52.680> larger

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
spend more time using slightly larger

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.040 
spend more time using slightly larger
sprocket<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> cassette<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> better

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
sprocket on the cassette to get a better

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.130 
sprocket on the cassette to get a better
chain<00:00:55.410> line<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.910> also<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.390> been<00:00:57.570> proven<00:00:57.960> now

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
chain line and also it's been proven now

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.470 
chain line and also it's been proven now
to<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.379> more<00:00:58.649> efficient<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.219> use<00:00:59.550> bigger<00:01:00.149> chain

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
to be more efficient to use bigger chain

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.760 
to be more efficient to use bigger chain
rings<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.840> bigger<00:01:01.109> sprocket

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
rings and bigger sprocket

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.130 
rings and bigger sprocket
so<00:01:02.010> he's<00:01:02.399> saving<00:01:02.879> probably<00:01:03.359> 2<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.690> 3<00:01:03.899> watts

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
so he's saving probably 2 or 3 watts

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.730 
so he's saving probably 2 or 3 watts
over<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.060> 5311<00:01:06.060> which<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.299> kind<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> interesting

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
over a 5311 which is kind of interesting

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.469 
over a 5311 which is kind of interesting
as<00:01:07.740> wheels<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.430> tires<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:09.000> particularly

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
as wheels and tires are particularly

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.580 
as wheels and tires are particularly
interesting<00:01:09.810> some<00:01:10.020> team<00:01:10.229> sponsored<00:01:10.560> by

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
interesting some team sponsored by

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.380 
interesting some team sponsored by
maverick<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.130> they've<00:01:11.250> got<00:01:11.400> mammoth<00:01:12.180> wheels

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
maverick so they've got mammoth wheels

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.380 
maverick so they've got mammoth wheels
and<00:01:12.659> Mavic<00:01:13.409> tubular<00:01:13.830> tyres<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.850> he's<00:01:15.210> running

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and Mavic tubular tyres but he's running

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.899 
and Mavic tubular tyres but he's running
a<00:01:15.509> 23<00:01:16.140> mil<00:01:16.350> at<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> back<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.040> 25<00:01:17.610> at<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
a 23 mil at the back and a 25 at the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.330 
a 23 mil at the back and a 25 at the
front<00:01:18.180> now<00:01:18.360> Zachary<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.200> pretty<00:01:19.619> tall<00:01:19.950> guy

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
front now Zachary is a pretty tall guy

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.859 
front now Zachary is a pretty tall guy
so<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:20.970> interesting<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.750> he's

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
so it's interesting to see that he's

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.630 
so it's interesting to see that he's
actually<00:01:21.990> only<00:01:22.500> running<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.920> medium<00:01:23.400> sized

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
actually only running a medium sized

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.280 
actually only running a medium sized
time<00:01:23.939> trial<00:01:24.180> bike<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.689> that'll<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:24.960> because

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
time trial bike and that'll be because

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.109 
time trial bike and that'll be because
as<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.830> see<00:01:25.890> there's<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> massive<00:01:26.850> drop

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
as you can see there's a massive drop

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.730 
as you can see there's a massive drop
between<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.600> saddle<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.140> his<00:01:28.229> bars<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
between the saddle and his bars and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.350 
between the saddle and his bars and
that's<00:01:28.979> kind<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> most<00:01:29.640> important<00:01:30.119> thing

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that's kind of the most important thing

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.910 
that's kind of the most important thing
for<00:01:30.780> these<00:01:30.930> guys<00:01:31.110> when<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.409> comes<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.829> in

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
for these guys when it comes to get in

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560 
for these guys when it comes to get in
their<00:01:32.070> aerodynamic<00:01:32.700> positions<00:01:33.119> dialed<00:01:33.450> in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
their aerodynamic positions dialed in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.030 
their aerodynamic positions dialed in
and<00:01:33.810> then<00:01:34.170> although<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> haven't<00:01:34.799> actually<00:01:34.890> got

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and then although I haven't actually got

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.069 
and then although I haven't actually got
