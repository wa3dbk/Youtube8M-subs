welcome<00:00:01.110> class<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.740> mini<00:00:02.129> lesson<00:00:02.580> on<00:00:02.929> arrays

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
welcome class this mini lesson on arrays

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.809 
welcome class this mini lesson on arrays
in<00:00:04.319> mathematics<00:00:05.040> so<00:00:05.160> we're<00:00:05.250> going<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.400> take<00:00:05.580> a

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
in mathematics so we're going to take a

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.610 
in mathematics so we're going to take a
number<00:00:06.270> today<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.960> we're<00:00:07.140> going<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.319> turn<00:00:07.440> it

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
number today and we're going to turn it

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.070 
number today and we're going to turn it
into<00:00:07.740> an<00:00:08.010> array<00:00:08.309> so<00:00:09.150> let's<00:00:09.360> switch<00:00:09.630> over<00:00:09.780> real

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
into an array so let's switch over real

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.100 
into an array so let's switch over real
quick<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.530> our<00:00:10.620> little<00:00:10.830> whiteboard<00:00:12.110> looking

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
quick to our little whiteboard looking

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.360 
quick to our little whiteboard looking
at<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.349> whiteboard<00:00:13.530> here<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.099> can<00:00:14.219> actually

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
at the whiteboard here we can actually

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.519 
at the whiteboard here we can actually
see<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.150> already<00:00:15.509> have<00:00:15.719> some<00:00:15.960> counters

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
see that we already have some counters

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.930 
see that we already have some counters
here<00:00:16.740> we're<00:00:16.920> familiar<00:00:17.070> with<00:00:17.340> counters<00:00:17.789> in

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
here we're familiar with counters in

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.179 
here we're familiar with counters in
math<00:00:18.119> but<00:00:18.900> these<00:00:19.140> counters<00:00:19.590> if<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.830> look<00:00:20.010> at

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
math but these counters if we look at

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.950 
math but these counters if we look at
them<00:00:20.340> real<00:00:20.490> quick<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.420> 1<00:00:21.689> 2<00:00:22.140> 3<00:00:22.279> 4<00:00:23.279> 5<00:00:23.789> 6<00:00:24.449> 7<00:00:24.689> 8

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
them real quick we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.320 
them real quick we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9<00:00:25.470> 10<00:00:25.740> 11<00:00:25.980> 12<00:00:26.269> so<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.390> 12<00:00:27.619> counters<00:00:28.619> here

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
9 10 11 12 so we have 12 counters here

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.519 
9 10 11 12 so we have 12 counters here
so<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.510> 12<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.900> start<00:00:31.080> off<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
so we have 12 to start off with and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.139 
so we have 12 to start off with and
we're<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> do<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.279> take<00:00:32.520> these<00:00:32.730> 12

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
we're going to do is take these 12

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.750 
we're going to do is take these 12
counts<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.690> shown<00:00:33.840> an<00:00:34.020> array<00:00:34.320> an<00:00:35.010> array<00:00:35.219> is

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
counts just shown an array an array is

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.350 
counts just shown an array an array is
spelled<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.829> our<00:00:37.829> our<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:39.680> why<00:00:41.030> that<00:00:42.030> would<00:00:42.180> be<00:00:42.239> an

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
spelled a our our a why that would be an

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.670 
spelled a our our a why that would be an
array<00:00:44.120> let's<00:00:45.120> fix<00:00:45.329> our<00:00:45.480> little<00:00:45.780> Y<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.379> there

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
array let's fix our little Y here there

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.970 
array let's fix our little Y here there
we<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.360> right<00:00:48.480> there<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.780> an<00:00:48.899> array<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.530> an

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
we go so right there is an array and an

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760 
we go so right there is an array and an
array<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:51.020> usually<00:00:52.020> called<00:00:52.170> rectangular

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
array is usually called rectangular

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.209 
array is usually called rectangular
arrays<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.370> what<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.610> do<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:55.219> align

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
arrays and what they do is they align

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.430 
arrays and what they do is they align
the<00:00:56.699> number<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.360> into<00:00:57.780> rows<00:00:58.109> &amp;<00:00:58.559> columns<00:01:00.440> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the number up into rows &amp; columns and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.260 
the number up into rows &amp; columns and
we're<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> take<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> look<00:01:02.370> at<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.670> so

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
we're going to take a look at that so

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.219 
we're going to take a look at that so
let's<00:01:03.420> stick<00:01:03.539> right<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.049> let's<00:01:04.170> create

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
let's stick right here and let's create

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.719 
let's stick right here and let's create
an<00:01:04.530> array<00:01:04.710> right<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.010> with<00:01:05.159> 12<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.580> then

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
an array right here with 12 and then

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.460 
an array right here with 12 and then
create<00:01:05.939> array<00:01:06.180> when<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.780> move<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> counters

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
create array when I move the counters

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
create array when I move the counters
and<00:01:07.680> lineup<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:09.439> into<00:01:10.439> even<00:01:10.950> rows<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.640> columns

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and lineup up into even rows and columns

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.130 
and lineup up into even rows and columns
and<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> start<00:01:12.689> off<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.020> we're

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and I'm going to start off and we're

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.700 
and I'm going to start off and we're
going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.320> try<00:01:13.680> two<00:01:14.520> rows<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> I'm<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
going to try two rows so I'm going to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.100 
going to try two rows so I'm going to
keep<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.009> even<00:01:17.430> all<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:17.790> through<00:01:21.110> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
keep it even all the way through so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.359 
keep it even all the way through so
moving<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.650> through<00:01:24.110> as<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
moving it through as you can see and

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.390 
moving it through as you can see and
getting<00:01:26.850> closer<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> end<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:28.250> we<00:01:29.250> have

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
getting closer to the end here we have

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.340 
getting closer to the end here we have
currently<00:01:29.790> used<00:01:30.030> 1<00:01:30.240> 2<00:01:30.390> 3<00:01:30.659> 4<00:01:30.869> 5<00:01:31.140> 6<00:01:31.470> 7<00:01:31.650> 8<00:01:33.380> 9<00:01:36.110> 10<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
currently used 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.999 
currently used 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and
the<00:01:38.100> last<00:01:38.310> two<00:01:39.590> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:41.180> an<00:01:42.180> array<00:01:42.829> if<00:01:43.829> you

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
the last two this is an array if you

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.770 
the last two this is an array if you
look<00:01:44.159> very<00:01:44.310> closely<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:45.240> when<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.689> at

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
look very closely here when we look at

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.679 
look very closely here when we look at
these<00:01:45.899> arrays<00:01:46.259> we'll<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.729> two

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
these arrays we'll see that we have two

00:01:48.689 --> 00:02:00.130 
these arrays we'll see that we have two
rows<00:01:49.130> one<00:01:50.130> row<00:01:51.439> two<00:01:52.439> rows<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:54.079> we<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.820> 1<00:01:56.820> 2<00:01:57.200> 3

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
rows one row two rows and we have 1 2 3

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.450 
rows one row two rows and we have 1 2 3
4<00:02:01.430> 5

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
4 5

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.360 
4 5
six<00:02:04.090> columns<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:07.090> is<00:02:07.360> called<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:08.050> two<00:02:09.420> by<00:02:10.420> six

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
six columns this is called a two by six

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.730 
six columns this is called a two by six
array<00:02:13.470> two<00:02:14.470> rows<00:02:14.680> six<00:02:15.160> columns<00:02:16.260> now<00:02:17.260> we<00:02:17.320> can

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
array two rows six columns now we can

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.850 
array two rows six columns now we can
actually<00:02:17.980> go<00:02:18.580> through<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.709> redistribute<00:02:20.709> all

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
actually go through and redistribute all

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.790 
actually go through and redistribute all
this<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:22.290> create<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:24.780> different<00:02:25.780> array<00:02:26.050> I'm

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
this and create a different array I'm

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.660 
this and create a different array I'm
going<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.160> real<00:02:27.310> quick<00:02:27.459> I'm<00:02:27.580> actually

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
going to that real quick I'm actually

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.190 
going to that real quick I'm actually
gonna<00:02:27.880> take<00:02:28.000> this<00:02:28.180> we're<00:02:28.660> going<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.900> make<00:02:29.050> an

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
gonna take this we're going to make an

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.750 
gonna take this we're going to make an
array<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:30.130> has<00:02:30.660> three<00:02:31.660> rows<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:32.560> see<00:02:33.520> if<00:02:33.610> we

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
array that has three rows and see if we

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.070 
array that has three rows and see if we
can<00:02:33.910> do<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:36.300> I'm<00:02:37.300> just<00:02:37.450> going<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.630> move<00:02:37.780> some<00:02:37.989> of

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
can do it I'm just going to move some of

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.330 
can do it I'm just going to move some of
these<00:02:38.140> down<00:02:38.380> because<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:38.950> want<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.190> make<00:02:39.310> sure

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
these down because you want to make sure

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.850 
these down because you want to make sure
that<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.570> equal<00:02:41.050> if<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.230> look<00:02:41.380> real

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
that it is equal if you look real

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.699 
that it is equal if you look real
closely<00:02:42.130> here<00:02:42.459> we<00:02:42.580> see<00:02:42.820> now<00:02:43.120> we<00:02:43.180> have<00:02:43.480> one<00:02:44.489> two

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
closely here we see now we have one two

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.320 
closely here we see now we have one two
three<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.880> three<00:02:49.510> by<00:02:50.470> I'm<00:02:51.340> going<00:02:52.150> below

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
three this is a three by I'm going below

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.430 
three this is a three by I'm going below
mean<00:02:52.570> by<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:53.820> two<00:02:55.050> three<00:02:56.130> four<00:02:57.930> four<00:02:58.930> columns

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
mean by one two three four four columns

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:07.590 
mean by one two three four four columns
so<00:03:00.340> three<00:03:00.880> rows<00:03:03.030> by<00:03:04.030> four<00:03:04.920> columns<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.600> these

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
so three rows by four columns and these

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.030 
so three rows by four columns and these
are<00:03:07.780> very<00:03:07.989> specific<00:03:08.230> terms<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.799> want<00:03:08.950> to

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
are very specific terms you want to

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.690 
are very specific terms you want to
learn<00:03:09.250> Rose<00:03:10.060> is<00:03:10.480> going<00:03:11.200> across<00:03:11.590> here<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.519> is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
learn Rose is going across here this is

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.729 
learn Rose is going across here this is
a<00:03:12.730> row<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:16.510> column<00:03:17.049> is<00:03:17.230> going<00:03:17.440> down<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.620> we

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
a row the column is going down so we

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.110 
a row the column is going down so we
have<00:03:20.950> three<00:03:21.400> rows<00:03:21.670> four<00:03:22.600> columns<00:03:23.549> or<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:25.000> can

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
have three rows four columns or you can

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.140 
have three rows four columns or you can
see<00:03:25.269> it<00:03:25.360> each<00:03:25.570> row<00:03:25.900> has<00:03:26.200> four<00:03:26.860> inside<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:27.970> so

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
see it each row has four inside of it so

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.660 
see it each row has four inside of it so
we<00:03:28.239> can<00:03:28.330> look<00:03:28.540> at<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.870> now<00:03:29.739> this<00:03:30.130> is<00:03:30.190> an<00:03:30.430> array

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
we can look at it now this is an array

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.370 
we can look at it now this is an array
let<00:03:30.940> me<00:03:31.060> show<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.239> real<00:03:31.510> quick<00:03:31.660> an<00:03:31.900> example

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
let me show you real quick an example

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.199 
let me show you real quick an example
oven<00:03:32.739> so<00:03:33.070> it's<00:03:33.310> not<00:03:33.430> an<00:03:33.610> array<00:03:33.790> rather<00:03:34.000> this

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
oven so it's not an array rather this

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.840 
oven so it's not an array rather this
next<00:03:34.480> page<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.989> on<00:03:35.590> here<00:03:36.100> we<00:03:36.459> should<00:03:36.640> have

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
next page and on here we should have

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.850 
next page and on here we should have
thirteen<00:03:37.830> another<00:03:38.830> thirteen<00:03:39.100> but<00:03:39.250> fifteen

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
thirteen another thirteen but fifteen

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.440 
thirteen another thirteen but fifteen
counters<00:03:41.860> so<00:03:42.459> we<00:03:42.549> have<00:03:42.670> fifteen<00:03:43.030> counters<00:03:43.360> I'm

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
counters so we have fifteen counters I'm

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.670 
counters so we have fifteen counters I'm
going<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:43.630> show<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:43.780> what's<00:03:43.930> not<00:03:44.170> an<00:03:44.380> array

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
going to show you what's not an array

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.610 
going to show you what's not an array
we're<00:03:45.640> going<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.850> create<00:03:46.239> an<00:03:46.420> array<00:03:46.780> with<00:03:47.590> two

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
we're going to create an array with two

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.470 
we're going to create an array with two
rows<00:03:48.220> or<00:03:48.670> we're<00:03:48.790> going<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:48.940> try<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:51.390> so<00:03:52.390> we're

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
rows or we're going to try to so we're

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.760 
rows or we're going to try to so we're
going<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.690> take<00:03:52.870> these<00:03:53.170> at<00:03:54.040> four

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:05.809 

six<00:04:00.430> eight

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.380 

ten

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.220 

I<00:04:12.430> got<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.520> grab<00:04:13.730> these<00:04:13.940> last<00:04:14.210> ones<00:04:14.450> now<00:04:15.050> you'll

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
I got to grab these last ones now you'll

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.440 
I got to grab these last ones now you'll
see<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.410> we<00:04:15.620> have<00:04:15.740> an<00:04:15.860> issue<00:04:16.100> I<00:04:16.519> put<00:04:17.209> this<00:04:17.269> one

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
see that we have an issue I put this one

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.750 
see that we have an issue I put this one
here<00:04:17.480> at<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.900> end<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.350> this<00:04:19.340> will<00:04:19.400> not<00:04:19.730> work

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
here at the end and this will not work

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.950 
here at the end and this will not work
because<00:04:20.180> an<00:04:20.480> array<00:04:21.400> requires<00:04:22.400> that<00:04:22.730> each<00:04:23.030> row

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
because an array requires that each row

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.610 
because an array requires that each row
or<00:04:24.290> each<00:04:24.860> column<00:04:25.490> have<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.420> same<00:04:26.690> amount<00:04:27.290> and

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
or each column have the same amount and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.390 
or each column have the same amount and
if<00:04:27.950> we<00:04:28.100> look<00:04:28.370> at<00:04:28.550> these<00:04:28.880> two<00:04:29.920> right<00:04:30.920> here<00:04:30.950> if<00:04:31.280> we

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
if we look at these two right here if we

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.180 
if we look at these two right here if we
look<00:04:31.610> at<00:04:32.110> this<00:04:33.110> row<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:33.770> has<00:04:34.580> one<00:04:35.270> more<00:04:36.190> then

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
look at this row it has one more then

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.100 
look at this row it has one more then
this<00:04:37.370> row<00:04:37.550> right<00:04:37.700> here<00:04:37.910> we're<00:04:38.090> missing<00:04:38.510> this

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
this row right here we're missing this

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.380 
this row right here we're missing this
point<00:04:39.670> and<00:04:41.110> look<00:04:42.110> at<00:04:42.230> this<00:04:42.320> column<00:04:43.090> it's<00:04:44.090> also

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
point and look at this column it's also

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.930 
point and look at this column it's also
the<00:04:44.660> same<00:04:44.900> way<00:04:45.110> it's<00:04:45.500> got<00:04:45.740> one<00:04:46.040> and<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.460> has<00:04:46.640> one

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
the same way it's got one and it has one

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.110 
the same way it's got one and it has one
in<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.240> it<00:04:47.600> needs<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:47.840> have<00:04:48.020> two<00:04:48.470> each<00:04:49.120> column

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
in it it needs to have two each column

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.540 
in it it needs to have two each column
has<00:04:50.300> two<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:50.810> in<00:04:50.960> this<00:04:51.110> case<00:04:51.410> this<00:04:52.160> one<00:04:52.400> only

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
has two and in this case this one only

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.850 
has two and in this case this one only
has<00:04:52.730> one<00:04:52.760> so<00:04:53.300> we're<00:04:53.450> missing<00:04:53.900> this<00:04:54.560> point

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
has one so we're missing this point

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.830 
has one so we're missing this point
right<00:04:54.950> here<00:04:55.010> so<00:04:55.280> that's<00:04:55.490> not<00:04:55.640> a<00:04:56.210> possible

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
right here so that's not a possible

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.490 
right here so that's not a possible
array<00:04:57.110> for<00:04:57.440> 15<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:59.090> we<00:04:59.210> have<00:04:59.360> to<00:04:59.510> reorganize<00:05:00.020> it

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
array for 15 so we have to reorganize it

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.030 
array for 15 so we have to reorganize it
to<00:05:00.680> find<00:05:00.950> an<00:05:01.100> array<00:05:01.310> that<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.550> possible<00:05:03.040> so

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
to find an array that is possible so

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.830 
to find an array that is possible so
we're<00:05:04.130> going<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.280> slowly<00:05:04.640> move<00:05:04.970> it<00:05:05.180> down<00:05:05.419> and<00:05:05.720> I

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
we're going to slowly move it down and I

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.940 
we're going to slowly move it down and I
move<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.110> down<00:05:06.230> to<00:05:06.260> here<00:05:06.500> we're<00:05:06.620> going<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.770> try

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
move it down to here we're going to try

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.640 
move it down to here we're going to try
three<00:05:07.370> rows<00:05:07.760> now<00:05:08.140> and<00:05:09.140> we're<00:05:09.230> going<00:05:09.350> to<00:05:09.380> see<00:05:09.530> if

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
three rows now and we're going to see if

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.920 
three rows now and we're going to see if
that's<00:05:09.830> possible<00:05:12.160> so<00:05:13.160> they<00:05:13.250> move<00:05:13.430> closer<00:05:13.930> we

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
that's possible so they move closer we

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.080 
that's possible so they move closer we
have<00:05:15.050> made<00:05:15.290> ourselves<00:05:15.440> a<00:05:15.979> nice<00:05:16.280> rectangular

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
have made ourselves a nice rectangular

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.830 
have made ourselves a nice rectangular
array<00:05:17.720> this<00:05:17.960> time<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:19.300> you<00:05:20.300> can<00:05:20.450> see<00:05:20.690> the

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
array this time and you can see the

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.290 
array this time and you can see the
rectangular<00:05:21.350> array<00:05:22.090> like<00:05:23.090> that<00:05:24.940> so<00:05:25.940> we<00:05:26.090> have

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
rectangular array like that so we have

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.410 
rectangular array like that so we have
one<00:05:27.310> two<00:05:28.310> three<00:05:29.080> rows

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:45.980 

and<00:05:34.400> one<00:05:35.400> two<00:05:36.360> three<00:05:37.370> four<00:05:38.690> five<00:05:40.490> columns<00:05:44.990> so

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
and one two three four five columns so

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.960 
and one two three four five columns so
we<00:05:46.020> have<00:05:46.230> three<00:05:46.770> rows<00:05:46.980> by<00:05:47.610> five<00:05:48.120> columns

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:00.220 

which<00:05:53.510> equals<00:05:53.990> 15<00:05:54.500> that's<00:05:54.710> our<00:05:54.860> our<00:05:55.010> a<00:05:57.580> 3x5<00:05:59.230> you

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
which equals 15 that's our our a 3x5 you

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.050 
which equals 15 that's our our a 3x5 you
can<00:06:00.350> see<00:06:00.440> each<00:06:00.590> row<00:06:00.830> has<00:06:01.070> five<00:06:01.370> in<00:06:01.610> it<00:06:01.700> or<00:06:01.910> each

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
can see each row has five in it or each

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.520 
can see each row has five in it or each
column<00:06:02.450> has<00:06:02.630> three<00:06:02.960> in<00:06:03.110> it<00:06:03.550> so<00:06:04.550> boys<00:06:04.820> and<00:06:04.970> girls

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
column has three in it so boys and girls

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.210 
column has three in it so boys and girls
there<00:06:06.530> you<00:06:06.680> have<00:06:06.860> yourself<00:06:07.220> an<00:06:07.340> array<00:06:09.220> so

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
there you have yourself an array so

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.580 
there you have yourself an array so
that's<00:06:10.400> about<00:06:10.730> it<00:06:10.970> for<00:06:11.150> a<00:06:11.330> race<00:06:11.630> just<00:06:12.230> remember

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
that's about it for a race just remember

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.930 
that's about it for a race just remember
the<00:06:12.680> key<00:06:12.890> points<00:06:13.250> here<00:06:13.340> that<00:06:13.520> they<00:06:13.640> are<00:06:13.760> made

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
the key points here that they are made

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.840 
the key points here that they are made
up<00:06:14.060> of<00:06:14.210> rows<00:06:14.510> and<00:06:14.750> columns<00:06:14.950> that<00:06:15.950> each<00:06:16.220> row<00:06:16.610> and

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
up of rows and columns that each row and

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.540 
up of rows and columns that each row and
each<00:06:16.910> column<00:06:16.970> have<00:06:17.480> an<00:06:17.600> equal<00:06:18.020> amount<00:06:18.430> so<00:06:19.430> if

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
each column have an equal amount so if

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.060 
each column have an equal amount so if
you<00:06:19.700> have<00:06:19.880> three<00:06:20.300> rows<00:06:20.330> all<00:06:20.990> through<00:06:21.890> those

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
you have three rows all through those

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.560 
you have three rows all through those
rows<00:06:22.280> better<00:06:22.640> have<00:06:22.820> the<00:06:22.940> same<00:06:23.150> number<00:06:23.540> of

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
rows better have the same number of

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.360 
rows better have the same number of
column<00:06:24.140> but<00:06:24.530> I<00:06:24.560> have<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:24.770> same<00:06:24.950> number<00:06:25.220> of

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
column but I have the same number of

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.860 
column but I have the same number of
counters<00:06:25.760> in<00:06:25.880> it<00:06:26.000> or<00:06:26.150> if<00:06:26.510> you're<00:06:26.600> looking<00:06:26.810> at

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
counters in it or if you're looking at

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.450 
counters in it or if you're looking at
the<00:06:26.990> columns<00:06:27.440> if<00:06:27.650> columns<00:06:28.010> better<00:06:28.220> have<00:06:28.370> the

the columns if columns better have the

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.040 
the columns if columns better have the

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
same number of counters in it if they

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.380 
same number of counters in it if they
don't<00:06:30.320> it<00:06:30.560> is<00:06:30.590> not<00:06:30.710> an<00:06:31.160> array<00:06:31.580> has<00:06:32.030> to<00:06:32.060> make<00:06:32.360> a

don't it is not an array has to make a
