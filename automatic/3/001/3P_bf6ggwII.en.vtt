00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.640

 new here or for those who do not know the stop 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.350
 they are a little annoying in relation to 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.629
 let you smoke inside the store 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.000
 He did not let himself filming his way 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.590
 was in the module splinter cell film with 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.050
 my cell phone quality is not the 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.899
 quality but I'm used to seeing 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.490

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.070

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.380

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.250
 Then everyone will stay, I went. 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.789
 straight to the front of the store to be able to 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.380
 to know how I was or did not want to be 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.479
 very excited for the human xbox 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.619
 Although you like or have a body, there is a 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.720
 little more of the products of sony games 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.220
 xbox the year the explosives that me 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:49.039
 more pleasing to suffer a little bit 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.240
 salty to me right now being well 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.560
 Cheap compared to Brazil 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.880
 here I was hiding behind and jaú 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.360
 because he was realizing that he was 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.770
 filming so stay hidden it also gives 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.259
 to show you a little 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.369
 jorge henrique and cristian they have the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.170
 available one way jogaço 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.180
 I like this game in the corner. 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.819
 left free in play 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.910
 nobody was nearly 90 dollars and saw 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.849
 Batman game also really cool 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.549
 Botafogo is thus well-known of 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.420
 slow suddenly and not forgotten me 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.420
 or brazuca 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.370
 I took the opportunity to have a look at the 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.830
 playstation 4 release game that 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.299
 sleep does not play group acts in play 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.540
 in fact he is the only game that I am 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.190
 that player s4 moment it a game 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.920
 schumacher left is everyone talking 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.840
 good of the game since his name is now 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.349
 of course it is a racing game all 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.750
 launch one has attended imprint 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.090
 a panoramic view and yes the ball store 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.010
 in a long time the monox xbox 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.150
 unfortunately had no ps4 people 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.190
 can be testing by playing 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.019
 Will her console she's waiting for? 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.609
 a little bit to be able to buy 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.280
 If I'm not mistaken on that day, I was 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:17.040
 talking a zelda demo 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:20.280
 I think it was that pretty as well. 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.140
 hd is interesting but still lyon 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.260
 need some titles or even to be able to 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.549
 motivate to buy the idea is that the moment 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.690
 that everyone thinks they want to see 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:33.440
 in this video that playstation 4 there by 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.709
 a decent price had to pay vain 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.709
 put up 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.050
 just so you have an idea is this was 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.800
 practically the day of the release of ds4 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.700
 and I asked the staff who worked 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.959
 in the store if they had a console 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.430
 available and everyone was up- to-date if I 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.359
 put my name on the waiting list only 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.430
 to know how long it would take 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.490
 I think my name is numerous 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.980
 list 45 pride 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.260
 and it has been a few days and even 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.910
 I have not received a call today that you want 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.380
 say that many people are looking for 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.740
 classic attracted few people are 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.240
 being able to have more anyway 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.780
 thank you for the invitation and big hug 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.780
 for you 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.740
 I was at 11 game crush a year ago 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:50.270
 and a girl with 20s arrived 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.759
 to hold all super games 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.650

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.270
 accustomed to buy every bought all 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.310
 the cartridges and when it came 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.990
 by the position state that could not accept 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.880
 because it was very bad 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.710
 She got the room in the trash in my room. 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.780
 front and I like Brazilian when 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:13.009
 Assumptions matter if I pick something up. 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.440
 you can not feel comfortable going up 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.630
 to keep the memory 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.539
 I got home I put the cartridge and the 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.759

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.889
