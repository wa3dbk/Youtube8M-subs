00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.580 

so<00:01:48.490> next<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:48.880> do<00:01:48.940> my<00:01:49.180> top<00:01:49.240> liner<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:50.020> like<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:50.470> use

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
so next I do my top liner I like to use

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.010 
so next I do my top liner I like to use
liquid<00:01:50.890> liner<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.430> create<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.910> winged<00:01:52.300> look<00:01:52.630> and

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
liquid liner to create a winged look and

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.420 
liquid liner to create a winged look and
then<00:01:53.200> I'm<00:01:53.320> going<00:01:53.410> to<00:01:53.500> take<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.800> carbon<00:01:54.280> and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
then I'm going to take the carbon and

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.730 
then I'm going to take the carbon and
connect<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.660> outside<00:01:55.870> of<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.560> wing

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
connect it to the outside of the wing

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.920 
connect it to the outside of the wing
that's<00:01:57.220> why<00:01:57.460> I<00:01:57.490> do<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.790> liner<00:01:58.030> first<00:02:00.930> next

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
that's why I do the liner first next

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.230 
that's why I do the liner first next
they<00:02:02.020> take<00:02:02.260> carbon<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.890> shadow<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.640> this<00:02:03.850> small
