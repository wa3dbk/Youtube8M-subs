00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 first of all it is that nothing they see this the 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.509
 that you just put a car very 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.130
 similar to smart which is very cool 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.330
 because it's my favorite car so what 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.330
 I will use it very often 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.370
 how to be a sick psychopath 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.880
 first get a telescope for 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.800
 start being like a psychopath first 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.340
 we need a telescope that can see 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.320
 the whole street like this number two 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.180
 identify the victim as psychopaths 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.760
 they always have to be within sight of 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.010
 victim potential victims like this 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.620
 like that car once they have their 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.710
 victim not lose sight follow the 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.910
 trace see what car you have if possible 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.410
 to see the plates and it is possible that 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.629
 you see the plates you have is 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.430
 it's better not to know exactly 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.280
 what car it is and if you can know what 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.870
 t-shirt this skin color is all 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.899
 that's all going to help them at the time 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.640
 of being psychopaths so they have to 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.890
 continue for a while to see more or less the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.960
 route that you take where you're going what 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.940
 places frequent what number of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.759
 phone you have if you eat pizza very 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.160
 followed if you have insurance if you work is going to 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.890
 the school where you live where you eat number 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.240
 3 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.850
 of a lomba in psychopaths always has 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.530
 a map like this should plan everything 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.390
 they must see what car they are going to use in planning 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.690
 the route they are going to take should plan 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.300
 what weapon are you going to use and good step 4 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.680
 I find it good once you find 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.540
 they found they should not attack 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.060
 they must wait patiently 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.580
 to give the opportunity step 5 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.560
 confirm that it is who you are looking for 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.690
 good psychopath technique is to obstruct 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.090
 its way obstructing it and not letting it 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.320
 go follow it and once 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.030
 good in some excuse like being 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.590
 struck out the tire like here to the lady 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.020
 I struck out the tire wait I think 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.509
 I threw the rim to see the truth of 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.740
 jÃ¡vea leave a little no no no we have 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.259
 made wait 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.060
 Step 6 Use your soul once you were 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.009
 patients and they waited for their opportunity 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.740
 in this case it was the semaphore get off 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.360
 choose your weapon the weapon you want in 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.020
 this case is an explosive so that everything 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.840
 be simple fast and discreet now 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.780
 they just say goodbye a little and they 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.520
 they return to their car step 7 effect the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.709
 plan for this step is required 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.340
 discretion there wait in this case that 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.060
 move away a little 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.700
 and send it directly to oblivion step 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.870
 8 escape from the area and good before 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.360
 that the police arrive to ask them questions 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.870
 they do not need to just walk away and 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:37.690
 get over it step 9 do not go crazy if 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.690
 everything is fine but let's kill something 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.879
 It is not what it feels 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.750
 hey hey where are you going where are you going alone 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.200
 I want to talk with you, you want to walk 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.200
 with me at night you do not want to see anything 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.630
 this is that if not because you are seeing me 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.530
 he wants to fight with me 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.530
 but 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.459
 because you're talking on cell phone esther 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.459
 It is adaptable by mobile 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:17.560
 almost all also also any are 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.290

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.170

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.530
 weird feeling like that none of this 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.530
 It is the real 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:46.830
