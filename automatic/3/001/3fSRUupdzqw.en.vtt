00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.820
 hello everyone and welcome to footlille com 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.820
 the film it's time for us to watch what made the news 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.720
 and today it will be question of higher cost for more than 23 years 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.280
 the new layout by all master 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.270
 Dear readers 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.620
 it is with a certain emotion that I introduced his traits to malaga 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.330
 hold it almost by chance steeve blum jobs what do I say the game that created the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.820
 first time that the seventh day 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.770
 but tired 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.230
 man is indeed the graphical interface and the mouse for 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.200
 microcomputers consumer is bowing out so we will remember well 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.980
 heard of his exemplary career at the head of the company knowing that we 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.640
 it owes among others the democratization of mp3 players 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.990
 but also those touchscreen smartphones with the arrival of 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.840
 the iphone in 2007 the touch pads with the real guru strike for 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.020
 some we will also remember his mythical black 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.330
 of its commercial policy not always free from reproach 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
 in short, a man who has marked the history of micro-computing 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.730
 visionary often criticized rightly or wrongly the team is thrilled to 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.520
 some 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.010
 especially during the next keynote of the brand 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.190
 to replace it another iconic figure of the brand has been 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.950
 appointed 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.950
 this is tim cook we wish the same success 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.620
 the tallec it's time to take stock of the next system 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.790
 operating microsoft 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.910
 after redemption with one of his acts it might well be that one of 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.030
 after just the consecration 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.740
 indeed this week we are learning that the next version of windows 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.130
 will natively support the strait 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.249
 the study will therefore no longer need to update the usb controller 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.159
 even better the copy should be improved so let's not 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.069
 get lost in multiple windows 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.859
 and most importantly it will be possible to interrupt a copy for the 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:17.959
 resume later 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.769
 all in one and the same window informing you about the rates of 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:21.459
 transfers 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.209
 the amount of fisher moved or the directories of origin and 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.779
 destination 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.009
 short a mine away not enough to seduce 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.649
 especially if we think back to its interface and a brain of compatibility with the 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:33.759
 touch tablets 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.089
 it starts to weigh in the balance and we can not wait to rub it 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.389
 mid 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.989
 since the calls on Saturday 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.099
 we must not feel sorry for him 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.140
 indeed the creator of the iphone in their associates once again to 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.269
 google for the design of his next google smartphone the nexus 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.519
 prague 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.719
 this new game could well shake the competition because with a 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.189
 configuration and key resources as announced 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.499
 the other smartphones are worried to be ludovic think of a 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:02.499
 possible offspring if they do not want to be picking it up 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.269
 the google nexus prime could not ship a dual core processor 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.539
 clocked at 1 5 ghz identical to that equipping the tablets archos g9 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.599
 its 5-inch touch screen would be equipped with a backlight to 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.799
 mohammed would be able to display a resolution of 1280 out of 720 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.540
 he even whispers that he would be the standard beard delphine sandwich of 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.759
 next bubble rises 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.799
 mass 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.459
 watch out for rumors 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.109
 yes but he feels good to teach us 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.499
 it was not 3 everything is possible 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:35.409
 if we trust the Wall Street Journal 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.599
 fishing will be is currently being specified for the third the 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.570
 terraces are from the apple touch pad 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.440
 for quite some time now rumors have been going around as to the 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.799
 supposedly very hot resolution of the next slate of the apple 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.779
 and today it is the wall street journal who would have his possession of 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.989
 this interesting information about it 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.929
 namely kappel have already ordered many slabs 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:59.379
 nephew 35 inches with a resolution of 2048 by 1536 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.329
 twice the resolution of the UN is 2 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.900
 still according to the wall street journal not less than 1 25 million components 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.739
 for ipad 3 would already be on the order forms 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.459
 but again all this is to be done with tweezers 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.149
 nobody really knows the city source 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.149
 this says the boss is still scheduled for early 2010 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.620
 mik 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.229
 after the mass on the gpu 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.669

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.569
