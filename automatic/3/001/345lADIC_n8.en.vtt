00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.529
 movie props made in friedberg this one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.750
 first martin of the next james bond 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.030
 went out in the air comes from swabia 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.150
 more precisely from these 3 d printers 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.340
 the company voxeljet unbelievable but true 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.189
 this machine can print whole cars 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.590
 our 3d printers work with particles 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.150
 materials as a starting material that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.990
 For example, it can be sand or plastic 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
 be in powder 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.210
 this powder will always be layered 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.180
 on a building area discharged from 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.860
 thin layer 0.3 millimeters thick with it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.050
 these layers with a printer so 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.820
 printed with the hangman printer and the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 liquid then printed on it 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.680
 it will cause these particles 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.750
 layer selectively depicts glued 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.510
 but you wear a new layer 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.910
 Item material printed on again 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.370
 and so on and so on until the construction height 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.260
 it is enough and the components or partie 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.239
 the areas that were printed were the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.129
 then get stuck and the rest 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.300
 Particle areas can then be removed 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.080
 be and there remains the desired 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.820
 object about whether spare parts for cars 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.560
 Architectural models or whole rooms here 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 Everything can be printed on 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.939
 Of course that also entails that 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.640
 Of course, with every new technology 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.500
 associated risks 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.299
 we now have the internet or too 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.450
 of course, the other seen over other media 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.140
 this theme with the printed weapon 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.420
 but ultimately there are others 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.590
 actually a lot of risks 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.900
 more dramatic for the business because of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.180
 example, just copyright so who has 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.850
 because the right of certain data who 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920
 may print duplicate parts 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.420
 then the data are really scanned 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.280
 your own data or include the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.470
 to give to those the object belongs that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.150
 are actually questions in the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.130
 so much more to come tomorrow 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.960
 what have seen the friedberger so far 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.390
 Machine is according to the company 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.460
 one of the largest 3d printers in the world 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.479
 so far not something for that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.580
 own living room 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.920
 but that could change 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.170
 only one could actually look like 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.030
 you describe that the plural number 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.690
 Households actually have 3d printers 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.480
 feature 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.690
 this printer would have to summer 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.490
 be built increased quality or 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.010
 also incorporate improved materials 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.140
 then something could be conceivable 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.440
 another scenario goes that one 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.270
 Druckzentren has copy shops just as it does now 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.500
 where practically data from private users 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.970
 can be printed in 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.160
 correspondingly high quality 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.440
 materials and then you could 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.310
 someday everyone at the pc would be wishful thinking 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.260
 to design 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.410
 whether spare part designer table or 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.620
 simply new shoes all from a 3d 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.620
 printer
