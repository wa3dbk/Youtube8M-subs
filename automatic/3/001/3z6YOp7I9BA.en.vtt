00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
the sandwiches that I'm sure kraang has

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.390 
the sandwiches that I'm sure kraang has
prepared<00:03:33.540> for<00:03:33.750> everybody<00:03:34.100> his<00:03:35.100> articulation

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
prepared for everybody his articulation

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.069 
prepared for everybody his articulation
a<00:03:35.790> little<00:03:35.970> bit<00:03:36.060> different<00:03:36.480> because<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.840> where

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
a little bit different because of where

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.860 
a little bit different because of where
his<00:03:37.260> head<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.590> placed<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:39.420> doesn't<00:03:39.690> really

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
his head is placed so it doesn't really

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.120 
his head is placed so it doesn't really
rotate<00:03:40.230> up<00:03:40.350> here<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.920> rotates<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.730> way<00:03:43.130> arms

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
rotate up here it rotates this way arms

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.390 
rotate up here it rotates this way arms
also<00:03:44.610> do<00:03:44.790> rotate<00:03:45.269> they<00:03:46.049> rotate<00:03:46.500> out<00:03:46.709> as<00:03:47.100> well

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
also do rotate they rotate out as well

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.509 
also do rotate they rotate out as well
so<00:03:47.880> he<00:03:48.060> can<00:03:48.239> do<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.600> super<00:03:49.380> big<00:03:49.590> hug<00:03:50.489> to

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
so he can do the super big hug to

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.440 
so he can do the super big hug to
everybody<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.450> legs<00:03:52.440> also<00:03:53.070> move<00:03:53.400> peg<00:03:54.269> holes

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
everybody and legs also move peg holes

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.170 
everybody and legs also move peg holes
are<00:03:54.690> in<00:03:54.780> both<00:03:55.130> Leatherhead<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.430> as<00:03:56.730> well<00:03:57.030> as

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
are in both Leatherhead and as well as

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.060 
are in both Leatherhead and as well as
crank<00:03:57.570> so<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:58.290> could<00:03:58.470> pick<00:03:58.650> them<00:03:58.829> into<00:03:59.040> a

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
crank so you could pick them into a

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.949 
crank so you could pick them into a
display<00:03:59.400> stand<00:03:59.519> or<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.239> can<00:04:00.600> have<00:04:00.750> them

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
display stand or you can have them

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.000 
display stand or you can have them
equally<00:04:01.350> sitting<00:04:01.950> somewhere<00:04:02.730> for<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.030> ride<00:04:03.299> I

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
equally sitting somewhere for a ride I

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.800 
equally sitting somewhere for a ride I
guess<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.130> only<00:04:05.220> problem<00:04:05.640> with<00:04:05.810> Leatherhead

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
guess the only problem with Leatherhead

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.099 
guess the only problem with Leatherhead
is<00:04:07.079> that<00:04:07.440> his<00:04:07.769> tail<00:04:08.250> would<00:04:09.150> prevent<00:04:09.810> him<00:04:10.079> from

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
is that his tail would prevent him from

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.520 
is that his tail would prevent him from
kind<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.500> just<00:04:10.799> sitting<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.519> vehicle<00:04:12.260> so<00:04:13.260> if

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
kind of just sitting in a vehicle so if
