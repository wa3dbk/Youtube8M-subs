read that but you can see that you can
see<00:00:30.810> there's<00:00:31.050> actually<00:00:31.439> kind<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.679> laggy<00:00:31.920> but

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
um you can see that it gives an accurate

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.750 
um you can see that it gives an accurate
representation<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:35.280> they're<00:00:35.640> actually

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
representation of what they're actually

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.959 
representation of what they're actually
trying<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.360> say<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.780> he<00:00:37.530> says<00:00:37.800> hello<00:00:38.219> hello<00:00:38.579> and

you can see that has it all in different

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.779 
you can see that has it all in different
colors<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.010> can't<00:00:50.190> actually<00:00:50.309> change<00:00:50.640> the

I have it and it is a superior as
severely<00:01:03.870> lagging<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.010> actual<00:01:05.250> area

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
severely lagging up the the actual area

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.359 
severely lagging up the the actual area
before<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> invited<00:01:06.750> all<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:06.900> friends<00:01:07.020> along<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
before I invited all my friends along it

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.750 
before I invited all my friends along it
actually<00:01:08.520> started<00:01:09.380> well<00:01:10.380> okay<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.189> got<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.610> got

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.700 
actually started well okay we got we got
a<00:01:11.790> little<00:01:11.970> bit<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.299> laggy<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.229> he<00:01:13.409> spiked

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
a little bit about laggy like he spiked

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.170 
a little bit about laggy like he spiked
I<00:01:13.830> think<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.159> because<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.580> musical

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that I would like to Caesar maybe a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530 
that I would like to Caesar maybe a
slightly<00:01:37.500> longer<00:01:37.890> sort<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.610> viewing<00:01:39.210> time

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
slightly longer sort of a viewing time

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.819 
slightly longer sort of a viewing time
because<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.079> actually<00:01:40.290> kind<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.530> hard<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
because it's actually kind of hard to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.410 
because it's actually kind of hard to
locate<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.490> person<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:42.119> actually

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
locate the person and then actually

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.300 
locate the person and then actually
trying<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> read<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.170> although<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.130> see

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
trying to read it although you can see

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.800 
trying to read it although you can see
that<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.880> actually<00:01:45.000> read<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.450> without

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
that so you can actually read it without

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.499 
that so you can actually read it without
being<00:01:46.170> obscure<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.490> view<00:01:47.640> being<00:01:47.820> obscured<00:01:48.270> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
being obscure the view being obscured so

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.240 
being obscure the view being obscured so
I<00:01:48.540> say<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.020> drop<00:01:49.229> down<00:01:49.259> here<00:01:49.649> you'd<00:01:50.040> still

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
I say if we drop down here you'd still

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.670 
I say if we drop down here you'd still
be<00:01:50.430> able<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.820> read<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> nameplate

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
be able to read just like the nameplate

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800 
be able to read just like the nameplate
it<00:01:52.890> still<00:01:53.130> has<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> same<00:01:53.610> visibility<00:01:53.909> as<00:01:54.570> that

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
it still has the same visibility as that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.319 
it still has the same visibility as that
and<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.590> starting<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.100> lag<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.670> quite<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> bit

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and it's starting to lag up quite a bit

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.999 
and it's starting to lag up quite a bit
now<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> little<00:01:58.320> more<00:01:58.590> people<00:01:58.890> are

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
now because a little more people are

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.310 
now because a little more people are
joining<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> rate<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.600> mod<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.079> eight

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
joining in so I rate this mod and eight

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.139 
joining in so I rate this mod and eight
out<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.590> ten<00:02:01.979> fruit<00:02:02.340> loops<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.700> see<00:02:03.000> how

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
out of ten fruit loops you can see how

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.090 
out of ten fruit loops you can see how
this<00:02:03.299> mod<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.540> nicely<00:02:03.960> implemented<00:02:04.530> into<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
this mod is nicely implemented into the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.649 
this mod is nicely implemented into the
game<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.430> Minecraft<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.149> actually<00:02:06.299> works

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
game of Minecraft and it actually works

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.660 
game of Minecraft and it actually works
quite<00:02:07.079> reasonably<00:02:07.590> well<00:02:07.920> now<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.489> may<00:02:08.640> be

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
quite reasonably well now you may be

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.639 
quite reasonably well now you may be
wondering<00:02:08.819> here<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.929> mod<00:02:10.170> actually

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
wondering here is this mod actually

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.350 
wondering here is this mod actually
installed<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> server<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.970> actually<00:02:12.120> a

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
installed on the server it's actually a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.910 
installed on the server it's actually a
client<00:02:12.930> side<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
client side so it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.589 
client side so it
is<00:02:14.130> actually<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.730> your<00:02:14.970> own<00:02:15.150> sort<00:02:15.540> of

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
is actually on your own sort of

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.470 
is actually on your own sort of
minecraft<00:02:16.260> client<00:02:16.470> if<00:02:16.709> not<00:02:16.920> know<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:17.550> someone

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
minecraft client if not know if someone

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.729 
minecraft client if not know if someone
doesn't<00:02:18.630> have<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.050> mod<00:02:19.200> installed<00:02:19.590> they

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
doesn't have the mod installed they

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.140 
doesn't have the mod installed they
won't<00:02:19.950> be<00:02:20.099> able<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.489> see<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:21.090> it's

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
won't be able to see it but it's

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.820 
won't be able to see it but it's
actually<00:02:21.360> pretty<00:02:21.690> cool<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.140> I'm<00:02:22.470> totally

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
actually pretty cool and I'm totally

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.309 
actually pretty cool and I'm totally
getting<00:02:23.069> surrounded<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.810> chat<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.230> going

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
getting surrounded and the chat is going

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.110 
getting surrounded and the chat is going
crazy<00:02:25.770> I'm<00:02:26.010> surprised<00:02:26.370> how<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.640> server<00:02:27.000> is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
crazy I'm surprised how the server is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.360 
crazy I'm surprised how the server is
actually<00:02:27.420> holding<00:02:27.569> up<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.110> my<00:02:28.739> minecraft<00:02:29.220> is

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
actually holding up and my minecraft is

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.430 
actually holding up and my minecraft is
I've<00:02:29.610> noticed<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.209> little<00:02:30.510> bit<00:02:30.600> laggy<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:30.989> I'm
