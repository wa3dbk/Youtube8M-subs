00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.949
 so beautiful and Saglik it stays dry every 10 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.760
 I got a little bit of freedom a little luggage Sido 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.459
 establish 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.219
 and indeed it works and the resolution the deeper 12 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.699
 we have to know how difficult it is 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.929
 Export values â€‹â€‹September is on again 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.489
 in the case of a fine 46 of the 80 90 Samsung device connected 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.329
 up here on the left 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.130
 we have once 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.670
 with one foot 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.370
 this when yes channel upshift 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.920
 there is a hang 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.920
 here for my goal it is the officials Yemen 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.830
 in this box itself via HDMI 2 it will be when the device is on 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.170
 the tape is released 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.450
 We should top the money up 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.450
 and put on the tracks first 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.010
 so you could see 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.850
 it is open 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.020
 19 20 times 10 80 set to 60 hertz 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.930
 then he jumped to the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.930
 FIFA 12 demo stop 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.730
 after that dominated on the screen 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.640
 and 82 on 27 so it definitely will 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.650
 runtergeschraubt 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.350
 Unfortunately, I can not offer really extremely accurate graphical comparison 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.560
 I do not turn on my camera 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.560
 which can connect between inputs 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.180
 if you print for a short time 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.480
 everything is still possible somehow 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.170
 and very briefly 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.700
 yes the company worthwhile 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.590
 Unite big, Andrew Marshall Fund wanted to put the supervision off, even now 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.840
 not really 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 so went 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.319
 Bonn 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.319
 to confirm 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.609
 the guests squeezed Borken 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.119
 Sven Lindemann six seven finals 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:47.529
 and Strutz ahead 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.419
 and 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.500
 actually you wanted to be easy 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.290
 0 2 lag 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.189
 Mainz Rome 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.659
 and mom the yesterday's game between 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.899
 Borussia Dortmund 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:07.899
 at the bottom of the lawn 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.499
 you recognize the jerseys 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:19.779
 especially if you look at this b-to-b sign Kurth 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:24.089
 it remains a bit spongy 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.859
 The situation is similar with Arsenal 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.399
 Textures in themselves 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.689
 quite alright 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.689
 Bad sees me about the actual look of the game 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.129
 but somehow a pity that Sony 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.820
 at the end user content in the list 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.909
 10 80 critics counties 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.760
 we're going to do the whole thing on the Xbox again, very rough in front of Nils 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.760
 was seen anyway 80 man 27 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.449
 you should go to the Xbox no 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.749
 Tuesday it puts a thousand 29 times dry 80 my whole gnawed 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:05.919
 also on 1 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.289
 handle that way 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.289
 Britz given 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.429
 sda 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:19.599
 Play game Attention top left but there was nothing to come 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.940
 because 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.940
 deeper on the Xbox the resolution does not change 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.630
 John in the mission statement itself somewhat reasonably blatter out with more so not so clear 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.210
 Kienbaum on the jerseys want 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.659
 and then let's see if you can distinguish a small one from the picture 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.659
 can be 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.999
 it could 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.029
 do not go 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.349
 still the thing will be 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.379
 Hess 2 demo completely held Mendig while the Xbox Demo customer clearly 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.289
 Jochen 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.089
 while Leader Dortmund 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:48.089
 and as against Arsenal 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.219
 betting 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:54.219
 in the game against jersey in court one stands 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.189
 BVB time not clear form 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.779
 the jersey itself 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.069
 since Arnesen is I can not find any real difference now 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.089
 for my eye itself will be essential 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:19.150
 sharply 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.569
 not quite as granular 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.419
 He judges victories for himself 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.150
 if a player is reversed for attention it is saved but 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.900
 a deeper one
