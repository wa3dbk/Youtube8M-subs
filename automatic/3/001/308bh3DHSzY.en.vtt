outside of my guitars and became

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.529 
outside of my guitars and became
increasingly<00:00:44.280> aware<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.329> most

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
increasingly aware that it's not most

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.319 
increasingly aware that it's not most
durable<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.140> finishes<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> outside

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
durable the finishes and on the outside

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.569 
durable the finishes and on the outside
it's<00:00:48.690> fantastic<00:00:49.260> totally<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.829> wonderful<00:00:50.309> and

make<00:01:33.570> sure<00:01:33.750> islands<00:01:34.110> clean

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.780 

basically<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.460> roma<00:01:45.700> in<00:01:46.920> first<00:01:47.920> bit<00:01:48.220> first

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
basically as you roma in first bit first

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.130 
basically as you roma in first bit first
few<00:01:49.270> coats<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.780> wood<00:01:49.900> absorbs<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.450> then<00:01:52.990> it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
few coats the wood absorbs and then it

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.370 
few coats the wood absorbs and then it
starts<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.530> build<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.610> can<00:01:54.790> see<00:01:55.000> like<00:01:55.380> as

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
starts to build and you can see like as

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.630 
starts to build and you can see like as
I<00:01:56.440> put<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.800> on<00:01:57.900> evaporate<00:01:59.400> the<00:02:00.400> solvent

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
I put it on evaporate the solvent

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.820 
I put it on evaporate the solvent
evaporates<00:02:00.940> it<00:02:01.630> goes<00:02:01.810> on<00:02:01.990> wet<00:02:02.260> and<00:02:02.290> then<00:02:02.590> very

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
evaporates it goes on wet and then very

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.640 
evaporates it goes on wet and then very
quickly<00:02:03.100> becomes<00:02:03.610> comes<00:02:04.360> dry<00:02:04.750> tomatoes<00:02:05.440> a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
quickly becomes comes dry tomatoes a

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.140 
quickly becomes comes dry tomatoes a
great<00:02:05.890> finish<00:02:06.220> for<00:02:06.250> this<00:02:06.490> because<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:07.000> means

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
great finish for this because it means

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.710 
great finish for this because it means
you<00:02:07.300> can<00:02:07.360> put<00:02:08.350> put<00:02:09.040> it<00:02:09.130> on<00:02:09.250> quite<00:02:09.550> quickly<00:02:09.820> at

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
you can put put it on quite quickly at

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:23.100 
you can put put it on quite quickly at
these<00:02:10.960> stages<00:02:11.880> building<00:02:12.880> stages<00:02:21.900> all<00:02:22.900> right

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
these stages building stages all right

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.330 
these stages building stages all right
you<00:02:23.800> can<00:02:23.950> see<00:02:24.190> it's<00:02:24.400> like<00:02:24.900> starting<00:02:25.900> to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
you can see it's like starting to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
you can see it's like starting to
starting<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.430> go<00:02:27.550> there<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.880> one<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.209> main

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
starting to go there and one of the main

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.449 
starting to go there and one of the main
reasons<00:02:37.780> why<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.440> do<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.040> way<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.280> don't

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
reasons why I do it this way I don't

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.699 
reasons why I do it this way I don't
glue<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.060> braces<00:02:40.510> on<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.930> then<00:02:41.380> French

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
glue the braces on and then French

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.770 
glue the braces on and then French
polish<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.190> which<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.459> could<00:02:42.640> do<00:02:42.850> many<00:02:43.600> people

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
polish it which I could do many people

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.570 
polish it which I could do many people
probably<00:02:44.170> say<00:02:44.440> this<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.770> totally

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
probably say this is a totally

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.640 
probably say this is a totally
long-winded<00:02:46.000> approach<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:47.230> if<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.380> look<00:02:47.530> at

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
long-winded approach but if you look at

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.550 
long-winded approach but if you look at
the<00:02:47.739> rubber<00:02:47.950> there's<00:02:48.870> all<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.080> resins<00:02:50.470> that

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the rubber there's all the resins that

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.400 
the rubber there's all the resins that
come<00:02:50.830> out<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:52.050> would<00:02:53.050> stain<00:02:53.380> the

lighter wood it would stand with this
bridge<00:02:55.800> braces<00:02:56.800> so<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.910> did<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.570> way<00:02:58.630> to

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
bridge braces so I did it this way to

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.410 
bridge braces so I did it this way to
overcome<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.660> yeah<00:03:02.040> very<00:03:03.040> long-winded

over<00:03:41.560> there<00:03:41.740> it's<00:03:42.069> going<00:03:42.310> on<00:03:42.400> how<00:03:42.819> does<00:03:42.970> it

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
over there it's going on how does it

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.940 
over there it's going on how does it
glue<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.690> science<00:03:44.290> hey<00:03:44.470> does<00:03:44.650> he<00:03:44.680> glue

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
glue it to the science hey does he glue

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.949 
glue it to the science hey does he glue
the<00:03:45.100> back<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.520> sides<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:46.120> know<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.840> little

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
the back to the sides I know a little

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.520 
the back to the sides I know a little
trick<00:03:47.260> for<00:03:47.290> that<00:03:48.870> take<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.990> French<00:03:50.200> polish

trick for that take the French polish
off<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:52.709> necessary<00:03:53.709> areas<00:03:55.770> we<00:03:56.770> get<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.040> that

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
off in necessary areas we get to that

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:08.059 
off in necessary areas we get to that
layer<00:03:57.340> maybe

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069

next point to this is to glue the back
graft<00:05:29.770> on<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.250> then<00:05:30.850> the<00:05:31.120> braces<00:05:31.540> on<00:05:31.690> go
