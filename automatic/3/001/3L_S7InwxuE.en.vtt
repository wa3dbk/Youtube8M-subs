00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
applications as well that's the quickest

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.700 
applications as well that's the quickest
way<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> Disk<00:00:33.600> Utility<00:00:33.750> if<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.530> don't

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
file new Finder window and then you will

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.590 
file new Finder window and then you will
go<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:45.050> your<00:00:46.050> actual<00:00:46.350> hard<00:00:46.890> drive<00:00:47.210> folder<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
go to your actual hard drive folder and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.900 
go to your actual hard drive folder and
go<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.020> applications<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:50.789> bit

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
go to applications it's a little bit

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.090 
go to applications it's a little bit
difficult<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> dig<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.920> get

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
difficult because you have to dig to get

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.549 
difficult because you have to dig to get
to<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.030> under<00:00:54.270> applications<00:00:54.989> you'll<00:00:55.320> go<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
to it so under applications you'll go to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.189 
to it so under applications you'll go to
utilities<00:00:56.390> I'll<00:00:57.390> show<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.870> view<00:00:58.109> just

so you can see a little bit better so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.189 
so you can see a little bit better so
went<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.280> applications<00:01:02.280> utilities<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.719> then

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
went to applications utilities and then

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.500 
went to applications utilities and then
you<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.500> search<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.710> Disk<00:01:05.640> Utility<00:01:05.820> which

that's saving on the desktop it I want

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.759 
that's saving on the desktop it I want
it<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> DVD<00:02:26.700> or<00:02:26.940> CD<00:02:27.150> master<00:02:27.959> rather<00:02:28.530> than

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
it to be a DVD or CD master rather than

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.789 
it to be a DVD or CD master rather than
a<00:02:28.799> compressed<00:02:29.450> image<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.720> will<00:02:30.900> make<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
a compressed image that will make it the

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.940 
a compressed image that will make it the
same<00:02:32.220> exact<00:02:32.700> copy<00:02:33.030> as<00:02:33.420> what<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.379> so

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
same exact copy as what it is now so

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.520 
same exact copy as what it is now so
that<00:02:35.400> will<00:02:35.599> give<00:02:36.599> me<00:02:36.720> basically<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:37.140> master

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
that will give me basically a master

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.160 
that will give me basically a master
copy<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:38.040> that's<00:02:38.250> probably<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.819> best<00:02:39.170> choice

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
copy so that's probably the best choice

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.160 
copy so that's probably the best choice
if<00:02:40.500> you're<00:02:40.920> going<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.489> use<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.879> for<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> few

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
if you're going to use this for a few

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.690 
if you're going to use this for a few
there<00:02:43.319> further<00:02:43.650> applications<00:02:44.370> where<00:02:44.610> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
there further applications where you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.119 
there further applications where you

need a master copy encryption I'm gonna

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.130 
need a master copy encryption I'm gonna
choose<00:02:47.310> none<00:02:47.609> if<00:02:48.359> you<00:02:48.480> need<00:02:48.629> to<00:02:48.720> encrypt<00:02:48.930> it

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
choose none if you need to encrypt it

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.080 
choose none if you need to encrypt it
you<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:50.040> I'm<00:02:50.129> gonna<00:02:50.250> choose<00:02:50.489> none<00:02:50.790> in

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
you can but I'm gonna choose none in

you can but I'm gonna choose none in
that<00:02:51.329> case<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.260> make<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> basic

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
that case to this just to make a basic

that case to this just to make a basic
generic<00:02:53.489> blank<00:02:54.030> copy<00:02:54.359> when<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.959> hit<00:02:55.140> save<00:02:55.379> this

generic blank copy when I hit save this

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.220 
generic blank copy when I hit save this
takes<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.220> few<00:02:56.489> seconds<00:02:57.150> because<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.109> is

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
takes a few seconds because it is

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.619 
takes a few seconds because it is
rendering<00:02:58.890> all<00:02:59.099> of<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.430> information<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.450> the

rendering all of that information to the

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.170 
rendering all of that information to the
desktop<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.590> I'm<00:03:01.769> gonna<00:03:01.859> pause<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.310> video<00:03:02.549> and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
desktop so I'm gonna pause the video and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.550 
desktop so I'm gonna pause the video and
come<00:03:03.420> back<00:03:03.569> quickly<00:03:03.629> it's<00:03:04.230> gonna<00:03:04.319> take<00:03:04.530> a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
come back quickly it's gonna take a

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.339 
come back quickly it's gonna take a
little<00:03:04.739> bit<00:03:04.980> longer<00:03:05.190> than<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.579> looks<00:03:05.760> like

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
little bit longer than it looks like

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.960
