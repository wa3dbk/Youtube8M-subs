right now it's inflated let's go through

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.979 
right now it's inflated let's go through
the<00:00:34.920> spec<00:00:35.219> shall<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> outside<00:00:36.840> of

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the raw map is a rip stop material which

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.610 
the raw map is a rip stop material which

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
means it's really hardware and so no

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.750 
means it's really hardware and so no

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
quarter an awkward situation or you know

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.110 
quarter an awkward situation or you know
an<00:00:46.260> awkward<00:00:46.590> pitch<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.399> would<00:00:47.760> definitely

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
an awkward pitch this would definitely

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360 
an awkward pitch this would definitely
be<00:00:48.210> able<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.480> cater<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.219> going

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
be able to cater for you and it's going

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.520 
be able to cater for you and it's going
to<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.520> nice<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.879> tough<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.239> durable

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
to be nice to tough and durable

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.470 
to be nice to tough and durable
obviously<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> foam<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:52.980> well<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.430> nice<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
obviously the foam as well is nice and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.360 
obviously the foam as well is nice and
thick<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.320> due<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.739> obviously<00:00:55.890> there's

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
thick just due to that obviously there's

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.970 
thick just due to that obviously there's
7.6<00:00:57.149> thickness<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
7.6 thickness that you have with it and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.369 
7.6 thickness that you have with it and
making<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.520> really<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.090> comfortable<00:01:00.570> also

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
making it really really comfortable also

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.170 
making it really really comfortable also
the<00:01:01.530> way<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.859> foam<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.640> structured<00:01:03.120> on

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the way that the foam is structured on

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.179 
the way that the foam is structured on
the<00:01:03.300> inside<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.960> traps<00:01:04.530> your<00:01:04.739> body<00:01:04.979> heat

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the inside it traps your body heat

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.770 
the inside it traps your body heat
should<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.549> say<00:01:05.729> keeping<00:01:06.420> your<00:01:06.540> core

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
should we say keeping your core

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
should we say keeping your core
temperature<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:07.860> also<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> bottom

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
temperature but then also on the bottom

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
temperature but then also on the bottom
the<00:01:09.570> bottom<00:01:09.689> part<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.530> edge<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> mat

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the bottom part of the edge of the mat

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.760 
the bottom part of the edge of the mat
itself<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.700> pushing<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> cold<00:01:13.020> air<00:01:13.260> down<00:01:13.530> you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
itself is pushing the cold air down you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
itself is pushing the cold air down you
see<00:01:13.920> that's<00:01:14.100> coming<00:01:14.490> from<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.939> ground<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
see that's coming from the ground so you

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.539 
see that's coming from the ground so you
won't<00:01:15.990> get<00:01:16.140> too<00:01:16.320> cold<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:16.920> because<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
won't get too cold but because it you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.560 
won't get too cold but because it you
know<00:01:17.640> you've<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> control

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
know you've got the control

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.749 
know you've got the control
you<00:01:19.350> won't<00:01:19.530> overheat<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.250> don't<00:01:20.400> under

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
you won't overheat and you don't under

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.999 
you won't overheat and you don't under
heat<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.119> you've<00:01:21.960> got<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:22.409> nice<00:01:22.650> flex

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
heat with it you've got really nice flex

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.859 
heat with it you've got really nice flex
padding's<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.150> side<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.479> well<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.689> it's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
padding's on the side as well so it's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.570 
padding's on the side as well so it's
going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.140> nice<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.650> comfortable<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
going to be nice and comfortable for you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.060 
going to be nice and comfortable for you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
also the work the way that the thickness

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.280 
also the work the way that the thickness
also<00:01:29.280> works<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.060> there's<00:01:30.450> any<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.990> know<00:01:31.200> if

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
also works is if there's any you know if
