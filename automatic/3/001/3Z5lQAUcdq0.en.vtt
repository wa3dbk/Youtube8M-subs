00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
think it was just 28 days of play pretty

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.980 
think it was just 28 days of play pretty
sure<00:02:43.700> they<00:02:43.820> made<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.090> add<00:02:44.270> something<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.960> it

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
sure they made you add something to it

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.930 
sure they made you add something to it
like<00:02:45.440> something<00:02:45.980> about<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.310> shoe<00:02:46.520> like<00:02:46.820> the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
like something about the shoe like the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.970 
like something about the shoe like the
shoe<00:02:47.360> number<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:48.020> at<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.350> time<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.560> think<00:02:48.860> my

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
shoe number and at the time I think my

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.590 
shoe number and at the time I think my
hashtags<00:02:49.430> were<00:02:49.580> messing<00:02:49.940> up<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:50.300> they<00:02:50.420> like

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
hashtags were messing up so they like

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.420 
hashtags were messing up so they like
wouldn't<00:02:50.930> show<00:02:51.080> up<00:02:51.230> in<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.560> feed<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:51.980> that

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
wouldn't show up in the feed of that

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.610 
wouldn't show up in the feed of that
hashtag<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.450> went<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.780> work<00:02:53.990> like<00:02:54.350> still

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
hashtag so I went to work like still

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.810 
hashtag so I went to work like still
annoyed<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.130> I'm<00:02:55.220> like<00:02:55.370> they're<00:02:55.520> never<00:02:55.700> gonna

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
annoyed and I'm like they're never gonna

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.950 
annoyed and I'm like they're never gonna
see<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.090> picture<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.600> it's<00:02:56.720> gonna<00:02:56.900> be

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
see the picture so it's gonna be

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.630 
see the picture so it's gonna be
pointless<00:02:57.350> but<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:57.830> checked<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.190> feed<00:02:58.400> and

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
pointless but I checked the feed and

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.100 
pointless but I checked the feed and
ended<00:02:58.880> up<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.090> they<00:02:59.210> were<00:02:59.270> both<00:02:59.420> there<00:02:59.720> so

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
ended up that they were both there so

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.960 
ended up that they were both there so
that<00:03:00.380> was<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.500> sigh<00:03:00.740> of<00:03:00.770> relief<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.460> I<00:03:01.640> think<00:03:01.880> it

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
that was a sigh of relief and I think it

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.990 
that was a sigh of relief and I think it
was<00:03:02.090> like<00:03:02.300> two<00:03:03.200> weeks<00:03:03.770> three<00:03:04.280> weeks<00:03:04.550> later<00:03:04.880> I

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
was like two weeks three weeks later I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.640 
was like two weeks three weeks later I
think<00:03:05.240> I<00:03:05.540> don't<00:03:05.750> remember<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.170> exact

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
think I don't remember like the exact

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.580 
think I don't remember like the exact
timeframe<00:03:06.940> but<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.240> go<00:03:08.540> on<00:03:08.660> my<00:03:08.750> Instagram<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.320> I
