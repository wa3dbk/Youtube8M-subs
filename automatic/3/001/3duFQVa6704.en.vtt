00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
doing it I had 35 of them I thought it'd

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.660 
doing it I had 35 of them I thought it'd
be<00:00:38.700> kind<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> cool<00:00:39.360> attack<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.460> that<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
be kind of a cool attack so that is a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.930 
be kind of a cool attack so that is a
very<00:00:41.969> expensive<00:00:42.270> army<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.530> 200<00:00:44.460> plus

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
very expensive army but this 200 plus

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.750 
very expensive army but this 200 plus
thousand<00:00:45.390> elixir<00:00:46.370> resource<00:00:47.370> count<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.670> this

thousand elixir resource count on this

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819 
thousand elixir resource count on this
base<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.210> definitely<00:00:49.079> going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.410> pay<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
base is definitely going to pay for that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.680 
base is definitely going to pay for that
so<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.520> too<00:00:50.579> worried<00:00:50.879> about<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.149> um<00:00:51.390> as

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
so I'm not too worried about it um as

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.049

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.760

like<00:00:54.270> two<00:00:54.809> wizards<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:55.289> now<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.559> there's<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
like two wizards right now and there's a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.080 
like two wizards right now and there's a
whole<00:00:55.980> group<00:00:56.219> over<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.640> right<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.940> need

whole group over to the right that need
healing<00:00:57.289> it's<00:00:58.289> kind<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.500> frustrating

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
healing it's kind of frustrating

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.740

sometimes<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.789> wish<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.180> supercell<00:01:00.629> would

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
sometimes I wish the supercell would

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.139 
sometimes I wish the supercell would
take<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> look<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.820> healers

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
take a look at that and that the healers

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.570 
take a look at that and that the healers
would<00:01:03.300> heal<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.719> largest<00:01:04.170> group<00:01:04.559> since<00:01:05.400> they

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
would heal the largest group since they

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.170

do is you can see the air defenses are
protected<00:03:20.150> really<00:03:20.450> well<00:03:20.600> in<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.870> center<00:03:21.170> and

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
protected really well in the center and

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.830 
protected really well in the center and
they're<00:03:22.190> both<00:03:22.310> level<00:03:22.670> for<00:03:22.850> air<00:03:23.300> defenses<00:03:23.750> from

the<00:03:23.989> look<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.350> so<00:03:25.010> I'm<00:03:25.190> gonna<00:03:25.310> have<00:03:25.459> to

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
the look of it so I'm gonna have to

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.940 
the look of it so I'm gonna have to
attack<00:03:25.970> up<00:03:26.150> here<00:03:26.330> at<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.450> top<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:27.620> try<00:03:27.890> and

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
get rid of this one air defence so that

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.910 
get rid of this one air defence so that
I<00:03:29.330> can<00:03:29.420> at<00:03:29.600> least<00:03:29.660> use<00:03:30.350> my<00:03:30.560> healers

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
I can at least use my healers

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.030 
I can at least use my healers
effectively<00:03:31.640> um<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.930> there<00:03:33.380> go<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.650> Giants

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
effectively um so there go the Giants

effectively um so there go the Giants
and<00:03:34.220> there<00:03:34.459> go<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.640> wall<00:03:34.940> breakers<00:03:35.270> as<00:03:35.390> well

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.070 
and there go the wall breakers as well
and<00:03:35.840> then<00:03:36.880> they<00:03:37.880> will<00:03:38.060> get<00:03:38.270> in<00:03:38.390> there<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.780> that

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
and then they will get in there to that

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.420 
and then they will get in there to that
air<00:03:39.380> defense<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.860> then<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.010> will<00:03:40.130> be<00:03:40.190> able<00:03:40.280> to

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
air defense and then I will be able to

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.890 
air defense and then I will be able to
drop<00:03:40.730> my<00:03:40.910> healers<00:03:41.300> as<00:03:41.480> well<00:03:42.350> as<00:03:43.390> yeah<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.570> as

you can see the clan castle on this base

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.210 
you can see the clan castle on this base
is<00:03:52.930> centralized<00:03:53.930> which<00:03:54.650> is<00:03:54.830> something<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.100> I

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
is centralized which is something that I

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.699 
is centralized which is something that I
always<00:03:55.459> talk<00:03:55.850> about<00:03:55.880> centralizing<00:03:56.600> your<00:03:57.440> clan

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
castle there's no way to draw them out

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.420 
castle there's no way to draw them out
when<00:03:59.959> it's<00:04:00.110> like<00:04:00.260> that<00:04:00.290> it's<00:04:00.620> very<00:04:00.950> very<00:04:01.190> hard

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
when it's like that it's very very hard

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.720 
when it's like that it's very very hard
to<00:04:02.030> draw<00:04:02.239> them<00:04:02.420> out<00:04:03.070> because<00:04:04.070> they<00:04:04.370> cover<00:04:04.580> the

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
to draw them out because they cover the

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.600 
to draw them out because they cover the
whole<00:04:04.910> base<00:04:05.120> in<00:04:05.450> just<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.930> base<00:04:06.110> so<00:04:06.830> if<00:04:07.340> you

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
whole base in just the base so if you

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.070

close because as you can see he's going

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.060 
close because as you can see he's going
to<00:06:33.690> shoot<00:06:33.870> in<00:06:33.990> just<00:06:34.169> a<00:06:34.229> second<00:06:34.589> and<00:06:34.620> take<00:06:34.860> out

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
to shoot in just a second and take out

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.459 
to shoot in just a second and take out
those<00:06:35.219> archers<00:06:35.690> but<00:06:36.690> the<00:06:36.779> thing<00:06:36.810> that<00:06:36.990> I<00:06:37.169> love

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
those archers but the thing that I love

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.300 
those archers but the thing that I love
about<00:06:37.529> the<00:06:37.919> witch<00:06:38.099> is<00:06:38.130> that

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
about the witch is that

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.120 
about the witch is that
um<00:06:40.300> she<00:06:40.720> does<00:06:40.900> her<00:06:41.050> own<00:06:41.200> damage<00:06:41.560> and<00:06:41.890> then<00:06:41.980> she

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
um she does her own damage and then she

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.010 
um she does her own damage and then she
sends<00:06:42.430> out<00:06:42.520> these<00:06:42.670> skeletons<00:06:43.180> that<00:06:43.450> are<00:06:43.780> an

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
sends out these skeletons that are an

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.470 
sends out these skeletons that are an
awesome<00:06:44.260> distraction<00:06:45.160> from<00:06:45.460> the<00:06:45.910> defense's

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
awesome distraction from the defense's

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.810 
awesome distraction from the defense's
if<00:06:47.140> it<00:06:47.290> wasn't<00:06:47.590> for<00:06:47.620> that<00:06:47.890> then<00:06:48.220> she<00:06:48.520> I<00:06:48.550> don't

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
if it wasn't for that then she I don't

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.220 
if it wasn't for that then she I don't
think<00:06:48.970> she<00:06:49.090> would<00:06:49.180> be<00:06:49.330> that<00:06:49.510> powerful<00:06:49.810> because

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230 
think she would be that powerful because

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.540 
think she would be that powerful because
she<00:06:50.410> doesn't<00:06:50.560> do<00:06:50.740> that<00:06:50.860> much<00:06:50.920> damage<00:06:51.100> by

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
she doesn't do that much damage by

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.550 
she doesn't do that much damage by
herself<00:06:51.880> neither<00:06:52.870> do<00:06:52.960> the<00:06:53.050> little<00:06:53.200> minion

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
herself neither do the little minion

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.370 
herself neither do the little minion
things<00:06:53.830> but<00:06:54.190> they<00:06:55.060> play<00:06:55.510> an<00:06:55.660> awesome<00:06:56.050> role<00:06:56.230> as

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380
