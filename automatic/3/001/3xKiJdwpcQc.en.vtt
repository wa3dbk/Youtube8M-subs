bells<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.199> very<00:00:25.380> small<00:00:25.679> jump<00:00:25.980> oh<00:00:26.130> no<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.609> gone

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
bells a very small jump oh no it's gone

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.429 
bells a very small jump oh no it's gone
over<00:00:26.939> there<00:00:27.089> now<00:00:27.239> so<00:00:27.749> these<00:00:27.869> are<00:00:27.929> really<00:00:28.199> kind

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
over there now so these are really kind

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.620 
over there now so these are really kind
of<00:00:28.499> cool<00:00:28.679> and<00:00:28.890> they<00:00:29.640> will<00:00:29.849> spawn<00:00:30.300> naturally

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
of cool and they will spawn naturally

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.720 
of cool and they will spawn naturally
above<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> surface<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.250> there's<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.640> that's

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
above the surface so there's one that's

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.240 
above the surface so there's one that's
spawn<00:00:33.030> naturally<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:34.260> above<00:00:34.590> ground<00:00:34.890> at

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
spawn naturally just above ground at

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.180 
spawn naturally just above ground at
daytime<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.910> they<00:00:36.870> they<00:00:37.410> will<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.770> hostile

as you saw it kind of turned red and got
hurt<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.660> he'll<00:00:57.870> immediately<00:00:58.260> teleport<00:00:58.920> away

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
hurt and he'll immediately teleport away

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.300 
hurt and he'll immediately teleport away
and<00:00:59.400> now<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> kill<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.450> it<00:01:00.600> will<00:01:00.720> drop<00:01:00.960> end

and now as you kill it it will drop end

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.490 
and now as you kill it it will drop end
eyes<00:01:02.310> know<00:01:02.880> the<00:01:03.810> things<00:01:03.990> you<00:01:04.079> through<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
eyes know the things you through I

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.870 
eyes know the things you through I
forgot<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:04.980> they're<00:01:05.100> called<00:01:05.280> ender<00:01:05.580> poets

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
forgot what they're called ender poets

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.940 
forgot what they're called ender poets
that's<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> one<00:01:06.440> they<00:01:07.440> will<00:01:07.590> drop<00:01:07.800> them

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
that's the one they will drop them

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.420 
that's the one they will drop them
rather<00:01:08.760> than<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.060> slime<00:01:09.390> ball<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.250> of<00:01:11.250> course

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
rather than a slime ball and of course

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
rather than a slime ball and of course
they'll<00:01:11.790> spit<00:01:12.090> into<00:01:12.240> cubes<00:01:12.630> smaller<00:01:13.409> cubes

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
they'll spit into cubes smaller cubes

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.280 
they'll spit into cubes smaller cubes
like<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.340> slime<00:01:14.850> will<00:01:15.120> and<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:16.050> these<00:01:16.229> guys

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
like the slime will and now these guys

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.780 
like the slime will and now these guys
are<00:01:16.500> probably<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:17.010> most<00:01:17.159> common<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.700> it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
are probably the most common because it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.090 
are probably the most common because it
seems<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.060> spawning<00:01:18.360> quite<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.690> lot<00:01:18.979> now<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
seems to be spawning quite a lot now the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.670 
seems to be spawning quite a lot now the
next<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.400> we've<00:01:20.580> got<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.940> the<00:01:21.570> zelfs<00:01:21.990> now<00:01:22.620> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
next one we've got is the zelfs now the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.100 
next one we've got is the zelfs now the
resolve<00:01:23.070> should<00:01:23.970> burn<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.240> daylight<00:01:24.780> there

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
resolve should burn and daylight there

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.310 
resolve should burn and daylight there
we<00:01:25.229> go<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.800> cue<00:01:26.310> perfectly<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.870> should<00:01:28.140> be

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
we go on cue perfectly and you should be

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.140 
we go on cue perfectly and you should be
able<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.560> tame<00:01:28.680> them<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:28.979> rotten<00:01:29.250> flesh<00:01:29.460> but

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
able to tame them with rotten flesh but

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.539 
able to tame them with rotten flesh but
I<00:01:30.210> found<00:01:30.690> that<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.320> doesn't<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:31.890> work<00:01:32.190> for

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
I found that it doesn't really work for

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.700 
I found that it doesn't really work for
some<00:01:33.210> reason<00:01:33.540> I'm<00:01:33.630> not<00:01:33.659> too<00:01:34.080> sure<00:01:34.260> why<00:01:34.440> where

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
some reason I'm not too sure why where

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.030 
some reason I'm not too sure why where

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
is my own flesh there it is where did he

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.270 
is my own flesh there it is where did he
go<00:01:38.630> always<00:01:39.630> died<00:01:39.840> okay<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:40.830> we<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:40.950> try<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
