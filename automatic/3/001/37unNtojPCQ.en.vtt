 request Alina Yusupova 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.190
 the video will be about what kind of masks I 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.040
 I use for the shaft of the skin of my face 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.070
 problem areas of the skin helps me 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.180
 soda here you can crack soda with 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.900
 some warm water and apply a dot on 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.710
 these sites leave for a while and then 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.790
 wash well and here cleans and black points 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.180
 can wash 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.089
 face skin leave it for some 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.010
 time and flush away but black dots pass 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.920
 the skin is laid out smoothes out 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:06.110
 it becomes soft like that 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.840
 soda helps with fat soda need 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.080
 add bathroom 200 water should 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.270
 exceed no more than 40 degrees water 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.909
 but must be typed so that when 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.750
 you sat down she was on the chest and not to 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.500
 hurt your heart here you can sit 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:29.290
 there about twenty minutes vylazim 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:32.420
 wash off all this and move on 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:37.030
 do your own business recipe for cleansing 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.150
 then we spent on the chin and nose 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.240
 here it is required 05 tsp gelatin 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.460
 half a tablet of activated carbon and 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.460
 about 1 teaspoon of milk 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.950
 but if anyone has no milk can water but 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.430
 I think everyone has milk for 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.580
 of this 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.380
 pill grind then add there 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.670
 gelatin mix everything well 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.350
 add water or milk and carefully 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.540
 stir well, nothing dissolves but 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.119
 we are not waiting for the microwave itself 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.379
 we wait for 15 seconds while it is 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:17.720
 flame hot and put a mask on the skin 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:19.010
 after a hot bath when 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.630
 inflamed 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.870
 when can it 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.960
 when a mask can fit 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.900
 you can take a hard depth 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.300
 brush and hard brush to drive in all 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.030
 it is like this then apply with another 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.420
 layer on top are already learning two layers are waiting 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.950
 until it dries to the end 15 somewhere 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:48.420
 maybe ten minutes and we are trying to shoot 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:53.160
 not mother film one-piece that's all 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:57.090
 remains on this film to clean well 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.820
 so far and in spite of all purchased masks and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.890
 in the same number 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.430
 stripes after the procedure must be applied 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:11.520
 moisturizing cream and 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:16.370
 Khalid happy by the way here I bought here 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:20.490
 here is oriflame hair oil 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.880
 I also like very much you can lubricate 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.030
 hair tips minutes a few minutes 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.620
 hold and rinse with water it feeds 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:37.680
 hair does not settle in the village 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:42.810
 okay well-groomed slender here here 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:47.840
 Here is the oil does not know will not be seen 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:51.930
 you can see this oil is suitable especially for those 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:55.260
 whom the hair is painted for example to me i 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.870
 I use hair mask 1 she 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.990
 mustard and she to me is actually very 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.090
 good help for that you need to take 2 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.780
 tablespoons of mustard powder 2 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.450
 tablespoons of any oil can oil 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.110
 be and vegetative or any other 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.260
 cosmetic oil 2 tablespoons 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.299
 granulated sugar and one chicken yolk 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.359
 eggs 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:24.840
 all this is mixed and applied to the roots 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.130
 hair we wrap it all up or cap 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.110
 some kind for swimming 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.530
 either a cellophane package or else 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.170
 something that's waiting for about 30 minutes if you 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.310
 overdone with sugar and then either you 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:43.090
 delicate skin the mask can be very baked 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.930
 you do not think to endure there or something else 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.160
 it is better not to endure a meeting once 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.680
 overdo the sugar and rinse with warm 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.550
 water then both desirable 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.120
 refuse to blow-dry hair 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.790
 because hair is so using mustard 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.180
 dry from the dryer it is generally pipets will 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.000
 I by the way hair a hair dryer at all I do not dry it 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.610
 it happens very rarely in winter it even in winter 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.770
 not always for the first time for mustard 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.060
 masks can use only one 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:20.550
 tablespoon of sugar more precisely its powder 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:24.910
 But who wants it like that 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:29.310
 enhances the whole process and the skin can 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:32.860
 a little more burn well I always later 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.740
 the main process so we mix everything 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.500
 ingredients add water water about 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.930
 two tablespoons need it all good 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.570
 mix thoroughly and mustard mask 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.840
 about one oily hair is done 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.180
 once every five days for normal hair 1 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.370
 once in 7 days predatory mask for dry 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.760
 hair is approximately done once every 10 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.860
 days here I can not say because 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.350
 did not know because she read it in 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.580
 on the internet but in principle since there was 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.680
 written and there was still on the Internet 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.140
 It is written that this mask is made in 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.640
 one month is best 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:15.640
 month to wait the usual masked straight 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.000
 I do not use such for hair 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:22.060
 so if you have any advice 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.850
 me than what smear can 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.950
 on the hair on the face and in general on the other 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.610
 body parts are sure to share with 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.490
 me by them 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.230
 it will be very interesting for everyone here
