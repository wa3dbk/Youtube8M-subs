00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
guys my thinks is not a big deal but it

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.910 
guys my thinks is not a big deal but it
is<00:00:53.699> back<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> day<00:00:54.480> when<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.440> first<00:00:55.649> started

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
is back in the day when I first started

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.069 
is back in the day when I first started
doing<00:00:56.129> giant<00:00:56.670> healer<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> really

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
doing giant healer it was a really

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.049 
doing giant healer it was a really
incredible<00:00:58.230> strategy<00:00:58.920> because<00:00:59.129> no<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.760> had

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
incredible strategy because no one had

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.389 
incredible strategy because no one had
those<00:01:00.390> black<00:01:00.870> seeking<00:01:01.469> air<00:01:01.680> mines<00:01:01.859> at<00:01:02.039> all

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
those black seeking air mines at all

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.579 
those black seeking air mines at all
because<00:01:02.850> back<00:01:03.359> then<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.690> cost<00:01:03.960> dark<00:01:04.320> elixir

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
because back then they cost dark elixir

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.560 
because back then they cost dark elixir
so<00:01:05.129> nobody<00:01:05.369> used<00:01:05.519> him<00:01:05.729> who<00:01:05.970> would<00:01:06.150> use<00:01:06.330> them<00:01:06.450> i

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
so nobody used him who would use them i

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.359 
so nobody used him who would use them i
mean<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.900> was<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.080> 600<00:01:07.650> dark<00:01:07.860> elixir<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> buy

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
mean it was like 600 dark elixir to buy

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.310 
mean it was like 600 dark elixir to buy
those<00:01:08.549> things<00:01:08.580> no<00:01:09.270> one<00:01:09.420> use<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.810> then

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
those things no one use it and then

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.280 
those things no one use it and then
traps<00:01:10.830> got<00:01:11.040> changed<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> gold<00:01:12.240> only<00:01:12.510> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
traps got changed to gold only so

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.929 
traps got changed to gold only so
everyone<00:01:13.740> started<00:01:14.010> using<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.520> could<00:01:14.670> raid<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
everyone started using you could raid a

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.760 
everyone started using you could raid a
town<00:01:15.270> hall<00:01:15.420> 7<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.990> they'd<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.590> thing

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
town hall 7 and they'd have that thing

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.030 
town hall 7 and they'd have that thing
and<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.479> changed<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.320> lot<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.830> I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and you know it changed it a lot but I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.520 
and you know it changed it a lot but I
think<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.210> would<00:01:21.450> bring<00:01:21.750> back<00:01:21.960> giant<00:01:22.290> healer

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
think this would bring back giant healer

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.200 
think this would bring back giant healer
a<00:01:22.560> little<00:01:22.799> bit<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.610> think<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> very

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
a little bit and I think it's a very

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.539 
a little bit and I think it's a very
welcome<00:01:24.869> addition<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.070> know<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.369> don't

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549

release<00:04:41.620> something<00:04:42.040> that's<00:04:42.340> not<00:04:42.490> supposed<00:04:42.550> to

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
release something that's not supposed to

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.990 
release something that's not supposed to
be<00:04:42.970> released<00:04:43.919> like<00:04:44.919> a<00:04:44.950> day<00:04:45.190> or<00:04:45.310> two<00:04:45.430> before<00:04:45.610> I

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
be released like a day or two before I

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.400 
be released like a day or two before I
just<00:04:46.210> don't<00:04:46.389> get<00:04:46.540> it<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:47.020> course<00:04:47.260> it's

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
just don't get it of course it's

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.320 
just don't get it of course it's
possible<00:04:47.880> so<00:04:48.880> I<00:04:49.180> think<00:04:49.270> it's<00:04:49.540> either

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
possible so I think it's either

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.320 
possible so I think it's either
intentional<00:04:52.330> or<00:04:53.700> fake<00:04:54.700> I<00:04:54.910> don't<00:04:55.060> think<00:04:55.210> it<00:04:55.270> was

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
intentional or fake I don't think it was

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.909 
intentional or fake I don't think it was
just<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.570> mistake<00:04:55.690> I<00:04:56.320> don't<00:04:56.500> think<00:04:56.680> they<00:04:56.770> just

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
just a mistake I don't think they just

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.130 
just a mistake I don't think they just
mistakenly<00:04:57.550> put<00:04:57.790> this<00:04:57.910> up<00:04:58.150> on<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.450> App<00:04:59.110> Store
