later<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.480> essentially<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.320> just

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
later but essentially this is just

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.979 
later but essentially this is just
fantastic<00:00:52.739> AoE<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
fantastic AoE like if you just have a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.869 
fantastic AoE like if you just have a
whole<00:00:55.170> bunch<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.980> everything

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
whole bunch of that like that everything

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.080 
whole bunch of that like that everything
is<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.480> hit<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.870> very<00:00:58.199> very<00:00:58.559> good

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
is going to be hit it's very very good

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.910 
is going to be hit it's very very good
and<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.180> use<00:01:00.300> vault<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.719> tumble<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.770> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and I use vault with tumble this is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.770 
and I use vault with tumble this is
essentially<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.609> tumble<00:01:03.239> means<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> can

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
essentially because tumble means you can

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.390 
essentially because tumble means you can
use<00:01:04.309> repeated<00:01:05.309> vaults<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.479> lot<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:08.250> you're

really in a sticky situation you should
be<00:01:09.930> fine<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.470> bolt<00:01:10.920> itself<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.520> just

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
be fine and bolt itself is just

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.550 
be fine and bolt itself is just

actually<00:03:21.060> he's<00:03:21.210> pretty<00:03:21.360> good<00:03:21.600> commentator<00:03:22.020> so

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
actually he's pretty good commentator so

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.290 
actually he's pretty good commentator so
I'll<00:03:23.070> link<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.670> description<00:03:23.790> for

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
I'll link that in the description for

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.290 
I'll link that in the description for
the<00:03:24.450> video<00:03:25.430> yes<00:03:26.430> then<00:03:26.640> also<00:03:26.850> in<00:03:27.030> terms<00:03:27.060> of

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
the video yes then also in terms of

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.940 
the video yes then also in terms of
gearing<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.260> haven't<00:03:28.500> been<00:03:28.620> able<00:03:28.710> to<00:03:28.830> do

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
gearing and I haven't been able to do

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.500 
gearing and I haven't been able to do
this<00:03:29.070> yet<00:03:29.310> because<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.790> drops<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.210> I've<00:03:30.300> got

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
this yet because the drops that I've got

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.620 
this yet because the drops that I've got
but<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.870> ideally<00:03:31.740> want<00:03:31.770> to<00:03:32.130> go<00:03:32.280> for<00:03:32.670> anything

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
but you ideally want to go for anything

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.270 
but you ideally want to go for anything
that<00:03:33.900> increases<00:03:34.440> your<00:03:34.470> percentage<00:03:35.010> fire

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
that increases your percentage fire

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.630 
that increases your percentage fire
damage<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:36.840> course<00:03:37.140> with<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.770> chakram<00:03:38.310> and

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
damage of course with the chakram and

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.790 
damage of course with the chakram and
the<00:03:38.820> entirely<00:03:39.120> shot<00:03:39.510> doing<00:03:39.720> fire<00:03:39.930> damage<00:03:40.380> that

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
the entirely shot doing fire damage that

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.040 
the entirely shot doing fire damage that
is<00:03:41.010> very<00:03:41.250> nice<00:03:42.860> alright<00:03:43.860> so<00:03:44.040> let's<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:45.050> look

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
is very nice alright so let's just look

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.320 
is very nice alright so let's just look
these<00:03:46.260> guys<00:03:46.500> down<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:47.880> just<00:03:47.940> want<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.180> keep

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
these guys down you just want to keep

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.180 
these guys down you just want to keep
everything<00:03:48.600> slowed<00:03:49.020> stay<00:03:49.500> we<00:03:49.620> have<00:03:49.740> 20<00:03:49.980> yards

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
everything slowed stay we have 20 yards

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.030 
everything slowed stay we have 20 yards
away<00:03:50.280> from<00:03:50.430> them<00:03:50.850> or<00:03:51.840> 10<00:03:52.080> yards<00:03:52.380> away<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:52.950> you

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
away from them or 10 yards away so you

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.370 
away from them or 10 yards away so you
can<00:03:53.130> get<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:54.180> know<00:03:54.300> benefit<00:03:54.750> from<00:03:54.930> all<00:03:55.110> that

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
can get a you know benefit from all that

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.310 
can get a you know benefit from all that
increased<00:03:55.830> damage<00:03:56.010> from<00:03:56.280> our<00:03:56.400> passives<00:03:56.880> and

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
increased damage from our passives and

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.960 
increased damage from our passives and
overall<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.500> can<00:03:58.770> really<00:03:59.370> do<00:03:59.490> work<00:03:59.700> with<00:03:59.880> this

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
overall you can really do work with this

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.270 
overall you can really do work with this
build<00:04:00.240> in<00:04:00.480> terms<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.560> actual<00:04:01.800> difficulty

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
build in terms of the actual difficulty

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.770 
build in terms of the actual difficulty
level<00:04:02.520> that<00:04:02.640> I'm<00:04:02.760> used<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.150> month<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.540> minute

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
level that I'm used a month the minute

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.930 
level that I'm used a month the minute
it's<00:04:03.900> storm<00:04:04.110> at<00:04:04.230> 1<00:04:04.440> I<00:04:04.680> can<00:04:05.010> do<00:04:05.160> torment<00:04:05.520> 2<00:04:05.730> but

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
it's storm at 1 I can do torment 2 but

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.730 
it's storm at 1 I can do torment 2 but
just<00:04:06.120> for<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.300> sake<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:07.170> video<00:04:07.470> being<00:04:07.680> a

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
just for the sake of this video being a

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.200 
just for the sake of this video being a
little<00:04:07.950> bit<00:04:08.040> easier<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.370> make<00:04:08.640> I'm<00:04:08.820> dropped<00:04:09.090> a

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
little bit easier to make I'm dropped a

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.210 
little bit easier to make I'm dropped a
time<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.480> torment<00:04:09.750> one<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.740> only<00:04:10.920> problem

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
time to torment one the only problem

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.440 
time to torment one the only problem
that<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.370> saw<00:04:11.580> on<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.730> side<00:04:11.850> with<00:04:11.970> torment<00:04:12.270> -

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
that I saw on the side with torment -

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.940 
that I saw on the side with torment -
and<00:04:12.660> it's<00:04:12.780> really<00:04:13.020> just<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.260> gear<00:04:13.470> thing<00:04:13.680> is

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
and it's really just the gear thing is

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.400 
and it's really just the gear thing is
that<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.790> can<00:04:15.030> be<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> little<00:04:15.390> bit<00:04:15.630> tricky<00:04:16.049> to

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
that it can be a little bit tricky to

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.349 
that it can be a little bit tricky to
meet<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:17.010> enrage<00:04:17.310> timers<00:04:17.760> on<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.910> few<00:04:18.150> bosses

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
meet the enrage timers on a few bosses

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.280 
meet the enrage timers on a few bosses
but<00:04:19.260> like<00:04:20.010> when<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.190> focus<00:04:20.460> I<00:04:20.700> can<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.419> overall

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
but like when I focus I can so overall

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.110 
but like when I focus I can so overall
it's<00:04:22.500> pretty<00:04:22.620> good<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.610> let's<00:04:23.940> just<00:04:24.060> use

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
it's pretty good and let's just use

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.430 
it's pretty good and let's just use
vengeance<00:04:24.600> for<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.810> fun<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.110> because<00:04:25.200> for

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
vengeance for the fun of it because for

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.339 
vengeance for the fun of it because for
some<00:04:25.560> reason<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.890> forgot

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
some reason I forgot

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.680 
some reason I forgot
it's<00:04:28.349> one<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.680> things<00:04:28.889> about<00:04:29.009> doing<00:04:29.310> the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
it's one of the things about doing the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.029 
it's one of the things about doing the
your<00:04:30.690> YouTube<00:04:31.050> commentary<00:04:31.500> it's<00:04:31.710> kind<00:04:31.949> of

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
your YouTube commentary it's kind of

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.760 
your YouTube commentary it's kind of
hard<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.060> stay<00:04:33.330> your<00:04:33.690> full<00:04:33.930> mental<00:04:34.289> capacity

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
hard to stay your full mental capacity

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.620 
hard to stay your full mental capacity
but<00:04:34.919> anyway<00:04:35.220> this<00:04:35.639> is<00:04:35.699> essentially<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.449> build

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
but anyway this is essentially the build

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.570 
but anyway this is essentially the build
you<00:04:37.110> do<00:04:37.319> a<00:04:37.349> lot<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:37.620> kiting<00:04:38.069> you<00:04:38.190> do<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.340> lot<00:04:38.550> of

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
you do a lot of kiting you do a lot of

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.610 
you do a lot of kiting you do a lot of
slowing<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.479> try<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.810> keep<00:04:40.020> yourself<00:04:40.349> 20

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
slowing you try to keep yourself 20

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.279 
slowing you try to keep yourself 20
yards<00:04:40.860> away<00:04:40.949> from<00:04:41.039> everything<00:04:41.639> and<00:04:42.289> you

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
yards away from everything and you

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.939 
yards away from everything and you
should<00:04:43.590> just<00:04:44.009> aver<00:04:44.490> II<00:04:44.520> well<00:04:44.759> I<00:04:45.710> think<00:04:46.710> another

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
should just aver II well I think another

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.189 
should just aver II well I think another
thing<00:04:47.069> a<00:04:47.220> few<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.729> my<00:04:47.759> abilities<00:04:48.509> and<00:04:48.690> just

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
thing a few of my abilities and just

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.050 
thing a few of my abilities and just
start<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.530> give<00:04:49.650> me<00:04:49.830> decent<00:04:50.160> life<00:04:50.280> on<00:04:50.490> hits<00:04:50.759> so

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
start to give me decent life on hits so

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.480 
start to give me decent life on hits so
those<00:04:52.050> times<00:04:52.410> when<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:52.830> are<00:04:52.860> faced<00:04:53.190> by<00:04:53.370> an
