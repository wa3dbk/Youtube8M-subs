except<00:00:49.940> for<00:00:49.970> Microsoft<00:00:50.600> Paint<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.739> in<00:00:51.890> this

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
except for Microsoft Paint so in this

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.030 
except for Microsoft Paint so in this
situation<00:00:53.050> to<00:00:54.050> make<00:00:54.079> things<00:00:54.440> easier<00:00:54.800> just

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
situation to make things easier just

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.670 
situation to make things easier just
going<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.340> get<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:56.170> goodness<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.290> welcome<00:00:57.590> the

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
going to get the goodness to welcome the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.819 
going to get the goodness to welcome the
magic<00:00:58.040> wand<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.870> your<00:00:59.870> tolerance<00:01:00.440> is<00:01:00.590> going

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
magic wand and your tolerance is going

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.950 
magic wand and your tolerance is going
to<00:01:00.920> be<00:01:01.040> 50<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:01.700> you<00:01:01.730> just<00:01:01.969> minimize<00:01:02.600> it<00:01:02.629> all<00:01:02.840> the

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
to be 50 so you just minimize it all the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.620 
to be 50 so you just minimize it all the
way<00:01:03.050> to<00:01:03.110> zero<00:01:03.379> and<00:01:03.649> in<00:01:04.369> flood<00:01:04.789> mode<00:01:05.059> make<00:01:05.389> it<00:01:05.509> to

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
way to zero and in flood mode make it to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.620 
way to zero and in flood mode make it to
global<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.159> there<00:01:07.399> so<00:01:07.999> then<00:01:08.149> just<00:01:08.270> select<00:01:08.569> the

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
global so there so then just select the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.080 
global so there so then just select the
white<00:01:08.899> and<00:01:09.200> then<00:01:09.709> obviously<00:01:10.069> race<00:01:10.609> it<00:01:10.789> I<00:01:10.880> guess

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
white and then obviously race it I guess

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.719 
white and then obviously race it I guess
so<00:01:12.079> now<00:01:12.229> what<00:01:12.469> you're<00:01:12.590> going<00:01:12.679> to<00:01:12.740> do<00:01:12.889> is<00:01:13.100> i'm<00:01:13.310> i

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
so now what you're going to do is i'm i

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.109 
so now what you're going to do is i'm i
guessed<00:01:14.479> zoom<00:01:14.990> in<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.520> then<00:01:16.520> uh<00:01:19.119> Microsoft

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
guessed zoom in and then uh Microsoft

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.410 
guessed zoom in and then uh Microsoft
Paint<00:01:20.569> there's<00:01:21.409> going<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.619> be<00:01:21.709> a<00:01:22.420> selection

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
Paint there's going to be a selection

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.809 
Paint there's going to be a selection
tool<00:01:23.569> right<00:01:23.899> but<00:01:24.889> you<00:01:25.039> can't<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.549> can't

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
tool right but you can't you can't

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.760 
tool right but you can't you can't
select<00:01:26.270> more<00:01:26.539> than<00:01:26.600> once<00:01:26.959> at<00:01:27.139> the<00:01:27.200> same<00:01:27.439> time

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
select more than once at the same time

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.849 
select more than once at the same time
so<00:01:28.609> paint.net<00:01:29.209> is<00:01:29.659> way<00:01:29.840> better<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:30.770> what

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
so paint.net is way better so what

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:31.899 
so paint.net is way better so what
you're<00:01:30.979> going<00:01:31.069> to<00:01:31.130> do<00:01:31.219> is<00:01:31.310> go<00:01:31.459> to<00:01:31.490> selection

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
you're going to do is go to selection

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.029 
you're going to do is go to selection
mode<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.509> then<00:01:33.229> right<00:01:33.380> here<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.920> little

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
mode and then right here the little

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.459 
mode and then right here the little
selection<00:01:34.549> to<00:01:34.789> whatever<00:01:35.149> instead<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.079> replace

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
selection to whatever instead of replace

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.160 
selection to whatever instead of replace
put<00:01:37.219> add<00:01:37.399> onion<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.090> that's<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.810> way<00:01:38.959> it<00:01:39.079> will

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
put add onion and that's the way it will

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.139 
put add onion and that's the way it will
be<00:01:39.259> double<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.429> what<00:01:40.549> you're<00:01:40.700> going<00:01:40.789> to<00:01:40.849> do<00:01:40.969> is

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
be double so what you're going to do is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.520 
be double so what you're going to do is
remove<00:01:41.779> the<00:01:42.049> head

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530

I'll make this quick as possible so I'm
going<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.780> pause<00:02:40.900> Mike<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.560> make<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.830> pallets

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.929 

all<00:02:44.860> right<00:02:45.040> man<00:02:45.280> I'm<00:02:45.549> back<00:02:46.000> up<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.610> just<00:02:48.610> delete

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
all right man I'm back up so just delete

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.210 
all right man I'm back up so just delete
the<00:02:49.090> head<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:50.379> I<00:02:50.439> want<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.680> teach<00:02:50.799> you<00:02:51.010> how<00:02:51.040> to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the head and I want to teach you how to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.640 
the head and I want to teach you how to
make<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.400> basic<00:02:51.730> head<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.390> mean<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.930> simple<00:02:53.290> head

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
make a basic head I mean a simple head

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.850 
make a basic head I mean a simple head
it's<00:02:53.890> not<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.250> hard<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.549> make<00:02:54.640> your<00:02:54.909> own<00:02:55.180> head

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
it's not that hard to make your own head

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.490 
it's not that hard to make your own head
so<00:02:56.860> what<00:02:56.980> you're<00:02:57.099> gonna<00:02:57.189> do<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.640> get<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.500> color

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
so what you're gonna do is get the color

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.839 
so what you're gonna do is get the color
drop<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.099> guess<00:03:00.280> what<00:03:00.459> that's<00:03:00.549> what<00:03:00.730> it's

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
drop I guess what that's what it's

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.899 
drop I guess what that's what it's
called<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.810> like<00:03:02.200> get<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.010> color<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:03.640> color

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
called the like get the color this color

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.630 
called the like get the color this color
right<00:03:04.180> here<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:05.170> then<00:03:05.349> get<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.040> pencil<00:03:06.459> and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
right here and then get the pencil and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.130 
right here and then get the pencil and
just<00:03:06.879> make<00:03:07.120> two<00:03:07.390> pixels

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
just make two pixels

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.050 
just make two pixels
I<00:03:08.230> mean<00:03:09.099> doughnut<00:03:09.519> zoom<00:03:09.640> in<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.819> little<00:03:09.940> bit

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
I mean doughnut zoom in a little bit

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.180 
I mean doughnut zoom in a little bit
more<00:03:10.530> all<00:03:11.530> right<00:03:11.680> that's<00:03:11.829> good

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
more all right that's good

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.970 
more all right that's good
two<00:03:12.609> pixels<00:03:13.170> after<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.260> make<00:03:14.379> two<00:03:14.530> pixels

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
two pixels after you make two pixels

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.500 
two pixels after you make two pixels
you're<00:03:15.129> going<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.310> get<00:03:15.400> some<00:03:15.579> brown<00:03:15.849> outline

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
you're going to get some brown outline

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.920 
you're going to get some brown outline
tool<00:03:17.079> and<00:03:17.640> just<00:03:18.640> start<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.239> from<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.510> first

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
tool and just start it from the first

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.479 
tool and just start it from the first
pixel<00:03:20.379> I'll<00:03:20.560> be<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.739> front<00:03:20.950> well<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:21.310> is<00:03:21.459> a

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
pixel I'll be in front well this is a

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.220 
pixel I'll be in front well this is a
first<00:03:21.700> pixel<00:03:22.120> right<00:03:22.209> here<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:23.019> is<00:03:23.139> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
first pixel right here this is the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.050 
first pixel right here this is the
second<00:03:23.620> pixel<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:24.579> right<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:24.849> know<00:03:24.940> the

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
second pixel so right you know the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.180 
second pixel so right you know the
second<00:03:25.389> pixel<00:03:25.540> put<00:03:25.840> one<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.290> then<00:03:26.950> just

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
second pixel put one and then just

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.839 
second pixel put one and then just
follow<00:03:27.370> my<00:03:27.609> lead

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
follow my lead

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.420 
follow my lead
or<00:03:28.090> yeah<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:29.349> you<00:03:29.409> just<00:03:29.560> going<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.769> draw<00:03:29.980> with

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
or yeah so you just going to draw with

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.450 
or yeah so you just going to draw with
that

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.300 

[Music]

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
[Music]

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.920 
[Music]
you<00:03:36.849> know<00:03:36.940> doesn't<00:03:37.360> really<00:03:37.390> have<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.840> be

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
you know doesn't really have to be

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.870 
you know doesn't really have to be
perfect<00:03:38.470> but<00:03:38.709> yet<00:03:39.099> again<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.430> has<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.730> be<00:03:39.849> a

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
perfect but yet again it has to be a

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.559 
perfect but yet again it has to be a
cool<00:03:40.150> one

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
cool one

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.990 
cool one
so<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.500> just<00:03:41.739> start<00:03:42.130> making<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.489> little<00:03:42.640> the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
so I just start making a little the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.070 
so I just start making a little the
little<00:03:43.239> mouth<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.870> guess<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:47.349> then<00:03:48.130> um<00:03:49.080> so

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
little mouth I guess and then um so

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.110 
little mouth I guess and then um so
that's<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.530> outline<00:03:50.709> of<00:03:50.920> amount<00:03:51.310> above<00:03:52.060> a

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
that's the outline of amount above a

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.920 
that's the outline of amount above a
lower<00:03:52.840> hat<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.650> guess<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.190> don't<00:03:54.250> let's<00:03:54.519> call<00:03:54.930> so

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
lower hat I guess I don't let's call so

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.150 
lower hat I guess I don't let's call so
now<00:03:56.019> what<00:03:56.140> you're<00:03:56.230> going<00:03:56.349> to<00:03:56.380> do<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.620> copy<00:03:56.860> the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
now what you're going to do is copy the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.750 
now what you're going to do is copy the
lightest<00:03:57.489> color<00:03:57.550> oh<00:04:01.019> sorry<00:04:02.019> yeah<00:04:02.890> but<00:04:03.489> after

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
lightest color oh sorry yeah but after

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.670 
lightest color oh sorry yeah but after
you're<00:04:04.120> done<00:04:04.330> with<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.900> magic<00:04:05.290> wand<00:04:05.590> and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
you're done with the magic wand and

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.680 
you're done with the magic wand and
taking<00:04:06.010> off<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.250> background<00:04:06.459> don't<00:04:07.330> forget

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
taking off the background don't forget

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.960 
taking off the background don't forget
to<00:04:07.870> change<00:04:08.170> flood<00:04:08.590> mode<00:04:08.769> back<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.069> continuous

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
to change flood mode back to continuous

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.570 
to change flood mode back to continuous
because<00:04:10.360> then<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:11.260> thing<00:04:11.920> will<00:04:12.040> happen<00:04:12.370> just

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
because then that thing will happen just

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.469 
because then that thing will happen just
color<00:04:13.390> in<00:04:13.600> that<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.830> then<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.850> shading<00:04:16.269> part

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
color in that and then the shading part

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.289 
color in that and then the shading part
at<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.750> middle<00:04:17.049> shade<00:04:17.700> you're<00:04:18.700> going<00:04:18.850> to<00:04:18.910> just

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
at the middle shade you're going to just

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.599 
at the middle shade you're going to just
shade<00:04:20.229> what<00:04:20.530> however<00:04:20.859> you<00:04:21.010> want<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.250> shade<00:04:21.459> it
