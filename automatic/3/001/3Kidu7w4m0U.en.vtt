through this and I don't have to care
about<00:04:52.880> what<00:04:53.240> he<00:04:53.389> says<00:04:54.759> that's<00:04:55.759> really<00:04:56.150> it

it's just now not not happening at all I
think<00:05:02.720> here<00:05:03.080> shouldn't<00:05:03.289> be<00:05:03.409> a<00:05:03.440> deal<00:05:03.620> breaker

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
think here shouldn't be a deal breaker

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.820 
think here shouldn't be a deal breaker
but<00:05:05.240> like<00:05:05.389> I<00:05:05.419> said<00:05:05.569> if<00:05:06.020> you<00:05:06.050> are<00:05:06.289> going<00:05:06.620> through

that process maybe they will try and

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.219
