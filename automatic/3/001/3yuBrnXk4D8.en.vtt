 of what it is that daddy such though not 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.399
 you can record a lot you can not record 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.559
 practically nothing but yes more or less 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.870
 signs as it was or is very little already 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.570
 I say practically nothing but something 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.739
 something something I have recorded and well then that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.890
 for also in that event of me 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.150
 you said names for the blonde 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.100
 that is a lot of things and well there 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.350
 so many so many 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 comments of names that are not 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.710
 can choose 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.360
 in fact evidently in each one has 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.369
 said a different name there are some that 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.810
 they agree but there are some that have 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.690
 more positive votes than others but of course 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.670
 that is, you do not know, I do not know which one to choose 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.180
 I'm super hesitant I'm super super 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.330
 super indecisive and it only occurs to me 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.470
 do a survey choose the names 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.540
 that I liked the most 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.820
 said you and comment on the vote 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.990
 so in the description you have a link 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.030
 that will take you to our pool 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.070
 that you already know is from surveys and 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.320
 Well then click on the one that most 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.060
 like and you will see then your vote or 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.770
 you go to the web that is the name 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.500
 that you like and that's it 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.820
 it is already in any case of all 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.830
 forms well put an option that is 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.000
 others are worth it if I see that option of 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.590
 others have more votes than any 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.140
 another name that we have put then 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.640
 then we will do today let's say that another 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.200
 selection by day by video by 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.060
 descriptions and such a little bit 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.250
 different but good guys what what 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.450
 I wanted to comment is that is that down 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.819
 you have 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.190
 the link to the surveys so that 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.080
 vote the one that you like the name that 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.180
 more like it and such because the truth that 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.400
 is that very many there are many and good 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.410
 those who are cooler or those who go are cool 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.730
 to me are the ones that I'm going to put I imagine 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.690
 I want overlayed but not right now 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.430
 I'm doing and still has not put 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.989
 but already the book enough comments and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.910
 I already know more or less the idea of what 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.349
 I have one of the names and such but 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.599
 that I'm going to leave below for you to vote 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.830
 digital and good then the hies finally 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.480
 name the motorcycle because until 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.220
 let's choose name can not use it 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.510
 I shit in milk so guys 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.250
 basically tell you about that to 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.019
 remember them go to the slopes vote 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.819
 that you do not forget, but yes 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.140
 you vote obviously then then no no 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.910
 we will not know what name the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.799
 motorcycle then it does not make much sense 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.239
 then guys apart from all that 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.500
 I wanted with the treatment of the event that 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.150
 I already told you but I wanted to comment 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.860
 an element not the one left is that it was and 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.989
 so it was so much of the hand if he turned a 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.760
 event that is us we expected that 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.560
 they were a lot less people but it 's that 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.239
 I mean and it was amazing guys was 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.620
 amazing thank you all 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.930
 that you are out there so many times 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.689
 everyone who gave us gifts 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.650
 that is, it was bestial, photos, signatures 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.510
 autographs 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.799
 everything will be put in the video that 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.930
 make tomorrow everything the photos that 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.829
 we did and everything so if any one that 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.180
 is watching the video was in the 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.590
 stayed and still has not sent the photo 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.879
 send me on twitter twitter 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.989
 is under the description because I am 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.340
 Seeing all the photos by twitter 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.650
 to put something in the video worth of 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.239
 tomorrow so basically it 's those 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.549
 guys comment on the subject of the survey 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.349
 that you do not forget the topic of the 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.359
 that was bestial, the safest thing is 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.579
 that we do later since given 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.859
 but already more organized because what not 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.939
 he has done it practically and he dares 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.169
 we need to have had a 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.430
 organization a little better the truth 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.540
 because they did outside before and I moved to 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.829
 sea ​​we do not think it will win sun 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.389
 free then can not hands and good 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.829
 good plan because there is no organization or 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.260
 is possibly here it reads from 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.989
 anyone 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.159
 and the series brown and good to the case that 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.739
 safer than when we have already 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.689
 let's say that a more sheltered place 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.579
 let's make another one and such we still do not know 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.040
 when there is nothing but seen the seen and I have 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.360
 seen the feeling, yes, the most 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.310
 searched for us we do not know in what 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.860
 city will neither be nor anything yet 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.150
 we have no idea but you know 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.170
 that he is not going to die was not going to be the 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.579
 only place where we are what we 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.780
 you know, I do not know how much time 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.819
 the best then in six months that 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.109
 we do not know it or we do not know it's worth not 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.269
 we know we do not know anything or what 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.799
 I'm saying because obviously 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.440
 will do more because it has been amazing 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.360
 and it has to be repeated no but still 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.160
 we do not know anything about how it's going to be 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.080
