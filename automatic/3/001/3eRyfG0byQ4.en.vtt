look right here what we've got is is a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.019 
look right here what we've got is is a
couple<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.949> different<00:00:26.099> variations<00:00:26.490> of

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
couple of different variations of

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.210 
couple of different variations of
holsters<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.349> things<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.189> about

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.790 
holsters and things I like about
holsters<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.929> them<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.050> be<00:00:31.140> Kydex<00:00:31.679> I

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
holsters I like for them to be Kydex I

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
holsters I like for them to be Kydex I
like<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:32.070> them<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.279> hard<00:00:32.520> plastic<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
like for them to be hard plastic the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.840 
like for them to be hard plastic the
reason<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.680> manipulate<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.219> gun<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
reason is so I can manipulate the gun I

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.049 
reason is so I can manipulate the gun I
can<00:00:36.360> rack<00:00:36.600> off<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.700> doesn't

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
can rack off of it that it doesn't

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.459 
can rack off of it that it doesn't
collapse<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.719> problem<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.260> leather

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
collapse the problem with leather

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.200 
collapse the problem with leather
holsters<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.280> tend<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> collapse<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.149> if

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
holsters is they tend to collapse and if

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.970 
holsters is they tend to collapse and if
you<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> reholster<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.469> pistol<00:00:43.860> with

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
you have to reholster the pistol with

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.470 
you have to reholster the pistol with
one<00:00:44.219> hand<00:00:44.550> while<00:00:45.090> you're<00:00:45.239> doing<00:00:45.450> something

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
one hand while you're doing something

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.029 
one hand while you're doing something
else<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.110> hard<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
else it's hard to get it in

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.330 
else it's hard to get it in
so<00:00:47.600> traits<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.750> look<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.230> holster<00:00:49.559> either

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
injection molded plastic or Kydex and it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.619 
injection molded plastic or Kydex and it
needs<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.190> able<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> positively<00:00:54.120> retain

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
needs to be able to positively retain

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.080 
needs to be able to positively retain
