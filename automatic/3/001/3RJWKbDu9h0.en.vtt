let's<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:16.949> get<00:00:17.070> right<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.789> is

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
let's just get right to it this is

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.200 
let's just get right to it this is
basically<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.840> rig<00:00:19.080> setup<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.460> updated

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
basically the rig setup for the updated

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.679 
basically the rig setup for the updated
version<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.140> pvc<00:00:22.650> shoulder<00:00:23.039> rig<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.689> as

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
version of the pvc shoulder rig and as

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.720 
version of the pvc shoulder rig and as
you<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.019> see<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.439> really<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.220> exact<00:00:26.550> same

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
you can see it really is the exact same

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.189 
you can see it really is the exact same
design<00:00:26.910> same<00:00:27.359> dimensions<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.930> everything

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
design same dimensions and everything

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.470 
design same dimensions and everything
the<00:00:28.320> only<00:00:28.439> difference<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.099> when<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> flip<00:00:30.330> this

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the only difference is when I flip this

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.540 
the only difference is when I flip this
over<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.109> see<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> bottom<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.099> replaced

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
over you can see the bottom I replaced

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.200 
over you can see the bottom I replaced
with<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.270> cross<00:00:34.110> PVC<00:00:35.040> piece<00:00:35.309> instead<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.030> that

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
with a cross PVC piece instead of that

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.260 
with a cross PVC piece instead of that
conduit<00:00:37.020> box<00:00:37.320> now<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.460> lets<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.030> do

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
conduit box now what that lets that do

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.080 
conduit box now what that lets that do
is<00:00:39.629> make<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.350> something<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.670> lot<00:00:41.910> more

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
is make it something that a lot more

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.670 
is make it something that a lot more
people<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:42.719> ahold<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.140> con<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
people can get ahold of that con do a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.319 
people can get ahold of that con do a
box<00:00:43.860> seemed<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> problem<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.090> lot<00:00:45.180> of

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
box seemed to be a problem for a lot of

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.209 
box seemed to be a problem for a lot of
people<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.660> pick<00:00:45.809> up<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.860> wasn't<00:00:47.010> too

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
people to pick up and it wasn't too

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.770 
people to pick up and it wasn't too
common<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.640> piece<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.329> was

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
common of a piece but I was

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.150 
common of a piece but I was
experimenting<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.680> L<00:00:49.829> channel

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
experimenting with this little L channel

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.470 
experimenting with this little L channel
in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> front<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.149> here<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
in the front as you can see here and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.420 
in the front as you can see here and
what<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.809> does<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.230> elevate<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.800> camera<00:00:53.250> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
what that does is elevate the camera and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.760 
what that does is elevate the camera and
let<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.879> run<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> camera<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> viewfinder<00:00:55.620> I

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
let you run a camera with a viewfinder I

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.400 
let you run a camera with a viewfinder I
found<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.969> lower<00:00:57.180> mount<00:00:57.629> also<00:00:57.899> worked

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
found that the lower mount also worked

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.920 
found that the lower mount also worked
with<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.680> battery<00:00:59.250> grip<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> camera<00:01:00.090> it

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
with a battery grip on the camera it

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.630 
with a battery grip on the camera it
seemed<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.199> work<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.469> fine<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.489> I

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
seemed to work really fine and like I

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.920 
seemed to work really fine and like I
said<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:03.090> don't<00:01:03.329> know<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.780> build

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
said I don't know if I'm going to build

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.750 
said I don't know if I'm going to build
video<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.010> exactly<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
video on this because it's exactly the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.370 
video on this because it's exactly the
same<00:01:05.970> build<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> original<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.140> just

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
same build as the original I just

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.050 
same build as the original I just
switched<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.220> centerpiece<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:08.970> know

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
switched out the centerpiece but I know

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.670 
switched out the centerpiece but I know
a<00:01:09.150> lot<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.479> people<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.869> requested<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.470> see

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
a lot of people have requested to see

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.630 
a lot of people have requested to see
this<00:01:10.860> rig<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> setup<00:01:13.640> now

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
this rig and this is the setup now

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.219 
this rig and this is the setup now
setting<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.000> camera<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:15.930> see

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
setting the camera on here you can see

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.690 
setting the camera on here you can see
this<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.560> set<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> lower<00:01:17.189> mount<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
this is set up on the lower mount and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700 
this is set up on the lower mount and
the<00:01:18.479> viewfinder<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:18.960> not<00:01:19.080> really<00:01:19.320> totally<00:01:19.500> in

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the viewfinder is not really totally in

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.010 
the viewfinder is not really totally in
place<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.240> see<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.659> actually<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
place but you can see this is actually a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.560 
place but you can see this is actually a
little<00:01:22.200> too<00:01:22.290> low<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:23.460> operation<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.240> had<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
little too low for operation I had a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.660 
little too low for operation I had a
battery<00:01:24.930> grip<00:01:25.140> when<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.320> had<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.619> setup<00:01:25.860> but

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
battery grip when I had this setup but

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.330 
battery grip when I had this setup but
the<00:01:27.330> battery<00:01:27.630> made<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> elevate<00:01:28.560> perfectly<00:01:29.130> as

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the battery made it elevate perfectly as

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.130 
the battery made it elevate perfectly as
you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.970> though<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.270> front<00:01:30.720> section

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
you can see though this front section

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.620 
you can see though this front section
which<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.369> my<00:01:32.610> opinion<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.030> temporary

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
which is in my opinion just temporary

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.200 
which is in my opinion just temporary
works<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:34.590> well<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.520> reason<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.909> said<00:01:36.090> it's

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
works as well the reason I said it's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.429 
works as well the reason I said it's
temporary<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.110> kind<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.320> an

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
temporary is because this is kind of an

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.679 
temporary is because this is kind of an
experimental<00:01:37.890> setup<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:39.150> does<00:01:39.479> work

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
experimental setup but this does work

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.210 
experimental setup but this does work
you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.590> elevates<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you can see it really elevates the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.389 
you can see it really elevates the
camera<00:01:41.549> there<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.890> basically

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
camera there and that is just basically

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.370 
camera there and that is just basically
a<00:01:44.520> little<00:01:44.909> plug<00:01:45.299> as<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:45.930> right<00:01:46.110> here

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
a little plug as you can see right here

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.960 
a little plug as you can see right here
with<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.619> little<00:01:46.860> quarter-twenty<00:01:47.490> screw<00:01:47.850> going

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
with a little quarter-twenty screw going

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.480 
with a little quarter-twenty screw going
through<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:49.530> don't<00:01:49.799> even<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.159> any

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
through it and I don't even have any

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.490 
through it and I don't even have any
washers<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.149> was<00:01:51.450> using<00:01:51.659> washers<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> found

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
washers I was using washers but I found

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.880 
washers I was using washers but I found
that<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:53.250> piece<00:01:53.549> alone<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.680> supported<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
that that piece alone is supported the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.740 
that that piece alone is supported the
camera<00:01:56.250> perfectly<00:01:56.850> fine<00:01:57.030> I've<00:01:57.240> never<00:01:57.450> had<00:01:57.600> any

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
camera perfectly fine I've never had any

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.120 
camera perfectly fine I've never had any
worries<00:01:58.079> about<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.409> slipping<00:01:58.590> even<00:01:58.950> though<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
worries about it slipping even though it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.030 
worries about it slipping even though it
doesn't<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.460> look<00:02:00.020> super<00:02:01.020> secure<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.860> on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
doesn't really look super secure it's on

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.609 
doesn't really look super secure it's on
there<00:02:02.219> pretty<00:02:02.399> well<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:04.200> lens<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.530> this

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
there pretty well the lens on this

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.580 
there pretty well the lens on this
camera<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.360> 1770<00:02:06.360> Sigma<00:02:06.990> lens<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.500> I've

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
camera is a 1770 Sigma lens and I've

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.150 
camera is a 1770 Sigma lens and I've
actually<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.550> liked<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.479> 2.8<00:02:10.160> it's

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
actually really liked it it's a 2.8 it's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.920 
actually really liked it it's a 2.8 it's
a<00:02:11.310> variable<00:02:11.610> f-stop<00:02:12.120> 2.8<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.870> 5.6

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
a variable f-stop 2.8 to 5.6

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.720 
a variable f-stop 2.8 to 5.6
something<00:02:14.200> but<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.069> up<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.430> working<00:02:15.640> out

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
something but it's up and working out

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.699 
something but it's up and working out
hopefully<00:02:15.909> I'll<00:02:16.090> do<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.209> little<00:02:16.299> video<00:02:16.709> testing

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
hopefully I'll do a little video testing

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.559 
hopefully I'll do a little video testing

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
can see this plug just kind of slides

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.949 
can see this plug just kind of slides

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
is the exact same setup as the original

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.539 
is the exact same setup as the original
so<00:02:31.420> if<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.439> want<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.680> see<00:02:32.859> that<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.310> can<00:02:33.400> click

but<00:02:35.439> I<00:02:35.469> want<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.739> mention<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.579> shoulder<00:02:37.510> setup

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
but I want to mention the shoulder setup

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.729 
but I want to mention the shoulder setup
this<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.670> basic<00:02:40.209> PVC<00:02:40.810> setup<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.409> that

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
this is the basic PVC setup of that

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.550 
this is the basic PVC setup of that
shoulder<00:02:42.099> section<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:43.569> something<00:02:44.409> that<00:02:44.439> I

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
shoulder section but something that I

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.780 
shoulder section but something that I
did<00:02:44.889> and<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.069> don't<00:02:45.280> know<00:02:45.400> if<00:02:45.489> it's<00:02:45.579> going<00:02:45.670> to

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
did and I don't know if it's going to

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.720 
did and I don't know if it's going to
show<00:02:46.030> up<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.870> actually<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.590> angled<00:02:48.250> here<00:02:48.549> let

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
show up it actually is angled here let

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.460 
show up it actually is angled here let
me<00:02:48.760> get<00:02:48.879> a<00:02:48.939> different<00:02:49.269> angle<00:02:49.359> when<00:02:50.139> you<00:02:50.230> set

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
me get a different angle when you set

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.440 
me get a different angle when you set
yours<00:02:50.680> up<00:02:50.950> as<00:02:51.129> you<00:02:51.250> can<00:02:51.340> see<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.879> sits<00:02:52.180> on<00:02:52.299> my

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
yours up as you can see this sits on my

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.140 
yours up as you can see this sits on my
right<00:02:52.720> shoulder<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.379> I<00:02:54.250> have<00:02:54.609> it<00:02:54.730> slightly

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
right shoulder and I have it slightly

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.599 
right shoulder and I have it slightly
angled<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:56.349> match<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.709> contour<00:02:56.919> of<00:02:57.250> my

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
angled to match the contour of my

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.429 
angled to match the contour of my
shoulder<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.180> really<00:02:58.780> helps<00:02:58.989> out<00:02:59.139> keeps

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
shoulder and that really helps out keeps

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.140 
shoulder and that really helps out keeps
everything<00:02:59.859> level<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.459> just<00:03:00.639> sits<00:03:00.909> better

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
everything level and it just sits better

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.059 
everything level and it just sits better

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
paint but it really is a PVC die and

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.610 
paint but it really is a PVC die and
it's<00:03:21.699> a<00:03:21.849> dark<00:03:22.180> dark<00:03:22.479> blue<00:03:22.780> it's<00:03:23.079> kind<00:03:23.349> of<00:03:23.440> hard

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
it's a dark dark blue it's kind of hard

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.589 
it's a dark dark blue it's kind of hard
to<00:03:23.680> tell<00:03:23.979> it<00:03:24.760> was<00:03:24.879> something<00:03:25.150> else<00:03:25.389> I<00:03:25.540> was

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
to tell it was something else I was

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.939 
to tell it was something else I was
experimenting<00:03:26.229> with<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.650> actually

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
experimenting with and I actually

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.339 
experimenting with and I actually
totally<00:03:27.549> hated<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.180> die<00:03:28.359> super<00:03:29.079> expensive

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
totally hated the die super expensive

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.229 
totally hated the die super expensive
and<00:03:29.680> took<00:03:29.859> forever<00:03:30.129> but<00:03:30.400> now<00:03:30.609> I<00:03:30.639> really<00:03:31.060> like

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
and took forever but now I really like

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.240 
and took forever but now I really like
it<00:03:31.419> because<00:03:31.599> it<00:03:31.780> dries<00:03:32.049> instantly<00:03:32.319> and<00:03:32.859> once

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
it because it dries instantly and once

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.250 
it because it dries instantly and once
it's<00:03:33.459> on<00:03:33.579> it<00:03:33.909> doesn't<00:03:34.329> hot<00:03:34.449> scratch<00:03:34.840> off<00:03:35.049> or

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
it's on it doesn't hot scratch off or

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.020 
it's on it doesn't hot scratch off or
easily<00:03:35.500> it's<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:35.919> much<00:03:36.040> better<00:03:36.250> than<00:03:36.400> paint<00:03:36.669> it

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
easily it's so much better than paint it

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.599 
easily it's so much better than paint it
just<00:03:37.689> is<00:03:37.870> takes<00:03:38.650> out<00:03:38.799> a<00:03:38.829> bunch<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.189> coats<00:03:39.400> to

hot-glued it at the seam but this stuff

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.809 
hot-glued it at the seam but this stuff
comes<00:03:56.109> with<00:03:56.259> a<00:03:56.290> tape<00:03:56.620> that<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:57.040> serious
