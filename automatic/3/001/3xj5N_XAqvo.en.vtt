00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.160
 dear and tannins 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.380
 Hello dear viewers subscribers 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.090
 just guests of the channel in this issue we 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.309
 let's play so pretty interesting 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.310
 character as a witch he is a witch doctor 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.449
 consider its main pros and cons 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.939
 talk about the most useful and 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.909
 effective clothes and rocks and indeed 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.169
 Tom is worth playing this character 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.999
 I begin perhaps with the fact that the sorcerer is 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.399
 versatile character he has a bunch 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.899
 clothes and weapons but there are only two good 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.519
 balanced cassette in which you 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.940
 be able to feel comfortable over and 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:40.280
 5 and 6 1 site is called senza not matsiya 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.030
 second set of jade reaper both sets 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.589
 very cool and give awesome bonuses 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.210
 then the reaper allows us to deal damage 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.929
 which we used to inflict over 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.539
 some time 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.010
 put it immediately asset deal 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.879
 allows us to use with me 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.920
 network fetishes 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.870
 before their death, that is, if earlier 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.879
 caused them only 20 seconds what 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.100
 now they are with us forever until 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.329
 until we let them go if possible 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.950
 or until they do not kill themselves 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.689
 sorcerer is perhaps a unique character in 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.820
 arsenal which is really cool 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.950
 their bonuses are so cool that 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.990
 with their choice, they simply run to 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.920
 the way I say it's not the whole set and 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.479
 Only the fact that I had the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.399
 our friendâ€™s weapons were not cheated either 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.799
 he uses special one-handed 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.540
 swords and ritual blades are better from 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.270
 which in my kukri and star 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.119
 I unfortunately did not fulfill the metal 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.170
 bonuses it really cool and 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.869
 allows you to roll back the skill big 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.619
 terrible water for 2 seconds each 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.020
 fetish kick 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.810
 In my very cool so put 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.619
 him plus with regard to skills here 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.840
 full set 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.930
 squeezing bugs and spiders to curses 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.850
 call animals and buffs passivka our 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.130
 character is truly unique they 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.780
 raise us the resilience of our cops then 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.759
 from our pets increases them 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.880
 damage amount 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.890
 or even cause them themselves in the arsenal 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.570
 our sorcerer for greater vitality is 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.119
 beautiful skill which is called 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.420
 post spirit she allows us to survive 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.070
 walk through walls or a mob of monsters 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.870
 when the monsters frankly go wild 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.379
 we can them 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.269
 frighten or to turn into a chicken Ryaba but 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.459
 even a character like a sorcerer has 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.060
 useless skill such as a zombie wall 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.860
 or zombie berserk completely forgot 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.569
 Our sorcerer has a beautiful ring 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.819
 which is called high finger 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.129
 human when using the skills of dogs 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.230
 zombies we combine them into one huge 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.000
 powerful dog that deals damage 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.629
 more than all our little dogs together 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.180
 taken 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.400
 Well, in conclusion I want to say that 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.440
 playing the sorcerer is the easiest 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.970
 subject to the call of animals so I 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.359
 would gladly recommend the sorcerer 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.359
 newcomer
