finding anything online on how to use

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.740 
finding anything online on how to use
these<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.540> saw<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.199> girl<00:00:16.410> online<00:00:17.010> who

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
these and so I saw one girl online who

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.730 
these and so I saw one girl online who
she<00:00:18.750> hooked<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> hair<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.920> top<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.670> this

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
she hooked the hair in the top of this

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.470 
she hooked the hair in the top of this
and<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:23.039> rolled<00:00:23.460> her<00:00:23.609> hair<00:00:23.820> down<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.269> there

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
and then rolled her hair down on there

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.529 
and then rolled her hair down on there
but<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> think<00:00:25.470> she<00:00:25.949> may<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.160> been

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
but I think she may have been

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.939 
but I think she may have been
transitioning<00:00:27.539> from<00:00:27.689> natural<00:00:28.320> me<00:00:28.769> from

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.809 

so<00:02:38.930> now<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.530> there<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.640> have

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
so now I have it in there and you have

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.910 
so now I have it in there and you have
to<00:02:41.849> keep<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.390> rollers<00:02:42.780> straight<00:02:43.410> up<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.860> down

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
so that's that one and it's pretty tight

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.470 
so that's that one and it's pretty tight
and<00:02:49.200> then<00:02:49.560> another<00:02:49.920> variation<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.209> found

found online and she put her clips down
there<00:03:12.210> but<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> found<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.470> didn't<00:03:13.830> secure

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
there but I found that it didn't secure

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.760 
there but I found that it didn't secure
minds<00:03:14.520> tight<00:03:14.970> enough<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:16.170> know<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.590> if

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.530 
minds tight enough and I know like if
this<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.130> anything<00:03:17.490> like<00:03:17.550> a<00:03:17.730> regular<00:03:18.060> Rover

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
this is anything like a regular Rover

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.500 
this is anything like a regular Rover
said<00:03:18.780> your<00:03:19.260> curlers<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.980> be<00:03:20.160> tight<00:03:20.510> or

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
said your curlers have to be tight or

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.260 
said your curlers have to be tight or
else<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:22.140> won't<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.770> won't<00:03:22.920> really<00:03:23.250> have<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
else it won't you won't really have the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.230 
else it won't you won't really have the
effect<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.810> look<00:03:25.050> for<00:03:25.260> when<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:27.090> know

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
effect that I look for when I you know

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.760 
effect that I look for when I you know
when<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.450> take<00:03:27.660> my<00:03:27.840> curls<00:03:28.110> down<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.470> like<00:03:28.650> the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
when I take my curls down I like the

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.430 
when I take my curls down I like the
curlers<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.400> be<00:03:29.520> tight<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.060> fit<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.510> snug<00:03:30.780> so

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
curlers to be tight and fit and snug so

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.500 
curlers to be tight and fit and snug so
that<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.770> curls<00:03:32.070> aren't<00:03:32.400> fuzzy<00:03:32.910> anywhere<00:03:33.330> so

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
that the curls aren't fuzzy anywhere so

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.449 
that the curls aren't fuzzy anywhere so
it's<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.720> nice<00:03:34.100> smooth<00:03:36.050> curl<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.220> that's

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
it's a nice smooth curl and so that's

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:46.610 
it's a nice smooth curl and so that's
that<00:03:38.640> what<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:38.940> needs<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.180> do<00:03:44.990> top<00:03:45.990> middle<00:03:46.320> of

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
that what it needs to do top middle of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.410 
that what it needs to do top middle of
my<00:03:46.800> head<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.340> found<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.820> starting<00:03:51.270> the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
my head and I found that starting the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.420 
my head and I found that starting the
very<00:03:51.660> first<00:03:51.930> once<00:03:52.170> was<00:03:52.410> hard<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.830> very<00:03:53.130> right

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
very first once was hard like very right

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.980 
very first once was hard like very right
in<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.670> very<00:03:53.880> back<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.300> was<00:03:54.420> kind<00:03:54.630> of<00:03:54.720> hard

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
in the very back it was kind of hard

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.770 
in the very back it was kind of hard
because<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.350> was<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.190> figuring<00:03:57.000> out<00:03:57.180> how<00:03:57.720> to

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
because I was just figuring out how to

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.780 
because I was just figuring out how to
use<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.380> curlers<00:04:01.040> then<00:04:02.040> at<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.280> top<00:04:02.520> middle

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
use the curlers then at the top middle

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.040 
use the curlers then at the top middle
was<00:04:03.030> kind<00:04:03.300> of<00:04:03.330> hard<00:04:03.540> because<00:04:03.690> they're<00:04:03.870> trying

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
was kind of hard because they're trying

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.810 
was kind of hard because they're trying
to<00:04:04.110> get<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.320> curlers<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.800> stay<00:04:05.370> up<00:04:05.610> and

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
to get the curlers to stay up and

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.020 
to get the curlers to stay up and
they're<00:04:05.940> kind<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:07.220> pushing<00:04:08.220> up<00:04:08.519> against<00:04:08.910> the

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
they're kind of pushing up against the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.020 
they're kind of pushing up against the
lower<00:04:09.300> level<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:10.800> curlers<00:04:11.280> okay<00:04:11.550> so<00:04:11.850> they<00:04:11.970> all

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
lower level of curlers okay so they all

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.690 
lower level of curlers okay so they all
right<00:04:12.180> put<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.810> wrap<00:04:12.989> foam<00:04:13.290> in<00:04:13.560> all<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.610> way

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
right put the wrap foam in all the way

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.539 
right put the wrap foam in all the way
to<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.060> end<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.420> nice<00:04:15.630> amount<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.310> he<00:04:17.370> can

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
to the end a nice amount so that he can

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.740 
to the end a nice amount so that he can
lay<00:04:17.729> down<00:04:18.000> on<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.510> curler

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.640 

that's<00:04:24.110> me<00:04:24.320> starting<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:26.110> right<00:04:27.110> there<00:04:27.380> looks

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
that's me starting it right there looks

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.740 
that's me starting it right there looks
it<00:04:30.160> okay<00:04:31.160> see<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.380> pool<00:04:33.650> kind<00:04:33.980> of<00:04:34.100> tightly

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
it okay see and the pool kind of tightly

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:47.380 
it okay see and the pool kind of tightly
and<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:35.930> go<00:04:36.140> ahead<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:36.590> ice<00:04:42.550> all<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.610> way<00:04:46.390> now

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
and I go ahead and ice all the way now

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.270 
and I go ahead and ice all the way now
this<00:04:47.600> is<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:47.870> first<00:04:48.230> time<00:04:48.530> I'm<00:04:48.620> doing<00:04:48.650> this<00:04:49.040> so

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
this is the first time I'm doing this so

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.140 
this is the first time I'm doing this so
I<00:04:49.310> won't<00:04:50.060> know<00:04:50.300> how<00:04:50.480> it<00:04:50.660> looks<00:04:51.790> how<00:04:52.790> it's<00:04:52.970> going

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
I won't know how it looks how it's going

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.020 
I won't know how it looks how it's going
to<00:04:53.210> turn<00:04:53.360> out<00:04:53.540> until<00:04:53.780> I'm<00:04:53.930> done<00:04:54.080> drying<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:55.030> but

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
to turn out until I'm done drying it but

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.120 
to turn out until I'm done drying it but
I<00:04:56.150> usually<00:04:56.540> do<00:04:56.690> my<00:04:56.720> own<00:04:57.020> hair<00:04:57.230> quite<00:04:57.530> often<00:04:57.740> and

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
I usually do my own hair quite often and

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.210 
I usually do my own hair quite often and
when<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.250> do<00:04:58.340> my<00:04:58.610> regular<00:04:58.820> roller<00:04:59.240> sets<00:05:00.220> it

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
when I do my regular roller sets it

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.030 
when I do my regular roller sets it
turns<00:05:01.490> out<00:05:01.760> just<00:05:02.000> fine

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
turns out just fine

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.850 
turns out just fine
so<00:05:04.040> we'll<00:05:04.280> see<00:05:04.430> about<00:05:04.520> this<00:05:04.880> one<00:05:05.120> it<00:05:05.860> usually

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
so we'll see about this one it usually

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.200 
so we'll see about this one it usually
generally<00:05:07.280> can<00:05:07.430> tell<00:05:07.460> how<00:05:07.760> your<00:05:07.970> hair<00:05:08.120> it's

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
generally can tell how your hair it's

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.150 
generally can tell how your hair it's
going<00:05:08.390> to<00:05:08.450> turn<00:05:08.660> out<00:05:08.870> by<00:05:09.260> how<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.470> roller<00:05:09.800> still

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
going to turn out by how to roller still

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.980 
going to turn out by how to roller still
in<00:05:10.310> there<00:05:10.430> cuz<00:05:10.640> if<00:05:11.120> they're<00:05:11.390> not<00:05:11.570> if<00:05:11.840> they

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
in there cuz if they're not if they

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.960 
in there cuz if they're not if they
don't<00:05:12.020> feel<00:05:12.350> tight<00:05:12.710> if<00:05:12.890> they<00:05:13.010> don't<00:05:13.190> feel<00:05:13.460> they

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
don't feel tight if they don't feel they

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.580 
don't feel tight if they don't feel they
feel<00:05:14.000> loose<00:05:14.510> and<00:05:14.810> like<00:05:14.930> they're<00:05:15.110> almost<00:05:15.290> going

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
feel loose and like they're almost going

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.060 
feel loose and like they're almost going
to<00:05:15.650> fall<00:05:15.830> out

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
to fall out

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.510 
to fall out
you<00:05:16.700> can<00:05:16.880> almost<00:05:17.120> guarantee<00:05:17.510> that<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:19.220> rubber

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
you can almost guarantee that the rubber

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.250 
you can almost guarantee that the rubber
stamp<00:05:19.700> won't<00:05:19.970> look<00:05:20.120> too<00:05:20.450> good<00:05:20.630> after<00:05:20.870> you<00:05:21.050> take

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
stamp won't look too good after you take

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.900 
stamp won't look too good after you take
it<00:05:21.410> down<00:05:21.530> have<00:05:21.890> to<00:05:22.070> take<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.340> rollers<00:05:22.670> out<00:05:24.910> and

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
it down have to take the rollers out and

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.460 
it down have to take the rollers out and
that<00:05:26.060> was<00:05:26.210> not<00:05:26.420> really<00:05:26.630> tight<00:05:26.900> enough<00:05:27.170> for<00:05:27.380> me

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
that was not really tight enough for me

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:42.159 
that was not really tight enough for me
so<00:05:30.880> I<00:05:31.900> just<00:05:32.900> kind<00:05:33.230> of<00:05:33.290> lift<00:05:33.530> it<00:05:33.650> up<00:05:33.830> on<00:05:34.040> it<00:05:41.169> make

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
so I just kind of lift it up on it make

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.720 
so I just kind of lift it up on it make
sure<00:05:42.350> that<00:05:42.530> there's<00:05:42.800> not<00:05:43.010> even<00:05:43.070> care<00:05:43.520> if<00:05:43.580> it's

sure that there's not even care if it's

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:51.640 
sure that there's not even care if it's
off

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.860

hair<00:05:54.110> is<00:05:54.139> secure<00:05:54.650> at<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:54.860> two

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.130 

it's<00:06:16.830> still<00:06:17.670> not<00:06:17.880> laying<00:06:18.150> down<00:06:18.360> like<00:06:18.390> I<00:06:18.690> wanted

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
it's still not laying down like I wanted

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.480 
it's still not laying down like I wanted
she<00:06:19.260> was<00:06:19.380> kind<00:06:19.590> of<00:06:19.650> leaning<00:06:19.830> up<00:06:20.070> against<00:06:20.310> that

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
she was kind of leaning up against that

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.640 
she was kind of leaning up against that
leather<00:06:20.700> Rover<00:06:21.090> so<00:06:21.240> I'm<00:06:21.330> not<00:06:21.450> able<00:06:21.660> to<00:06:21.780> break

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
leather Rover so I'm not able to break

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.530 
leather Rover so I'm not able to break
it<00:06:22.800> down<00:06:22.920> as<00:06:23.130> tight<00:06:23.370> to<00:06:23.400> my<00:06:23.700> scalp<00:06:24.060> as<00:06:24.240> I<00:06:24.360> would

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
it down as tight to my scalp as I would

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.680 
it down as tight to my scalp as I would
want<00:06:24.720> that<00:06:24.990> when<00:06:25.140> the<00:06:25.230> beef<00:06:25.580> but<00:06:26.580> overall<00:06:27.390> the

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
want that when the beef but overall the

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.790 
want that when the beef but overall the
curler<00:06:27.960> is<00:06:28.200> still<00:06:28.520> pretty<00:06:29.520> tight<00:06:29.910> and<00:06:30.720> I<00:06:31.500> find

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
curler is still pretty tight and I find

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.410 
curler is still pretty tight and I find
that<00:06:31.950> when<00:06:32.160> I<00:06:32.220> put<00:06:32.610> the<00:06:33.920> little<00:06:35.000> things<00:06:36.000> on<00:06:36.270> to

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
that when I put the little things on to

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.600 
that when I put the little things on to
security<00:06:36.990> I<00:06:37.140> put<00:06:37.770> it<00:06:37.860> like<00:06:38.010> at<00:06:38.190> least<00:06:38.340> on<00:06:38.580> a

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
security I put it like at least on a

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.750 
security I put it like at least on a
second<00:06:39.240> rung<00:06:39.900> from<00:06:40.860> the<00:06:41.070> top<00:06:41.280> of<00:06:41.460> where<00:06:41.640> my

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
second rung from the top of where my

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.950 
second rung from the top of where my
hair<00:06:42.030> stops<00:06:42.360> it<00:06:42.770> so<00:06:43.970> my<00:06:44.970> hair<00:06:45.210> stops<00:06:45.510> up<00:06:45.780> here

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
hair stops it so my hair stops up here

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.410 
hair stops it so my hair stops up here
so<00:06:46.230> I'll<00:06:46.440> probably<00:06:46.680> put<00:06:47.310> it<00:06:47.460> about<00:06:48.180> right

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
so I'll probably put it about right

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.200 
so I'll probably put it about right
there<00:06:48.600> on<00:06:48.750> that<00:06:48.780> run
