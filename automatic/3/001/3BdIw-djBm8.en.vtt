00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.450
 I wondered here just now and not whether to make 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.360
 I frame the mirror and decided it 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.640
 to saw from a common piece of MDF 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.820
 how to cut everyone knows 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.340
 but how to paint a few in order 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.270
 to paint the subject well 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.090
 to prime 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.250
 for this, I take a simple primer and 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.980
 his little pad calearo you Vayu 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.770
 because groups can immediately be made 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:40.820
 color and primed my friends 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:44.840
 need to work with hands in the first place 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.790
 profitable secondly it is more interesting a 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.100
 third you can make the subject 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.950
 the like of which you will not find anywhere else 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.070
 world so the first layer has dried it is 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.300
 pink banal stunning and the second 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.120
 I will have an extraordinary layer 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.560
 beautiful and suede first i dye 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.329
 the jib often ask me where I come from 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.399
 take my ideas 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:14.140
 and you ask me it on the school website 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:17.539
 repair I will answer you 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.149
 paint over i'm going to two layers 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.780
 do you know the difference between good paint 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:27.819
 bad good paint when it dries 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.819
 dark and bad brightens 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.380
 the surface of the table is matte and dark 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.230
 it means the paint is dry I'm going 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.050
 work on heaps if they are cut 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.830
 then they must be beautiful and in 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.430
 this will help me sticky masking tape 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.840
 I paste all the surfaces of this tape 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.320
 so as not to get them dirty i take a 15 minute 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.880
 mardan is the name 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.550
 specialized material on which 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.360
 stick social sheets because 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.050
 I will use a small item 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.690
 the fastest 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.130
 that means i am for 15 minutes 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.090
 I can work 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.660
 mordant dried up became sticky and now i'm on 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.910
 frame 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.910
 I can glue steel sheets 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:38.120
 I brush the excess gold from the surface and 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.720
 immediately take off the tape look 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.720
 on this beauty 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:52.360
 so the frame is painted perimeter gilded 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.420
 but I want this free field 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.069
 put a thin golden drawing i take 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:03.120
 I get the most ordinary tracing paper 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.220
 a material called a perk 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.000
 she's just golden 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.330
 I put under the tracing paper I take the device which 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 i called decorative curling i am this 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.380
 device made himself from curling hair at 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.840
 it 's about 183 degrees 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:29.140
 Celsius I start to draw all sorts 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.040
 flowers and it turns out so thin 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.040
 gold 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:51.890
 Well, the beauty is golden I have hands 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.420
 it is clear that when such a beautiful frame 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.819
 no drawing in it will be possible 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.090
 it will just be necessary to insert into it 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.750
 look look around you can in the mirror 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.329
 which I'm going to do now 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.700
 back liner to the size of this hole 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.700
 I will cut the mirror on it 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.389
 here is such a rearview mirror in 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:30.819
 I got it but I have a feeling 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:32.169
 that looks like it is probably too new 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:36.159
 I need to make it 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:39.310
 how to age a mirror change the date 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:42.340
 of birth in the passport but there is no mirror 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.139
 passports for this 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:50.310
 where ordinary would be needed 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:54.150
 I have a microwave oven harvested 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:58.110
 container in it I lower the mirror 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:02.219
 I close the container and put it inside 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:06.190
 lowest temperature and 10 seconds 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:13.680
 need to turn on and off all the time 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.680
 microwave shoots turn off 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:26.200
 shoots and see what is here 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:29.690
 got ready for a mirror 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:34.930
 cracked so gentle touching 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:39.100
 craquelure chick insert mirror here 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:42.290
 I put the substrate and hammering brackets 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.940
 the frame for the frame of course can be 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.060
 just buy in the store 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.760
 but if you do it yourself, then 2 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.479
 the framework will no longer be with you 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.169
 marat 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.169
 before meetings
