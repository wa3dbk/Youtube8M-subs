00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
yeah you basically could try and get

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.729 
yeah you basically could try and get
some<00:02:09.440> skyward<00:02:10.039> kales<00:02:10.369> with<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:12.050> yet<00:02:12.320> send

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
some skyward kales with it and yet send

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.870 
some skyward kales with it and yet send
some<00:02:12.950> more<00:02:13.100> vertical<00:02:13.640> over<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> horizontal

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
some more vertical over a horizontal

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.330 
some more vertical over a horizontal
next<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.330> would<00:02:17.480> be<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:19.610> down<00:02:20.360> be<00:02:20.660> here

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
next to that would be is down be here

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.050 
next to that would be is down be here
seems<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.489> be<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:24.019> takes<00:02:24.230> longer<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.650> transform

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.400 

seems<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:30.040> well<00:02:31.480> done<00:02:32.480> little<00:02:33.080> bit<00:02:33.170> quicker

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
seems that well done little bit quicker

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.570 
seems that well done little bit quicker
seems<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.530> be<00:02:36.620> doing<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.890> little<00:02:37.160> bit<00:02:37.370> less

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
seems to be doing a little bit less

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:49.270 
seems to be doing a little bit less
damage<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:44.440> yeah<00:02:45.440> it's<00:02:46.070> basically<00:02:48.280> being

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
damage and yeah it's basically being

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.330 
damage and yeah it's basically being
more<00:02:50.239> heavy<00:02:50.660> towards<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.950> going<00:02:52.190> down

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
more heavy towards like going down

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.220 
more heavy towards like going down
quicker<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:54.440> larger<00:02:54.980> objects<00:02:55.370> in<00:02:55.519> this<00:02:56.230> but

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
quicker the larger objects in this but

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.850 
quicker the larger objects in this but
it's<00:02:57.709> time<00:02:57.890> on<00:02:58.070> damage<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.820> yeah<00:02:59.650> Nexus<00:03:00.650> is

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
it's time on damage and yeah Nexus is

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.280 
it's time on damage and yeah Nexus is
standard<00:03:01.579> be<00:03:03.459> just<00:03:04.510> leave<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.690> reaches<00:03:06.200> the

moves<00:04:47.090> them<00:04:47.240> forward<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:48.139> yet<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.680> just<00:04:48.710> it

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
moves them forward and yet it just it

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.770 
moves them forward and yet it just it
doesn't<00:04:49.729> reduce<00:04:49.910> homage<00:04:50.330> or<00:04:50.419> anything<00:04:50.570> it's

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
special sent to the air a little bit

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.900 
special sent to the air a little bit
before<00:05:12.680> use<00:05:12.919> and<00:05:13.160> then<00:05:15.160> basically<00:05:16.160> do<00:05:16.760> some

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
before use and then basically do some

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.550 
before use and then basically do some
damage<00:05:17.180> like<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.450> other<00:05:17.570> one<00:05:17.780> seems<00:05:18.289> to<00:05:18.380> be

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
damage like the other one seems to be

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:27.430 
damage like the other one seems to be
more<00:05:19.010> heavier<00:05:19.639> objects<00:05:20.240> as<00:05:20.360> well<00:05:26.320> yeah<00:05:27.320> it

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
more heavier objects as well yeah it

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.750 
more heavier objects as well yeah it
seems<00:05:27.650> to<00:05:27.800> be<00:05:27.919> just<00:05:28.250> like<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.460> other<00:05:28.580> one

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
seems to be just like the other one

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.460 
seems to be just like the other one
except<00:05:29.000> oh<00:05:29.090> that<00:05:29.419> let's<00:05:29.870> go<00:05:29.960> to<00:05:30.169> the<00:05:30.229> air<00:05:30.440> a

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
except oh that let's go to the air a

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.570 
except oh that let's go to the air a
little<00:05:30.680> bit<00:05:31.840> and<00:05:32.840> yeah<00:05:33.530> what'd<00:05:34.130> you<00:05:34.220> guys<00:05:34.340> take

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
little bit and yeah what'd you guys take

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.629 
little bit and yeah what'd you guys take
global<00:05:34.940> honor<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.530> transform<00:05:36.530> into<00:05:37.220> it<00:05:37.520> and

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
global honor to transform into it and

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.360 
global honor to transform into it and
then<00:05:37.760> finally<00:05:38.150> recovery<00:05:40.599> recovery<00:05:42.220> seems<00:05:43.220> to

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
then finally recovery recovery seems to

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.920 
then finally recovery recovery seems to
send<00:05:43.580> them<00:05:43.669> straight<00:05:43.970> up<00:05:44.150> in<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.300> air<00:05:44.389> but

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
send them straight up in the air but

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.420 
send them straight up in the air but
won't<00:05:45.139> attack<00:05:45.410> them<00:05:45.530> on<00:05:45.650> anything<00:05:45.979> on<00:05:46.220> the<00:05:46.310> way

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
won't attack them on anything on the way

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.029 
won't attack them on anything on the way
down<00:05:46.639> whatsoever<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:47.870> it<00:05:48.380> cuts<00:05:48.560> up<00:05:48.710> anything

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
down whatsoever and it cuts up anything

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.540 
down whatsoever and it cuts up anything
and<00:05:49.789> there's<00:05:50.419> way<00:05:50.630> when<00:05:50.870> recovery<00:05:51.410> key<00:05:52.370> there

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
and there's way when recovery key there

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.869 
and there's way when recovery key there
so

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:53.879 
so

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.999 
so
yeah<00:05:54.539> that's<00:05:54.779> pretty<00:05:54.959> much<00:05:55.199> Kirby's<00:05:55.619> entire

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
yeah that's pretty much Kirby's entire

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.649 
yeah that's pretty much Kirby's entire
