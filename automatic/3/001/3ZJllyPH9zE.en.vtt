00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
three bundles total and I installed

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.299 
three bundles total and I installed
about<00:00:45.059> two<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.590> quarter<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.039> two<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
about two and a quarter to two and a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
about two and a quarter to two and a
half<00:00:47.430> windows<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> used<00:00:48.239> most<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
half windows so I used most of one of

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.319 
half windows so I used most of one of
the<00:00:49.620> 20s<00:00:50.010> part<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> twins<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the 20s part of one of the twins then I

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
the 20s part of one of the twins then I
used<00:00:51.539> about<00:00:51.690> half<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> 18<00:00:52.739> inch<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.640> I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
used about half of the 18 inch so I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.810 
used about half of the 18 inch so I
probably<00:00:54.149> say<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.539> about<00:00:55.489> two<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.730> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
probably say it's about two and a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.930 
probably say it's about two and a
quarter<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.690> two<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:59.160> half<00:00:59.340> bundles<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
quarter to are two and a half bundles I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.700 
quarter to are two and a half bundles I

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
was really hard to maintain that here

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.420 
was really hard to maintain that here
being<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.720> good<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.110> was<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.770> did<00:01:50.250> call

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
being as good as it was so I did call

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.520

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
watch the hair and the first thing that

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.289 
watch the hair and the first thing that
I<00:01:52.649> noticed<00:01:53.040> when<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.220> co<00:01:53.430> wash<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.820> hair<00:01:54.060> is

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
I noticed when I co wash the hair is

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.420 
I noticed when I co wash the hair is
that<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.810> strips<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.259> lot<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> color<00:01:55.829> out<00:01:55.890> so

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that it strips a lot of the color out so

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.819 
that it strips a lot of the color out so
I<00:01:56.759> don't<00:01:57.509> think<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:57.930> unprocessed<00:01:58.439> I

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
I don't think that it is unprocessed I

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.649 
I don't think that it is unprocessed I
can't<00:01:59.159> say<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.729> unprocessed<00:02:00.060> because

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
can't say that it is unprocessed because

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.340 
can't say that it is unprocessed because

wavy<00:03:26.430> pattern<00:03:26.940> but<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:27.890> pretty<00:03:28.890> much<00:03:28.980> how

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
wavy pattern but this is pretty much how

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.300 
wavy pattern but this is pretty much how
it<00:03:30.030> came<00:03:30.359> out<00:03:30.660> once<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.440> co<00:03:31.799> watch<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.250> a

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
it came out once I co watch it in a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.380 
it came out once I co watch it in a
drive<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.760> let<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:32.940> air<00:03:33.120> dried<00:03:33.359> and

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.370 
blow-dried or anything I just let it air
dry<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.570> pretty<00:03:36.780> much<00:03:36.930> how<00:03:37.079> it<00:03:37.200> came

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
dry and this is pretty much how it came

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.530 
dry and this is pretty much how it came
out<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.739> this<00:03:37.890> was<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.220> worst<00:03:38.400> one<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:39.030> still

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
out and this was the worst one it still

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.150 
out and this was the worst one it still
feels<00:03:39.750> really<00:03:39.780> soft<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.470> it's<00:03:40.650> pretty<00:03:40.950> but

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
feels really soft and it's pretty but

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.940 
feels really soft and it's pretty but
this<00:03:41.310> one's<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.670> most<00:03:41.700> Brown<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.620> also<00:03:43.620> the

this one's the most Brown and also the
most<00:03:44.100> straight<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.820> other<00:03:44.850> two<00:03:45.209> came<00:03:45.480> out<00:03:45.600> a

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
most straight the other two came out a

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.370 
most straight the other two came out a
lot<00:03:46.049> more<00:03:46.500> curly<00:03:47.750> then<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:48.900> one<00:03:49.049> day<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.200> don't

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
lot more curly then this one day I don't

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.319 
lot more curly then this one day I don't
like<00:03:49.470> my<00:03:49.590> wavy<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.130> like<00:03:50.430> another<00:03:50.880> thing<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
like my wavy I like another thing the

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.390 
like my wavy I like another thing the
hair<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.660> really<00:03:51.870> soft<00:03:52.200> it's<00:03:52.920> pretty<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.280> think

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
hair is really soft it's pretty I think

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.130 
hair is really soft it's pretty I think
it'll<00:03:53.700> be<00:03:53.790> good<00:03:53.970> like<00:03:54.390> it'll<00:03:54.660> be<00:03:54.690> manageable

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
it'll be good like it'll be manageable

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.509 
it'll be good like it'll be manageable
because<00:03:55.350> I<00:03:55.530> did<00:03:55.680> get<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.920> Garnier<00:03:56.190> Fructis

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
because I did get the Garnier Fructis

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.309 
because I did get the Garnier Fructis
shampoo<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:57.450> conditioner<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:57.989> think<00:03:58.079> the

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
shampoo and conditioner so I think the

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.840 
shampoo and conditioner so I think the
hair<00:03:58.470> will<00:03:58.560> be<00:03:58.650> fine<00:03:58.890> I've<00:03:59.430> only<00:03:59.579> had<00:03:59.790> it

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
hair will be fine I've only had it

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.690 
hair will be fine I've only had it
installed<00:04:00.180> for<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:01.230> couple<00:04:01.890> days<00:04:02.010> now<00:04:02.069> so<00:04:02.640> I

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
curl patter too but that's just because

twist<00:05:17.949> it<00:05:18.099> up<00:05:18.190> like<00:05:18.370> this<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.759> I<00:05:19.570> kind<00:05:20.110> of

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
twist it up like this and I kind of

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.170 
twist it up like this and I kind of
sleep<00:05:20.409> with<00:05:20.590> it<00:05:21.180> like<00:05:22.180> wrapped<00:05:22.509> up<00:05:22.720> like<00:05:22.930> this

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180
