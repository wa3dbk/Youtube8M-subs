just<00:01:44.820> hit<00:01:45.060> s<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.899> X<00:01:47.119> scaling<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> x-axis

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
just hit s and X scaling on the x-axis

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.550 
just hit s and X scaling on the x-axis
okay<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:52.579> then<00:01:53.579> we're<00:01:54.360> going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.600> rotate<00:01:54.840> with

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
okay and then we're going to rotate with

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.539 
okay and then we're going to rotate with
alt<00:01:55.920> shift<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.219> why<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.939> y-axis<00:02:01.430> let<00:02:02.430> me

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
alt shift and then why the y-axis let me

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.010 
alt shift and then why the y-axis let me
not<00:02:02.700> shift<00:02:03.030> sighs<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.229> why<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:06.570> we're

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
not shift sighs and then why and we're

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.520 
not shift sighs and then why and we're
going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.200> go<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:08.310> front<00:02:08.729> view

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
going to go to a front view

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.690 
going to go to a front view
hit<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.280> Z<00:02:11.850> key<00:02:12.120> now<00:02:12.690> ZK<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.430> wireframe<00:02:14.430> mode

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
hit the Z key now ZK is wireframe mode

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.000 
hit the Z key now ZK is wireframe mode
and<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.720> only<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.140> she's<00:02:16.410> basically<00:02:16.560> like

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and it only so she's basically like

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.980 
and it only so she's basically like
those<00:02:17.400> edges<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:20.100> objects<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.540> we<00:02:21.690> want<00:02:21.900> to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
those edges to the objects so we want to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.820 
those edges to the objects so we want to
go<00:02:22.140> there<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.900> mode<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:25.380> we<00:02:25.680> can

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
go there and that mode because we can

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.990 
go there and that mode because we can
see<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:27.590> little<00:02:28.590> plane<00:02:28.980> here<00:02:29.280> if<00:02:29.489> we<00:02:29.760> weren't

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
see the little plane here if we weren't

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.910 
see the little plane here if we weren't
in<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.630> would<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.260> kind<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.530> be<00:02:31.650> invisible

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
in it it would just kind of be invisible

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.910 
in it it would just kind of be invisible
when<00:02:32.520> we're<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.390> wireframe<00:02:33.720> mode<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.650> makes<00:02:34.830> a

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
when we're in wireframe mode it makes a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.030 
when we're in wireframe mode it makes a
little<00:02:35.160> easier<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.459> see<00:02:35.610> with<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.060> line<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.500> I

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
little easier to see with that line so I

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.479 
little easier to see with that line so I
selected<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.940> little<00:02:39.330> Domino<00:02:39.810> block<00:02:40.170> hit<00:02:41.100> G

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
selected the little Domino block hit G

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.310 
selected the little Domino block hit G
I'm<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.330> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.570> move<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.810> over<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.080> the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
I'm just going to move it over to the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.449 
I'm just going to move it over to the
edge<00:02:43.440> here<00:02:44.239> now<00:02:45.239> we<00:02:45.300> want<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.900> close<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
edge here now we want it close to the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.949 
edge here now we want it close to the
plane<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.360> doesn't<00:02:48.600> have<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.810> be<00:02:48.840> perfect<00:02:49.410> and

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
plane it doesn't have to be perfect and

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.320 
plane it doesn't have to be perfect and
so<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.080> have<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.560> whole<00:02:52.760> domino<00:02:53.760> kind<00:02:54.269> of

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
so you have a whole domino kind of

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.020 
so you have a whole domino kind of
looking<00:02:54.570> thing<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.410> our<00:02:55.560> plane<00:02:56.030> and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.820 
looking thing here and our plane and
we're<00:02:57.239> going<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.420> go<00:02:57.540> down<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.350> actors

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
all the dominoes lined up we'll zoom on

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.039 
all the dominoes lined up we'll zoom on
it<00:04:01.950> so<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.160> can<00:04:02.400> see<00:04:02.579> all<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:03.239> dominoes<00:04:03.510> lined

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
up hit the p key and they'll just fall

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.900 
up hit the p key and they'll just fall
over<00:04:07.230> like<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.859> I'll<00:04:08.430> give<00:04:08.579> you<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.760> little

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
different view piki fall over simple as

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.650 
different view piki fall over simple as
that<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:14.400> can<00:04:14.519> go<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:15.090> can<00:04:15.120> get<00:04:15.420> out<00:04:15.540> of

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
that you can go you can get out of

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.509 
that you can go you can get out of
warframe<00:04:15.989> mode<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:17.070> can<00:04:17.220> see<00:04:17.400> the

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
warframe mode so you can see the

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.969 
warframe mode so you can see the
lighting<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.180> faces<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:18.959> all<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.950> I

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
lighting and faces and all that so I

mean you can have a little fun with that
you<00:04:21.510> could<00:04:21.690> make<00:04:22.229> it<00:04:22.349> really<00:04:22.620> will

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
you could make it really will

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.469 
you could make it really will
cool<00:04:24.419> Domino<00:04:25.379> animation<00:04:25.979> and<00:04:26.400> let's<00:04:27.330> take

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
cool Domino animation and let's take

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.790 
cool Domino animation and let's take
this<00:04:27.629> look<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:28.110> bit<00:04:28.440> further<00:04:28.770> um<00:04:30.409> you<00:04:31.409> this<00:04:31.620> is

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
this look a bit further um you this is

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.920 
this look a bit further um you this is
not<00:04:31.919> just<00:04:32.129> limited<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:32.550> dominos<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.360> can<00:04:33.569> select

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
not just limited to dominos I can select

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.189 
not just limited to dominos I can select
one<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.139> these<00:04:34.289> pieces<00:04:34.530> here<00:04:34.949> hit<00:04:35.610> shifty

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
one of these pieces here hit shifty

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.869 
one of these pieces here hit shifty
rotate<00:04:37.199> it<00:04:37.430> hit<00:04:38.430> 94<00:04:39.389> rotating<00:04:40.020> 90<00:04:40.229> degrees

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879 
rotate it hit 94 rotating 90 degrees

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:45.260 
rotate it hit 94 rotating 90 degrees
second<00:04:41.879> on<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.060> top<00:04:42.470> and<00:04:44.000> kind<00:04:45.000> of<00:04:45.090> make<00:04:45.240> a

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
second on the top and kind of make a

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.149 
second on the top and kind of make a
little<00:04:45.360> building<00:04:45.870> there<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.800> go<00:04:46.949> back<00:04:47.129> into

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
little building there and go back into

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.240 
little building there and go back into
our<00:04:47.460> frame<00:04:47.819> mode<00:04:48.229> so<00:04:49.229> i<00:04:49.289> can<00:04:49.650> just<00:04:49.860> kind<00:04:50.220> of

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
our frame mode so i can just kind of

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.499 
our frame mode so i can just kind of
duplicate<00:04:50.759> these<00:04:51.379> and<00:04:53.030> just<00:04:54.030> kind<00:04:54.210> of<00:04:54.270> treat

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
duplicate these and just kind of treat

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.129 
duplicate these and just kind of treat
them<00:04:54.599> like<00:04:55.099> regular<00:04:56.099> dominoes<00:04:56.669> kind<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.180> and

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
them like regular dominoes kind of and

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.369 
them like regular dominoes kind of and
co<00:04:58.849> there<00:04:59.849> goes<00:05:00.120> it<00:05:00.330> falls<00:05:00.599> over<00:05:00.810> so<00:05:01.169> i<00:05:01.199> mean

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
little dominoes or whatever and you

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.110 
little dominoes or whatever and you
could<00:05:10.680> throw<00:05:10.919> ball<00:05:11.190> through<00:05:11.430> it<00:05:11.610> just<00:05:11.909> make

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
could throw ball through it just make

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.730 
could throw ball through it just make
little<00:05:12.300> buildings<00:05:12.960> i<00:05:13.199> mean<00:05:13.349> you<00:05:13.440> can<00:05:13.620> normally

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
little buildings i mean you can normally

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.159 
little buildings i mean you can normally
have<00:05:15.710> lots<00:05:16.710> of<00:05:16.830> fun<00:05:17.039> with<00:05:17.280> this<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.990> great

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
have lots of fun with this and the great

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.899 
have lots of fun with this and the great
thing<00:05:19.199> about<00:05:19.469> this<00:05:19.889> instead<00:05:20.460> of<00:05:20.669> real

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
thing about this instead of real

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.420 
thing about this instead of real
dominoes<00:05:21.449> that<00:05:21.840> you<00:05:22.080> can't<00:05:22.430> accidentally

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
dominoes that you can't accidentally

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.100 
dominoes that you can't accidentally
knock<00:05:23.759> them<00:05:23.969> over<00:05:24.060> and<00:05:24.330> you<00:05:24.449> can<00:05:24.479> do<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:24.930> same

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
knock them over and you can do the same

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.219 
knock them over and you can do the same
thing<00:05:25.349> over<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:25.740> over<00:05:25.919> again<00:05:26.219> and<00:05:26.930> so<00:05:27.930> let's

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
thing over and over again and so let's

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.249 
thing over and over again and so let's
say<00:05:28.380> you<00:05:28.440> wanted<00:05:28.830> to<00:05:28.949> render<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:29.490> on<00:05:30.110> you<00:05:31.110> can

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
say you wanted to render this on you can

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.850 
say you wanted to render this on you can
go<00:05:31.440> to<00:05:31.669> whoopsies<00:05:32.669> camera<00:05:33.150> but<00:05:34.080> it's<00:05:34.500> a<00:05:34.650> little

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
go to whoopsies camera but it's a little

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.159 
go to whoopsies camera but it's a little
too<00:05:35.159> close<00:05:35.460> in<00:05:35.729> so<00:05:36.120> we're<00:05:36.750> going<00:05:36.840> to<00:05:36.960> go<00:05:37.139> over

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
too close in so we're going to go over

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.029 
too close in so we're going to go over
and<00:05:37.919> pull<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.699> camera<00:05:39.060> back<00:05:39.409> from<00:05:40.409> our<00:05:40.740> area

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
and pull the camera back from our area

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.230 
and pull the camera back from our area
here<00:05:41.490> i'm<00:05:42.479> going<00:05:42.690> to<00:05:42.810> go<00:05:43.020> to<00:05:43.080> view<00:05:43.500> camera<00:05:44.240> move

now when i move forward in my time frame
it's<00:06:28.409> actually<00:06:28.620> moving<00:06:29.129> i'll<00:06:29.879> use<00:06:30.270> my<00:06:30.300> arrow

it's actually moving i'll use my arrow
keys<00:06:30.949> so<00:06:31.949> that<00:06:31.979> you<00:06:32.219> can<00:06:32.370> see<00:06:32.580> what's

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 
keys so that you can see what's

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.330 
keys so that you can see what's
happening<00:06:33.320> someone<00:06:34.320> framed

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
happening someone framed

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.280 
happening someone framed
100<00:06:36.060> right<00:06:36.210> now<00:06:36.419> and<00:06:36.750> everything<00:06:37.260> just

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 
100 right now and everything just

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.700 
100 right now and everything just
falling<00:06:38.040> over<00:06:38.370> and<00:06:38.639> so<00:06:39.180> let's<00:06:39.389> say<00:06:39.600> hit<00:06:40.169> f12<00:06:40.500> to

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
falling over and so let's say hit f12 to

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.120 
falling over and so let's say hit f12 to
render<00:06:40.830> that<00:06:42.230> you<00:06:43.230> can<00:06:43.380> see<00:06:43.590> how<00:06:43.740> it's<00:06:43.949> all

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
render that you can see how it's all

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.810 
render that you can see how it's all
half<00:06:44.840> fallen<00:06:45.840> over<00:06:46.139> N<00:06:46.320> so<00:06:47.250> I<00:06:47.280> mean<00:06:47.610> you<00:06:47.699> can

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
half fallen over N so I mean you can

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.650 
half fallen over N so I mean you can
have<00:06:48.090> a<00:06:48.120> lot<00:06:48.510> of<00:06:48.540> fun<00:06:48.900> with<00:06:49.669> the<00:06:50.669> blender<00:06:51.060> game

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 
have a lot of fun with the blender game

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.930 
have a lot of fun with the blender game
engine<00:06:51.870> and<00:06:52.500> physics<00:06:53.070> engine<00:06:53.430> I<00:06:53.580> mean<00:06:53.760> it's

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
engine and physics engine I mean it's

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.570 
engine and physics engine I mean it's
really<00:06:54.090> fun<00:06:54.419> to<00:06:54.449> just<00:06:54.750> kind<00:06:55.080> of<00:06:55.139> play<00:06:55.320> with

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
really fun to just kind of play with

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.150 
really fun to just kind of play with
make<00:06:56.580> dominoes<00:06:57.139> fall<00:06:58.139> over<00:06:58.590> make<00:06:58.889> little

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
buildings you can be just kind of

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.730 
buildings you can be just kind of
destructive<00:07:02.310> with<00:07:02.490> it<00:07:02.669> and<00:07:02.850> have<00:07:03.000> fun<00:07:03.210> with<00:07:03.419> it
