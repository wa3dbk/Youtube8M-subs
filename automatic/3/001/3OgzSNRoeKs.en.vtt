00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
they do area effect damage and they're

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.470 
they do area effect damage and they're
extremely<00:00:32.830> effective<00:00:33.640> against<00:00:33.940> light<00:00:34.120> units

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
extremely effective against light units

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.540 
extremely effective against light units
like<00:00:34.660> Marines<00:00:35.080> it's<00:00:36.070> not<00:00:36.220> going<00:00:36.310> to<00:00:36.430> work<00:00:36.490> very

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
like Marines it's not going to work very

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.910 
like Marines it's not going to work very
much<00:00:36.970> late<00:00:37.510> game<00:00:37.540> or<00:00:37.990> with<00:00:38.290> units<00:00:38.590> with<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:38.740> lot

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
much late game or with units with a lot

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.960 
much late game or with units with a lot
of<00:00:38.950> hip<00:00:39.130> points<00:00:39.400> because<00:00:39.640> you<00:00:39.730> can<00:00:39.850> see

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
of hip points because you can see

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.880 
of hip points because you can see
banelings<00:00:40.720> don't<00:00:40.900> do<00:00:41.020> that<00:00:41.200> much<00:00:41.410> damage<00:00:41.440> they

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
banelings don't do that much damage they

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.819 
banelings don't do that much damage they
do<00:00:41.950> 35<00:00:42.730> vs<00:00:43.090> light<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.510> only<00:00:43.720> 20<00:00:44.110> versus

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
do 35 vs light and only 20 versus

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.229 
do 35 vs light and only 20 versus
regular<00:00:45.010> so<00:00:45.400> that's<00:00:45.730> why<00:00:45.820> they're<00:00:45.970> so

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
regular so that's why they're so

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.390 
regular so that's why they're so
effective<00:00:46.540> against<00:00:46.930> Marines<00:00:47.290> so<00:00:48.100> you're

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
effective against Marines so you're

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.040 
effective against Marines so you're
going<00:00:48.489> to<00:00:48.579> run<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.850> banelings<00:00:49.300> in<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:49.750> then

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
going to run the banelings in and then

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.000 
going to run the banelings in and then
you're<00:00:50.200> going<00:00:50.290> to<00:00:50.380> follow<00:00:50.620> it<00:00:50.800> up<00:00:50.980> with

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
you're going to follow it up with

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.470 
you're going to follow it up with
zerglings<00:00:51.610> you<00:00:51.670> can<00:00:51.820> see<00:00:51.940> it's<00:00:52.060> a<00:00:52.149> two-on-one

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
zerglings you can see it's a two-on-one

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.210 
zerglings you can see it's a two-on-one
right<00:00:52.780> now<00:00:52.930> but<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:53.530> can<00:00:53.560> do<00:00:53.800> this<00:00:53.950> in<00:00:54.130> a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
right now but you can do this in a

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.889 
right now but you can do this in a
one-on-one<00:00:54.430> too<00:00:54.970> because<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.600> wouldn't<00:00:55.810> need

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
one-on-one too because you wouldn't need

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.240 
one-on-one too because you wouldn't need
all<00:00:56.140> those<00:00:56.260> zerglings<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:56.800> finish<00:00:57.040> it<00:00:57.160> off

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
all those zerglings to finish it off

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.430 
all those zerglings to finish it off
have<00:00:57.880> this<00:00:58.030> game<00:00:58.239> running<00:00:58.450> a<00:00:58.690> little<00:00:58.960> bit<00:00:59.140> slow

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
have this game running a little bit slow

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.210 
have this game running a little bit slow
but<00:00:59.980> let's<00:01:00.489> watch<00:01:00.700> it<00:01:00.760> go<00:01:01.860> you<00:01:02.860> can<00:01:02.980> see<00:01:03.100> the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
but let's watch it go you can see the

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.950 
but let's watch it go you can see the
banelings<00:01:03.610> have<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.910> go<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.210> first<00:01:04.509> and<00:01:04.780> you

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
banelings have to go in first and you

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.169 
banelings have to go in first and you
want<00:01:05.170> them<00:01:05.289> to<00:01:05.409> go<00:01:05.590> in<00:01:05.799> in<00:01:05.979> as<00:01:06.490> big<00:01:06.729> of<00:01:06.759> a<00:01:06.909> ball

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:07.179 
want them to go in in as big of a ball

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:09.059 
want them to go in in as big of a ball
as<00:01:07.420> they<00:01:07.630> can<00:01:07.869> so<00:01:07.899> they're<00:01:08.229> highly<00:01:08.710> clumped

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:09.069 
as they can so they're highly clumped

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.770 
as they can so they're highly clumped
because<00:01:09.609> they're<00:01:09.729> going<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:09.939> be<00:01:10.030> taken<00:01:10.389> out<00:01:10.539> at

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
because they're going to be taken out at

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.779 
because they're going to be taken out at
the<00:01:10.810> start<00:01:11.289> when<00:01:12.039> they<00:01:12.159> get<00:01:12.310> there<00:01:12.460> but<00:01:12.670> then

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
the start when they get there but then

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:13.800 
the start when they get there but then
excuse<00:01:13.119> they<00:01:13.240> get<00:01:13.389> there<00:01:13.569> they're<00:01:13.689> gonna

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
excuse they get there they're gonna

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.410 
excuse they get there they're gonna
break<00:01:14.079> those<00:01:14.289> reins<00:01:14.560> down<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:15.159> then<00:01:16.149> you<00:01:16.240> want

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
break those reins down and then you want

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.449 
break those reins down and then you want
to<00:01:16.450> immediately<00:01:16.869> follow<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.799> in<00:01:18.009> with<00:01:18.340> your

00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:18.459 
to immediately follow that in with your

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:19.679 
to immediately follow that in with your
zerglings<00:01:18.880> so<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.119> see<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.420> zerglings

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
zerglings so you see the zerglings

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.539 
zerglings so you see the zerglings
coming<00:01:20.139> in<00:01:20.229> from<00:01:20.380> behind<00:01:20.499> right<00:01:20.799> now<00:01:20.829> they

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
coming in from behind right now they

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.399 
coming in from behind right now they
broke<00:01:21.759> through<00:01:21.939> that<00:01:22.119> ball<00:01:22.479> that<00:01:22.780> wall<00:01:23.079> that

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
broke through that ball that wall that

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.590 
broke through that ball that wall that
the<00:01:23.679> ball<00:01:23.859> form<00:01:24.219> to<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.850> now<00:01:25.119> they<00:01:25.270> can<00:01:25.420> wrap

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
the ball form to and now they can wrap

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.510 
the ball form to and now they can wrap
around<00:01:25.630> these<00:01:25.990> marines<00:01:26.289> easily<00:01:27.159> take<00:01:27.369> them

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
around these marines easily take them

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.399 
around these marines easily take them
out<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:27.850> then<00:01:28.389> you<00:01:28.509> get<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.749> good<00:01:28.959> game<00:01:29.170> from

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
out and then you get the good game from

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.249 
out and then you get the good game from
your<00:01:29.590> opponent<00:01:30.039> so<00:01:30.969> that's<00:01:31.509> how<00:01:31.689> to<00:01:31.749> baneling

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
your opponent so that's how to baneling

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.779 
your opponent so that's how to baneling
ballbust<00:01:32.740> remember<00:01:33.100> it's<00:01:33.279> not<00:01:33.429> going<00:01:33.609> to<00:01:33.700> be

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
ballbust remember it's not going to be

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.239 
ballbust remember it's not going to be
that<00:01:33.819> great<00:01:34.119> late<00:01:34.420> game<00:01:34.779> but<00:01:35.560> it's<00:01:35.829> extremely

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249 
that great late game but it's extremely
