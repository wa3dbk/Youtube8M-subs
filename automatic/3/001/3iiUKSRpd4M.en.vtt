00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.670 
ok use your eggs wisely you can't kill
you<00:02:26.489> but<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:27.660> shoot<00:02:27.870> him<00:02:28.020> while<00:02:28.170> he's<00:02:28.350> living

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
you but to shoot him while he's living

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.170 
you but to shoot him while he's living
so<00:02:28.800> they<00:02:28.920> ricochet<00:02:29.100> off<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.520> walls<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.120> you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
so they ricochet off the walls and you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.550 
so they ricochet off the walls and you
get<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> most<00:02:30.570> use<00:02:30.780> out<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.080> them<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.350> can

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
get the most use out of them you can

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.650 
get the most use out of them you can
possible<00:02:33.170> secret<00:02:34.170> there<00:02:35.209> that's<00:02:36.209> pretty<00:02:36.510> good

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
possible secret there that's pretty good

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.260 
possible secret there that's pretty good
it's<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:37.890> bad<00:02:38.540> got<00:02:39.540> um<00:02:39.750> yeah<00:02:40.100> four<00:02:41.100> eggs<00:02:41.340> ok

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
it's not bad got um yeah four eggs ok

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.030 
it's not bad got um yeah four eggs ok
now<00:02:43.840> make<00:02:44.020> sure<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.200> ricochet<00:02:44.710> them<00:02:44.890> in

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
now make sure you ricochet them in

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.550 
now make sure you ricochet them in
straight<00:02:45.430> or<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.390> straight<00:02:46.720> as<00:02:46.840> possible<00:02:46.900> line

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
straight or a straight as possible line

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.140 
straight or a straight as possible line
so<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.860> have<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.190> best<00:02:48.400> chance<00:02:48.490> of<00:02:48.820> hitting<00:02:48.970> a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
so you have the best chance of hitting a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.870 
so you have the best chance of hitting a
multiple<00:02:49.630> times<00:02:49.660> with<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.170> same<00:02:50.200> egg<00:02:50.880> all

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
multiple times with the same egg all

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.900 
multiple times with the same egg all
right<00:02:52.060> now<00:02:52.240> go<00:02:52.420> back<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:53.200> way<00:02:53.700> remember<00:02:54.700> down

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
right now go back this way remember down

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.930 
right now go back this way remember down
is<00:02:55.150> death<00:02:55.710> even<00:02:56.710> though<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:56.800> pipe<00:02:57.250> leads<00:02:57.640> you

is death even though I pipe leads you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.060 
is death even though I pipe leads you
down<00:02:57.970> there<00:02:58.570> if<00:02:59.050> you<00:02:59.170> go<00:02:59.290> down<00:02:59.560> there<00:02:59.890> by

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
down there if you go down there by

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.860 
down there if you go down there by
falling<00:03:00.610> you'll<00:03:00.760> die<00:03:00.970> what<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.450> heck<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.630> up

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
falling you'll die what the heck is up

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.180 
falling you'll die what the heck is up
with<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.160> can<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.250> believe<00:03:03.520> that<00:03:04.920> ok<00:03:05.920> I'll
