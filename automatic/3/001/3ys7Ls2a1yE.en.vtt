this is building on our prior experience

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.620 
this is building on our prior experience
and<00:03:43.050> if<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.890> trial<00:03:44.280> shows<00:03:44.610> what<00:03:44.940> previous

and if this trial shows what previous

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.559 
and if this trial shows what previous
trials<00:03:45.989> have<00:03:46.170> shown<00:03:46.549> this<00:03:47.549> will<00:03:47.790> ultimately

trials have shown this will ultimately

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.490 
trials have shown this will ultimately
lead<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.280> approval<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.870> therapy<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:52.200> the

and see the future today is is that with

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.040 
and see the future today is is that with
the<00:04:04.440> next<00:04:04.920> few<00:04:05.520> years<00:04:05.550> maybe<00:04:06.270> even<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.840> couple

the next few years maybe even a couple
of<00:04:07.200> years<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.860> will<00:04:08.010> be<00:04:08.070> possible<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.330> have

might develop the risk of side effects
up<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.290> drugs<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.950> health<00:04:38.760> hopefully

up to drugs and health hopefully
therefore<00:04:39.930> better<00:04:40.560> treatment<00:04:41.310> better
