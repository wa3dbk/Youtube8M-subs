00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.370
 it usually happens that we only take advantage of 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.830
 exterior spaces of the house when 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.059
 the weather accompanies us and with that we 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.939
 we lose all the benefits that we 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.470
 gives a courtyard the informality the 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.540
 camaraderie the opportunity to power 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.090
 share with freedom and relax with 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.829
 several people all things more than 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.810
 compatible when we get together with the 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.790
 family and with friends to was a 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.470
 football game and which one is the best 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.809
 all instances to meet with 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.239
 yours without a doubt that around the 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.920
 table a good roast a meal and that's what 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.840
 that we want to make today a center of 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.880
 outside kitchen to be able to see the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.470
 globally as the first thing that 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.760
 we have to do is define where 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.370
 we want to leave the kitchen center 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.280
 obviously you want outside and permanent 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.570
 you have to be indoors 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 our project will be the combination of 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.440
 a folding work table and a 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.960
 support for a gas grill so we 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.820
 to do based on a module of 85 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.670
 centimeters tall and at the ideal height 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.680
 to be able to cook with pieces that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.979
 open to the sides to be able to bend 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.259
 from 70 centimeters to 140 and with an area 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.450
 bottom divided into two one that will be 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.149
 open and the other that will be closed for 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.649
 can leave a value of 2 kilos we are going to 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.289
 starting by assembling the two structures 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.149
 lateral the four vertical pieces 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.360
 we are going to make them with brushed pine 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.399
 2 inches and the horizontal pieces that 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.149
 In total there are 8 we will do with pine 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.149
 3 inches 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.480
 ah 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.200
 when we have these two armed 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.360
 structures in the shape of letters and 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.240
 we join with the crossbars the four 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.680
 short crossmembers me in 29 centimeters and 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.680
 the four long 60 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.019
 remember that all the measures of this 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.269
 project and the codes of the products 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.819
 that we are using are in pdf for your 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.830
 free download at www dot do it this 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.790
 same point cl to take it to the 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.769
 shop and buy just what is necessary 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.870
 at the bottom we are going to put a 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.239
 piece of pine grooving 60 x 32 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.430
 centimeters and we're going to leave it swallowed 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.019
 one centimeter deep to 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.879
 fix it let's occupy squares 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.200
 2-inch metal screws and 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.480
 3/4 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.859
 we chose this slotted wood because the 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.750
 we can buy dimensioned in the 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.140
 store and because it will give warmth to 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.140
 draft 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.380
 to assemble the cabinets we divide the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.900
 interior with a pine frame 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.640
 brushed and tered grooved with the 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.290
 same slotted fabric we cover the 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.290
 side of the cabinet for gas 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.080
 the main deck has a measure 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.750
 70 x 40 centimeters and we're going to 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.239
 leave with the slots down from 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.690
 this way the two covers that go 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.580
 above have a measure of 34 x 40 each 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.050
 one and we're going to leave it with the slots 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.030
 upwards 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.940
 we are going to occupy hinges to be able 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.860
 deploy them in this way and so we are going 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.510
 to be a work cover of a 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.860
 meter 40 long the problem that 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.800
 we have is how to extend so 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.860
 horizontal these side covers the 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.450
 solution is the following we will 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.310
 manufacture four pieces four supports 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.960
 of bars with this pine seed of two 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.020
 for one we are going to make a small 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.930
 pierced to this same piece and here in the 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.700
 crossbars thing that these supports of 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.680
 bars can be moved 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.680
 horizontal in this way 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.620
 the draft of the bar will be 25 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:28.639
 centimeters and the crossbar will have 2 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.639
 x 2 centimeters 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.759
 with the ready structure we apply with 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.259
 spatula colored paste challenges pine 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.739
 insigne to cover the head of the 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.719
 screws 

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:01.719
 We hope it dries and then we choose 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.300
 the doors of 29 x 53 and all the rest 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.700
 of the furniture the structure we are going to 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.170
 paint with a sand colored wash to 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.360
 decrease the intensity of the 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.340
 vein the main deck and 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.280
 laterals plus the supports we're going to 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.570
 paint with a gray paint because 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.780
 then we will combine it with our 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.780
 material 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.960
 once it's all dry we're going to 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.030
 install the hinges on the doors 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.460
 for this project we are going to use these 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.930
 hinges robocop that the great grace that 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.850
 they have is that they fulfill the function of a 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.150
 straight hinge and a curve to it 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.150
 weather 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:41.650
 We will fix the main cover to 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.650
 the structure of the furniture with squares 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.590
 finally the slate stone palmetto 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.200
 we cut it to the measure of the covers 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.180
 Folding with angle grinder and disc 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.130
 cut for stones we paste it with 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.130
 neutral silicone and calafat gun was 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.150
 to join the folding pieces we use 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.150
 Mass in Abyan or 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.000
 how the gas balloon will go in this area 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.590
 let's make a draft in the vertical 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.700
 inside so you can pass the 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.700
 Hose rod 

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:53.349
 the choripanes are adults with this 

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:55.059
 world event center but the only thing 

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:56.739
 lack is to keep the boss happy 

00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:58.299
 because surely all friends are going to 

00:07:56.739 --> 00:08:00.279
 want to come to the parties here to the 

00:07:58.299 --> 00:08:02.979
 house if you have any doubt about this 

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:05.109
 program you know www point in light of the 

00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:06.669
 same point cl can make us all the 

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:10.049
 questions they want and we answer them 

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:10.049
 we all see each other chao chao
