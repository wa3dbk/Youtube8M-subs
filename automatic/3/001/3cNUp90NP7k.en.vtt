ten bucks
oh<00:00:11.099> no<00:00:11.280> let's<00:00:11.580> do<00:00:11.759> it

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.100 

that<00:00:18.290> rent<00:00:18.470> doesn't<00:00:18.650> look<00:00:18.830> good<00:00:19.420> yeah<00:00:20.420> I<00:00:20.780> think

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
that rent doesn't look good yeah I think

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.780 
that rent doesn't look good yeah I think
so<00:00:21.350> myself<00:00:21.560> as<00:00:21.860> well<00:00:22.040> yeah<00:00:22.220> looks<00:00:22.700> a<00:00:22.760> bit

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
so myself as well yeah looks a bit

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.450 
so myself as well yeah looks a bit
faster<00:00:23.450> I<00:00:23.630> was<00:00:23.779> gonna<00:00:23.900> say<00:00:24.140> looks<00:00:24.350> faster<00:00:24.830> just

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
faster I was gonna say looks faster just

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.650 
faster I was gonna say looks faster just
out<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:25.910> job<00:00:26.119> done

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
out the job done

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.600 
out the job done
exactly<00:00:27.740> well<00:00:28.250> there<00:00:28.369> are<00:00:28.460> some

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
exactly well there are some

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.429 
exactly well there are some
modifications<00:00:28.849> in<00:00:29.360> the<00:00:29.390> last<00:00:29.779> year<00:00:29.960> really

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
modifications in the last year really

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.970 
modifications in the last year really
yeah<00:00:30.860> we<00:00:31.040> change<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:31.400> cable<00:00:31.700> running<00:00:31.870> okay

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
yeah we change the cable running okay

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.290 
yeah we change the cable running okay
it's<00:00:33.980> a<00:00:34.040> little<00:00:34.430> bit<00:00:34.520> difficult<00:00:34.699> to<00:00:34.940> spot<00:00:35.180> on

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
it's a little bit difficult to spot on

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.490 
it's a little bit difficult to spot on
this<00:00:35.420> one<00:00:35.480> because<00:00:35.809> this<00:00:35.930> is<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.140> early

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
this one because this is the early

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.619 
this one because this is the early
prototype<00:00:36.949> stage<00:00:37.160> but<00:00:38.030> what<00:00:38.120> we<00:00:38.239> found<00:00:38.449> is

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
prototype stage but what we found is

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.420 
prototype stage but what we found is
instead<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.230> having<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.590> cables<00:00:39.949> go<00:00:40.040> all<00:00:40.309> the

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
instead of having the cables go all the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.390 
instead of having the cables go all the
way<00:00:40.460> in<00:00:40.790> we<00:00:41.390> let's<00:00:42.110> see<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.290> clip<00:00:42.650> and<00:00:43.100> on<00:00:43.250> the

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
way in we let's see the clip and on the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.720 
way in we let's see the clip and on the
the<00:00:43.970> old<00:00:44.120> wine<00:00:44.330> yeah<00:00:44.739> now<00:00:45.739> it's<00:00:45.949> moving<00:00:46.489> so

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
the old wine yeah now it's moving so

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.160 
the old wine yeah now it's moving so
they're<00:00:46.940> three<00:00:47.300> stainless<00:00:47.629> steel<00:00:47.930> chips

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
they're three stainless steel chips

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.380 
they're three stainless steel chips
going<00:00:48.680> like<00:00:48.890> this<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.460> they're<00:00:49.820> mobile<00:00:50.120> into

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
going like this and they're mobile into

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.509 
going like this and they're mobile into
the<00:00:50.479> frame<00:00:50.720> right<00:00:52.180> so<00:00:53.199> first<00:00:54.199> that<00:00:54.860> benefit<00:00:55.370> is

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
the frame right so first that benefit is

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.479 
the frame right so first that benefit is
that<00:00:55.760> it's<00:00:56.030> easier<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.600> set<00:00:56.930> up<00:00:56.960> yeah<00:00:57.589> the

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
that it's easier to set up yeah the

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.850 
that it's easier to set up yeah the
second<00:00:58.850> benefit<00:00:59.239> is<00:00:59.449> that<00:00:59.809> the<00:01:00.199> shifting<00:01:00.739> is

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
second benefit is that the shifting is

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.149 
second benefit is that the shifting is
is<00:01:01.070> include<00:01:01.820> point<00:01:02.120> at<00:01:02.409> the<00:01:03.409> outgoing<00:01:03.769> angle

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
is include point at the outgoing angle

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.670 
is include point at the outgoing angle
of<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.430> inner<00:01:04.610> cable<00:01:05.470> controlled<00:01:06.470> by<00:01:06.620> the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
of the inner cable controlled by the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.980 
of the inner cable controlled by the
tubes<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.640> when<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.150> change<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.450> size<00:01:08.540> of<00:01:08.869> the

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
tubes so when you change the size of the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.810 
tubes so when you change the size of the
bike<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.680> angle<00:01:09.979> of<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.190> tube<00:01:10.369> change<00:01:10.640> as

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
bike the angle of the tube change as

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.789 
bike the angle of the tube change as
well<00:01:10.970> right<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:11.810> therefore<00:01:12.260> we<00:01:12.350> can<00:01:12.530> control

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
well right so therefore we can control

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.310 
well right so therefore we can control
the<00:01:12.950> outgoing<00:01:13.450> inner<00:01:14.450> cable<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.020> their<00:01:15.140> verb

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
the outgoing inner cable and their verb

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.160 
the outgoing inner cable and their verb
is<00:01:15.530> shifting<00:01:16.340> his<00:01:16.400> way<00:01:16.580> smoother<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.540> as<00:01:18.049> an

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
is shifting his way smoother and as an

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.880 
is shifting his way smoother and as an
extra<00:01:18.409> benefit<00:01:18.880> where's<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.060> last<00:01:20.360> cable

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
extra benefit where's the last cable

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.390 
extra benefit where's the last cable
it's<00:01:21.890> for<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.159> rebate

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
it's for the rebate

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.790 
it's for the rebate
and<00:01:23.910> now<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> piece<00:01:25.020> hole<00:01:25.230> will<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.620> a

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
and now the piece hole will have a

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
and now the piece hole will have a
chemical<00:01:26.160> sample<00:01:28.070> right<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.670> put<00:01:29.790> a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
chemical sample right so you can put a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.970 
chemical sample right so you can put a
barrel<00:01:30.210> adjuster<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> frame<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.800> can

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
barrel adjuster in the frame and you can

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:41.810 
barrel adjuster in the frame and you can
adjust<00:01:35.120> simple<00:01:36.120> but<00:01:36.560> yeah<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.800> is<00:01:38.480> and<00:01:40.010> is<00:01:41.010> this

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
adjust simple but yeah it is and is this

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.140 
adjust simple but yeah it is and is this
Mike<00:01:42.060> afraid<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.230> is<00:01:43.350> er<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:45.200> work<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.940> where

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
Mike afraid this is er to work and where

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.330 
Mike afraid this is er to work and where
would<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.620> controlled<00:01:49.620> is<00:01:49.800> there<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.980> leave<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
would be controlled is there a leave a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
would be controlled is there a leave a
specific<00:01:50.790> point<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> control<00:01:51.540> unit<00:01:51.570> circle

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
specific point the control unit circle

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.870 
specific point the control unit circle
and<00:01:52.440> it's<00:01:52.800> basically<00:01:53.280> after<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.550> could<00:01:53.760> you

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
and it's basically after the could you

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:07.760 
and it's basically after the could you
run<00:01:58.880> any<00:02:00.230> any<00:02:01.230> word<00:02:01.410> on<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.650> p5<00:02:02.010> yet<00:02:05.420> well<00:02:06.770> at

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
run any any word on the p5 yet well at

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.810 
run any any word on the p5 yet well at
some<00:02:07.920> point<00:02:07.980> in<00:02:08.280> time<00:02:08.310> there<00:02:08.670> will<00:02:08.790> be

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
some point in time there will be

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.740 
some point in time there will be
beatified<00:02:09.890> that's<00:02:10.890> for<00:02:11.040> sure<00:02:11.300> yeah<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.570> think

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
beatified that's for sure yeah I think

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.520 
beatified that's for sure yeah I think
you<00:02:12.870> could<00:02:12.960> say<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.320> is<00:02:13.410> red

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
you could say that is red

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.770 
you could say that is red
thanks<00:02:16.530> very<00:02:16.680> much
