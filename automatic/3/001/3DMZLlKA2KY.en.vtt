00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
circle for the year as you use this roll

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.160 
circle for the year as you use this roll
of<00:01:50.759> duct<00:01:51.000> tape<00:01:51.530> just<00:01:52.530> put<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.659> drew<00:01:54.659> inside

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
of duct tape just put it on drew inside

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.160 
of duct tape just put it on drew inside
of<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.380> duct<00:01:55.560> tape<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.420> get<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> perfect<00:01:57.930> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
of the duct tape to get the perfect to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.230 
of the duct tape to get the perfect to
get<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> perfect<00:01:58.890> circle<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.520> I<00:02:00.000> think

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
get like a perfect circle and I think

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.280 
get like a perfect circle and I think
what<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> might<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.869> little<00:02:04.049> bit

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
what I might do to get that little bit

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.010 
what I might do to get that little bit
extra<00:02:04.409> bigger<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.299> want<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.899> can

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
extra bigger if I want to see if I can

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.229 
extra bigger if I want to see if I can
find<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.469> either<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.220> an<00:02:08.369> old<00:02:08.550> roll<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.060> duct

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
find it either like an old roll of duct

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.830 
find it either like an old roll of duct
tape<00:02:09.270> or<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.619> might<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.420> take<00:02:12.420> some<00:02:12.780> of

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
tape or I might have to take some of

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.320 
tape or I might have to take some of
this<00:02:13.020> off

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
this off

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.050 
this off
where<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.569> use<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:15.960> all<00:02:16.200> down<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.819> others

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
where it use it all down but so others

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.670 
where it use it all down but so others
can<00:02:18.209> leave<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> little<00:02:18.660> bit<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.050> duct<00:02:19.260> tape<00:02:19.290> on

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
can leave a little bit of duct tape on

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.620 
can leave a little bit of duct tape on
to<00:02:19.980> make<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> little<00:02:20.430> bit<00:02:20.550> thicker<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.600> I

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
to make a little bit thicker so that I

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.120 
to make a little bit thicker so that I
can<00:02:21.720> actually<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.200> lip<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.040> have

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
can actually get the lip so I can have

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.699 
can actually get the lip so I can have
the<00:02:23.220> ear<00:02:23.430> which<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.060> inside<00:02:24.480> shape<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.110> then

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
the ear which is inside shape and then

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.340 
the ear which is inside shape and then
the<00:02:25.980> little<00:02:27.350> outside<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.410> side<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.950> head

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
the little outside the side of the head

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.540 
the little outside the side of the head
for<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.440> outside<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.040> go<00:02:32.220> around<00:02:32.280> it

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
for the outside and just go around it

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.800 
for the outside and just go around it
like<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:32.910> I'm<00:02:32.970> gonna<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.270> two<00:02:33.600> perfect

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
like that so I'm gonna have two perfect

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.800 
like that so I'm gonna have two perfect
circles<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:35.280> go<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:37.850> guess<00:02:38.850> like<00:02:39.270> said<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
circles to go on I guess like said the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.290 
circles to go on I guess like said the
eyes<00:02:39.959> at<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.320> moment<00:02:40.739> thems<00:02:41.640> leaving<00:02:41.760> them<00:02:42.150> as

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
eyes at the moment thems leaving them as

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.790 
eyes at the moment thems leaving them as
they<00:02:42.510> are<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.080> kind<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.350> position

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
they are so I can kind of position

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.180 
they are so I can kind of position
things<00:02:45.350> just<00:02:46.350> up<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.680> side<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.070> head

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
things just up in the side of the head

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.640 
things just up in the side of the head
doing<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.550> same<00:02:47.700> as<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.090> other<00:02:48.209> side<00:02:48.590> out<00:02:49.590> of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
doing the same as the other side out of

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.570 
doing the same as the other side out of
a<00:02:49.950> bit<00:02:50.130> more<00:02:50.280> thickness<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.910> clay<00:02:51.290> because

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
a bit more thickness to the clay because

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.970 
a bit more thickness to the clay because
to<00:02:53.580> me<00:02:53.760> when<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.420> look<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.810> front<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
to me when I look to the front the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.000 
to me when I look to the front the
faceplate<00:02:56.459> seemed<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.940> go<00:02:57.140> round<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.650> tues

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
faceplate seemed to go round and tues

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.560 
faceplate seemed to go round and tues
straight<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.720> on<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:01.050> become<00:03:01.380> more<00:03:01.769> rounder

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
straight so on to become more rounder

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.190 
straight so on to become more rounder
before<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.780> was<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.930> bit<00:03:04.140> going<00:03:04.400> round<00:03:05.400> straight

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
before it was a bit going round straight

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.830 
before it was a bit going round straight
which<00:03:07.200> didn't<00:03:07.470> look<00:03:07.560> right<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.950> me<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:09.090> I've

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
which didn't look right to me so I've

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.550 
which didn't look right to me so I've
just<00:03:10.830> altered<00:03:11.519> that<00:03:11.850> by<00:03:12.720> thickening<00:03:13.140> up<00:03:13.380> this

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
just altered that by thickening up this

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.509 
just altered that by thickening up this
side<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.360> thickness<00:03:15.720> there<00:03:16.620> that's<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
side just the thickness there that's the

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.740 
side just the thickness there that's the
amount<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.850> put<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:19.650> see<00:03:20.299> about<00:03:21.299> half<00:03:21.630> of

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
amount of put on you see about half of

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.490 
amount of put on you see about half of
the<00:03:21.870> nails<00:03:23.180> thickness<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.450> I'm<00:03:25.260> doing<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
the nails thickness and I'm doing the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.330 
the nails thickness and I'm doing the
same<00:03:25.709> on<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.220> side<00:03:26.280> as<00:03:26.760> well<00:03:28.940> then<00:03:31.070> I'll<00:03:32.070> tell

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
same on this side as well then I'll tell

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.650 
same on this side as well then I'll tell
you<00:03:32.459> okay<00:03:33.180> i<00:03:33.209> also<00:03:33.480> bought<00:03:33.840> some<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.230> these<00:03:35.660> air

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
you okay i also bought some of these air

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.080 
you okay i also bought some of these air
dusters<00:03:37.230> for<00:03:37.440> keyboards<00:03:37.980> no<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.670> compressed

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
dusters for keyboards no the compressed

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.930 
dusters for keyboards no the compressed
air<00:03:41.510> if<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.690> spray<00:03:42.900> them<00:03:43.049> normally<00:03:43.470> yet<00:03:44.010> just

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
air if you spray them normally yet just

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.380 
air if you spray them normally yet just
air<00:03:45.269> but<00:03:46.200> with<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.860> nhp<00:03:47.180> obviously<00:03:48.180> because

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
air but with the nhp obviously because

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.690 
air but with the nhp obviously because
it<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.630> become<00:03:48.840> really<00:03:49.440> soft<00:03:49.739> if<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.489> turn

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
it can become really soft if you turn

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.810 
it can become really soft if you turn
the<00:03:50.880> cams<00:03:51.299> upside<00:03:51.840> down<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.440> blast<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.459> yes<00:03:53.670> we

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
the cams upside down and blast it yes we

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.580 
the cams upside down and blast it yes we
get<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.000> blast<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.360> little<00:03:54.570> lick<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.989> liquid

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
get a blast a little lick the liquid

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.270 
get a blast a little lick the liquid
that's<00:03:55.739> in<00:03:55.890> there<00:03:57.200> which<00:03:58.200> freezes<00:03:58.620> what

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
that's in there which freezes what

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.460 
that's in there which freezes what
doesn't<00:03:59.489> freeze<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.910> clay<00:04:00.150> but<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.750> obviously

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
doesn't freeze the clay but it obviously

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.400 
doesn't freeze the clay but it obviously
makes<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.130> lot<00:04:02.250> harder<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:03.810> lot<00:04:04.079> more

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
makes it a lot harder and a lot more

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.600 
makes it a lot harder and a lot more
easier<00:04:04.950> i'm<00:04:05.070> not<00:04:05.190> going<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.370> do<00:04:05.459> this

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
easier i'm not going to do this

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.220 
easier i'm not going to do this
obviously<00:04:05.940> kind<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.540> got<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:06.720> how<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:06.870> want<00:04:06.959> it

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
obviously kind of got it how I want it

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.920 
obviously kind of got it how I want it
but<00:04:08.690> instead<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.870> carving<00:04:10.680> soft<00:04:11.609> clay<00:04:11.940> you

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
but instead of carving soft clay you

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.360 
but instead of carving soft clay you
spray<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.290> upside<00:04:13.620> down<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.130> give<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.280> a

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
spray that upside down and it give it a

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.090 
spray that upside down and it give it a
blast<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.289> it<00:04:16.289> hardens<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.709> clay<00:04:16.950> up

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
blast of that and it hardens the clay up

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.180 
blast of that and it hardens the clay up
to<00:04:17.250> make<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.820> lot<00:04:18.359> easier<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.840> carve<00:04:19.079> into<00:04:19.350> so

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
to make it a lot easier to carve into so

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.940 
to make it a lot easier to carve into so
you<00:04:20.250> can<00:04:20.370> carve<00:04:20.579> more<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.870> better<00:04:22.710> shapes

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
you can carve more the better shapes

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.560 
you can carve more the better shapes
rather<00:04:23.190> than<00:04:23.340> digging<00:04:23.550> into<00:04:23.849> the<00:04:24.060> soft<00:04:24.300> clay

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
rather than digging into the soft clay

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.820 
rather than digging into the soft clay
as<00:04:24.810> much<00:04:25.700> so<00:04:26.700> that's<00:04:26.849> a<00:04:26.910> good<00:04:27.030> thing

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
as much so that's a good thing

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.950 
as much so that's a good thing
I'll<00:04:28.370> show<00:04:28.639> you<00:04:29.439> so<00:04:30.439> far<00:04:30.710> on<00:04:31.009> this<00:04:31.810> sculpt<00:04:32.810> I've

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
I'll show you so far on this sculpt I've

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.409 
I'll show you so far on this sculpt I've
used<00:04:33.289> for<00:04:34.120> blocks<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.419> nsp<00:04:35.990> a<00:04:36.939> chevron<00:04:37.939> nsp

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
used for blocks of the nsp a chevron nsp

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.249 
used for blocks of the nsp a chevron nsp
medium<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.520> this<00:04:40.520> is<00:04:40.639> my<00:04:40.789> last<00:04:40.969> block<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:41.539> I

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
medium and this is my last block and I

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.439 
medium and this is my last block and I
think<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.860> I'm<00:04:43.159> not<00:04:43.759> even<00:04:43.939> going<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.090> use<00:04:44.270> all

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
think that I'm not even going to use all

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.300 
think that I'm not even going to use all
of<00:04:44.569> this<00:04:44.780> I<00:04:45.020> was<00:04:45.500> kind<00:04:45.740> of<00:04:45.889> thinking<00:04:45.949> about

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
of this I was kind of thinking about

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.089 
of this I was kind of thinking about
ordering<00:04:46.669> more<00:04:47.090> last<00:04:47.389> week<00:04:47.629> I<00:04:47.930> was<00:04:48.259> like<00:04:48.439> maybe

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
ordering more last week I was like maybe

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.459 
ordering more last week I was like maybe
I<00:04:49.250> should<00:04:49.460> order<00:04:49.639> more<00:04:49.789> because<00:04:50.180> i'm<00:04:50.990> not<00:04:51.289> sure

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:51.469 
I should order more because i'm not sure

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:53.529 
I should order more because i'm not sure
if<00:04:51.650> I'm<00:04:52.580> gonna<00:04:52.849> be<00:04:52.939> able<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.180> get<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.330> all<00:04:53.509> done

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
if I'm gonna be able to get it all done

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.100 
if I'm gonna be able to get it all done
with<00:04:53.960> just<00:04:54.469> five<00:04:54.860> blocks<00:04:55.099> but<00:04:56.030> so<00:04:56.509> far<00:04:56.719> this<00:04:56.930> is

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
with just five blocks but so far this is

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.659 
with just five blocks but so far this is
for<00:04:57.409> books<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:58.990> I've<00:04:59.990> got<00:05:00.110> one<00:05:00.319> block<00:05:00.530> left<00:05:00.669> so

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
for books and I've got one block left so

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.290 
for books and I've got one block left so
I<00:05:02.229> think<00:05:03.229> that<00:05:03.349> I<00:05:03.800> should<00:05:04.039> be<00:05:04.219> fine<00:05:04.520> with<00:05:05.030> five

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
I think that I should be fine with five

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.110 
I think that I should be fine with five
blocks<00:05:07.569> which<00:05:08.569> is<00:05:08.690> not<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.870> bad<00:05:08.960> amount<00:05:10.120> okay

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
blocks which is not a bad amount okay

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.719 
blocks which is not a bad amount okay
I've<00:05:11.419> been<00:05:11.569> heating<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.979> clay<00:05:13.190> with<00:05:13.400> my<00:05:13.520> heat

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
I've been heating the clay with my heat

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.499 
I've been heating the clay with my heat
gun<00:05:13.759> to<00:05:15.550> give<00:05:16.550> it<00:05:16.639> a<00:05:16.699> more<00:05:17.620> malleable<00:05:18.620> state

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
gun to give it a more malleable state

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.180 
gun to give it a more malleable state
and<00:05:20.509> rubbing<00:05:21.409> it<00:05:21.440> in<00:05:21.560> my<00:05:21.590> hands<00:05:22.009> and<00:05:22.129> then

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
and rubbing it in my hands and then

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.800 
and rubbing it in my hands and then
putting<00:05:22.460> it<00:05:22.550> on<00:05:22.669> and<00:05:22.909> it<00:05:22.940> sticks<00:05:23.180> a<00:05:23.360> heck<00:05:23.599> of<00:05:23.629> a

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
putting it on and it sticks a heck of a

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.200 
putting it on and it sticks a heck of a
lot<00:05:23.960> better<00:05:24.020> if<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.650> heat<00:05:24.830> it<00:05:24.860> up<00:05:25.039> first<00:05:25.400> then

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
lot better if you heat it up first then

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.999 
lot better if you heat it up first then
if<00:05:26.539> you<00:05:26.750> just<00:05:26.930> put<00:05:27.169> it<00:05:27.259> straight<00:05:27.469> roll<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:27.949> and

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
if you just put it straight roll it and

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.439 
if you just put it straight roll it and
put<00:05:28.219> it<00:05:28.250> straight<00:05:28.490> on<00:05:28.699> there<00:05:28.879> you<00:05:29.000> roll<00:05:29.150> it<00:05:29.270> put

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
put it straight on there you roll it put

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.089 
put it straight on there you roll it put
it<00:05:29.539> straight<00:05:29.629> on<00:05:29.810> it<00:05:29.930> seems<00:05:30.139> to<00:05:30.289> stay<00:05:30.919> in

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
it straight on it seems to stay in

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.619 
it straight on it seems to stay in
certain<00:05:31.520> blocks<00:05:31.729> but<00:05:31.940> when<00:05:32.120> you<00:05:32.210> heat<00:05:32.389> it<00:05:32.419> up

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 
certain blocks but when you heat it up

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.619 
certain blocks but when you heat it up
it<00:05:33.310> kind<00:05:34.310> of<00:05:34.430> blends<00:05:34.699> into<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.120> whole<00:05:35.360> thing

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629 
it kind of blends into the whole thing

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.689 
it kind of blends into the whole thing
so<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:35.930> don't<00:05:36.139> have<00:05:36.259> any<00:05:36.409> problems<00:05:37.009> so<00:05:37.580> we'll

so you don't have any problems so we'll
recommend<00:05:38.120> heating<00:05:38.449> it<00:05:38.539> if<00:05:38.659> you're<00:05:38.750> going<00:05:38.870> to

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
recommend heating it if you're going to

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.059 
recommend heating it if you're going to
use<00:05:39.550> nsp<00:05:40.550> or<00:05:40.849> any<00:05:41.659> kind<00:05:41.930> of<00:05:42.139> plasticine<00:05:42.800> like

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
use nsp or any kind of plasticine like

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:48.999
