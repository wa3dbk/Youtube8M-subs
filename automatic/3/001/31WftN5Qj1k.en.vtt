that's gotten another it doesn't

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.990 
that's gotten another it doesn't
necessarily<00:01:54.840> mean<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.399> wrong<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
necessarily mean it's right or wrong and

necessarily mean it's right or wrong and
there's<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.270> lot<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.570> different<00:01:58.020> ways<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
there's a lot of different ways to do a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.670 
there's a lot of different ways to do a
lot<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.280> different<00:01:59.549> things<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
lot of different things so here is a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.020 
lot of different things so here is a
half<00:02:02.540> treble<00:02:03.540> crochet<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.579> treble

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
half treble crochet so in a treble

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.730 
half treble crochet so in a treble
crochet<00:02:06.210> you're<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> yarn<00:02:07.320> over<00:02:07.710> twice

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
crochet you're going to yarn over twice

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.699 
crochet you're going to yarn over twice
and<00:02:08.610> that's<00:02:08.849> what<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.500> half

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
and that's what you do in the half

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.780 
and that's what you do in the half
trouble<00:02:11.160> also<00:02:11.660> so

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
trouble also so

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.470 
trouble also so
you<00:02:13.180> yarn<00:02:13.510> over<00:02:13.840> twice<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.250> then<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.969> insert

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
you yarn over twice and then you insert

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.349 
you yarn over twice and then you insert
your<00:02:16.719> hook<00:02:17.109> from<00:02:17.379> front<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:18.129> back<00:02:18.310> through<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
neck stitch you want to work in I'm

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.190 
neck stitch you want to work in I'm
going<00:02:21.430> underneath<00:02:21.760> those<00:02:22.120> two<00:02:22.359> strands<00:02:23.049> and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
going underneath those two strands and

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.920 
going underneath those two strands and
then<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.459> hook<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:24.909> back<00:02:25.090> turns<00:02:25.540> up<00:02:25.780> a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
then the hook in the back turns up a

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.630 
then the hook in the back turns up a
little<00:02:26.140> bit<00:02:26.439> and<00:02:26.769> then<00:02:27.069> I'm<00:02:27.159> going<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.370> yarn

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
little bit and then I'm going to yarn

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.860 
little bit and then I'm going to yarn
over<00:02:28.239> draw<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:29.319> loop<00:02:29.709> up<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.569> then<00:02:31.569> I'm

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
over draw that loop up and then I'm

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.949 
over draw that loop up and then I'm
going<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.049> give<00:02:32.349> these<00:02:32.560> some<00:02:33.299> pull<00:02:34.299> right<00:02:34.599> here

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
going to give these some pull right here

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.869 
going to give these some pull right here
so<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.379> they're<00:02:35.590> kind<00:02:35.859> of<00:02:35.980> even<00:02:36.430> there

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
so that they're kind of even there

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.640
