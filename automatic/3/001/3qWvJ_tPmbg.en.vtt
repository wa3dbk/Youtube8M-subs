00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.360
 very welcome to this sketch course 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.400
 up 2013 my name is carolina botero and 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.529
 I will accompany you in a series of 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.980
 tutorial videos where are we going to go 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.989
 learning step by step how to use 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.349
 this powerful program from now 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:35.290
 Any questions, inquire or 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.570
 even suggestion is welcome and for 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.440
 please let me know through the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.989
 formulation of comments on youtube 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.110
 Of course whoever wants it can 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.890
 subscribe to my channel and from now on 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.719
 I would appreciate a like as motivator for 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.760
 continue generating this type of videos 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.280
 tutorials 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.530
 let's see first how was born 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.289
 this software and what are its 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.619
 basic features this software 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.680
 was created by a company called the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.500
 software belonging to google in the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.330
 year 2006 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.700
 was born with the 2005 version and we have to 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.040
 keep in mind that the last year 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.990
 this software was sold a company 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.070
 independent called trimble 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.759
 currently the software that we are 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.430
 using that is the 2013 date 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:35.120
 belongs to this new company 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.100
 sketchup is a software that is used 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.650
 basically for modeling in three 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.170
 dimensions although you can also 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.260
 used in two of anyone who 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.890
 want to start modeling 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.570
 three-dimensional can take this 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.800
 software that is characterized as being a 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:59.310
 very intuitive software very simple and 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.130
 with a very fast learning curve 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.009
 the modeling in this program is a 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.369
 modeling that is based on faces or 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.459
 surfaces we generate volumes 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.960
 from the construction of faces or 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.600
 surfaces 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.270
 this software is very used to create 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.960
 all kinds of objects in three dimensions 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.360
 from architectural projects 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.970
 industrial projects furniture design 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.580
 automotive design 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.250
 etc be its field of application is very 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.870
 broad and above all is very useful for 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:43.069
 carry forward the design process 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.400
 if we analyze a little the advantages of 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.010
 this program you are going to see that as 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.470
 I advanced them is a pretty software 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.409
 easy to learn has an interface 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.590
 simple an interface that simple and 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.680
 friendly 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.260
 another feature is that the program 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.440
 comes in two versions on one side 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.770
 we have a version that is free that 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.230
 it is free that is a basic version but 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.660
 quite complete is a version that 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.120
 we can download directly from this 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.549
 page page time chat 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.610
 and there is another version that is a 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.819
 version pays a very complete version 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.420
 that although it is pay your license enough 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.720
 economic 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.750
 another advantage is that it's actually a 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.970
 program that does not require equipment 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.180
 too powerful is a program that 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.850
 consumes few resources for 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.150
 generation of the models is also a 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.790
 program that runs under different 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.290
 operating systems gets along well with 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.690
 windows with mac but still does not exist 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.760
 the version to use in minutes 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.060
 One of its great advantages is that 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.430
 has a very large gallery of three 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.260
 of we can connect to the internet and 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.680
 take advantage of a wide variety of 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.410
 components and textures that we can 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.299
 download directly from the cloud and 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.180
 we can even get to share 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.200
 our productions from this same 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.080
 gallery another advantage is that we have 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.340
 access to a lot of videos 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.340
 tutorials and online help so 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.650
 so to be able to deepen the use 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.770
 of the program step by step and form 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.680
 totally self - taught is also a 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:48.470
 full software compatible with google 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.940
 earth and google maps we can 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:55.760
 elaborate our geometry and then 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.140
 geolocalize the bone insert it through 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.729
 of Google 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:05.089
 hertz in the real environment of it 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.939
 It is software that allows us to import 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:11.839
 geometry from different programs 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:16.669
 modeled and also allows us to export 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:20.639
 our model towards different programs 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:24.259
 that have different formats 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.840
 Finally, it is quite easy to create 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:30.210
 animations the steps to follow are not 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.370
 complexes basically what there is that 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.210
 do is generate scenes 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.500
 and we can quickly get a 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:43.790
 animation or final presentation 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.220
 as I told you earlier there are in 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.130
 actually three types of sketchup for a 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.740
 side we have the basic sketch up that 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.320
 characterized by being free and what 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.170
 we can download from this page we have 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.360
 also the sketch up pro that is a 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.900
 version pays but with a license 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:07.010
 quite accessible and there is also a 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:09.950
 visualizer that allows us to see the 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.810
 models generated sketchup although it is not 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.570
 possible to make modifications 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.520
 finally I would like you to lend 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.310
 attention to the requirements of 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.169
 minimum hardware so that this program 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.419
 can run correctly 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.699
 in case they have windows xp 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.849
 these have screens are the 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:33.389
 minimum requirements 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:37.979
 in the case of windows vista 7 and 8 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:41.909
 notice that the basic hardware is this and 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:44.580
 in the case that they have macintosh in the 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.500
 required hardware is this that we see in 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.990
 the bottom 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.410
 now if after this brief 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:55.410
 introduction I invite you to get into 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:58.500
 the world of this chat through a 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:01.260
 second video tutorial where we are going to 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.690
 analyze the program interface and the 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.950
 templates that it offers us as to 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.950
 begin to draw
