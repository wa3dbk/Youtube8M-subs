going to show you how to make music with
your<00:00:03.090> 3d<00:00:03.300> printer<00:00:10.280> alright<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.309> was<00:00:11.639> thinking

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
your 3d printer alright I was thinking

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.100 
your 3d printer alright I was thinking
to<00:00:12.059> be<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.210> internet<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.719> something<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
to be the internet for something the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.120 
to be the internet for something the
other<00:00:13.290> day<00:00:13.969> trying<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.830> come<00:00:16.830> up<00:00:16.859> with<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
other day trying to come up with the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.550 
other day trying to come up with the
code<00:00:17.310> where<00:00:17.580> when<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.570> print<00:00:18.960> finishes<00:00:19.380> it

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
code where when the print finishes it

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.470 
code where when the print finishes it
actually<00:00:19.859> kind<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.130> tells<00:00:20.789> me<00:00:20.970> or<00:00:21.090> notifies<00:00:21.449> me

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
actually kind of tells me or notifies me

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.849 
actually kind of tells me or notifies me
or<00:00:21.750> maybe<00:00:21.869> tweets<00:00:22.199> me<00:00:22.350> or<00:00:22.470> something<00:00:22.800> like

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
or maybe tweets me or something like

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.939 
or maybe tweets me or something like
that<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.880> place<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.750> has<00:00:25.109> these<00:00:25.680> G

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
that but this place that has these G

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.769 
that but this place that has these G
codes<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.580> load<00:00:26.820> them<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.029> into<00:00:27.269> your<00:00:27.390> printer

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
codes you load them up into your printer

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.599 
codes you load them up into your printer
and<00:00:27.960> automatically<00:00:28.740> I'll<00:00:28.920> play<00:00:29.160> some<00:00:29.369> notes

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and automatically I'll play some notes

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.659 
and automatically I'll play some notes
which<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.480> amazing<00:00:31.320> because<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:32.099> am<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.250> big<00:00:32.460> fan

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
which is amazing because I am a big fan

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.450 
which is amazing because I am a big fan
of<00:00:32.730> those<00:00:32.969> floppy<00:00:33.270> things<00:00:33.719> where<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:35.370> know

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
of those floppy things where you know

they play music from the floppy drives
and<00:00:37.200> stuff<00:00:37.350> yeah<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.829> thought<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.160> was<00:00:38.280> really

this Final Fantasy G code and load it
into<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.459> end<00:02:26.640> code<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.680> every<00:02:28.680> script<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:30.379> I'm

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
into the end code of every script so I'm

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.780 
into the end code of every script so I'm
gonna<00:02:31.530> open<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.890> up<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.190> notepad<00:02:32.340> plus<00:02:32.760> plus

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
gonna open it up in notepad plus plus

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.610 
gonna open it up in notepad plus plus
right<00:02:33.239> here<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.930> see<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.319> very<00:02:34.349> short

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
right here and you see it's a very short

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.140 
right here and you see it's a very short
snippet<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.370> code<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.860> what<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.760> want<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.000> do

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
snippet of code so what you want to do

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.979 
snippet of code so what you want to do
here<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.629> copy<00:02:41.299> actually<00:02:42.299> open<00:02:42.540> your<00:02:42.660> care<00:02:42.870> at

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
here is copy actually open your care at

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.490 
here is copy actually open your care at
this<00:02:43.080> time<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:45.390> paste<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.900> at<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.230> end

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
this time and just paste it at the end

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.620 
this time and just paste it at the end
code<00:02:49.370> right<00:02:50.370> before<00:02:50.760> anything<00:02:51.150> happens<00:02:51.510> at

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
code right before anything happens at

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.319 
code right before anything happens at
the<00:02:51.750> end<00:02:52.880> obviously<00:02:53.880> I'm<00:02:54.060> gonna<00:02:54.480> get<00:02:54.720> rid<00:02:54.900> of

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
the end obviously I'm gonna get rid of

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.650 
the end obviously I'm gonna get rid of
these<00:02:58.519> quotes<00:02:59.519> because<00:02:59.849> I<00:03:00.060> don't<00:03:00.239> need<00:03:00.450> them

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
these quotes because I don't need them

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.789 
these quotes because I don't need them
and<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.170> don't<00:03:01.349> think<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.680> registers<00:03:02.129> inside

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
and I don't think it registers inside

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.360 
and I don't think it registers inside
the<00:03:04.799> end<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.099> G<00:03:05.250> code<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:07.670> once<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.819> save<00:03:09.120> on

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
the end of the G code and once I save on

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.309 
the end of the G code and once I save on
your<00:03:11.370> next<00:03:11.579> print<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.540> will<00:03:12.720> actually<00:03:13.019> play

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
your next print it will actually play

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.539 
your next print it will actually play
the<00:03:14.010> Final<00:03:14.610> Fantasy<00:03:15.110> battle<00:03:16.110> sound<00:03:16.590> as<00:03:17.310> soon

as<00:03:17.670> it's<00:03:17.819> finished<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.239> then<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.900> know

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
as it's finished and then you know

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:32.559 
as it's finished and then you know
return<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> position<00:03:19.739> back<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.130> home

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569
