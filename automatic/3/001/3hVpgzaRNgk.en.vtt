those black bars are gone definitely
playing<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.900> mean<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:38.650> not<00:01:38.830> quite<00:01:39.310> buttery

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
playing I mean it's not quite buttery

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.930 
playing I mean it's not quite buttery
smooth<00:01:40.180> but<00:01:41.170> uh

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
smooth but uh

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.970 
smooth but uh
it's<00:01:43.940> going<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:48.170> only<00:01:48.200> other<00:01:48.560> thing<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:48.920> would

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
it's going the only other thing I would

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.450 
it's going the only other thing I would
mention<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:50.320> that<00:01:51.320> I<00:01:51.440> keep<00:01:51.770> hitting<00:01:52.130> these

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
mention is that I keep hitting these

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.550 
mention is that I keep hitting these
warnings<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.210> background

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.180 

here<00:01:59.560> we<00:01:59.710> go<00:01:59.829> right<00:01:59.979> here

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.790 

his<00:02:03.880> programs<00:02:04.390> saying<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.560> don't<00:02:05.620> have

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
his programs saying that I don't have

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.270 
his programs saying that I don't have
memories<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:08.320> low<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.800> it's<00:02:08.950> popped<00:02:09.130> up

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
memories is low and it's popped up

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.710 
memories is low and it's popped up
several<00:02:09.520> times<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:10.030> hasn't<00:02:10.300> affected<00:02:10.360> the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
several times it hasn't affected the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.620 
several times it hasn't affected the
gameplay<00:02:11.140> but<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.860> mean<00:02:12.730> that's<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.390> guess

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
gameplay but I mean that's that I guess

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.360 
gameplay but I mean that's that I guess
the<00:02:13.810> other<00:02:13.900> thing<00:02:13.990> I<00:02:14.110> did<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.410> helped<00:02:14.650> was<00:02:15.010> I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
the other thing I did that helped was I

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.050 
the other thing I did that helped was I
went<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.390> task<00:02:16.630> manager<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:18.640> had<00:02:18.880> my

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
went to the task manager and I had my

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.250 
went to the task manager and I had my
Starcraft<00:02:19.480> 2<00:02:19.630> here<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.800> want<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.400> I

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
update speed you can see it's running in

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.260 
update speed you can see it's running in
high<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.920> don't<00:02:26.250> know<00:02:26.459> that's<00:02:26.610> actually<00:02:26.819> doing

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
high I don't know that's actually doing

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.780 
high I don't know that's actually doing
anything<00:02:27.709> but<00:02:28.709> there<00:02:29.160> was<00:02:29.280> some<00:02:29.400> hiccups<00:02:29.610> in

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
anything but there was some hiccups in

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.830 
anything but there was some hiccups in
the<00:02:29.819> beginning<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.270> are<00:02:30.420> gone<00:02:30.540> but<00:02:30.810> that

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
the beginning that are gone but that

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.030 
the beginning that are gone but that
might<00:02:31.080> just<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.319> because<00:02:31.530> I'm<00:02:31.800> still

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
might just be because I'm still

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:45.580 
might just be because I'm still
downloading<00:02:33.030> things<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.390> background<00:02:41.750> I

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.290 

kind<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.650> suck<00:02:46.920> playing<00:02:47.250> right<00:02:47.430> now<00:02:47.550> because<00:02:47.820> I

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
kind of suck playing right now because I

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.360
