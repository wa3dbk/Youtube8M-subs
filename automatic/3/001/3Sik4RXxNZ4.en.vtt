00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Speak up today and let's do the review. 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.899
 iphone 5 s 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.899
 and it's still worth playing the mint 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.170
 The iPhone 5 s has a design similar to the 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.670
 that we already found on iphone 5 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.620
 the only difference is that now he has 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.380
 more available color than color 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.300
 a novelty on the iphone 5 is the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.940
 presence of touch sensor and ipad is enough 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.190
 put your finger here your digital and 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.840
 it unlocks the device you can 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.640
 register up to five fingerprints 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.780
 different and the process is quite 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.180
 simple 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.920
 only the only use at the moment for 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.490
 the touchpad is that it serves precisely 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.950
 for you to unlock the device or 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.210
 to dispense with the usefulness of 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.489
 password at the time you download the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:59.160
 app as in iphone 5 or 5s 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.649
 also has a 4 inch screen 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.180
 also she is a retina and how can you 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.180
 view account with beautiful pictures 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.630
 talk a little bit about the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.460
 performance the 5s has the chip at 7 and the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.710
 processing has become even better 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.140
 optimized and a smartphone can run 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.960
 any type of application can see 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.810
 which it opens and closes quickly will 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.420
 opening a party app is also fine 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.280
 fast then how about that the smartphone 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.619
 It's going to be pretty much everything. 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.090
 simple very very very fast 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.330
 as you can see we're playing 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.610
 the asphalt 7 and the graphics as well as being 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.950
 excellent you can also notice the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.680
 fluidity that the device provides 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.260
 great gameplay is important to highlight 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.090
 one with a processor called m 7 that 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.340
 allows all movement data 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.920
 monitored and captured by the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.619
 gyroscope accelerometer and even 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.470
 compass without using the chip 7 which 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.500
 optimizes the battery life in the 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.100
 5s connectivity well served 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.630
 since it has 4 g bluetooth 4.0 o 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.970
 wifi abgn we also have gps plus e 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.670
 drop and airplay where you can play 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.579
 mirror your smartphone image is from 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.579
 5s on your tv using an apple tv 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.500
 but a little on the iphone 5 camera 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.450
 s features an 8 megapixel sensor 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.150
 the photos are still great 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.970
 but the big news here is 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.250
 account of the new double led flash 5 yet 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.349
 was unique that is double and brings 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.200
 technology brought tony that uses 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.880
 hot and cold shades here to 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.800
 achieve results in photos 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.390
 especially where light is scarce with 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.060
 greater fidelity 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.760
 Another highlight in the 5s camera is the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.220
 feature called slow or slow motion 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.590
 motion 120 frames per second if he 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.069
 your clip and then you have good results 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.069
 funny 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.550
 as we see in all iphones so far the 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.250
 battery is always that point where the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.710
 most critical people and unfortunately the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.530
 iphone 5 's did not get practically 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.070
 no improvement over the 515 to 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.700
 people had 1,440 million perez aquino 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.860
 5s 1560 but now we have to rafael 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.740
 you end up using a lot if you 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.840
 is a heavy user but there around the 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.720
 4 pm you're going to have to 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.880
 Put the iphone 5 back on the wall 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.020
 if you use it moderately you can 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.510
 reach the end of the day with him 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.130
 iphones recessions always improve 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.790
 what was presented in the model 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.310
 previous 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.640
 are practically updates we can 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.600
 see that in the 3gs in the 4s and now on the iphone 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.790
 5 sec 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.680
 it brings exactly the same design to 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.260
 same screen but it has more 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.880
 improved camera performance and 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.070
 always sharp connections 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.080
 battery is still a problem and the 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.480
 touchpad that came out as a great 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.760
 idea still does not have much use 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.130
 besides unlocking the screen and downloading 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.480
 new applications without the need for 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.519
 typing the azimuth 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.650
