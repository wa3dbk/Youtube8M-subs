with this symbol here at the top you can

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.860 
with this symbol here at the top you can

see green and the red arrow when you get

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.390 
see green and the red arrow when you get
closer<00:01:50.270> they<00:01:51.270> change<00:01:51.659> their<00:01:51.900> brightness

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
closer they change their brightness

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.710 
closer they change their brightness
indicating<00:01:53.400> that<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.850> movement<00:01:54.330> is<00:01:54.420> now

limited to that horizontal or vertical
direction<00:01:59.150> this<00:02:00.150> is<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.360> very<00:02:00.570> useful<00:02:00.930> maneuver

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
direction this is a very useful maneuver

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.789 
direction this is a very useful maneuver
because<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:03.060> door<00:02:03.270> should<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.720> course<00:02:04.049> remain
