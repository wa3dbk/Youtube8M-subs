00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.309
 then it should start here with the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 second round at the egg run a lot of success 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.240
 this looks like it is now 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.010
 like a head to head race so the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.990
 but luca has blocked far 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.160
 he pulls over too much like he does 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.500
 he the user in the 1 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.300
 what makes a best of the drives now 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.010
 Just go straight ahead and shine 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
 to let get his iphone 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.789
 He just pushes the door shut 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.170
 Continue pushing kaluga 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.149
 and there it goes the other direction 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 High is not important so the luca 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.110
 plays with fair means Silvestre is 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.940
 actually a really small fat one 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.020
 boy trying the other simple 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.940
 to stand further 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.440
 I'm not sure but that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.239
 Referees really do not have that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 thought out what is that he does not fit 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.840
 be that relies on it for sure 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.590
 But this collapse is broken 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.750
 is not the case 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.670
 and now he has him with the butt 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.559
 it goes downhill for the riemer 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.750
 and that's how the winner stands 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.809
 the best way wind the second run on 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.280
 Sunday he has started taking turns 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.340
 Now here for this side of the bridge 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.320
 decided takes a start in his 50 m 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.549
 and now takes measure of the jump must 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.080
 of course, that's perfect 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.450
 Of course the car is here 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.890
 there everything looks good looks 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.040
 well he has managed 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.659
 that could through he could drive through 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.790
 Now, for sure, he will get that momentum 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.530
 also as perfect as the previous one 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.119
 obama candidate she looks at that 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.850
 whole from the perspective of the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.759
 command in his 50's the jump and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.430
 the sinus pull to god out of that is 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.729
 too big that's a very small one 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.140
 little piece saxony warrior 53 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.670
 will start here now maybe will 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.009
 he pull this goal 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.960
 repaired this fat little cousin 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.490
 race now takes the curve takes 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.579
 startup has been possible since school 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.979
 but not only luck not good enough 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.979
 three slips down from civilian 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.640
 Of course, 447 does not take much 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.250
 a lot of driving on this short distance 44 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.599
 km h 42 km h must now see here 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.789
 that he has the right takeoff angle 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.290
 arrives there comes aqas with his 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:19.080
 seven jumps because she looked good 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.640
 but not good enough 300 and 2 damage 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.790
 Done at the Bund of 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.350
 ku klux klan your goal negra with the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.970
 Of course, object 907 has one 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.710
 little speed advantage over the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.420
 but other armor is from the weight 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.740
 Of course, it has to be lighter, of course 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.690
 also a bit better meet there 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.760
 the jump is the angled right 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:42.150
 he agrees and lands on the meters we 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.190
 so have two players this 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.590
 That's what we did 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.050
 really need a jump now 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.850
 at the federal and start it will be 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.590
 this jump start a new one 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.400
 position so that this jump does not 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.660
 can be copied 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.640
 and she has the other side too 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.470
 chosen now must be in the angle 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.010
 catch the jump perfectly 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.780
 there comes the right turn without a trace that 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.050
 goes down like butter 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.620
 Thus, however, he endured agitated age 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.080
 Swede what a job so there comes a 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.000
 car tax our candidate only directly in the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.130
 first jump had quasi done 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.810
 against screen will destroy 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.850
 now safely start on cool athlon 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.340
 of course has the small advantage that 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.170
 he had just seen off in about the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.330
 how could work the whole thing was 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:32.820
 Of course, the 50 m behaves differently 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:35.910
 there could curve that jumps back and 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.250
 slips off the mouse was the bunch 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.090
 So win this second mini game 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:46.140
 pull jump with your object 907 where 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.510
 I do not shoot any more grass 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.560
 then it starts with a goal leaning so 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.209
 every five seconds 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.560
 Sniper Kiel is the next one I have to 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.070
 now that I do not use my 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.430
 miss 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.470
 the drive like the devil always in a circle 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.390
 the SEC the others keep on driving 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.270
 before that there is the compensation 11 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.860
 or mx has snowed out 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:11.340
 he managed his second keel 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.510
 with the t 37 fine I had to first 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.459
 overtake t1 on the right 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.440
 there came a shot that went wrong 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.390
 Funnily enough, he lives first 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.010
 the boat is still valid now 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.639
 of course tactical to weigh which 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.650
 panzer you click with 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.060
 the last few minutes and which ready 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.370
 Maybe you just mistakenly 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.969
 is feed for my opponent four 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.560
 maybe still checked 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:34.719
 nice shot here I'm tracked 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.159
 Now the question is who shoots as 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:39.310
 Next to me, my dad is too 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:41.379
 total 90 reported halter done so 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.849
 the recommendation and it is only one more 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.289
 minute time and actually I am the 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.729
 only armor still somehow 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.189
 bombards went there remains a shot 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.439
 just miss and worry 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:54.069
 next hit mottakis's hit 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:59.169
 and b poster in his 18 after the 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:05:00.430
 fifth mallet warmer warmer so then 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.659
 tell me already in which 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.860
 direction I should turn my tower 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:13.319
 so I first a first 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:13.319
 seconds shoot now continue where long 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.940
 red 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.219
 such card right 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:06:00.420
 I shit so stupid hired as 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:03.510
 radio still has not made it that way 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.630
 no one is fast anywhere spe the psp 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.630
 go 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.770
 let's go and moni strike even horny 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.330
 is that? 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.800
 but seems the worse dismissal 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.870
 as the penetrator he drives 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.280
 so gold must of course be careful 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.320
 I lost too much 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.330
 there leave another track and now 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.740
 be curious if he loses it 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.300
 no, that he makes it well makes 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.220
 excellent loses no here 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.380
 speed also rammed the mice 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.990
 not and he also the dealer at 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.640
 aarstraÃŸe like a fly with me 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.890
 rematch between draws yes 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.540
 little ground he well might the 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.220
 anchors from the board decided here now 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.260
 is it up here in front it seems 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.960
 really to a fight between the 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.210
 penetrator under docs 77 to come to 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.950
 pizza delivery that was just my dear 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.390
 singing club and there he lets himself 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.310
 really a lot of time the penetrator 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.320
 but is without prejudice to back down 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.000
 and adolf does it in really 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.090
 sure about the numbers and the mice 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.290
 make it really very series must 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.290
 of course it is really happening now 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.330
 wind through and there it goes downhill and 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:09.120
 1000 liters completely stopped 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:11.130
 There crashes the mouse has a tank 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.630
 1 destroyed there is the first tank 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.130
 died oh my god 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.900
 and that 's where the boys go 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.760
 meander through this one you have to 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.780
 turn extra round that was the bc bounty 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.900
 in a promising position 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:24.090
 actually been and the pga tour 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.990
 win the big final here sovereign 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.630
 at 4 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:31.200
 Jubilee heartfelt congratulations to 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:34.730
 the penetrator 798 second place goes to 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.730
 adolf 77
