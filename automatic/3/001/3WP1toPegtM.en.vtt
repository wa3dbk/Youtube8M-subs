megahertz<00:02:00.689> bands<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.500> then<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
megahertz bands and then you have the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.609 
megahertz bands and then you have the
support<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.750> WCDMA<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:05.280> 850<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.060> 1900<00:02:07.049> as

solid now the question would be will

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.310 
solid now the question would be will
this<00:03:27.030> hold<00:03:27.240> up<00:03:27.420> over<00:03:27.630> six<00:03:27.930> months<00:03:28.230> because

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
this hold up over six months because

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.110 
this hold up over six months because
originally<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:28.890> know<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.400> Palm<00:03:29.610> Pre<00:03:29.640> hinge

the original Palm Pre was pretty solid

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.490 
the original Palm Pre was pretty solid
but<00:03:32.330> after<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.750> know<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> couple<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.200> months<00:03:34.440> a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
but after you know a couple of months a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.140 
but after you know a couple of months a
lot<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.710> people<00:03:34.920> were<00:03:35.010> reporting<00:03:35.460> that<00:03:36.000> it

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.580 
lot of people were reporting that it
wasn't<00:03:36.360> holding<00:03:36.780> up<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:36.990> I<00:03:37.050> will<00:03:37.200> say<00:03:37.380> this

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
wasn't holding up but I will say this

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.320 
wasn't holding up but I will say this
one<00:03:37.770> feels<00:03:38.010> stronger<00:03:38.460> out<00:03:38.610> of<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.790> box<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.240> the

one feels stronger out of the box in the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.170 
one feels stronger out of the box in the
original<00:03:39.720> pre<00:03:39.930> give<00:03:40.470> your<00:03:40.710> mute<00:03:41.700> switch<00:03:41.940> on

original pre give your mute switch on

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.940 
original pre give your mute switch on
top<00:03:42.390> as<00:03:42.630> well<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.020> that's<00:03:43.110> unchanged<00:03:43.740> for<00:03:43.890> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
top as well so that's unchanged for the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.880 
top as well so that's unchanged for the
most<00:03:44.100> part<00:03:44.310> in<00:03:44.400> any<00:03:44.520> of<00:03:44.610> your<00:03:44.700> touch-tone

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
inductive back there as well so it's

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.210
