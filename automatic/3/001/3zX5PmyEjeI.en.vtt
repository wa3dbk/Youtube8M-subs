00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.410 
look at his legs he has the extra armor
that<00:01:29.159> our<00:01:29.369> Cooper's<00:01:29.670> had<00:01:29.850> below<00:01:30.119> their<00:01:30.270> knee

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
that our Cooper's had below their knee

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090 
that our Cooper's had below their knee
pad<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.079> one<00:01:31.200> thing<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.439> actually<00:01:31.560> noticed

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
pad and one thing I actually noticed

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.730 
pad and one thing I actually noticed
that<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.400> different<00:01:32.850> than<00:01:33.290> October<00:01:34.290> flies

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
that was different than October flies

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.230 
that was different than October flies
when<00:01:35.009> he<00:01:35.070> was<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.340> his<00:01:35.400> arc<00:01:35.610> trooper<00:01:35.880> armor<00:01:36.000> in

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
when he was in his arc trooper armor in

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.810 
when he was in his arc trooper armor in
season<00:01:36.540> 3<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.930> his<00:01:37.650> knee<00:01:38.070> pads<00:01:38.280> are<00:01:38.490> actually

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
season 3 is his knee pads are actually

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
season 3 is his knee pads are actually
filled<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.150> blue<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> made<00:01:40.020> sure<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> fix<00:01:40.650> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
filled in blue so I made sure to fix it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.069 
filled in blue so I made sure to fix it
up<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.070> actually<00:01:41.189> had<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.549> change<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.119> leg

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
up I actually had to change that leg

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.630 
up I actually had to change that leg
design<00:01:43.229> earlier<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.130> didn't<00:01:44.460> make<00:01:44.520> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
design earlier because I didn't make it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.490 
design earlier because I didn't make it
with<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> blue<00:01:45.180> fill<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> knee<00:01:46.170> pad<00:01:46.350> before

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
with the blue fill the knee pad before

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.740 
with the blue fill the knee pad before
now<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.280> had<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> three<00:01:47.820> blue<00:01:48.000> lines<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.570> his

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
now we had the three blue lines on his

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.840 
now we had the three blue lines on his
knee<00:01:48.990> pad<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.890> his<00:01:50.009> knee<00:01:50.130> pad<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.460> his

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
knee pad not on his knee pad on his

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.880 
knee pad not on his knee pad on his
armor<00:01:51.210> below<00:01:51.509> his<00:01:51.659> knee<00:01:51.810> pad<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:52.740> look

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
armor below his knee pad and if we look

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.039 
armor below his knee pad and if we look
to<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> side<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.450> see<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> did

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
to the side here we can see I did

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.170 
to the side here we can see I did
actually<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.920> design<00:01:56.549> wrap<00:01:56.790> around<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
actually have the design wrap around the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.209 
actually have the design wrap around the
leg<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.570> those<00:01:58.079> wrap<00:01:58.290> around<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.950> other

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
leg and those wrap around to the other

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.870 
leg and those wrap around to the other
side<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.670> well

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
side as well

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.870 
side as well
and<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.659> move<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.829> see<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.159> inside<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and if we move to see the inside of the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.520 
and if we move to see the inside of the
leg<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.479> see<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.960> design<00:02:04.259> does

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
leg we can see that the design does

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.170 
leg we can see that the design does
actually<00:02:04.829> extend<00:02:05.250> onto<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.700> inside<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
actually extend onto the inside of the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.359 
actually extend onto the inside of the
leg<00:02:06.360> now<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.380> all<00:02:07.530> my<00:02:07.560> figures<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.129> can

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
leg now just like all my figures I can

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.029 
leg now just like all my figures I can
fold<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:08.729> these<00:02:08.940> legs<00:02:09.530> follow<00:02:10.530> up<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.830> that

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
fold up these legs follow up like that

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.340 
fold up these legs follow up like that
and<00:02:11.629> then<00:02:12.629> just

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
and then just

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.980 
and then just
fold<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.000> nothing<00:02:15.000> happened<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.810> leg

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
fold it and nothing happened to the leg

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.890 
fold it and nothing happened to the leg
now<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:17.130> turn<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.670> around<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.180> arm<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.870> can

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
now I turn it around to this arm we can

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.260 
now I turn it around to this arm we can
see<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.350> this<00:02:19.470> arm<00:02:19.710> has<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.010> blue<00:02:20.370> line<00:02:20.580> with

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
see that this arm has a blue line with

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.150 
see that this arm has a blue line with
the<00:02:21.480> gray<00:02:21.750> arc<00:02:22.080> trooper<00:02:22.350> armor<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.920> wrist

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.430 
the gray arc trooper armor and the wrist
communicator<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.880> then<00:02:24.420> his<00:02:24.570> elbow<00:02:24.930> pads<00:02:25.140> are

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
communicator and then his elbow pads are

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.680 
communicator and then his elbow pads are
both<00:02:25.680> filled<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.100> blue<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:26.790> we<00:02:27.390> look<00:02:27.540> at<00:02:27.630> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
both filled in blue if we look at the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.210 
both filled in blue if we look at the
back<00:02:27.840> here<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:28.380> see<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.710> we<00:02:28.800> have<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
back here we can see that we have the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.890 
back here we can see that we have the
two<00:02:29.490> black<00:02:29.850> ammo<00:02:30.180> pouches<00:02:30.330> which<00:02:30.750> are

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
two black ammo pouches which are

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.030 
two black ammo pouches which are
different<00:02:31.200> than<00:02:31.320> regular<00:02:31.440> clone<00:02:31.800> ammo

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
different than regular clone ammo

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.710 
different than regular clone ammo
pouches<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:32.880> made<00:02:33.090> sure<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.300> add<00:02:33.540> that

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
pouches so I made sure to add that

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.570 
pouches so I made sure to add that
detail<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.320> if<00:02:34.920> we<00:02:35.010> look<00:02:35.160> at<00:02:35.250> his<00:02:35.340> other<00:02:35.460> arm

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
detail and if we look at his other arm

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.180 
detail and if we look at his other arm
we<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.060> see<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.930> elbow<00:02:37.620> pad<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:37.950> filled

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
we can see that the elbow pad is filled

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.310 
we can see that the elbow pad is filled
in<00:02:38.310> blue<00:02:38.550> we<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.210> that<00:02:39.390> little<00:02:39.660> blue<00:02:39.780> line<00:02:40.020> on

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
in blue we have that little blue line on

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.470 
in blue we have that little blue line on
the<00:02:40.530> back<00:02:40.770> there<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.550> extra<00:02:42.030> armor<00:02:42.330> that

arc troopers have on their arms with the
blue<00:02:44.520> line<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.000> then<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.300> don't<00:02:45.510> know<00:02:45.570> what

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
blue line and then I don't know what

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.540 
blue line and then I don't know what
they<00:02:45.750> call<00:02:45.960> this<00:02:46.110> thing<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.190> little

they call this thing but it is a little
colorful<00:02:48.260> communicator<00:02:49.260> thing<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:49.860> made

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
colorful communicator thing that I made

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.400 
colorful communicator thing that I made
sure<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.310> add<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.820> on<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.720> arm<00:02:51.960> we<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.140> see

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
sure to add and on this arm we can see

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.140 
sure to add and on this arm we can see
that<00:02:52.590> there<00:02:52.740> is<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:53.160> blue<00:02:53.550> line<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.000> front

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
that there is the blue line on the front

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.900 
that there is the blue line on the front
too<00:02:54.770> so<00:02:55.770> here<00:02:55.950> we<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.160> see<00:02:56.310> our<00:02:56.460> purifies

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
too so here we can see our purifies

have<00:04:29.610> really<00:04:29.819> much<00:04:30.030> on<00:04:30.240> his<00:04:30.389> torso<00:04:30.630> design<00:04:31.020> but

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
have really much on his torso design but

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.590 
have really much on his torso design but
of<00:04:31.710> course<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.310> did<00:04:32.550> add<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:32.940> one<00:04:33.180> marks<00:04:33.479> that

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
of course I did add the one marks that

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.689 
of course I did add the one marks that
he<00:04:33.750> has<00:04:33.840> on<00:04:33.990> his<00:04:34.110> torso<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.710> those<00:04:35.460> look

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
he has on his torso and those look

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.059 
he has on his torso and those look
really<00:04:35.729> nice<00:04:36.060> now<00:04:36.539> if<00:04:36.750> we<00:04:36.900> look<00:04:37.110> at<00:04:37.259> his<00:04:37.470> legs

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
really nice now if we look at his legs

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.180 
really nice now if we look at his legs
he<00:04:38.669> has<00:04:38.819> a<00:04:39.090> blue<00:04:39.599> stripe<00:04:39.900> in<00:04:40.139> the<00:04:40.349> knee<00:04:40.500> pad<00:04:40.710> and

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
he has a blue stripe in the knee pad and

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.950 
he has a blue stripe in the knee pad and
we<00:04:41.280> can<00:04:41.400> also<00:04:41.520> see<00:04:41.819> the<00:04:41.970> tally<00:04:42.240> marks<00:04:42.569> on<00:04:42.780> his

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
we can also see the tally marks on his

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.659 
we can also see the tally marks on his
legs<00:04:43.229> and<00:04:43.500> just<00:04:44.009> like<00:04:44.099> all<00:04:44.250> my<00:04:44.280> custom

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
legs and just like all my custom

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.820 
legs and just like all my custom
minifigures<00:04:45.150> these<00:04:45.479> legs<00:04:45.750> are<00:04:45.960> poseable<00:04:46.650> so<00:04:46.770> I

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
minifigures these legs are poseable so I

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.490 
minifigures these legs are poseable so I
can<00:04:46.979> fold<00:04:47.130> up<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.340> legs<00:04:47.990> unfold<00:04:48.990> them<00:04:49.139> whatnot

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
can fold up the legs unfold them whatnot

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.120 
can fold up the legs unfold them whatnot
and<00:04:50.090> nothing<00:04:51.090> has<00:04:51.539> happened<00:04:51.569> to<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.169> legs<00:04:52.319> now

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
and nothing has happened to the legs now

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.499 
and nothing has happened to the legs now
if<00:04:53.250> you<00:04:53.340> take<00:04:53.430> a<00:04:53.490> look<00:04:53.699> at<00:04:53.819> the<00:04:53.970> arms<00:04:54.300> they<00:04:54.479> have

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
if you take a look at the arms they have

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.240 
if you take a look at the arms they have
my<00:04:54.750> wraparound<00:04:55.110> arm<00:04:55.440> design<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:55.919> we<00:04:55.979> can<00:04:56.130> see

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
my wraparound arm design and we can see

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.210 
my wraparound arm design and we can see
the<00:04:56.370> black<00:04:56.580> line<00:04:56.639> there<00:04:57.289> we<00:04:58.289> look<00:04:58.470> at<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.889> side

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
the black line there we look at the side

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.920 
the black line there we look at the side
of<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.370> arm<00:04:59.490> here<00:04:59.789> we<00:05:00.000> can<00:05:00.120> see<00:05:00.270> that<00:05:00.389> Rex<00:05:00.720> has

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
of the arm here we can see that Rex has

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.839 
of the arm here we can see that Rex has
a<00:05:00.960> blue<00:05:01.410> line<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:02.310> can<00:05:02.400> see<00:05:02.490> his<00:05:02.610> wrist

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
a blue line and you can see his wrist

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.450 
a blue line and you can see his wrist
communicator<00:05:03.000> is<00:05:03.599> blue<00:05:03.990> more<00:05:04.680> tally<00:05:04.979> marks<00:05:05.310> on

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
communicator is blue more tally marks on

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.430 
communicator is blue more tally marks on
his<00:05:05.610> arm<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:06.330> we<00:05:06.840> turn<00:05:07.020> around<00:05:07.139> to<00:05:07.289> the<00:05:07.349> back

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
his arm and we turn around to the back

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.980 
his arm and we turn around to the back
here<00:05:07.889> we<00:05:08.490> can<00:05:08.610> see<00:05:08.759> that<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:09.090> elbow<00:05:09.449> pad<00:05:09.630> has<00:05:09.870> a

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
here we can see that the elbow pad has a

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.659 
here we can see that the elbow pad has a
blue<00:05:10.139> line<00:05:10.320> in<00:05:10.470> it<00:05:10.560> we<00:05:11.039> can<00:05:11.190> see<00:05:11.310> his<00:05:11.460> back

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
blue line in it we can see his back

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.189 
blue line in it we can see his back
design<00:05:11.849> there<00:05:12.210> which<00:05:12.509> doesn't<00:05:12.900> have<00:05:12.990> anything

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
design there which doesn't have anything

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.010 
design there which doesn't have anything
on<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.620> it's<00:05:13.740> just<00:05:13.949> a<00:05:14.099> regular<00:05:14.460> clone<00:05:15.180> back

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
on it it's just a regular clone back

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.770 
on it it's just a regular clone back
design<00:05:16.229> and<00:05:16.620> his<00:05:17.310> other<00:05:17.580> arm<00:05:17.639> is<00:05:18.330> pretty<00:05:18.630> much

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
design and his other arm is pretty much

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.219 
design and his other arm is pretty much
exactly<00:05:19.199> the<00:05:19.409> same<00:05:20.720> just<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:21.810> only

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
exactly the same just the only

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:23.810 
exactly the same just the only
difference<00:05:22.560> with<00:05:22.710> this<00:05:22.830> arm<00:05:23.099> is<00:05:23.280> he<00:05:23.460> has<00:05:23.580> some

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
difference with this arm is he has some

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.700 
difference with this arm is he has some
white<00:05:24.060> tally<00:05:24.330> marks<00:05:24.690> which<00:05:25.199> you<00:05:25.319> can<00:05:25.470> barely

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
white tally marks which you can barely

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.100 
white tally marks which you can barely
see<00:05:26.069> but<00:05:26.430> you<00:05:26.490> can<00:05:26.639> still<00:05:26.909> kind<00:05:27.060> of<00:05:27.180> see<00:05:27.240> it<00:05:27.449> so

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
see but you can still kind of see it so

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.020 
see but you can still kind of see it so
here<00:05:28.289> we<00:05:28.319> can<00:05:28.500> take<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.710> look<00:05:29.069> at<00:05:29.280> clone<00:05:29.789> Kappa

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
here we can take a look at clone Kappa

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.779 
here we can take a look at clone Kappa
Rex's<00:05:30.449> helmet<00:05:30.810> and<00:05:31.190> unlike<00:05:32.190> all<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.639> other

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
Rex's helmet and unlike all the other

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.850 
Rex's helmet and unlike all the other
phase<00:05:33.060> two<00:05:33.270> clones<00:05:33.509> Rex<00:05:33.870> does<00:05:34.110> have<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.590> phase

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
phase two clones Rex does have the phase

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.890 
phase two clones Rex does have the phase
one<00:05:35.070> visor<00:05:35.280> on<00:05:35.610> his<00:05:35.789> face<00:05:36.000> on<00:05:36.180> helmet<00:05:36.479> because

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
one visor on his face on helmet because

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.770 
one visor on his face on helmet because
he<00:05:37.229> did<00:05:37.440> actually<00:05:37.710> weld<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.880> whole<00:05:39.330> part<00:05:39.750> of

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
he did actually weld the whole part of

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.170 
he did actually weld the whole part of
the<00:05:39.840> helmet<00:05:40.199> on<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.500> this<00:05:40.620> helmet<00:05:40.949> so<00:05:41.699> I<00:05:41.729> did

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
the helmet on to this helmet so I did

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.790 
the helmet on to this helmet so I did
incorporate<00:05:42.509> that<00:05:42.870> in<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.080> design<00:05:43.469> and<00:05:43.740> we

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
incorporate that in the design and we

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.370 
incorporate that in the design and we
have<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.250> blue<00:05:44.580> lines<00:05:44.789> around<00:05:45.240> his<00:05:45.419> visor<00:05:45.630> now

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
have the blue lines around his visor now

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.170 
have the blue lines around his visor now
we<00:05:46.440> can<00:05:46.620> also<00:05:46.800> see<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.280> weld<00:05:47.550> marks<00:05:47.849> on<00:05:48.000> there

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
we can also see the weld marks on there

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.360 
we can also see the weld marks on there
as<00:05:48.330> well<00:05:48.539> now<00:05:48.750> we<00:05:49.229> have<00:05:49.349> his<00:05:49.650> breathers<00:05:50.070> on<00:05:50.250> the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
as well now we have his breathers on the

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.580 
as well now we have his breathers on the
front<00:05:50.699> and<00:05:50.940> the<00:05:51.330> two<00:05:51.479> little<00:05:51.659> blue<00:05:52.229> things<00:05:52.469> he

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
has on the top there just like fives he

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.520 
has on the top there just like fives he

at<00:06:00.539> the<00:06:00.810> top<00:06:01.020> there<00:06:01.259> we<00:06:01.409> can<00:06:01.530> see<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.889> tally

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
at the top there we can see the tally

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.200 
at the top there we can see the tally
marks<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.909> Rex<00:06:03.120> has<00:06:03.380> counting<00:06:04.380> his<00:06:04.940> kills<00:06:05.940> in
