00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.640
 to make a mba without also buying some 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.200
 figures and what is called a play safe 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.550
 peaceful 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.550
 from home let's see 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.210
 directly by the box with a cutter 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.350
 to 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.250
 here are all the figures that now 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.080
 same are available 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.080
 how it works a bit and the 3 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.460
 that is xavi mister incredible and we are going to 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.460

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.640
 no this is a bit the game has come out to 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.710
 from skylanders had very good 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.190
 sales of skylanders with all their 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.339
 footballers and with everything 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.810
 with all the ips that I have of everything 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.729
 I 'm not going to be able to get this out 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.460
 you're even talking about the 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.980
 possibility that in the future they will leave 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.220
 figures 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.730
 and the game will also expand something to 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.420
 thanks and wait good we do the 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.740
 box 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.740
 we have down here 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.270
 and what we have here directly 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.270
 first the game 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:47.689
 the figures are quite good 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.229
 we are later we will see some 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.229
 singers too 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.390
 since spanish 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.820
 it's a plastic moves it's made a 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.840
 Poquillo is always made for children 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.840
 also at the end 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.659
 ah 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.950
 of the triples 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.880
 situations 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.250
 ah 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.959
 be different from the one before we are going to 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.959
 see him 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.120
 figures and here we have different 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.120
 places to go putting the figures 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.540
 and we have to play 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.650
 where you will see them well because with 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.750
 our translation 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.459
 of cleaning the Caribbean the incredible and 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.230
 the monsters with this we are going to be able 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.239
 play all three games then each 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.629
 see how they are going to be selling 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.739
 expansions as you see from home where 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.870
 we have to put this to be able 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.599
 Play the houses you are talking 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.480
 I have to check what each blazer 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.170
 it's 20 o'clock, plus it has the module 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.750
 of game 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.120
 in a game box where you will be able to 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.110
 create your different games those are the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.290
 friends take him power that we 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.290
 to be able 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.690
 to give different types of energy to 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.690
 the different players 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.140
 here the letter 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.910
 we will be able to put the computer to 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.510
 that still works 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.510
 bye 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.280
 well with this 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.610
 and it would fit 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.060
 and it would fit differently 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.060
 razer 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.920
 different figurines we have to fit 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.920
 the here 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.500
 then we have the figure that part as 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.090
 francesco here I have fairies 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.540
 or that they sell for about ten euros 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.400
 each one separated and there are groups of three 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.260
 that can be found by twenty 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.630
 thirty euros 20 25 30 and then the 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.910
 presets right now they're home 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.160
 what is a fabric to be a game of 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.969
 cars and then they have also taken off 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.429
 the game 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:44.659
 the lone ranger also for the 

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:47.349
 infinity that also included then another 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.349
 game other victims 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.780
 the way what 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.360
 I do not really like the truth because 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.190
 you will never be able to return 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.560
 put it as it was 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.320
 and you always have a difficulty the 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.610
 space through 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.610
 if he did not cut me anything 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.770
 to minds 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.370
 d 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.370
 how 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.510
 and here we already have simply characters 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.510
 of caps 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.140
 i 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.790
 and the game what it would be like to be able to play 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.880
 podcast is different from the other the other 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:57.120
 he came to one with three each one is one 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.120
 single 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.900
 finally you're finally going to be what 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.550
 same as the others 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.460
 Finally, to do a bit of 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:22.130
 comparisons with the different 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:25.540
 to see first the most hexagonal base 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.530
 you are standing 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.530
 it has nothing 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.630
 and here we would have 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.630
 base 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.910
 and here we had directly the 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.040
 characters and as we said we have 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.200
 site for everyone 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.020
 and then to check a bit then here 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.590
 we have different 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.790
 after part 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.790
 different are you landers 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:58.120
 ah 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:09.749
 and the figures as we see are 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:12.799
 closest to the giant I think they are 2 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:12.799
 to the normals 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.230
 they have the form because it would almost be a 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.729
 little bit smaller 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:24.400
 let's 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:26.919
 to play what's left 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.669
 once it is in play thank you very much 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:34.060
 and see you next if you do not have a 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:37.440
 Lumia or any of these videos if you have 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:40.590
 liked to contribute of a like 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.590
 thank you
