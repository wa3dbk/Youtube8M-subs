00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hi everyone, thank you for being here 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.319
 like every day on the techno channel 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.990
 01net all the high tech news is 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.790
 here of course robots invade 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.889
 our house Jerome I know you have a 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.839
 robot vacuum cleaner at home I am a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.300
 robot myself it's true you 're not the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.619
 true I mean by that I could 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.750
 stop by pressing a button 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.060
 In short, robots invade our 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.439
 daily and there is a living room that has 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.970
 took place this week a salon 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.849
 European scale which is here in 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.689
 france to lyon called innorobo on 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.689
 will visit this salon 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.770
 and you may have already dreamed of being 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.690
 a bit like iron man to have a species 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.920
 armor armor that you 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.050
 would allow there was a problem at 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.970
 human heart I believe yes but it has him 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.580
 served finally it's true of opinion here 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.290
 with a strength tenfold with a 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.190
 equipment in fact that allows you to 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.960
 do lots of things that can not be done 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.060
 not to do with human strength that 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.410
 is called a good exoskeleton then iron 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.700
 man it's not for right now huh it 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.150
 remains of the comic still or 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.460
 cinema 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.020
 but in fact the research is progressing 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.270
 enormously in this area of 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.760
 the exoskeleton as for example for 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.080
 to multiply the human force jérôme and 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.060
 lift incredible weights 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.920
 this robot is a port exoskeleton of 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.619
 charge so it helps to assist the port 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.390
 load of 40 kg at the back 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.610
 when you have legs alone or up 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.650
 20 kg with the arms so he can have 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.310
 applications both military and 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.510
 civil in the btp or in the industry 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.180
 for handling 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.760
 the exoskeleton ps 32 kg with people from 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.110
 ground and 47 kg with arms the person 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.520
 who is equipped with the exoskeleton does 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.410
 actually feels that two kilos to 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.300
 shoulder level when 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.830
 the exoskeleton is equipped with a load 40 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.690
 kg at the backpack level it has a 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.000
 autonomy of 4 to 5 hours and it allows 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.980
 to walk up to 5 km time it's me 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.540
 who controls the exoskeleton so I 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.970
 puts in motion freely it imposes me 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.470
 no pace so I feel when 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.940
 even pretty free it's a new 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.070
 feeling to be as close to a 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.320
 machine here for these exoskeleton 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.909
 it's pretty impressive and it's a 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.140
 reality very close because in fact we 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.229
 said that it could see the light of day 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.090
 2016 2017 then other family other 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.120
 big family of skeletons 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.070
 exoskeleton that could actually 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.780
 completely changed the lives of thousands 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.470
 of disabled people this is a 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.380
 exoskeleton four limbs that will 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.360
 to be able to endure the person 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.030
 tetraplegic and 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.620
 execute movements of which this one has 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.690
 the intention 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.580
 for that we will go through an implant to 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.410
 the brain surface that will allow 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.060
 to acquire the cerebral signals from the 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.550
 nobody the instructions will be sent 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.770
 to the exoskeleton and the exoskeleton is going 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.810
 move from a mobilize the person 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.850
 according to his intentions the exoskeleton and 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.290
 specifically developed for use 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.030
 with quadriplegic people 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.160
 we are considering a first experience 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.650
 real size so with a person 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.400
 tetraplegic for the end of 2013 beginning 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.140
 2014 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.240
 and from there we will try to 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.060
 multiply the experiences and try to 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.560
 pull more and more towards a product 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.480
 marketable medium-term not before 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.370
 that many years these are all 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.260
 hopes are allowed in this area and 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.650
 it's exoskeleton could happen to 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.270
 from 2020 that is low tomorrow 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.980
 report in Lyon by jean david duarte 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.350
 for the 01net techno channel 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.000
 and besides innorobo we will talk about it again 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.870
 probably next week because 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.760
 we still have lots of things to you 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.320
 tell the techno channel 01net any 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.709
 the high-tech news every day has 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.190
 very quickly 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:34.080
 hello to all the high-tech news 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.080
 every day very quickly hi to all
