00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
over the course of time maybe like I

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.590 
over the course of time maybe like I
think<00:05:07.650> like<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:07.950> month<00:05:08.310> or<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:08.910> doing

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
think like a month or so and doing

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.900 
think like a month or so and doing
various<00:05:09.990> activities<00:05:10.890> in<00:05:10.919> there<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.580> then<00:05:11.730> if

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
various activities in there and then if

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.470 
various activities in there and then if
you<00:05:12.030> own<00:05:12.360> get<00:05:12.900> like<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.110> Chinese<00:05:13.620> SMS<00:05:14.480> online

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
you own get like a Chinese SMS online

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.990 
you own get like a Chinese SMS online
account<00:05:15.870> you<00:05:16.169> can<00:05:16.650> actually<00:05:16.830> verify<00:05:17.520> that<00:05:17.760> and

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
account you can actually verify that and

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.180 
account you can actually verify that and
then<00:05:18.300> get<00:05:18.690> an<00:05:18.780> instant<00:05:19.200> key<00:05:19.350> which<00:05:20.040> is

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
then get an instant key which is

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.159 
then get an instant key which is
possible<00:05:20.669> because<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:21.210> do<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.600> sometimes<00:05:22.050> too

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
possible because I do that sometimes too

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.710 
possible because I do that sometimes too
so<00:05:22.860> it's<00:05:23.280> not<00:05:23.340> like<00:05:23.580> it's<00:05:23.730> impossible<00:05:24.060> but<00:05:24.660> you

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
so it's not like it's impossible but you

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.180 
so it's not like it's impossible but you
can<00:05:24.930> definitely<00:05:25.080> get<00:05:25.350> into<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.680> game<00:05:25.890> and

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190

use<00:05:35.430> wtfast<00:05:37.220> wtfast<00:05:38.220> um<00:05:38.730> to<00:05:39.570> link<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:39.990> this

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
use wtfast wtfast um to link to this

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.900 
use wtfast wtfast um to link to this
game<00:05:40.230> in<00:05:40.710> order<00:05:40.919> to<00:05:41.070> use<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.520> you<00:05:41.669> should

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
game in order to use that you should

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.840 
game in order to use that you should
probably<00:05:42.180> link<00:05:42.950> wtfast<00:05:43.950> to<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.220> launcher<00:05:44.640> so

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
probably link wtfast to the launcher so

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.700 
probably link wtfast to the launcher so
it<00:05:44.970> catches<00:05:45.180> on<00:05:45.540> and<00:05:45.570> speeds<00:05:46.200> up<00:05:46.350> your<00:05:46.530> arm

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
it catches on and speeds up your arm

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.650 
it catches on and speeds up your arm
speed<00:05:47.100> because<00:05:47.460> if<00:05:47.580> you<00:05:47.700> don't<00:05:47.910> you<00:05:48.240> will<00:05:48.360> have

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
speed because if you don't you will have

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.990 
speed because if you don't you will have
40<00:05:49.080> hundred<00:05:49.350> I<00:05:49.410> mean<00:05:49.680> 400<00:05:49.890> MS<00:05:50.460> and<00:05:50.760> the<00:05:50.850> game
