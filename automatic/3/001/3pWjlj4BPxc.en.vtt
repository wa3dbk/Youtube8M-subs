00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.130
 one more video tutorial from be thinks it's starting and the subject now its 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.200
 cd drive and dvd we show a series of problems that can happen 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 and possible solutions you can follow 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.749
 if you put one says that simply nothing happens this is probably a 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.579
 problem reading media rinaldo drive 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.439
 it may be that it concerns scanty dirty or is simply incompatible 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.169
 this drive has another drive that works 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.190
 another fairly common problem 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.160
 you Petrobras and nothing happens in this case the solution reopen or manually 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.010
 the chocolate and I decided paper put hranice small hole that you are 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.770
 seeing I never went with a little force until the drawer is open 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.160
 It will open a little 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.350
 so you pull the expense with the hand 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.800
 I had the disk push the tray back into place. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.740
 not open in the conventional way the problem can be with a suit 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.930
 now the city seems to function normally but it did not come 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.740
 the lens may be dirty. 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.120
 the best recommendation to use an own disk for this 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400
 he has to be born of the want it to be generated if it can obstruct the reading 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.070
 If you prefer to do the manual cleaning, remove the disk drive and the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.480
 swab siege patients gently into the lens 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.480
 and do not forget not because with nothing else on the lens just the tip of the swab 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.680
 another possible problem is the costume does not work anymore this can happen by 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.229
 two main reasons the first happens when you install some 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.670
 software recorder it has somehow to opera the registry and drivers of the 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.920
 windows allowing the recorder to work 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.060
 do you suspect that ten stadiums would suffer a question clean the registry and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.820
 try again 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.390
 the other possible cause of the current problem of the compatibility of traitors 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.880
 if this happened when you installed a new version of the operating system 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.270
 it may be necessary to wait for some update 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.259
 and it is very simple and execute it see how 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.309
 on the Start menu, right-click Computer Hecking 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.019
 properties 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.019
 in this rich device manager screen 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:24.779
 click on the plus or arrow symbol next to pvc drive and it went well for 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.779
 expand the list this will show your try 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.839
 right-click on it the polisario tricolor 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.459
 if the case is more serious the centralism connects perhaps there is some problem in the 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.509
 collections 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:45.159
 first between ships and check if the driver state otherwise it 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.379
 is probably offline 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.449
 check all the jobs that are connecting behind the computer 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:52.919
 if possible 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.029
 and try again 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.519
 if nothing of what was shown here solved the problem then you should 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.750
 change the player 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.660
 if it is still under warranty or I will take some technician to do the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.149
 repair needed 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.629
 We hope to have helped you with another video. 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.629
