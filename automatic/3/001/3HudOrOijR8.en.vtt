00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.530 
movie it's so it's so funny but I do
think<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.579> movie<00:01:50.970> had<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.390> come

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
think that if that movie had not come

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.240 
think that if that movie had not come
out<00:01:51.659> my<00:01:51.869> generation<00:01:52.439> might<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.740> been<00:01:52.829> nicer

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
out my generation might have been nicer
