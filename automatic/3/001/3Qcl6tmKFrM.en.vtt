00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.096
With the  Jóvenes Clásicos del Son

00:00:02.097 --> 00:00:05.953
the first three CDs were made with recording companies

00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:08.722
that were not from Cuba. They were international enterprises.

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:12.290
And I wasn’t... I wasn’t lucky...

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:16.013
Because it was very difficult it would reach the people, do you understand?

00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:18.587
This CD I’m going to do now with my group...

00:00:18.788 --> 00:00:20.626
that’s called Son del Nene,

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:26.097
I’m already doing it with EGREM. Everything is going to be done here in Cuba.

00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:30.013
The people is going to have the...

00:00:30.014 --> 00:00:32.058
That thing of going to the store and say I’m... Do you understand?

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.898
Not like those. Those used to get two or three.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.241
But these ones are going to be here.

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:40.838
That comes first. That they, that the people...

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:44.581
have the CD.

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:47.116
And the people too...

00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:50.479
You know that when you are already in a group you have to have respect...

00:00:51.313 --> 00:00:55.575
for other group... you have to respect the schemes and ideas, don’t you?

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.174
You can offer your ideas, don’t you?

00:00:57.175 --> 00:01:01.294
But there is a director and... you have to respect that, don’t you?

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:02.384
And then...

00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:05.864
because of that, those were things... I was striving for.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.994
And for me that is... the utmost.

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:43.496
Well, this is the first CD of this group Son del Nene.

00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:47.250
We all know that Nene

00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:50.569
is one of the exceptional voices of our Cuban music.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.174
Mainly with the Son and the Rumba.

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:56.266
He was before part of the group Jóvenes Clásicos.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.027
There are parts of this group that, well...

00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:02.011
after a... a dissolution...

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.258
There are musicians with him sharing this work.

00:02:08.512 --> 00:02:13.195
Like in every production... every production requires a treatment,

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:15.625
a study, an analizing work beforehand.

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:19.288
That’s always done before beginning each recording,

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.655
each discographic production.

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.860
Nene, as we all know,

00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:27.498
is a singer with exceptional vocal qualities.

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:31.148
He has formed his own picket, as we say.

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.694
A young group, of very good musicians, .

00:02:34.952 --> 00:02:36.821
with this Septet format.

00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:41.467
And well, we intend to let the people know this new work....

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:44.709
this new line of work that, of course,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.722
goes within the Son roots... the traditional Son,

00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:52.641
the contemporary Son, the Rumba.

00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:54.936
With elements of...

00:02:56.127 --> 00:03:00.025
all this sonic quality we have in our music.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.828
The instruments used,

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.098
the tres, the guitar, bongo drum, tumbadora, the trumpets, the choir.

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:08.043
It is what...

00:03:08.144 --> 00:03:11.807
It’s the main center of all the sonic quality of this group.

00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:16.571
And well, we are already on the phase of...

00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:21.940
On the phase of mixing of this magnificent CD, and we are very proud ,

00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:23.901
and very happy with this new production.

00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:25.998
And it‘s a new proposal given by EGREM,

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:28.506
for the dancing public, for the infomed public,

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:32.712
for Nene’s fans, as a singer, as an interpreter.

00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:36.090
And well, here we are with this purpose.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:39.950
Gossip, did you see? Ahh...

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:41.185
Gossip. Ahh...

00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:44.972
- Nene. - Emilio Vega. -There.

00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:46.038
- And Pedrito, look at him there.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.481
- Pedrito Ugalde. El Colorao. - Ahh... El Colorao.

00:03:48.482 --> 00:03:49.883
- There. - Look at him there.

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:51.644
He’s got to take more care of himself.

00:03:53.472 --> 00:03:56.706
He drinks a lot of beer and was in a hospital, for not paying attention to Changó.

00:03:56.707 --> 00:03:59.009
- The best thing for the kidneys is the beer.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.557
The oracle, for not paying attention to Changó.

00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:06.260
Well, my name is Osnel Rodríguez Otero.

00:04:06.295 --> 00:04:07.801
I am the group’s guitarist.

00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:12.066
I am very happy of being in this new group.

00:04:12.067 --> 00:04:13.829
It’s been almost a year since we were founded.

00:04:14.558 --> 00:04:17.474
And with Nene we’d been working for about six years in another group.

00:04:17.475 --> 00:04:20.356
Ad well, with this proposal...

00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:23.013
we intend to reach your hearts with our music.

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:25.587
I’ve got some themes with the group.

00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:29.130
I am a composer, and I’m very happy, too, that...

00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:34.999
that my music at last be also sung by the excellence  of  Nene.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.114
And well, at the end this is a group of friends and we hope that it will go on like this...

00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:42.296
go on for... go on in the future, isn’t it?

00:04:42.597 --> 00:04:44.829
Well, in this CD there are three themes of my own.

00:04:45.205 --> 00:04:47.499
That is, an opening, which is like an instrumental,

00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:49.325
which is the starting point of the CD.

00:04:49.326 --> 00:04:52.104
And two more themes: the Son del Nene,

00:04:53.463 --> 00:04:58.892
a theme inspired rather in the history of the group, isn’t it?

00:05:01.694 --> 00:05:04.654
And we also have the Sabio Salomón,

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:08.276
which is a theme also inspired in our personal experiences.

00:05:09.736 --> 00:05:13.783
Inspired in things that happen in life, and people...

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:18.493
people that think some things and that at the end it’s not what they thought.

00:05:19.117 --> 00:05:20.699
At the end friendship is what wins.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.994
And also wins good will among persons.

00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:25.399
So, we hope you enjoy it.
