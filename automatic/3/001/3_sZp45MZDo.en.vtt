one just three buttons pretty basic but

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.090 
one just three buttons pretty basic but
yeah<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> do<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.110> where<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.799> twist

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
yeah I do like that where you can twist

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.399 
yeah I do like that where you can twist
it<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.460> actually<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.149> spin<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.259> can

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
it and actually and like spin it you can

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.780 
it and actually and like spin it you can
spin<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.550> flick<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.060> flick<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
perfect every time obviously and just go

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.379 
perfect every time obviously and just go
to<00:02:52.470> one<00:02:52.680> at<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.859> time<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.549> progressively
