just let it settle on a temperature
you're<00:01:02.100> looking<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.460> 170<00:01:03.270> degrees<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you're looking for 170 degrees in the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.899 
you're looking for 170 degrees in the
thigh<00:01:04.049> meat<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> good<00:01:05.159> idea<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.610> take<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
thigh meat it's a good idea to take the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.480 
thigh meat it's a good idea to take the
temperature<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.510> both<00:01:06.930> thighs<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:08.189> you've<00:01:08.369> got

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
temperature of both thighs if you've got

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.980 
temperature of both thighs if you've got
to<00:01:08.580> put<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.790> turkey<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> oven<00:01:09.270> sideways

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
to put your turkey in the oven sideways

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.050 
to put your turkey in the oven sideways
one<00:01:10.470> side<00:01:10.740> might<00:01:11.070> cook<00:01:11.250> faster<00:01:11.790> than<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
one side might cook faster than the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.670 
one side might cook faster than the
other<00:01:12.240> because<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.720> hot<00:01:12.869> spots<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> oven

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
other because of hot spots in the oven

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
other because of hot spots in the oven
now<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.040> quite<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.430> 170<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.270> gonna

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
now I'm not quite at 170 so I'm gonna

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.850 
now I'm not quite at 170 so I'm gonna
put<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> turkey<00:01:18.930> back<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> oven<00:01:19.619> for

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
put the turkey back in the oven for

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
put the turkey back in the oven for
about<00:01:19.950> 10<00:01:20.310> minutes<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.390> check

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
about 10 minutes or so and then check

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.870 
about 10 minutes or so and then check
the<00:01:21.630> temperature<00:01:22.110> again<00:01:25.250> okay<00:01:26.250> let's<00:01:26.640> give

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the temperature again okay let's give

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:37.679 
the temperature again okay let's give
the<00:01:27.000> turkey<00:01:27.360> another<00:01:27.869> check

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.800 

perfect<00:01:38.499> we're<00:01:39.249> at<00:01:39.310> 170<00:01:40.149> degrees

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
perfect we're at 170 degrees

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.109 
perfect we're at 170 degrees
now<00:01:41.649> if<00:01:41.770> you've<00:01:41.920> stuffed<00:01:42.280> your<00:01:42.490> turkey<00:01:42.880> you'll

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
now if you've stuffed your turkey you'll

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.849 
now if you've stuffed your turkey you'll
also<00:01:43.359> want<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:43.780> check<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.049> temperature<00:01:44.649> of

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
also want to check the temperature of

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:46.319 
also want to check the temperature of
the<00:01:45.009> stuffing<00:01:45.249> you<00:01:45.640> should<00:01:46.179> have<00:01:46.299> a

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
the stuffing you should have a

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.469 
the stuffing you should have a
temperature<00:01:46.750> reading<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.310> 165<00:01:48.310> degrees<00:01:48.479> now

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
temperature reading of 165 degrees now

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.449 
temperature reading of 165 degrees now
oftentimes<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.500> turkey<00:01:50.890> will<00:01:51.039> be<00:01:51.159> cooked

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
oftentimes the turkey will be cooked

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.730 
oftentimes the turkey will be cooked
before<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.359> stuffing<00:01:52.780> is<00:01:52.929> fully<00:01:53.200> cooked<00:01:53.530> if

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
before the stuffing is fully cooked if

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.190 
before the stuffing is fully cooked if
that's<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.459> case<00:01:54.640> spoon<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.600> stuffing<00:01:56.020> out

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
that's the case spoon the stuffing out

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.959 
that's the case spoon the stuffing out
of<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.619> bird<00:01:56.829> put<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:57.399> into<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:57.579> buttered

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
of the bird put it into a buttered

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.880 
of the bird put it into a buttered
baking<00:01:58.179> dish<00:01:58.569> and<00:01:58.750> put<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.259> back<00:01:59.469> in<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.770> oven

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
baking dish and put it back in the oven

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.609 
baking dish and put it back in the oven
until<00:02:00.130> it's<00:02:00.520> finished<00:02:00.819> cooking<00:02:00.909> through<00:02:01.619> next

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
until it's finished cooking through next

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.949 
until it's finished cooking through next
I'm<00:02:03.459> going<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.789> transfer<00:02:04.179> the<00:02:04.270> turkey<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.840> my
