 we will be fast so look at the box 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.940
 here we go like that inside we go 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.530
 first look at the small leaflets 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.570
 for they put us inside 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.790
 so let's start with this little 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.430
 leaflet that presents us so the whole 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.770
 rico product line so I'm going 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.570
 let you look quickly but 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.650
 good do not you make us such 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.690
 day is an opportunity to introduce yourself 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.510
 other products so from the margin that 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.190
 ricco and I hope if you like the video 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.350
 so afterwards tell me what you 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.360
 think presentations of this product 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.440
 hello mounts a little wide of choice 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.730
 still of products they have and 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.170
 frankly it's good products 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.790
 quality for a very really very price 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.660
 reasonable so frankly I you 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.130
 advise to go for a little tour 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.700
 on the site you put the good in the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.220
 description 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.330
 so we immediately looked at the little one 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.490
 leaflet so now in fact one 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.930
 observe this is the small guarantee so 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.390
 like it's a rico product 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.340
 official so they also put us 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.990
 a little sticker so it's rather 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.190
 by his not a little sticker like that 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.950
 the rico brand frankly it's not 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.570
 badly and after we have the record of the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.950
 product so it's a German record 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.830
 karl if you do German marks 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.030
 mezaache still includes roughly how 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.769
 they work and two years I'm going 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.150
 you explain it so here is so 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.129
 now we have seen the 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.090
 the records now to the product 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.180
 as such it is in a 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.530
 little cover like this so I'm going to 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.870
 go out top 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.069
 so here's the little cover 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.079
 is a small carrying case 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.060
 really good quality 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.560
 that would allow us to transport him a 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.750
 little everywhere in the bag and then really 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.069
 not to damage it 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.900
 so concerning the speaker like you 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.730
 can see me I chose a blue 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.470
 so of the mark their ecot go 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.970
 really very good quality or less 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.140
 frank that I love is the design 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.879
 it's a very beautiful design they have 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.840
 really worked on it so I'm going 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.670
 explain to you a little 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.370
 features right now 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.620
 so as you can see first of all 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.420
 there is the on / off button so that is very 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.060
 classic so there is also the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.370
 ability to pause your 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.840
 eyes so your music and the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.909
 revive in I try to do the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.920
 quality on it also carried forward from 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.329
 do the previous music and the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.400
 next music is he also the 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.379
 possibility 2 stop the music for 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.120
 get a phone call 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.620
 so normally there is a very convenient 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.010
 so we will immediately look 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.269
 now to show you the names 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.519
 different takes that there are 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.329
 opportunity to put on the child so 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.669
 they are arranged in a small bag 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:27.459
 I'm taking it out so we do not 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.409
 could see there is so a small 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.000
 taken so it's actually that it allows to 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.709
 their noses on it as you go up 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.049
 it's a file when you do not rent it 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.299
 all in all we are arranging it so far 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.680
 the phone or a computer is in 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.579
 done without even having the button one can 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.750
 put lesson directly in water via 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.620
 the speaker so in fact if you 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.540
 do not have the button with your 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.519
 computer you can put that 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.400
 calm here and lot on my computer and 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.989
 his lesson will come out of the speaker 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.760
 so that's still very classic 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.639
 there is also the possibility of putting 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.019
 a microsd map over here if that 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.629
 interests someone so for the 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.090
 recharge you just have to place it the 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.440
 case here and that on a usb port of a 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.569
 computer and your device gets 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.340
 will recharge so we go right away 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.669
 do the test so the product so in 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.229
 do we do the button aune there saturday 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.090
 bluetooth angels so there when you 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:18.099
 see in fact they are waiting so I'm going 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.260
 take I'm going to break it yes 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.600
 maybe can fit in my game the 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.450
 to ask twenty years is the same 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.570
 so I was counting on my phone 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.910
 will activate the bluetooth so there he has me 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.250
 spotted the day before so that so I 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.850
 logs 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.500
 so here it goes so 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.620
 collective so normally 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.460
 there I'm going to select a doc music 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.850
 randomly 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.320
 I take one at worst we will say hop 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.700
 hop hop not that I find a no 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:50.160
 resume daddy august and frankly the 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.290
 are for nothing and there will be place saq 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.570
 blue note when the speaker is connected 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.500
 but frankly lesson that he is 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.990
 really very good qualities 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.510
 mental therefore comes april pregnant and 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.440
 around 30 20 to 30 euros should 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.550
 to be 25 30 euros 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.830
 it's really a very very good spirit 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.240
 quality for small speakers who get 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.740
 transport everywhere 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.880
 so when I tell you it's very very 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.260
 good quality we can transport it 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.640
 everywhere in the coronation win that 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.870
 frankly she does she really is 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.260
 not take hold of the bag in the 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.880
 poached 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.200
 frankly that a trick where we can put 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.760
 easily and can be transported 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.650
 easily thanks to the little cover that 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.030
 we propose to frankly the music 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.590
 Belgian where the army for Vour listen to 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.920
 background we really hear very well me I 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.920
 find the game 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.360
 so when you see there it works 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.889
 to clash or emitted a remix frankly 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.840

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.130
