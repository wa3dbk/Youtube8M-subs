00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.360
 good morning and welcome back to this 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.460
 new tutorial 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.020
 I am Michael d'etude and today I am here 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.860
 to teach you how to fold paper for 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.269
 making this pelican in origami is a 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.949
 recall in simple and still not only 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.949
 well squared paper sheet let's get started 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.960
 take a square piece of paper 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:37.350
 taken from a sheet a4 and as before 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:39.770
 what we give him on a single diagonal if 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.239
 we open the sheet and we carry this 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.239
 line is this line here in the center 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.840
 and now we repeat the same thing then 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.840
 we choose half again 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:32.310
 allows model turn it now 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:38.509
 we take this tip and carry it 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.509
 up to this tip so 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.870
 mark the physics and now we take the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.870
 sheet in half on this line 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.660
 now take the inside and without 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.640
 open the sheet take it towards 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:08.149
 the outside and keep it brought to 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.399
 version are fake does not reach 45 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.870
 degrees more or less then here when 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:20.330
 get 45 degrees pressed here to fix 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:23.330
 the fold now let's do a few folds on 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.090
 this one on this tip therefore is a 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:31.070
 our sheet here we push towards 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.320
 the inside is this central fold 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:39.230
 but we reverse it we become one 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:44.450
 fold valley and then press the folds 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:47.340
 you have to adjust your beak also 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.790
 you have not read desired 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:56.849
 at this point we take this side e 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.849
 we bring it here in this way 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.680
 and then we reopen it we end it with a corner 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:07.859
 turn 90 degrees and repeat the same 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.859
 thing 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:23.459
 and here too we reopen a corner boasts 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.459
 graphs and you will have your pelican 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.510
 if I can do it, it's ok 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.609
 well 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.349
 you will have your pelican who is not 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:37.120
