and you still can't find the leak

sometimes<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.000> might<00:00:21.119> be<00:00:21.180> suspecting<00:00:21.840> that

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
sometimes you might be suspecting that

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.230 
sometimes you might be suspecting that
Schrader<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.619> leaking<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.609> if<00:00:23.760> there's<00:00:23.970> dye

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
Schrader is leaking but if there's dye

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.990 
Schrader is leaking but if there's dye
in<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> system<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.019> know<00:00:25.050> when<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.380> put<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
in the system you know when you put the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.939 
in the system you know when you put the
quick-connect<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.240> your<00:00:27.420> AC<00:00:27.990> lines<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.680> there

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
quick-connect for your AC lines on there

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.950 
quick-connect for your AC lines on there
that's<00:00:29.369> where<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.699> install<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.300> dye<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.539> on

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
that's where you install the dye is on

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.200 
that's where you install the dye is on
the<00:00:31.080> low<00:00:31.230> side<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.279> when<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.550> pull<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.940> off

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the low side so when you pull this off

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.360 
the low side so when you pull this off
your<00:00:34.020> little<00:00:34.260> valve<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.710> going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:35.040> covered

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
your little valve is going to be covered

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
your little valve is going to be covered
with<00:00:35.489> dye<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:36.149> don't<00:00:36.329> know<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.840> dye

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
with dye you don't know if that is dye

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.340 
with dye you don't know if that is dye
from<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.250> install<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.120> dye<00:00:39.300> or<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:40.200> it

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
from the install of the dye or is it

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.619 
from the install of the dye or is it
actually<00:00:40.469> dye<00:00:40.980> from<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.399> leak<00:00:41.640> well<00:00:42.450> there's

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
actually dye from the leak well there's

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.299 
actually dye from the leak well there's
one<00:00:42.809> way<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.020> found<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.590> helps<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.920> determine

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
one way I found that helps you determine

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.000 
one way I found that helps you determine
that<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.969> that's<00:00:45.149> use<00:00:45.480> an<00:00:45.780> audio<00:00:46.079> vise<00:00:46.500> audio

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that and that's use an audio vise audio

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.260 
that and that's use an audio vise audio
amplifier<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.480> works<00:00:48.660> pretty<00:00:48.899> simple<00:00:50.090> just<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
amplifier it works pretty simple just a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.380 
amplifier it works pretty simple just a
set<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> headphones<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:52.699> plugs<00:00:53.699> into<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.059> wand

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
set of headphones that plugs into a wand

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.410 
set of headphones that plugs into a wand
you<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:55.440> control<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.980> volume<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:57.030> set<00:00:57.239> that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you can control the volume you set that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.150 
you can control the volume you set that
right<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.750> top<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> there<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.590> guarantee

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
right on top of there and that guarantee

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.700 
right on top of there and that guarantee
if<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> leaking<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.420> will<00:01:00.600> hear<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.989> so

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
if that is leaking you will hear it so

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.219 
if that is leaking you will hear it so
we're<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> show<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.219> how<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.609> works<00:01:03.229> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
we're going to show you how it works the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.870 
we're going to show you how it works the
sound<00:01:04.439> amplifier<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.129> actually<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> pretty

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
sound amplifier is actually a pretty

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.429 
sound amplifier is actually a pretty
simple<00:01:06.119> device<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.020> got<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> very

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
simple device has just got a very

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.170 
simple device has just got a very
sensitive<00:01:07.860> microphone<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> end<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.090> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
sensitive microphone on the end of it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.300 
sensitive microphone on the end of it
it's<00:01:09.780> got<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> volume<00:01:10.380> control<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it's got a volume control so that you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.429 
it's got a volume control so that you
can<00:01:11.460> turn<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.420> put<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.659> headphones<00:01:13.200> on

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
can turn it up you put the headphones on

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.950 
can turn it up you put the headphones on
and<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.799> start<00:01:14.070> listening<00:01:14.400> now<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.450> may<00:01:15.810> have

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and you start listening now you may have

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.260 
and you start listening now you may have
to<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.040> precise<00:01:17.549> because<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.939> could<00:01:18.150> be

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
to get very precise because you could be

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.760 
to get very precise because you could be
all<00:01:18.420> around<00:01:18.810> something<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.290> could<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.680> as

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
all around something you could be as

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.710 
all around something you could be as
close<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.549> an<00:01:20.729> inch<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> half<00:01:21.150> inch<00:01:21.479> away<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
close as an inch or a half inch away and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320 
close as an inch or a half inch away and
not<00:01:22.049> hear<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.430> we're<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> put<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
not hear it so we're going to put the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.719 
not hear it so we're going to put the
microphone<00:01:25.290> into<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> camera<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.549> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
microphone into the camera so that you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.870 
microphone into the camera so that you
can<00:01:26.880> hear<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.420> show<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.930> leak<00:01:28.880> now

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
can hear it and show you this leak now

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.460 
can hear it and show you this leak now
you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.150> tell<00:01:30.329> sometimes<00:01:30.810> you've<00:01:31.140> got<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.380> be

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
you can tell sometimes you've got to be

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.600 
you can tell sometimes you've got to be
right<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.070> before<00:01:32.220> you'll<00:01:32.610> hear

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.100 

come<00:01:36.420> away<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.220> may<00:01:38.370> be<00:01:38.400> around<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.110> over

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
come away but you may be around it over

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.230 
come away but you may be around it over
here<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.410> you<00:01:40.500> don't<00:01:40.650> hear<00:01:40.890> anything<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:42.180> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
here and you don't hear anything so you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.270 
here and you don't hear anything so you
can<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.630> pinpoint<00:01:43.320> right<00:01:43.560> down<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.100> nigger

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
can be pinpoint right down to the nigger
