00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.420
 at first glance, the shirvana steppes are calm 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.190
 and monotonous yellow-green steppe 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.499
 waving in the wind barely noticeable 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:23.550
 lulls and pacifies with movements 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:27.189
 but this monotony is only apparent 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.989
 so we are amazing again in Azerbaijan 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.179
 but this is a large territory 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.280
 shirvan national park i when 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.170
 was one of the Caspian Sea and although in 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.949
 present she represent 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.719
 just plain 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.780
 traces can still be found here 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.760
 the ancient town of the park lies 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.750
 in the region of moderately warm half-empty and 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.620
 dry steppes 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.690
 summer is hot and dry winters are mild 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.460
 The reserve has developed several types 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.199
 vegetation and desert and 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.359
 semi-desert and meadow 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.129
 and the animal world is such 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.329
 a variety that you will not meet 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.030
 perhaps nowhere else 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.290
 beautiful steppe in the spring and more on the forest 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.740
 unpredictable and even dangerous meet 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.170
 phalanx threatens phalanx spider has 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.810
 several names of solpuga pehorka 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.990
 phalanx the camel spider and is 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.000
 rather unpredictable animals begin 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.369
 from the fact that it is not quite a spider though 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.490
 refers to arachnids known about 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.070
 thousands of phalanx species for scientists names 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.409
 flank and too comfortable and more general 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.520
 consumer name Solpuga in 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.930
 translated from Latin 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.790
 it means running away from the sun at all 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.930
 not by chance we met our hero 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.829
 evening at sunset 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.170
 solpugs are very peculiar in their image 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.509
 living and building blend together and 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.610
 signs of high development and primitive 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.829
 features such as body structure and 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.170
 their limbs are quite primitive. 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.469
 respiratory system is the most developed of all 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.750
 arachnids phalanx rather large 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.640
 animals Central Asian phalanx can 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.890
 reach a length of 7 centimeters 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.060
 whole body including limbs covered 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.549
 long hairs 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.470
 the tentacles in front are like 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.670
 limbs and often perform and 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.560
 function you 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.480
 they go frighteningly and hardly anyone 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.180
 will willingly meet with 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:22.270
 him closer so these mobile animals 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.730
 are nocturnal predators they are omnivores 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.950
 eating termites dark beetles 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.959
 other small arthropods but 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.420
 eat and bigger game for example 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.190
 lizard mainly phalanx inhabits 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.230
 deserts and semi-deserts can 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.050
 meet in the desert gobi on the north 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.360
 Caucasus in Astrakhan for the Caucasus on the bottom 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.280
 the Volga region in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.390
 and in Europe they live in Greece and 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.190
 In Spain I gave no phalanxes but their bites 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.810
 can have dire consequences 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.360
 large phalanges quite able 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.459
 bite through human skin and since on and 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.799
 the remains of decaying remains 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.900
 of their victims when they are bitten they can get into 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:08.440
 wound and cause inflammation or infection 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:10.540
 blood about phalanx poison 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.730
 There are many fiction 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.250
 for a long time people thought her terrible 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.410
 poisonous and very dangerous for man herself 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.480
 the personâ€™s flank is not completely afraid 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.670
 and at night can easily run in a tent 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.040
 on the light of the flashlight so you will spend the night 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.590
 in these places the entrance to the tent is always 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.450
 close different nations give phalanxes 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.269
 most diverse name for example 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.250
 wind scorpion is the name of the phalanx 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.560
 got for their run because they can 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.109
 reach speeds of up to 16 kilometers in 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.109
 hour see and our phalanx ran 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.930
 wonderful creature unusual and 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.930
 interesting
