00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
well the days head looking a little bit

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.299 
well the days head looking a little bit
wet<00:00:12.840> across<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.320> southeast<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:13.889> will<00:00:14.009> even

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
wet across the southeast and will even

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.770 
wet across the southeast and will even
see<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> brief<00:00:14.969> touch<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.450> through

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
see a brief touch of that through

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.939 
see a brief touch of that through
England<00:00:16.080> parts<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.560> Queensland

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
England parts of Queensland

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.010

unfortunately<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> bulk<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.330> rain<00:00:18.510> will

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
unfortunately the bulk of that rain will

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.840 
unfortunately the bulk of that rain will
fall<00:00:19.260> south<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.800> Charlie<00:00:20.100> bill<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.430> as<00:00:20.730> it

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
fall south of Charlie bill and as it

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.670 
fall south of Charlie bill and as it
moves<00:00:21.060> further<00:00:21.270> east<00:00:21.539> will<00:00:21.720> dissipate<00:00:22.289> quite

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
moves further east will dissipate quite

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.500 
moves further east will dissipate quite
quickly<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.490> are<00:00:23.580> looking<00:00:23.820> at<00:00:23.939> mostly<00:00:24.210> dry

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
