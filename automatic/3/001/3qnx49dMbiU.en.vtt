the side and what's really cool about

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.710 
the side and what's really cool about
this<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.460> put<00:01:26.729> foot<00:01:27.090> pegs<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.570> there

neat things about the slave ones it kind
of<00:01:42.119> works<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> diorama<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.470> way<00:01:43.909> you<00:01:44.909> move

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
of works as a diorama in a way you move

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.910 
of works as a diorama in a way you move
them<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> way<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> bit<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
them all the way so we can get a bit of

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.039 
them all the way so we can get a bit of
a<00:01:47.009> better<00:01:47.220> look

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.760 

all<00:01:50.590> right<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.509> as<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:52.689> can<00:01:52.810> see<00:01:52.869> if<00:01:53.109> I<00:01:53.229> if<00:01:53.469> I<00:01:53.590> go

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
all right so as you can see if I if I go

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.859 
all right so as you can see if I if I go
in<00:01:53.920> there<00:01:54.130> there's<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.609> there's<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.450> actual

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
in there there's the there's the actual

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.410 
in there there's the there's the actual
I<00:01:56.259> guess<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.070> call<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.340> bridge<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.179> slave

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
I guess you call it bridge of the slave

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.450 
I guess you call it bridge of the slave
one<00:01:58.689> where<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.110> put<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.469> figures<00:01:59.890> in<00:02:00.159> and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
one where you put the figures in and

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.660 
one where you put the figures in and
there's<00:02:01.149> some<00:02:01.570> control<00:02:02.409> panels<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.399> have<00:02:03.549> to

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
there's some control panels you have to

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.550 
there's some control panels you have to
actually<00:02:03.939> apply<00:02:04.450> those<00:02:04.719> stickers<00:02:05.200> there<00:02:05.380> but

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
actually apply those stickers there but

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.029 
actually apply those stickers there but
those<00:02:05.679> ones<00:02:05.890> came<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.440> sly<00:02:08.619> one<00:02:08.649> already

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
those ones came on the sly one already

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.630 
those ones came on the sly one already
these<00:02:09.759> two<00:02:10.000> stickers<00:02:10.299> that<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:10.750> see<00:02:10.989> here<00:02:11.379> I

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
these two stickers that you see here I

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.670 
these two stickers that you see here I
had<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.819> apply<00:02:13.060> those<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.660> then<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.379> can<00:02:14.500> see

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
had to apply those and then you can see

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.500 
had to apply those and then you can see
there's<00:02:14.860> multiple<00:02:15.340> foot<00:02:15.580> pegs<00:02:16.830> all<00:02:17.830> right<00:02:18.099> and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
there's multiple foot pegs all right and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.660 
there's multiple foot pegs all right and
the<00:02:19.620> doors<00:02:20.620> lock

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
the doors lock

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.089 
the doors lock
unlike<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.299> canopy<00:02:22.840> which<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:23.140> kind<00:02:23.380> of<00:02:23.530> loose

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
unlike the canopy which is kind of loose

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.150 
unlike the canopy which is kind of loose
it<00:02:25.000> does<00:02:25.269> lock<00:02:25.599> into<00:02:25.959> place<00:02:26.110> like<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.590> very

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
it does lock into place like that very

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.600 
it does lock into place like that very
well<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.660> hopefully<00:02:29.500> turning<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.160> slave<00:02:30.430> one

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
well and hopefully turning the slave one

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.300 
well and hopefully turning the slave one
around<00:02:30.849> without<00:02:31.000> knocking<00:02:31.360> everything<00:02:31.810> over

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
around without knocking everything over

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.890 
around without knocking everything over
we<00:02:33.310> will<00:02:33.400> give<00:02:33.519> it<00:02:33.670> back<00:02:33.700> here<00:02:34.239> this<00:02:34.450> would<00:02:34.720> be

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
we will give it back here this would be

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.740 
we will give it back here this would be
where<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:36.310> this<00:02:36.519> slave<00:02:36.849> one<00:02:37.060> were<00:02:37.209> just<00:02:37.450> scale

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
where if this slave one were just scale

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.509 
where if this slave one were just scale
the<00:02:38.019> figures<00:02:38.349> this<00:02:38.709> would<00:02:38.890> actually<00:02:39.040> be<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
the figures this would actually be the

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.900 
the figures this would actually be the
entrance<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.799> slave<00:02:42.069> one<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.640> they<00:02:42.700> put

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
entrance to the slave one and they put

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.490 
entrance to the slave one and they put
this<00:02:43.090> thing<00:02:43.150> here<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.810> I'm<00:02:44.019> not<00:02:44.170> even<00:02:44.290> going

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
this thing here and I'm not even going

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.400 
this thing here and I'm not even going
to<00:02:44.530> try<00:02:44.680> well<00:02:45.459> there<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.700> goes<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.930> sort<00:02:47.290> of

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
to try well there it goes it's sort of

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.920 
to try well there it goes it's sort of
worthless<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.099> mean<00:02:48.280> no<00:02:48.940> figure<00:02:49.329> could<00:02:49.540> fit<00:02:49.810> in

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
worthless I mean no figure could fit in

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.210 
worthless I mean no figure could fit in
there<00:02:51.390> even<00:02:52.390> Boba<00:02:52.930> Fett<00:02:53.170> whose<00:02:53.410> pretty<00:02:53.829> short

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
there even Boba Fett whose pretty short

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.840 
there even Boba Fett whose pretty short
is<00:02:54.430> probably<00:02:55.150> like<00:02:55.420> 11<00:02:55.630> or<00:02:56.049> 12<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:57.400> can<00:02:57.609> stand

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
is probably like 11 or 12 you can stand

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.120 
is probably like 11 or 12 you can stand
right<00:02:58.000> about<00:02:58.180> there<00:02:58.690> so<00:02:58.889> obviously<00:02:59.889> this

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
right about there so obviously this

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.890 
right about there so obviously this
isn't<00:03:00.489> meant<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.760> be<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:01.060> entrance<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.660> side

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
isn't meant to be the entrance the side

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.750 
isn't meant to be the entrance the side
door<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.230> more<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:02.859> the<00:03:03.040> entrance<00:03:03.459> if<00:03:03.760> anything

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
door is more of the entrance if anything

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.099 
door is more of the entrance if anything
so<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:06.880> is<00:03:07.090> sort<00:03:07.329> of<00:03:07.389> just<00:03:07.450> like<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.780> worthless

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
so this is sort of just like a worthless

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.960 
so this is sort of just like a worthless
little<00:03:09.930> thing<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.139> add<00:03:11.290> on<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.799> slave<00:03:12.730> one

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
little thing to add on to the slave one

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.550 
little thing to add on to the slave one
very<00:03:13.630> hard<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:14.079> lock<00:03:14.290> into<00:03:14.620> place<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:16.180> then<00:03:16.630> we

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
very hard to lock into place and then we

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.750 
very hard to lock into place and then we
have<00:03:18.359> this<00:03:19.359> thing<00:03:19.690> here<00:03:20.370> which<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.609> like

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
have this thing here which is like

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.330 
have this thing here which is like
supposed<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.389> be<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.569> cell<00:03:22.870> block<00:03:23.099> and<00:03:24.099> it's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
supposed to be a cell block and it's

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.670 
supposed to be a cell block and it's
basically<00:03:24.790> just<00:03:24.910> like<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.239> plastic<00:03:25.810> coffin

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
basically just like a plastic coffin

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.559 
basically just like a plastic coffin
so<00:03:28.340> this<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.700> supposed<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.000> find<00:03:29.180> like<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
so this is supposed to find like the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.390 
so this is supposed to find like the
detention<00:03:30.170> area<00:03:30.319> of<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.680> slave<00:03:30.950> one<00:03:31.190> but

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
detention area of the slave one but

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.430 
detention area of the slave one but
again<00:03:31.849> it's<00:03:32.060> pretty<00:03:32.299> cheap<00:03:32.720> it's<00:03:33.019> kind<00:03:33.349> of

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
again it's pretty cheap it's kind of

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.970 
again it's pretty cheap it's kind of
rinky-dink<00:03:33.769> it's<00:03:35.110> at<00:03:36.110> least<00:03:36.379> it<00:03:36.530> locks<00:03:36.739> into

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
rinky-dink it's at least it locks into

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.530 
rinky-dink it's at least it locks into
place<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.489> doesn't<00:03:37.670> come<00:03:37.879> down<00:03:37.909> good<00:03:38.360> that's
