i'm here at goon hilly which is where
they've<00:00:09.719> got<00:00:09.840> massive<00:00:10.469> satellites<00:00:11.010> oh<00:00:11.309> and

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
they've got massive satellites oh and

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.180 
they've got massive satellites oh and
it's<00:00:11.880> placed<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.389> 60s<00:00:12.900> they<00:00:13.530> took<00:00:13.799> all<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
way way way out of space which is a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.200 
way way way out of space which is a
rather<00:00:37.739> marvelous<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.760> best<00:00:38.969> thing<00:00:39.180> about

rather marvelous the best thing about
today<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.899> I'm<00:00:40.020> about<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
today is that I'm about to go on a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.970 
today is that I'm about to go on a
Segway<00:00:41.040> which<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.579> why<00:00:42.140> he'll<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.260> buds<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
Segway which is why he'll be buds on a

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.490 
Segway which is why he'll be buds on a
knee<00:00:44.550> pads<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.570> rather<00:00:45.719> attractive<00:00:45.899> neon

knee pads and a rather attractive neon
yellow<00:00:46.649> jacket<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.090> bit<00:00:48.210> okay<00:00:49.140> so

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
yellow jacket see you in a bit okay so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.139 
yellow jacket see you in a bit okay so
basically<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.489> way<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.670> which<00:00:50.789> your<00:00:50.969> segway

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
basically the way in which your segway

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.520 
basically the way in which your segway
works<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:53.930> you've<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.170> central

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
works is you've got this central

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.319 
works is you've got this central
platform<00:00:55.739> here<00:00:56.100> okay<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.910> actually

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
platform here okay that's actually

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.330 
platform here okay that's actually
stabilized<00:00:57.899> by<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.230> machine<00:00:58.559> itself<00:00:58.680> okay

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
stabilized by the machine itself okay

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.459 
stabilized by the machine itself okay
you<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.940> stand<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.750> demonstrated

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you just stand on that as demonstrated

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.500 
you just stand on that as demonstrated
by<00:01:01.500> Sarah<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.760> stand<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> then

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
by Sarah that you stand on that then

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.969 
by Sarah that you stand on that then
you've<00:01:03.690> got<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.379> spacek<00:01:04.830> your

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
you've got this with spacek your

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.370 
you've got this with spacek your
steering<00:01:05.280> okay<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> tell<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.140> right

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
steering okay so you tell that the right

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.940 
steering okay so you tell that the right
machine<00:01:07.830> spinsters<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:12.320> okay<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
machine spinsters right okay you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.469 
machine spinsters right okay you
forwards<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.369> backwards<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:15.150> actually

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
forwards and backwards is actually

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.850 
forwards and backwards is actually
controlled<00:01:15.840> by<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.049> tilt<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> machine

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
controlled by the tilt of the machine

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.890 
controlled by the tilt of the machine
itself<00:01:16.979> okay<00:01:17.580> ticketing<00:01:18.210> forwards<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
itself okay ticketing forwards like that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.800 
itself okay ticketing forwards like that
machine<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.710> forwards<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.630> lean

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
machine this forwards and if you lean

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.539 
machine this forwards and if you lean
your<00:01:21.840> weight<00:01:21.960> back<00:01:22.200> which<00:01:22.799> equals<00:01:23.100> slow<00:01:23.280> down

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
your weight back which equals slow down

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.910 
your weight back which equals slow down
spot<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.090> start<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> get<00:01:25.020> back<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.320> okay

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
spot and start to get back with okay

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.890 
spot and start to get back with okay
where<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> machines<00:01:26.790> themselves<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.750> not

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
where the machines themselves I'm not

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.950 
where the machines themselves I'm not
actually<00:01:28.110> designed<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.890> backwards

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
actually designed to go backwards

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.480 
actually designed to go backwards
they've<00:01:30.960> cleared<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.159> back<00:01:32.280> there's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
they've cleared if you go back there's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.980 
they've cleared if you go back there's
too<00:01:32.640> much<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.119> become<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.600> unstable

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
too much they will become very unstable

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.899 
too much they will become very unstable
and<00:01:34.380> very<00:01:34.890> lucky<00:01:35.130> through<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> floor

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and very lucky through you to the floor

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.030 
and very lucky through you to the floor
so<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:36.900> avoid<00:01:37.140> doing<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> can

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
so you can avoid doing that if you can

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.160 
so you can avoid doing that if you can
right<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.030> front<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> say<00:01:39.509> okay<00:01:39.689> now<00:01:40.020> see

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
right in front of you say okay now see

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
right in front of you say okay now see
this<00:01:40.290> much<00:01:40.530> label<00:01:40.979> there<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.460> says<00:01:41.700> warning

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
this much label there it says warning

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.530 
this much label there it says warning
risk<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.930> death<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.530> serious<00:01:43.829> injury<00:01:44.399> okay<00:01:45.090> so
