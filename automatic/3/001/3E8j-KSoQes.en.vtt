00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 the alva lapse that speaks the same with more 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.929
 a video for you in this duo shown 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.330
 as in which the first best program 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.670
 to record and one is in three programs 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.910
 which I think are the worst 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.710
 I'll tell you what's cold and with 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.640
 The child ran to me too. 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.730
 akon samus I'm frank, the flex for me is 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.630
 good is producing the percentiles work 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.559
 Saturdays common as it pays to work 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.250
 easily without problems 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.950
 seek problems gave that the codec I 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.070
 I think a lot and that is good is good enough 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.610
 Perfectly not very well to be 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.969
 remembered we believe advertiser ready in is 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.120
 super easy to provoke one does not want to know 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:07.110
 very well how to learn to work with 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:09.960
 a championship all 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.370
 a track he thinks the psd below 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.540
 now it's not like that 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.360
 But a bigger problem is that it 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.270
 record when I left recordable strip by 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.330
 example played 150 cold for example one 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.280
 very son be pension be operating 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.280
 too much contact or even if you did not hire 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.250
 so I do not know that I do not even use the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.770
 fred just so close even for being 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:44.640
 is the option to record a monitor ready 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.820
 the second is that it is a warning and it is 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.030
 only for those who have it is wonder is the tea 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.740
 plech this time defendants all 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.220
 Now you're ready then. 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.170
 Mayor Rosa, that 's how I record everything. 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.759
 a sound game sound we are better horse 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.880
 all the same 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.850
 in the same lane this will avoid 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.860
 shaken and white credits ie by 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.820
 example was launched as was the Sergio 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.040
 pine 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.550
 I can not call myself trust too much. 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.640
 low 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.810
 to prove it so mexico here 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.930
 it's very good 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.540
 writing takes up almost nothing with the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.880
 treasure the cast when gel is only 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:37.560
 I hope times when pet what is much 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.940
 because it values â€‹â€‹the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.600
 conflict because the graph to record or 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.150
 either have no problem between almost like 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.030
 a much more movement problem 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:54.130
 peaceful with these own programs and 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:58.180
 just because it has nvidia and above all else 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:04.210
 we have to ask for 600 portuguese soccer 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:07.080
 the following is the story for me this is 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.120
 a yellow flower in the best that we 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.940
 So it 's that I know and I'm going to vaccinate 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.950
 also how common is the athlete 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.790
 first time and ready 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.780
 has a personal cost principle 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.730
 spirit 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.360
 here you do not even have to check the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.760
 sign agreement with stella mari everything here 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.860
 it's for me 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.260
 get an album here that is my arm 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.560
 it's up how much you do increase 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.750
 brand has proven and approved contains spike for 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.140
 record full hd 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.710
 you also have to feel the 67 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.930
 points or more or less says to be very 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.610
 bit because I 'm going to record did not close and 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.970
 to malaria 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.940
 There should also be super fast 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.330
 steal here and they always make me feel 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.610
 I think absurd it went well without problems and that 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.270
 is not the arrival of this problem was the 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:11.990
 Okay, see how it goes. 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:16.640
 so the same people for me she is 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.710
 similar when you start recording the codec 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.170
 in several colleagues have that the phelps 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:25.760

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:29.090
 with fred has now has internet here 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.969
 far away would have paid itu scholarship 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.999
 offers 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:39.339
 This is the best colleague and friend comes with 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:40.360
 one is enough for what I always want 

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:43.899
 your name 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.179
 You already have a protocol to fill 

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:49.389
 the vacancy is very or very small 

00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:50.589
 She was a very good woman for the regions. 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.559
 and ready 

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:57.989
 fortunately they have an observatory with 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:05:02.409
 a compadrio other four 

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:03.909
 It has been observed that I can win in 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.179
 debut against the lion 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:09.939
 that welcomed me this morning 14 years 

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:14.789
 suffers with the ideal weight and better 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:21.189
 This organized y r 12 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:23.469
 so much in contact because it chooses 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:25.540
 the front want to think it comes that it does not have 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:29.550
 How do you work out how the levels 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:33.100
 thirty charlton in the same to talk format 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.590
 is that something is not a good size 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.570
 that the website 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.700
 you may have on air is less 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.250
 feeling is sensitive to touch with 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.370
 conflict resolution never recorded 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.400
 expelling agenda and went beyond and would bring 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:52.030
 avoiding the same thing when our 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:06:04.330
 Metem not to ask was always to 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:06:08.200
 record the album do you think a great thing 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:11.980
 And you can record on skates, but I think. 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.960
 that I have the blue program of the 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.310
 Europe comes from the guard of my voice 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.590
 yesterday the workshop in the first goal the game 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.010
 in this controversial Iraq profile occurs in 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.230
 goias 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:28.010
 who expects the pace 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:31.430
 who did not say andersson band years 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.170
 You can see here we have 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.350
 mess food 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.810
 the defender arrives here in patience 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.420
 that is, he continued without being able to leave the 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.610
 silva sortelha and forward do not be 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:47.110
 brother have fun plus our batteries 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:50.390
 formed trunks any profits in 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.130
 2011 juvenile presents marry a lot 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:59.510
 bush and garbage paper that today 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:07:00.770
 just me but can not say more 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.840
 anything 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.880
 just go to failure involves showing that 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.420
 influence 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.060
 I think it will not show why I 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:15.320
 I will write to flex messes we are 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:18.610
 north or we are giving your game 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:21.890
 to win on the globe then you have 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:25.550
 printed on top of the top scorer 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:27.560
 miner appears as a flower of 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.470
 pray for me when you go to 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.220
 record 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:35.560
 and it is the Flemish are less a good thing 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.540
 It is that you can record and 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:41.590
 and you comment on arriving 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:43.690
 to 60 or 100 athletes per family and I 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:53.800
 I think it 's done with continued risk 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:58.960
 control of these is for the program has a 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:01.200
 tablet that has a cure but only because it is not 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.200
 that
