00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello I am sonia in the video tutorial of 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.830
 today we are going to learn how to make laps 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.830
 short 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.770
 the short turns consist in weaving the 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.660
 back but not until its completion 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.820
 that is to say that we reached a certain point 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.280
 we turn the work around and we continue 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.620
 knitting you will ask what is it for 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.129
 in this type of laps have a crowd 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.470
 of applications one of them the most 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.260
 common is to perform the shape of the 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.120
 Sock heel also serves to 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.840
 perform shapes in the tissue as per 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.500
 example sheets we start to make the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.950
 short laps the process is that 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.200
 we weave only a part of 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.600
 the turn in this case we're going to weave 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.130
 only 5 points 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.590
 once arrived at the five points 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.049
 we surround the next point of the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.190
 Next we put the thread as 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.710
 if we were to knit the inside out 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.510
 we slide the point as if we were to 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.800
 knit it upside down 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.050
 we passed the thread 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.670
 surrounding the point as if we were going to 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.220
 we knit the right we turn the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.770
 work 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.650
 we slide again the same point as 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.080
 if we were to knit it upside down 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.510
 and we put the thread to weave the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.120
 straight 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.710
 in this way we have got 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:51.640
 make the short return and that we do not stay 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.580
 a hole of separation between where 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.800
 we have finished the short return and where 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.110
 continue the turn 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.860
 ok we have surrounded that point and that 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.020
 way there is no gap left 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.520
 we repeat we are going to weave the first 5 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.520
 turn points 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.540
 two 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:18.280
 4 and 5 the next point the only thing that 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.200
 let's do is surround it with this thread 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.700
 so there is not a hole left 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.790
 separation between the first five 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.530
 points and the rest of the turn then 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.050
 we put the thread as if we were 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.870
 knit inside out we slip the next 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.950
 point to knit it upside down 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.770
 we put the thread back in its 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.930
 initial position we go around the 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.299
 work 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.819
 we slide the point again as if 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.549
 we were to weave it inside out we put the 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.650
 strand as to weave the right and already 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.980
 we have the right until the end of the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.980
 return 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.560
 Well I want to show how it will go 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.560
 leaving our short laps 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.280
 and if you notice on this side where 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.650
 we have made the short laps is 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.470
 the broader work and in this more 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.470
 narrow goes from less to more 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:33.010
 and now we're going to perform to go back 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.590
 until this other point then let's see 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.930
 how do we collect the points that before 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.180
 we have surrounded with the thread 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.140
 Now let's proceed to go picking 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.140
 the points that we have previously surrounded 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.140
 so 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.930
 we started knitting and we'll go 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.730
 finding with those points that before 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.070
 we have surrounded with the thread so that 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.020
 there were gaps between the first five 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.450
 points and the rest of the round 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.310
 at these points they are normal and now 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.980
 here we already find one of the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.780
 points that is surrounded then we take 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.210
 that point 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.970
 and the strand with which it is surrounded 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.400
 and then we pass them to the needle 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.810
 left 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.810
 and we knit them together 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.830
 this other point also 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.120
 it is also surrounded by the thread 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.120
 then we take the point 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.340
 evra 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.340
 and we knit them together 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:48.220
 again the point the strand 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.430
 and we knit them together 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.390
 and we can finish 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.390
 the whole round 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.850
 Well, that 's how the 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.880
 short laps as you see we have made 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.530
 here one way that does not stay in the other 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.360
 side where we have not done the 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.219
 short turns 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.199
 in this video tutorial we have learned 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:26.569
 how to make short laps that have 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.610
 multiple applications you already know if 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.409
 you have any doubt leave a comment 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.129
 in the video and well I hope that I have 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.509
 served 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.689
 thank you very much for watching and even the 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.689
 next
