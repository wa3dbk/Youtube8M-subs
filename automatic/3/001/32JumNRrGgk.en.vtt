Christmas and follow the instructions
to<00:00:14.860> get<00:00:14.980> it<00:00:15.129> back<00:00:15.490> into<00:00:15.730> a<00:00:15.879> cube<00:00:16.209> but<00:00:16.660> once

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
to get it back into a cube but once

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.480 
to get it back into a cube but once
you've<00:00:17.199> taken<00:00:17.439> it<00:00:17.710> apart<00:00:18.330> was<00:00:19.330> somewhat<00:00:19.779> term

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
you've taken it apart was somewhat term

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.480 
you've taken it apart was somewhat term
difficult<00:00:21.490> so<00:00:22.300> I've<00:00:22.840> had<00:00:23.050> two<00:00:23.890> assists

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
difficult so I've had two assists

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.499 
difficult so I've had two assists
everybody<00:00:25.000> and<00:00:25.419> of<00:00:26.050> course<00:00:26.369> Amy<00:00:27.369> and<00:00:27.849> she<00:00:28.329> has

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
everybody and of course Amy and she has

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.589 
everybody and of course Amy and she has
to<00:00:28.660> come<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:29.140> pretty<00:00:29.829> back<00:00:30.430> again<00:00:30.820> into<00:00:31.090> a<00:00:31.269> cube

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
to come to pretty back again into a cube

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.540 
to come to pretty back again into a cube
I'd<00:00:32.500> video<00:00:32.949> how<00:00:33.610> to<00:00:33.640> do<00:00:34.000> it<00:00:34.150> so<00:00:34.390> here<00:00:35.199> it<00:00:35.350> is<00:00:35.550> so

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
I'd video how to do it so here it is so

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.110 
I'd video how to do it so here it is so
here<00:00:36.730> we<00:00:36.760> are<00:00:36.970> how<00:00:37.180> to<00:00:37.239> put<00:00:37.600> your<00:00:37.809> neocube<00:00:39.120> back

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
here we are how to put your neocube back

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.770 
here we are how to put your neocube back
into<00:00:40.449> a<00:00:40.480> cube<00:00:41.129> 12<00:00:42.129> sheet<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:43.300> you<00:00:43.510> get<00:00:43.600> it<00:00:43.660> over

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
into a cube 12 sheet it you get it over

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.660 
into a cube 12 sheet it you get it over
to<00:00:43.930> online<00:00:44.379> then<00:00:44.769> you<00:00:44.860> take<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.129> first<00:00:45.280> 36

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
to online then you take the first 36

00:00:45.670 --> 00:01:09.929 
to online then you take the first 36
that's<00:00:46.210> 12<00:01:03.059> 36<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.159> got<00:01:06.310> 36<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.760> fold

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
that's 12 36 so you got 36 then you fold

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:28.710 
that's 12 36 so you got 36 then you fold
it<00:01:10.150> back<00:01:10.390> on<00:01:10.600> itself<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.090> get<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.510> a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
it back on itself and if you get it a

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.510 
it back on itself and if you get it a
little<00:01:28.990> bit<00:01:29.290> worried<00:01:29.710> so<00:01:29.920> I<00:01:29.950> do<00:01:30.040> not<00:01:30.310> join

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
little bit worried so I do not join

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.840 
little bit worried so I do not join
together<00:01:30.760> you<00:01:31.510> move<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.490> roll<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.610> balls

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
together you move the roll the balls

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.570 
together you move the roll the balls
round<00:01:34.360> until<00:01:35.200> this<00:01:35.440> stick<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:39.280> keep

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
round until this stick and you keep

00:01:39.580 --> 00:02:13.050 
round until this stick and you keep
repeating<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.750> process

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.790 

all<00:02:14.060> right<00:02:14.180> there<00:02:14.780> we<00:02:14.990> are<00:02:15.050> until<00:02:15.590> you've<00:02:15.770> got

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
all right there we are until you've got

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.220 
all right there we are until you've got
a<00:02:16.280> nice<00:02:16.970> long<00:02:17.270> line<00:02:17.480> like<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.780> then<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.740> take

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
a nice long line like that then you take

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.500 
a nice long line like that then you take
the<00:02:21.230> first<00:02:22.000> 12<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.810> way<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:25.010> that's<00:02:25.070> 1<00:02:25.580> 2<00:02:25.880> 3

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
the first 12 in that way so that's 1 2 3

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:36.100 
the first 12 in that way so that's 1 2 3
4<00:02:31.390> 12<00:02:33.250> then<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.430> fold<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.970> back<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:35.600> this<00:02:35.840> end

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
4 12 then you fold it back so this end

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:52.350 
4 12 then you fold it back so this end
touches<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:37.250> 12<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:41.510> be<00:02:41.690> careful

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.920 

so<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.980> looks<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:57.670> then<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:59.060> squeeze

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
so it looks like that then you squeeze

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:12.089 
so it looks like that then you squeeze
it<00:03:00.409> together<00:03:00.620> very<00:03:01.190> gently<00:03:10.330> until<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:11.599> forms

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
it together very gently until it forms

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.030 
it together very gently until it forms
that<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:14.629> keep<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.530> turn<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:15.950> around

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
that and you keep you turn it around

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.339 
that and you keep you turn it around
live<00:03:16.400> up<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:17.360> repeat<00:03:17.629> the<00:03:17.690> process<00:03:20.110> it's<00:03:21.110> one

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
live up and repeat the process it's one

00:03:21.349 --> 00:04:01.589 
live up and repeat the process it's one
two<00:03:21.799> three<00:03:22.400> four<00:03:22.819> six<00:03:23.810> seven<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:26.390> twelve<00:04:00.519> then

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
two three four six seven and twelve then

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:09.430 
two three four six seven and twelve then
the<00:04:02.599> last<00:04:02.780> one<00:04:06.819> should<00:04:07.819> all<00:04:08.209> fight<00:04:08.660> turn<00:04:09.230> it

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
the last one should all fight turn it

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:18.599 
the last one should all fight turn it
into<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.799> cube<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:15.230> there<00:04:15.440> we<00:04:15.590> are<00:04:16.450> no<00:04:17.450> neocube

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
into a cube and there we are no neocube

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.889 
into a cube and there we are no neocube
back<00:04:19.609> into<00:04:20.539> a<00:04:20.599> cube<00:04:20.900> easy
