very<00:00:53.579> easy<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.270> also<00:00:54.930> use<00:00:55.260> sponge<00:00:55.680> rollers<00:00:56.129> for

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
very easy I also use sponge rollers for

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.810

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.620 
probably about a half inch diameter then
I<00:01:06.509> also<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> 1<00:01:07.380> inch<00:01:07.560> diameter<00:01:08.630> sponge

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.609 
I also get the 1 inch diameter sponge
rollers<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.140> well<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:11.659> use<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.690> for<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.440> rat

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
rollers as well I use this for the rat

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.850 
rollers as well I use this for the rat
from<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:13.950> victory<00:01:14.430> rolls<00:01:14.759> and<00:01:15.860> also

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
from the victory rolls and also

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.999 
from the victory rolls and also
sometimes<00:01:17.190> I<00:01:17.790> use<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.540> my<00:01:18.810> bangs<00:01:19.170> most<00:01:19.860> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
sometimes I use it for my bangs most of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
sometimes I use it for my bangs most of
time<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.190> use<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> bigger<00:01:20.820> rats<00:01:21.119> from<00:01:21.330> my<00:01:21.509> bangs

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
time I use the bigger rats from my bangs

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.469 
time I use the bigger rats from my bangs
because<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:23.310> thicker<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.330> holds<00:01:24.570> better

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
because it thicker and it holds better

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.580 
because it thicker and it holds better
and<00:01:27.800> that's<00:01:28.800> it<00:01:29.300> I<00:01:30.300> have<00:01:30.840> shown<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.229> other
