foggers and how German roaches survive

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.709 
foggers and how German roaches survive
traditionally<00:00:57.210> when<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.420> think<00:00:57.570> about

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
traditionally when we think about

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.830 
traditionally when we think about
flogging<00:00:58.500> filling<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> air<00:00:59.609> with

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
flogging filling the air with

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.270 
flogging filling the air with
insecticide<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.440> German<00:01:01.829> roaches

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
insecticide we think that German roaches

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920 
insecticide we think that German roaches
or<00:01:02.399> any<00:01:02.550> insect<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.239> matter<00:01:03.449> has<00:01:03.660> no

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
or any insect for that matter has no

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.080 
or any insect for that matter has no
room<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.409> escape<00:01:04.710> there<00:01:05.700> are<00:01:05.850> several

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
room to escape there are several

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
room to escape there are several
different<00:01:06.570> types<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.900> loggers<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> market

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
different types of loggers on the market

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.679 
different types of loggers on the market
and<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.070> use<00:01:08.250> them<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.820> many<00:01:09.030> places<00:01:09.270> our

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and we use them all in many places our

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.770 
and we use them all in many places our
addicts<00:01:10.229> our<00:01:10.560> rooms<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.670> crawl<00:01:11.939> spaces<00:01:12.330> even

addicts our rooms or crawl spaces even

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.679 
addicts our rooms or crawl spaces even
our<00:01:12.900> campers<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.470> our<00:01:13.619> cars<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.570> many

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
our campers in our cars but in so many

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.630 
our campers in our cars but in so many
cases<00:01:15.900> all<00:01:16.350> we're<00:01:16.530> left<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> mess<00:01:17.460> to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
cases all we're left with is a mess to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.600 
cases all we're left with is a mess to
clean<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.299> still<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.780> live<00:01:19.049> bugs<00:01:19.610> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
clean up and we still have live bugs the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
clean up and we still have live bugs the
other<00:01:20.729> problem<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.150> fog<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.509> you've<00:01:21.869> got<00:01:22.049> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
other problem with fog is you've got to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.050 
other problem with fog is you've got to
leave<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.380> about<00:01:22.650> four<00:01:23.040> hours<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.520> most<00:01:23.729> cases

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
leave for about four hours in most cases

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.649 
leave for about four hours in most cases
so<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.930> some<00:01:25.140> place<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.409> go<00:01:26.420> foggers<00:01:27.420> take<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
so have some place to go foggers take a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.910 
so have some place to go foggers take a
lot<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> work<00:01:28.140> you've<00:01:28.439> got<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.619> think<00:01:28.770> about

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
lot of work you've got to think about

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.240

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.399 
your birds your pets your food your fish
tanks<00:01:32.840> cleaning<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.790> it's<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.909> lot<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.119> work

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
tanks cleaning up and it's a lot of work

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.260 
tanks cleaning up and it's a lot of work
foggers<00:01:37.409> also<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.250> dangerous<00:01:38.640> too<00:01:38.909> many

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
foggers also can be dangerous too many

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630 
foggers also can be dangerous too many
in<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> small<00:01:39.780> room<00:01:40.079> or<00:01:40.439> open<00:01:40.799> flames<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.460> be<00:01:41.610> a

in a small room or open flames can be a
real<00:01:41.880> problem<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.229> better<00:01:43.380> than

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
real problem and we can do better than

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.470 
filling the air is just one more thing
that<00:02:41.890> they<00:02:42.069> pretty<00:02:42.340> much<00:02:42.459> figured<00:02:42.909> out<00:02:43.060> how<00:02:43.420> to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
that they pretty much figured out how to

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.800 
that they pretty much figured out how to
get<00:02:43.780> away<00:02:43.930> from<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.620> how<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:44.829> survive<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.970> if

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
get away from and how to survive so if

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.660 
get away from and how to survive so if
you're<00:02:46.959> going<00:02:47.079> to<00:02:47.140> use<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.349> fogger<00:02:47.920> do

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
you're going to use a fogger do

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.000 
you're going to use a fogger do
everything<00:02:49.120> correctly<00:02:49.349> clean<00:02:50.349> up<00:02:50.560> get

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
everything correctly clean up get

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.819 
everything correctly clean up get
everything<00:02:51.400> right<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.530> hope<00:02:53.530> for<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.769> best

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
everything right and hope for the best

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.399 
everything right and hope for the best
but<00:02:54.280> foggers<00:02:54.849> generally<00:02:55.840> just<00:02:56.019> aren't<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
but foggers generally just aren't the

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.050 
but foggers generally just aren't the
best<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.859> part<00:02:57.040> of<00:02:57.129> that<00:02:57.280> reason<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.879> this

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
best and part of that reason is this

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.830 
best and part of that reason is this
