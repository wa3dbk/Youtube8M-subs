 Mysterious old man: First of all, it works as a bank of a bank. Just as we are dealing with ordinary banks, in reality ordinary banks have an account at the central bank to make deposits and borrow money. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Otsuki: That's right. Ordinary banks also deposit with central banks in the same way as we do, and borrow them when they are not enough. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Yoko: The money that banks deal with will be large, so it's still convenient and safe. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Mysterious old man: One more thing. It is also important to go directly to various financial institutions, talk to them, and conduct surveys. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Mysterious old man: The situation of the deposit and the lending of each financial institution, the business condition, the movement of the financial market, etc. are always accurately grasped, it is not just a doctor to diagnose the health condition and take consultation. . 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Of course we do this in the country as well. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Otsuki: That's about it. The Central Bank is a medical doctor who works to protect the financial system! 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Mysterious old man: No, I'm not just doing a health check. In the case of emergency, the disease may be treated directly. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Yoko: uh? What kind of disease is it? 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 (Phone ringer) 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Mysterious old man: It is not impossible that the settlement of the bank will be difficult due to the breakdown of the computer. (Machine noise, ambulance siren) 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Then the impact is not limited to one bank, but it will attack all of the related banks. When this happens, the financial system is a mess. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 At that time, central banks are thus urgently supplying funds. And we keep the financial structure. It's because the central bank is called the "last lender". 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 In addition, in order to protect the credibility of the credit system, there is also a system such as the Deposit Insurance Organization which pays a certain amount of insurance to depositors when a financial institution goes bankrupt, and which funds when a financial institution breaks down. There is.
