00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.220
 of this company that is dedicated to perform 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.450
 because they are the great video games with 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.970
 magnificent graphics but if there are in 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.670
 Google Google was looking for ready-made 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.809
 many versions but they created my that 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.390
 this phone looks good you do not see the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.030
 graphs I stable several versions and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.300
 the graphics are not the only version 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.850
 that I found that worked for me in the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.800
 that I have currently installed 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.820
 I'm going to leave them in the same way 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.900
 here in the description of the video so that 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 if you want it 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.049
 download it 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.560
 they download it and they play it and everything 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.560
 well we did can play 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.720

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.890
 terminal that has this phone a 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.860
 very phone this game sorry can 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.040
 to play 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.650
 as indicated by this game there are some 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:51.520
 parts where it is not seen but runs 100% 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:55.289
 I guarantee them and you camp one 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.289
 it does not prove for you to see 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.440
 and canada 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.789
 for each one demonstration for them to see 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.039
 what 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.500
 run to the without 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.769
 the only fire it has is this that 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.799
 you do not look at the bottom you only see ones 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.959
 how many paragraphs of the good game of 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.840
 the same way is something so it does not matter 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.750
 in the game what's important and be in the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.860

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.860

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.780
 it depends on how you use it but 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.970
 Believe me, I really liked getting 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.160
 I liked this scholarship too, but with 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.840
 tremps and it works very well in our 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.780
 Huawei phone and 320 does not ask for almost anything 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.330

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.480

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.980
