00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello to everything in this video i'm going 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.779
 present you a watercolor enarque 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.760
 black a bit in the style of such a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.170
 I realized only on one form 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.170
 very clear gradient 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.080
 first of all I took the 15th rank and I 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.730
 I put two black watercolors so 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.460
 sorry I could not film on my nails 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.960
 because I did it but I have everything 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.730
 lost when putting his computer 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.490
 there was a bug so I had to start again 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.680
 on capture so then I take the 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.730
 firm brush and I'm going to draw the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.739
 contours of my form 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.350
 so down I made a big flower 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.320
 a small water and a circular arc 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.120
 then with the bread will save I have 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.949
 drawn so I'm going to do but degraded 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.989
 I put black and I'm going downgraded 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.390
 to degrade in fact like this for 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.879
 to form a strip pulls it down on 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.579
 wipes pulls down and so we 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.890
 wipe between each step it takes 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.199
 clean wiped his brush 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.899
 so here I do the same for the inside 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.269
 of the flower so of course before doing 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.610
 this pattern on my nails I did one of 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.670
 graded really very very discreet 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.160
 only with little clear rock 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.450
 with sequined varnish and beige varnish 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.940
 for the french manicure 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.619
 I really wanted only the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.179
 end of my angle be slightly 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.950
 colorful to give a little bit when 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.390
 even of relief at the app store but the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.390
 my uncle's top was pretty much 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.500
 transparent worship api 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.050
 then when I made my gradient I 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.179
 pick up the details brush I'm doing 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.500
 the stamens in the heart of the flower in 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.500
 your titles and hours 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.680
 like for the little one then I 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.390
 widened my arc and I'm going 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.390
 add a spiral inside 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.130
 then with black watercolor a 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.780
 little more diluted for all wrote 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 you - and to do hyper traits 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.970
 fun I'm going to make a grid of 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.650
 way to do like a heresy 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.910
 so I'm gridding a place 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.910
 who stays in the middle actually 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.200
 then I take the round brush and 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.510
 I'm going to draw two big drops 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.209
 so for wise crushes the brush I pull 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.190
 and I raise the past then I put it 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.870
 you I am and as long as it is not 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.790
 I'm going to habib and the watercolor 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:32.660
 in the middle what will make this effect a 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:34.520
 little bit like that found and I'm going 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.810
 do the same thing for the mounds that 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.340
 I did in the middle so here I did a 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.520
 book on house I made in white 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.239
 for discreet inspections withdrawal so I 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.700
 put a drop 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.190
 I followed my brush I clean myself I 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.780
 am and I like it free 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.310
 the painting that arrives is one of his 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.880
 passages in his business like 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.470
 I hope this tutorial will help you 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.670
 liked there you have the result on 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.350
 house so I could not show myself 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.239
 so I added small pears and 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.290
 rhinestones me I tell you to friday 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.290
