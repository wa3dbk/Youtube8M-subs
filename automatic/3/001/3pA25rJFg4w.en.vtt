00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
modern against the surface for that I

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.779 
modern against the surface for that I
own<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:16.410> here<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> two<00:00:16.830> guitars<00:00:17.279> as<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.670> can

maple<00:00:39.329> neck<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> fingerboard<00:00:40.410> is

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
maple neck so the fingerboard is

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.459

time<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:46.829> guitars<00:00:47.219> are<00:00:47.340> very<00:00:47.520> different

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
time these guitars are very different

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.450 
time these guitars are very different
the<00:00:48.210> profile<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.989> s4<00:00:49.350> has<00:00:49.620> much<00:00:50.010> more<00:00:50.219> so

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the profile on the s4 has much more so

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.290 
the profile on the s4 has much more so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
rounded a lot more wood to it the modern

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.760 
rounded a lot more wood to it the modern
is<00:00:54.570> much<00:00:54.840> slimmer<00:00:55.820> as<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.059> see<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.870> then

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
is much slimmer as you can see and then

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.010 
is much slimmer as you can see and then
the<00:00:59.100> heel<00:00:59.340> joint<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.910> very<00:01:00.090> different<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.840> the
