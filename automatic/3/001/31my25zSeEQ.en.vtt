so<00:00:06.450> you'd<00:00:06.569> like<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.720> learn<00:00:06.930> how<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.140> hit<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.379> draw

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
so you'd like to learn how to hit a draw

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.919 
so you'd like to learn how to hit a draw
shot<00:00:08.000> but<00:00:09.000> first<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.450> all<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.719> need<00:00:09.870> to

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
shot but first of all you need to

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.039 
shot but first of all you need to
understand<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.469> few<00:00:10.500> basic<00:00:10.710> rules<00:00:12.049> very

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
understand a few basic rules very

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.140 
understand a few basic rules very
importantly<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.190> clubface<00:00:14.820> which

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
importantly it's the clubface which

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.910 
importantly it's the clubface which
controls<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.839> starting<00:00:16.260> direction<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
controls the starting direction of the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.730 
controls the starting direction of the
shot<00:00:17.539> so<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> draw<00:00:19.020> you'd<00:00:19.260> want<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> ball

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
shot so for a draw you'd want the ball

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.260 
shot so for a draw you'd want the ball
to<00:00:19.770> start<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.160> little<00:00:20.279> bit<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.699> little<00:00:21.000> bit<00:00:21.119> to
