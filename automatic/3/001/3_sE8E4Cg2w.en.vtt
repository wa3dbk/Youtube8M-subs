 a huge selection of products available 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.030
 prices with delivery throughout Russia 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.960
 I am 2 and 4 online dot ru link is in 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.880
 description hello everyone with you maxim 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.400
 this channel is a good choice of our hero 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.800
 today's release is a firm monitor and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.869
 axes at least so it should 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.119
 it seems to be pronounced i always i called 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.060
 just alac not sure what it is 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.560
 right but nevertheless modelka g 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.719
 2460 pidgin is one of the most 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.380
 technologically 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.890
 complete monitors on 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.219
 today 24 inch full hd 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.200
 permits tn matrix but in fact 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.710
 she's not so bad but more about that 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.230
 later 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.440
 one millisecond here click frequency 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.370
 144 hertz sweep technology support 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.170
 nvidia g-sync 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.539
 and shutter 3d that is so that it 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.460
 worked you need active glasses 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.770
 the only thing in this monitor is not 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.920
 so this court column even yusb hub 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.409
 4 ports were built two of them are yusbi 30 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.030
 the remaining two usb double one of 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.220
 which still supports technology 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.299
 accelerated charging monitor stand on 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.180
 all occasions 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.460
 height adjustable tilt monitor possible 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.470
 expand to portrait position plus 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.420
 10 turntable so monitor 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.580
 rotates around its axis and without 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.380
 any problems but if you and this 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.840
 little monitor can be set to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.549
 bracket or on monitor 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.159
 a separate holder is common here 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.110
 standard weight 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.030
 Well, it seems like the moment came when I 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.549
 usually scold tn matrices 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.500
 but not this time and not because I'm tired 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.840
 do it though therefore too 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.240
 but not only here is very, very 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.040
 good tn matrix although I still 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.240
 play up the dimensions of the monitor themselves 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.159
 still 24 inches is not 27 by 27 it would be 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.649
 probably more noticeable distortion all 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.439
 it is but at 24 up with this matrix 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.180
 I liked the viewing angles now I 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.130
 I will try to demonstrate this no 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.770
 I understand perfectly that this is tn matrix 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.149
 but she has flaws 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.570
 horizontal viewing angles well, just 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.520
 just gorgeous with a little vertical 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.860
 worse and to become vertical 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.660
 horizontal if we turn the monitor 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.530
 in portrait mode still tolerable 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.080
 result 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.940
 better than probably 95 percent tn 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.490
 matrix is ​​the only thing that gives out here 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.490
 awning components this pink bloom if 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.560
 we will deflect vertically and then 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.510
 which is inherent again to all of us this 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.090
 difference in brightness at the top and bottom 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.950
 the monitor is the text at the bottom of the page 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.930
 will be lighter than the top well or 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.360
 on the contrary, but I must say that in this 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.730
 case it is very very very weak 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.610
 noticeable perhaps this is the first tn matrix 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.900
 which I myself would agree daily 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.760
 enjoy without experiencing 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.739
 some hellish torment I even 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.239
 mounted one issue using this 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.130
 monitor and naturally did there 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.780
 slight color correction and no 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.220
 I did not feel any discomfort though 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.810
 it seemed that the monitor a little bit 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.430
 overestimated contrast but this is again 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.720
 still quite a bit it is noticeable 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.940
 if you constantly do some 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.310
 product video or photo design on 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.500
 something so very accurate for household 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.300
 needs that is just to mount 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.580
 some movie is not at all 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.530
 will affect the eye will not rush into 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.880
 games the result is excellent excellent 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.700
 Contrast Excellent color reproduction 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.250
 color juicy enough without 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.350
 perry kontra ranks plus good tn 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.900
 the matrix is therefore plus for dimensions 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.060
 24 inches in sight the picture does not 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.130
 distorted this is very important this is the first 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.430
 Teng monitor which I say it 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.590
 you can sit as you like 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.140
 there slightly change the position will fall apart 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.299
 on a chair or vice versa get together or else 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.130
 something and all this will not be 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.500
 affect usually when I tested 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.290
 Monica's secrets faced with what it costs 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.230
 per millimeter will move and the whole picture in 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.120
 porridge all black and white and generally horror 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.400
 going on no monitor then this is not 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.769
 happens yes this is the first so-called but nick in 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.930
 channel history which I do not scold for his 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.000
 the matrix is now a couple of words about the menu and 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.790
 settings and then move on to the minuses and 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.650
 so the menu is pretty simple to climb and 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.470
 there often will not be likely 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.140
 button layout is convenient and signed 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.269
 You do not need to climb under the monitor in general and 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.010
 hope for intuition everything is visible everything 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.959
 pretty convenient place that the settings are not 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.850
 so much at our disposal in essence 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.549
 3 preset gamma modes 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.260
 brightness slider and know the contrast 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.000
 Well, the choice of shade warm cold 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.890
 custom well and the rest in 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.440
 In general, everything can change the language 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.410
 but 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.830
 And so I understood through two noticeable functions. 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.050
 settings and nvidia ultra low power blue 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.940
 setting is designed to 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.490
 to reduce 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.090
 Blur effect on the monitor during 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.270
 active prices 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.970
 odd this but it has a very strong effect 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.700
 on the brightness of that is, it eats up from 70 here 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.620
 there 90 percent brightness can be in 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.630
 overall quite controversial technology but it 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.540
 there is and there is a possibility of any overclocking 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.390
 matrix so-called overdrive but when 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.740
 one millisecond response and I don't know 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.410
 why does this function need to be visually 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.240
 no differences I saw maybe this 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.490
 function just need to hold 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.710
 avid overclockers and also in the menu 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.480
 will get the opportunity to turn on 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.790
 sight why cheating i think 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.860
 not necessary to explain to someone can be a cake 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.140
 shoot without aiming and so on 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.730
 crazy things to create why semi 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.470
 because the size of the sight is not 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.380
 configured that is, there are some 6 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.360
 pre-installed options but they are all 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.640
 equally huge but probably it 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.830
 better than nothing at all 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.600
 sides and the benefits of them are a little not 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.120
 more review blocking than 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.550
 really some kind of straight some 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.530
 advantage gives well in general such 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.320
 opportunity is well, that now the cons 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.760
 I still hope about juicing of rising 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.010
 somehow do a separate release 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.500
 so let's leave it for now 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.720
 but like all monitors with juicing, and we 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.030
 this monitor suffers only 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.460
 just one connector and this displayport 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.230
 that is, do not divine expel what 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.000
 single displayport 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.550
 duck to honor the manufacturer need to say 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 what displayport cable comes with 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.710
 no perversions for you 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.630
 To a large account, it's okay, but 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.820
 here if your video card is not 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.830
 displayport or full-size 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.200
 displayport and so have to tinker with 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.000
 problem adapters of course small 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.100
 but here in our city find something 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.520
 associated with the display pore there any 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.220
 adapters on mini displayport or on 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.930
 hdmi is extremely difficult and easier to order 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.950
 from another city ​​or from there 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.720
 for generally just have this 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.510
 moment in mind well and in my opinion 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.150
 3d support, that is, yes, I understand that 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.400
 someone exactly this function they need for 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.890
 someone exactly she and interesting but I was 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.040
 would only be happy if this monitor were 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.990
 without 3d support and it would be cheaper so 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.590
 for a couple of thousand by the way his 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:51.180
 price from 15 to 18 thousand rubles these 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.250
 The last two points are unique to 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.800
 still can not be attributed to this 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.080
 the price we get is extremely staffed 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.180
 all possible technologies device 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.220
 well, monetary technology and yes 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.050
 forgot to say that here is a matte finish 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.000
 again in my opinion it is huge 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.940
 plus for the monitor although there is also 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.910
 huge army of fans of gloss lovers 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.710
 okay i liked the monitor with nothing 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.270
 I can't do anything about it 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.520
 color rendering excellent viewing angles 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.050
 despite the fact that the tn matrix with me 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.760
 this has not happened yet that biotin and 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.410
 praised well and also can not 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.990
 do with what i need it 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.060
 return and soon he gets on review and 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.730
 anybody else okay on this let's 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.250
 finish i'm gonna go mog up think 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.860
 about the meaning of life and about the so-called monitors 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:37.110
 these days you subscribe to the channel 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.420
 tell your friends about him if you are here 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.750
 like to look in the description there links 

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:45.030
