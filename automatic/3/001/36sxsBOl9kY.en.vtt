00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.950 
products in the new linear format that
we've<00:00:27.370> developed<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:28.330> 20<00:00:28.690> that<00:00:28.870> we're

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
we've developed the 20 that we're

we've developed the 20 that we're
looking<00:00:29.170> at<00:00:29.290> here<00:00:29.470> there's<00:00:29.770> also<00:00:29.980> an<00:00:30.400> x4<00:00:30.850> bar

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
looking at here there's also an x4 bar

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.960 
looking at here there's also an x4 bar
10<00:00:31.480> which<00:00:31.750> is<00:00:31.900> smaller<00:00:32.259> uses<00:00:32.950> 10<00:00:33.220> pixels<00:00:33.730> over

products<00:00:41.860> remain<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.400> same<00:00:43.030> though<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.320> we've

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
products remain the same though so we've

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.660 
products remain the same though so we've

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
one color to the next we back that up

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.149

with a color temperature control channel

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.649 
with a color temperature control channel
which<00:01:15.580> we<00:01:15.729> do<00:01:15.850> with<00:01:16.030> all<00:01:16.180> of<00:01:16.330> our<00:01:16.390> fixtures

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
which we do with all of our fixtures

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.350 
which we do with all of our fixtures
which<00:01:17.200> allows<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:18.010> hone<00:01:18.580> in<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.150> color

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
which allows you to hone in on the color

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.570 
which allows you to hone in on the color
temperature<00:01:19.600> either<00:01:20.200> from<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.680> white<00:01:20.950> base<00:01:21.310> or

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
temperature either from a white base or

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.850 
temperature either from a white base or
from<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:21.970> colored<00:01:22.299> base<00:01:22.510> as<00:01:22.720> well<00:01:22.870> and<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.680> can

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
from a colored base as well and this can

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.950 
from a colored base as well and this can
be<00:01:23.979> added<00:01:24.370> onto<00:01:24.549> a<00:01:24.729> color<00:01:25.000> or<00:01:25.240> just<00:01:25.750> use

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
be added onto a color or just use

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.969 
be added onto a color or just use
independently<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:28.750> control<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.440> beam<00:01:29.710> we

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
independently for control of the beam we

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.730 
independently for control of the beam we
have<00:01:30.010> a<00:01:30.220> 7<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:31.000> 50<00:01:31.390> degrees<00:01:31.780> zoom<00:01:32.020> range<00:01:32.350> which

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
have a 7 to 50 degrees zoom range which

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.500 
have a 7 to 50 degrees zoom range which
is<00:01:32.920> obviously<00:01:33.310> phenomenal<00:01:33.880> now<00:01:34.060> let's<00:01:34.299> go<00:01:34.450> to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
is obviously phenomenal now let's go to

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.750 
is obviously phenomenal now let's go to
go<00:01:34.720> from<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:34.960> very<00:01:34.990> very<00:01:35.530> tight<00:01:35.830> light<00:01:36.280> curtain

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
go from a very very tight light curtain

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.469 
go from a very very tight light curtain
effect<00:01:37.090> out<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.869> a<00:01:37.900> full<00:01:38.229> Cyclorama<00:01:39.159> wash<00:01:39.520> so

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
effect out to a full Cyclorama wash so

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.330 
effect out to a full Cyclorama wash so
that's<00:01:40.690> very<00:01:40.930> versatile<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.799> something

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
that's very versatile and something

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.700 
that's very versatile and something
that's<00:01:42.490> that's<00:01:42.990> very<00:01:43.990> special<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.470> this

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
that's that's very special to this

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.130 
that's that's very special to this
fixture<00:01:45.010> when<00:01:45.850> we<00:01:45.970> have<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:46.299> many<00:01:46.420> pixels<00:01:46.930> all

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
fixture when we have so many pixels all

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.780 
fixture when we have so many pixels all
next<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.530> each<00:01:47.619> other<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:48.100> means<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.549> we<00:01:48.640> get

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
next to each other it means that we get

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.700 
next to each other it means that we get
beautiful<00:01:49.450> washing<00:01:49.869> across<00:01:50.350> a<00:01:50.380> surface

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
beautiful washing across a surface

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.950 
beautiful washing across a surface
across<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.310> Cyclorama<00:01:51.610> for<00:01:52.030> example<00:01:52.420> when<00:01:52.840> we

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
across the Cyclorama for example when we

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.350 
across the Cyclorama for example when we
go<00:01:52.990> out<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.380> those<00:01:53.500> wider<00:01:53.830> zoom<00:01:54.159> ranges<00:01:54.580> and

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
go out to those wider zoom ranges and

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.810 
go out to those wider zoom ranges and
when<00:01:55.720> we<00:01:55.810> get<00:01:55.990> narrow<00:01:56.260> we<00:01:56.740> get<00:01:57.040> an<00:01:57.189> absolute

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
when we get narrow we get an absolute

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.649 
when we get narrow we get an absolute
curtain<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.420> light<00:01:58.570> not<00:01:59.259> sporadic<00:01:59.860> spots<00:02:00.659> for

curtain of light not sporadic spots for

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.660 
curtain of light not sporadic spots for
control<00:02:02.049> of<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.350> fixture<00:02:02.710> we<00:02:02.860> have<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.340> tilt

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
control of the fixture we have a tilt

alignment pins which slide out from the
base<00:03:56.050> of<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.410> fixture<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.010> connect<00:03:57.790> into<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
base of the fixture and connect into the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.360

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
next unit and allow that to happen so

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.950 
next unit and allow that to happen so
that<00:04:00.640> you're<00:04:00.760> sure<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.210> any<00:04:01.420> effects<00:04:01.780> that

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
that you're sure that any effects that

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.210 
that you're sure that any effects that
your<00:04:02.050> programming<00:04:02.620> will<00:04:02.740> look<00:04:02.860> absolutely

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
your programming will look absolutely

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.510 
your programming will look absolutely
fantastic<00:04:04.380> when<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.470> do<00:04:05.680> align<00:04:06.010> fixtures

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
fantastic when you do align fixtures

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.220 
fantastic when you do align fixtures
together<00:04:06.760> like<00:04:07.180> that<00:04:07.420> they've<00:04:07.780> been<00:04:08.050> designed

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
together like that they've been designed

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.500 
together like that they've been designed
so<00:04:08.650> there's<00:04:08.860> absolute<00:04:09.400> consistent<00:04:10.060> pixel

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
so there's absolute consistent pixel

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.960 
so there's absolute consistent pixel

spacing from one fixture to the next and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.360 
spacing from one fixture to the next and
you<00:04:13.150> won't<00:04:13.390> see<00:04:13.600> any<00:04:13.750> gaps<00:04:14.050> in<00:04:14.290> between<00:04:14.370> that's

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
you won't see any gaps in between that's

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.729
