 can be base for infinite others 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.080
 sauces and I particularly I think 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.830
 with the strong support of the very large hat 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.080
 It's the same thing I think it's not just 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.869

 corn starch that some scene the sauce 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.840
 bechamel he is more full-bodied people 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.230
 has other flavors that give the differential 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.420

 after about 15 minutes here 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.680
 It is a way I do now that I come 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.210
 I'll take the onions like a blonde from the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.330
 center 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.060
 now that I'm going to introduce our new 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:44.300
 scale 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:48.920
 I have two pinches of 140 grams of 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:52.190
 goal and also reached us it can be 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.620
 addition of herbs also causes more 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.230
 common is true so that arises 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.400

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.320
 thyme 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.990
 The technique of the hat's nose is the 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.320
 next I have an eye on the milk case 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.780
 it was hot confusion that the cube that 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.530
 It was the little blocks Sabino, daughter of the house. 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.480
 cold can do the reverse also if 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.820
 you want or at the time you in the case as 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.930
 a butter with its own flour 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.770
 hot will sit the cold milk is always 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.390

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.990
 stirring it while you're cooking it 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.050
 he sings you some particles in the background 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.560
 they burn with taste not much 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.770
 Cool, cool. 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.120
 every once in a while you come and do not 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.170
 touched fire so high it's going to burn 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.870
 background is also very easy to do a little 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.730
