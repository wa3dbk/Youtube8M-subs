00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.180
 yes 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.890
 meaning because you lose it 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.890
 you lose this river 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.750
 of the 500 sense because because if I 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.160
 you lose, you lose 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.930
 they do not teach me the wood 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.549
 teaches you far 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.549
 it sounds like noise 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.010
 do not 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.110
 downward 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.940
 Major leagues are found 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.270
 when you showed your laundry the 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.770
 'chicharito' became smaller and water 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.770
 and everything is windows 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.770
 grammar 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.160
 recommendation can you give the 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.830
 kids who pretend to have a stomach 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.640
 as like mine and like yours that 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.640
 surgery 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.040
 throws abs are made in the kitchen 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.040
 not so much in the gym has abused 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.970
 in the kitchen listen to that recommendation 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.520
 with the abdominals are done in the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.350
 kitchen not in the gym what to 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.200
 referred to the washboard stomach 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.400
 skillet 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.020
 with the feed is correct and is 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.450
 correct food is the most 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.270
 important to for good to have a 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.460
 Defined abdomen without wanting to tell you 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.180
 do not consume it because we have to 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.920
 consume but for those who pretend 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.620
 have a physicist like that of the engineer 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.870
 mayagotia few tortillas a day 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.640
 dispatched you do not depend much on the 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.320
 physical construction of everyone sees there 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.720
 that frank physical constitution the 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.430
 generation also males if there are three 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.980
 types of tumor bodies was no more 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.340
 film is love because here is a bolus 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.340
 morbid 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.830
 and there is a room everyone 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.300
 depends on the type of genetics you have 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.980
 is the amount of calories you have to 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.690
 consume daily and this includes the 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.150
 tortillas the flour this the 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.340
 carbohydrates proteins all there 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.420
 people who say I go to the gym 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.190
 I lower myself to the things that get fat and I 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.710
 I take care of a week and nothing more the end of 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.870
 I was given a soda or three 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.400
 anna omelettes and so I put plan 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.350
 that's the money they're throwing lies 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.150
 usually people say yes I do look after myself 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.190
 from Monday to Friday but you owe it to 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.200
 suddenly they grab the leg there is a no 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.120
 nothing happens and lohan while a diet there is a 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.130
 nothing happens and after a while they give and there is a 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.660
 nothing royal happens and if and if you put everything together 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.700
 that ate the day that nothing happened 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.200
 I feel like a junk food very 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.880
 complete I think good that 's in 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.880
 about junk food but there's 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.060
 food that is not scrap that is part 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.670
 of the acceptable food supplement 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.250
 I do not know what to call him 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.890
 or correct in our regime 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.900
 food but we consume it in the 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.000
 exaggeration that is very important is 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.230
 part of the whole life all that 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.850
 be in excess always going to be bad 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.710
 then and with more rice carbohydrates 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.940
 that are essential in your day-to-day life if 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.370
 does it too much because it's going to be 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.470
 reflected in fat accumulations how 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.090
 know what is the correct amount for 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.560
 you have to approach a person 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.630
 a professional in someone who knows that 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.950
 look how many calories are you 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.420
 consuming at this time so that 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.580
 have the physique you have right now with 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.040
 the physical activity that you do then 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.570
 with that then you can put together a diet and 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.730
 more suited to you than what you need 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.470
 Well, if you want to increase the volume 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.970
 If you want to define yourself or anything else you want 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.970
 lower the fat and you want to be thin 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.950
 or if you want to know that I'm very interested 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.900
 the issue because there are many young people who 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:15.240
 they pretend to be like me and I say it in the 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.240
 gym like me there well well tucked 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.180
 everyone wants to leave the dishes that 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.680
 we want to get fat is the same thing 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.780
 do it every day I have a few years 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.330
 training and I weighed 30 kilos less 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.550
 measuring what I weighed 58 kilos 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.320
 measuring 190 my wrist was my arm and 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.729
 so over the years you have to 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.169
 be constant the thing is that people 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.550
 wants to see a change from one day to the next 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.320
 from one week to another one month to 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.180
 other then well it is not so every day 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.919
 you eat all the weekends you go and you 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.970
 bust and you want to have a change in the 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.970
 gym for a week 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.560
 the blowout 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:07.770
 how much do you weigh I weigh my range 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:11.599
 of weight between 88 and 92 kilos but you 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:14.400
 is 190 or is in the perfect range 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:17.580
 I am an acceptable one is in the accept if 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.220
 pretend to be less heavy or heavier 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.870
 not right now how am I 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.699
 I keep edhasa several years I like 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.349
 be like this I feel slim I'm here 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:28.169
 I feel strong, I feel good 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:32.120
 very well then it was what was the best 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:32.120
 can rescue from the chicharito 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.169
 na 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:39.169
 all right
