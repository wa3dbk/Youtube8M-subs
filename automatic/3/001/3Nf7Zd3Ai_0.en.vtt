okay and it is actually part of the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
okay and it is actually part of the
metal<00:00:54.899> chassis<00:00:55.289> here<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.520> where<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
metal chassis here this is where it

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.020 
metal chassis here this is where it
connects<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:59.780> now<00:01:00.780> an<00:01:01.050> easy<00:01:01.410> way<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.910> these

connects in now an easy way to get these

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.620 
connects in now an easy way to get these
off<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.530> little<00:01:04.860> neat<00:01:05.010> trick<00:01:05.280> here

okay see that yeah there's a nice little
nifty<00:01:12.000> uh<00:01:12.180> swivel<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.740> there's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.010> screw

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
nifty uh swivel there so there's a screw

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.609 
nifty uh swivel there so there's a screw
here<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> other<00:01:16.470> side

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
here and here and it's on the other side

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.320 
here and here and it's on the other side
as<00:01:16.920> well<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.970> allows<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:19.110> swivel

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
as well and that allows this to swivel

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.210 
as well and that allows this to swivel
okay<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.740> certain<00:01:22.920> point

okay now when you get to a certain point
on<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.430> swivel<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:24.259> right<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:26.430> can

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
on the swivel here right there you can

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.200 
on the swivel here right there you can
just<00:01:26.850> pull<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.299> off<00:01:27.479> there<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.939> press

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
just pull it off there and we can press

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.480 
just pull it off there and we can press
it<00:01:30.360> out<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:32.220> there<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:32.990> now<00:01:34.490> something

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
right they do have bearings so we now

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.300 
right they do have bearings so we now
have<00:01:56.520> bearings<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.659> drive<00:01:58.140> wheels<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
have bearings on the drive wheels the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.359 
have bearings on the drive wheels the
road<00:01:59.640> wheels<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.180> idler<00:02:00.689> wheels<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:02.130> here's

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
road wheels and idler wheels so here's

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.649 
road wheels and idler wheels so here's
the<00:02:02.460> road<00:02:02.640> wheels<00:02:02.850> give<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.540> little

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the road wheels give you a little

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.530 
the road wheels give you a little
bearing<00:02:03.990> test<00:02:04.200> here

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.780 

so<00:02:12.540> quite<00:02:13.080> nice<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> bearings<00:02:14.660> definitely

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
so quite nice on the bearings definitely

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.480 
so quite nice on the bearings definitely
new<00:02:17.790> addition<00:02:18.270> we<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:19.070> let's<00:02:20.070> take<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.310> little

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
new addition we like let's take a little

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.620 
new addition we like let's take a little
closer<00:02:20.820> look<00:02:20.970> at<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> gearboxes<00:02:21.990> here<00:02:23.630> you

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
closer look at the gearboxes here you

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.660 
closer look at the gearboxes here you
notice<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.200> one<00:02:25.410> big<00:02:25.740> solid<00:02:26.220> gear<00:02:26.430> on

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
notice this is one big solid gear on

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.050 
notice this is one big solid gear on
here

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
here

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.970 
here
it<00:02:27.750> looks<00:02:28.020> like<00:02:28.170> two<00:02:28.380> gears<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:28.860> it's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
it looks like two gears but it's

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.820 
it looks like two gears but it's
actually<00:02:29.340> one<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.960> then<00:02:30.960> we<00:02:31.140> have<00:02:31.290> one<00:02:31.530> big

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
actually one and then we have one big

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.520 
actually one and then we have one big
metal<00:02:32.430> gear<00:02:32.640> here<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.030> then<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.020> first<00:02:34.290> gear

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
metal gear here and then the first gear

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.600 
metal gear here and then the first gear
here<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> these<00:02:37.260> are<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.710> three<00:02:38.340> two<00:02:38.400> one

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
here so these are the three two one

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.250 
here so these are the three two one
productions<00:02:39.240> right<00:02:39.420> here<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.840> then<00:02:40.050> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
productions right here and then the
