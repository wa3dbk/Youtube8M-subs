00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.530
 and already the morning goes by hope 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.780
 for celina cano we arrived to deliver 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.700
 with her we promised them it's a little while 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.699
 tickets for the zoo we're going to 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.460
 raffle via the twitter band 3.0 track 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.170
 facebook band 3.0 they put someone who 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.400
 wants to go to the zoo and then the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.320
 list is now is not going to communicate with 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.640
 you in another producer and it's going to 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.320
 communicate with you for this draw 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.260
 of the tickets to go to the zoo 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.880
 but silvina muÃ±iz our veterinary 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.550
 that we always go tips was the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.989
 zoo made a note showed us by 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.790
 where do you have to go with the tickets that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.820
 then let's give us pass and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.820
 see 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.500
 3.0 band today came to the zoo 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.560
 buenos aires- a very alternative 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.270
 interesting very well known by all for 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.300
 keep in mind on this vacation from 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.300
 winter 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.510
 we are now in the aviary that has been 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.640
 recently reconstituted what is the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.030
 function that the aviary really has 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.310
 what do you want to transmit 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.380
 this is a space for reflection although 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.229
 it does not look like it but nature can 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.970
 serve as a space where we can 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.229
 think that what is happening to us as 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.080
 we relate to the natural world 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.400
 with other living beings then the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.630
 idea of this aviary unlike 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.149
 almost all that I know in the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.009
 world, the emphasis is not on 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.229
 you can recognize what species of 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.759
 birds there are of course to me I'm interested 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.680
 that we know how they are called at least 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.899
 but the emphasis is on what 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.119
 It happens to these birds that is what 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.070
 you are seeing are survivors 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.679
 of the illegal traffic of species a 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.590
 thematic the federal the king of the forest the 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.390
 queen dwells white herons macaws 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.300
 blue and yellow red macaws 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.640
 then the idea is to show them teach 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.520
 with them and share with people who 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.200
 visits us 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.380
 this knowledge that they are animals 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.170
 who have come 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.509
 kidnapped from illegal trade because 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.489
 there is that there is something key that is is a 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.110
 problem that has a solution and with 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.170
 you with the means that allow us 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.209
 expand this idea a little bit because 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.500
 you see that not everyone can 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.000
 get to the zoo there are people who 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.970
 he looks at us from other provinces 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.470
 then well we can even encourage 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.900
 to our colleagues other zoos to 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.430
 who also take advantage of their collection of 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.319
 animals like us with a 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.120
 educational intentionality with a 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.160
 clear goal of conservation ie 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.140
 the zoo does not have to be a place 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.360
 where animals are merely exhibited 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.299
 this is not a theme park this is not 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.620
 a living museum no no no this is a center 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.590
 of conservation an education center 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.599
 environmental where we have to help that 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.090
 the people who visit us go with a 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.130
 message modify some attitude in 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.540
 favor of conservation that is us 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.459
 our bet is to save what 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.120
 is outside we use for that the animals 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.120
 that we have inside 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.140
 for you a cat and a lion have appeared 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.750
 not because the lions are very big and 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.590
 the data is very small and you 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.050
 they like lions 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.830
 very well and how are the claws of the 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.530
 sharp lions so that they serve them for 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.760
 tear the flesh and look like a 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.659
 big cat 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.150
 these animals know where they live in the 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:43.260
 savannah where it looks like a lion and a 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.260
 cat want galas have mustaches are 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.750
 felines here we see how there are few 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.260
 differences between felines there is no 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.150
 big differences between a cat and a 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.409
 wild feline we are just facing 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.409
 to the white lionesses 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.640
 What bird species are that if 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.520
 you can have as canary domestic 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:14.390
 Calabrian mandarins diamonds 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.030
 dogs cats hamsters guinea pigs is 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.250
 aquarium fish which almost all 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.530
 are born they reproduce in captivity with 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.980
 australian turrets with ribs 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.420
 since there is an extensive menu a very 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.730
 interesting to choose pets 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.000
 appropriately and not resort to 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.200
 turtles to the yellow cardinal 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.480
 species that are justly threatened 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.710
 by people shopping but also 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.630
 we can see it 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.460
 take another look at the zoo from 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.530
 another place this is a monument 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.340
 national historical unlike other 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.630
 zoos of the world what many many 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.180
 people do not like what they say is a 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.570
 Victorian zoo not from a point 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.180
 of sight is a fortress this alone is 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.030
 say the Victorian concept is not 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.280
 that having animals in back bars does not 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.960
 it's something that we like or appropriate and 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.250
 besides that almost are we are 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.540
 ending with this concept 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.820
 this daily is a demonstration of 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.340
 but on the other hand one can come 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.520
 to recognize buildings over 120 years old 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.040
 that were designed to link the 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.140
 animals of origin with architecture 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.740
 of those from those countries of origin but the 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.480
 Asian elephants in a temple that 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.150
 flame denim well 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.150
 replica one of bombay to another scale and I 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.710
 It seems that this is an educational value 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.820
 where we link the natural with the 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.820
 cultural in an unprecedented way 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.409
 where elephants sleep or not 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.150
 in the temple of 2 Hindustani is the 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:03.080
 Their room is a very house 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:06.860
 large was built in thousand 898 and it 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:10.310
 finished in 1904 the building 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.400
 architecturally it is a Hindu temple and 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.979
 It is divided into three pieces on the side 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.719
 left looking towards there we have the 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.710
 African and side pieces 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:22.600
 right is that of sciatica Carlos 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.060
 as to be a keeper of these animals 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.760
 rather intensive care not 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.850
 It is only exposure of the animal is 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.770
 What we do is file the nails and 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.140
 see that they are good to see that the food 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.000
 come well because obviously they are 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.280
 our guests from here of the zoo 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.410
 who feed the elephants or 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.900
 not the African elephants that are 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:47.350
 at this time out most of his 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.240
 diet is dry if this is dry grass you 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.670
 we give awards for carrots and apples 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.010
 obviously those are much smaller 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.080
 then they are eating a little less 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.700
 As the 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.190
 Africa will be much larger 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.830
 that the Asians you know for what 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.380
 serves the trunk of the elephant general to 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.400
 eat and because he has such a trumpet 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.120
 long 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.770
 I dont know 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.260
 with you know because he has a long trunk 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:15.320
 the elephant is what is the animal that most 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.850
 you like the zoo the elephant what is 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.850
 what you like most about the elephant 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.849
 I do not know about the horn and you know why 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:26.110
 serves the trunk to eat 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:28.539
 well the elephant is a long trunk 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.940
 to get twigs out of the trees 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:34.139
 that are high and you know so that 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.139
 you know how with the elephant 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.220
 is missing in my life the first time and today 

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:42.009
 that you saw it for the first time that you feel 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.120
 how about 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:47.080
 cute 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.080
 and giants
