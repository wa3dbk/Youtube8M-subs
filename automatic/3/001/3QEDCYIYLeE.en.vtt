I<00:03:37.470> mean<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.490> game<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.910> just<00:03:39.000> stupid<00:03:39.420> period

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
I mean this game is just stupid period

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.690 
I mean this game is just stupid period
so<00:03:40.470> tell<00:03:40.650> them<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.920> add<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.070> game<00:03:41.370> slightly

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
so tell them to add that game slightly

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.890 
so tell them to add that game slightly
so<00:03:41.790> we<00:03:41.910> have<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.150> option<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.540> turn<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.810> off

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
so we have that option to turn it off

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.570 
so we have that option to turn it off
what<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.590> mean<00:03:43.770> because<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.220> think<00:03:44.280> it's

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
what I mean because I think it's

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.160 
what I mean because I think it's

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
necessary I think it's only fair because

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.510 
necessary I think it's only fair because
it's<00:03:46.500> not<00:03:46.620> like<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.920> game<00:03:47.070> is<00:03:47.100> getting<00:03:47.280> any
