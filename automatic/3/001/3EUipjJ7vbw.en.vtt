00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.130
 hello how are you and welcome again 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.440
 this channel and more one piece theories 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.090
 this time, the first theory 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.910
 well 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.210
 in the navy knows what happened between pink 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.690
 and still do flamingo I trust that for 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.700
 be a 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.350
 descendant of the Navy 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.460
 it would help in everything but the situation 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.430
 it could be very different since during 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.739
 recent events the admiral project 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.640
 Now he is very calm in the face of the situation 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.550
 of the revolution 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.310
 so maybe the navy was already planning 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.190
 get rid of the flaming or reveal 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.010
 to the public what he did to the king of three 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.909
 pink so the safest thing is that 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.380
 look for the slightest opportunity to 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.380
 will eliminate the flamingos 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.780
 second theory is 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.080
 the admiral the ex admiral of aoki and 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.810
 Well who was looking 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.180
 and after two years many things 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.940
 happened after he left the navy 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.580
 the navy started rumors where 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.670
 indicate that the former admiral is 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.650
 in the underworld 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.650
 information that the vice admiral is 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.110
 woman gives ao kylie what she 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.670
 he replies that he is still the same 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.670
 but in the movie 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.280
 juampi z reveals a bit of what is 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.370
 doing and says he is following 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.430
 true man but what kind of man 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.880
 or person would deserve to be investigated with 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.920
 So much money besides that he communicates to 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.290
 that woman that the navy is not what 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.150
 seems to do since they are 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.420
 doing some kind of activity 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.100
 illicit below the table and 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.100
 surely he is trying to confirm 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.830
 if it's true and as to who is 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.070
 looking could be some high command of the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.920
 revolutionary army to confirm 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.110
 if what you heard from the navy is true 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.060
 after all other than other 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.850
 organization could give you the answer 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.220
 that he seeks after all for 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.330
 for some reason the revolutionaries 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.330
 they fight against the morning 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:02.579
 the third theory is good in the end 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:04.980
 of the battle royale of the battle royal in the 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.739
 position of the rose because it was unexpected 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.020
 since with flamengo he underestimated all 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.420
 the competitors 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.970
 they entered the joust and I'm sure 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.580
 sure I did not expect the second 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.550
 commanding the revolutionary army 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.430
 would snatch the mere mere payroll 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.160
 I had already commented but the presence 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.100
 of the cip and 0 a admiral of the navy 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.520
 maybe from the beginning your goal 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.650
 real was not to help Sunday but 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.290
 catch the revolutionaries as 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.960
 surely luisa bus at home on Saturday 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.110
 forgiveness will be responsible for defeating the 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.300
 flamingos and we can not rule out the idea 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:51.160
 of which dragon is already in three 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:54.400
 pink good that would be all for this 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.770
 week thank you for watching the video and good 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.480
 I wanted to tell you something that I heard is 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.209
 a rumor 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.580
 with one of my contacts the 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:08.370
 playstation, he told me what 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.550
 the one piece manga was going to 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.240
 bring mexico and what if it's going to be 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:19.260
 throughout the republic but I forgot 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.989
 in which editorial was going to print and 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.440
 Well, I would like to know if this rumor 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.710
 It's true so, well, if someone 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.070
 He knows something if I find out later 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.770
 he communicated them so well that would be 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:39.230
 all thanks for watching the video and we 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.230
 we see in the next theories of wampis
