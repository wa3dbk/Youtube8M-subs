would<00:02:10.380> call<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.590> pretty<00:02:10.890> roll<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.610> tried

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
would call a pretty roll I tried

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.900 
would call a pretty roll I tried
something<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.420> bit<00:02:12.510> challenging<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.380> did<00:02:13.860> a

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
something a bit challenging I I did a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.020 
something a bit challenging I I did a
documentary<00:02:14.910> drama<00:02:15.690> as<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.110> cancer<00:02:16.800> patient

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
documentary drama as a cancer patient

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.510 
documentary drama as a cancer patient
this<00:02:18.030> lady<00:02:18.270> who<00:02:18.950> used<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.100> be<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> cancer

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
this lady who used to be a cancer

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.610 
this lady who used to be a cancer
activist<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.660> was<00:02:21.780> very<00:02:21.840> difficult<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.590> a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
activist so that was very difficult as a

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.890 
activist so that was very difficult as a
first<00:02:22.950> role<00:02:23.190> but<00:02:23.790> i<00:02:23.819> thought<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.390> will<00:02:24.750> give

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
first role but i thought this will give

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.990 
first role but i thought this will give
me<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.050> chance<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.620> really<00:02:25.980> i<00:02:26.100> identify<00:02:26.970> with

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
me a chance to really i identify with

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.820 
me a chance to really i identify with
what<00:02:27.360> acting<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:27.930> about<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.440> first<00:02:28.620> place

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
what acting is about in the first place

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.760 
what acting is about in the first place
so<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.970> was<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.209> good<00:02:30.959> experience<00:02:31.319> where<00:02:31.620> I'll

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
so that was a good experience where I'll

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.040 
so that was a good experience where I'll
do<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.069> again<00:02:32.160> i'm<00:02:32.970> not<00:02:33.180> sure<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.390> if<00:02:33.810> i<00:02:33.989> do

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
do it again i'm not sure and if i do

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.780 
do it again i'm not sure and if i do
choose<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.560> do<00:02:34.800> acting<00:02:35.130> i<00:02:35.280> would<00:02:35.459> definitely

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
choose to do acting i would definitely

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.850 
choose to do acting i would definitely
go<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.180> get<00:02:36.270> technically<00:02:36.780> trained<00:02:37.080> because

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
go and get technically trained because

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.920 
go and get technically trained because
you<00:02:38.160> don't<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.519> get<00:02:39.060> up<00:02:39.120> then<00:02:39.360> colors<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.810> an

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
you don't just get up then colors of an

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.830 
you don't just get up then colors of an
actor<00:02:40.290> no
