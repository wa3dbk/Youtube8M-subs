00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hey guys let's talk a little bit about

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.360 
hey guys let's talk a little bit about
top<00:00:03.090> dead<00:00:03.300> center<00:00:03.659> I<00:00:03.899> want<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.830> quickly<00:00:05.040> go

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
top dead center I want to quickly go

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.990 
top dead center I want to quickly go
through<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:06.150> few<00:00:06.899> steps<00:00:06.930> on<00:00:07.610> what<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.820> should

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
through a few steps on what you should

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.030 
through a few steps on what you should
be<00:00:09.150> seeing<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.960> what<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.200> should<00:00:10.380> do<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.710> set

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
be seeing and what you should do to set

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.020 
be seeing and what you should do to set
your<00:00:11.599> engine<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:12.719> top<00:00:12.840> dead<00:00:13.139> center<00:00:14.030> there's

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
your engine on top dead center there's

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.640 
your engine on top dead center there's
actually<00:00:15.420> two<00:00:15.599> positions<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.260> top<00:00:16.440> dead

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
actually two positions of top dead

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.160 
actually two positions of top dead
center<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.670> can<00:00:17.820> say<00:00:18.000> your<00:00:18.150> put<00:00:18.270> your<00:00:18.420> engine

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
center you can say your put your engine

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.960 
center you can say your put your engine
at<00:00:19.320> top<00:00:19.529> dead<00:00:19.680> center<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.070> compression<00:00:20.520> stroke

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
at top dead center on compression stroke

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.390 
at top dead center on compression stroke
or<00:00:21.210> top<00:00:22.020> dead<00:00:22.199> center<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.880> an<00:00:23.880> exhaust<00:00:24.359> stroke

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
or top dead center on an exhaust stroke

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.580 
or top dead center on an exhaust stroke
it<00:00:26.400> can<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> little<00:00:26.970> confusing<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:28.289> you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
it can be a little confusing because you

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.330 
it can be a little confusing because you
will<00:00:29.099> end<00:00:29.279> up<00:00:29.429> lining<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:30.090> your<00:00:31.009> crank<00:00:32.009> pulley

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
will end up lining up your crank pulley

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.229 
will end up lining up your crank pulley
with<00:00:33.270> marking<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.829> case<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.430> you're

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
with marking on the case and you're

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.729 
with marking on the case and you're
going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> think<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.840> top<00:00:37.050> dead<00:00:37.230> center<00:00:37.559> so

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
going to think it's top dead center so

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.560 
going to think it's top dead center so
I'm<00:00:37.829> good<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.960> actually<00:00:41.570> you're

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
I'm good to go but it's actually you're

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.910 
I'm good to go but it's actually you're
going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.780> pay<00:00:42.989> attention<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.440> make<00:00:43.590> sure<00:00:43.770> it's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
going to pay attention to make sure it's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
going to pay attention to make sure it's
on<00:00:43.950> compression<00:00:44.520> stroke<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:45.629> my

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
on compression stroke right now my

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.709 
on compression stroke right now my
engine<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.620> compression<00:00:47.190> stroke<00:00:48.000> top<00:00:48.539> dead

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
engine is on compression stroke top dead

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.310 
engine is on compression stroke top dead
center<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.670> you'll<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
center and if it is you'll see on the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.189

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
pointing up and to the left a little bit

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
pointing up and to the left a little bit
that<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.960> exactly<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.650> top

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that is if you have it exactly on top

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.030 
that is if you have it exactly on top
dead<00:01:17.130> center<00:01:17.689> compression<00:01:18.689> stroke<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.979> I'm

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
dead center compression stroke now I'm

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.679 
dead center compression stroke now I'm
going<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.250> show<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.430> what<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.030> means<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.509> be

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
going to show you what it means to be

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.679 
going to show you what it means to be
180<00:01:22.560> degrees<00:01:22.920> off<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:24.030> I'm<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
180 degrees off what I'm going to do is

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.560 
180 degrees off what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.049> spin<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.009> crankshaft<00:01:26.570> 360

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I'm going to spin the crankshaft 360

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.600 
I'm going to spin the crankshaft 360
degrees<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.470> full<00:01:28.710> revolution<00:01:28.890> put<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
degrees or one full revolution put it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.880 
degrees or one full revolution put it
backwards<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.540> you're<00:01:31.470> going<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.650> see

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
backwards that and you're going to see

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.429 
backwards that and you're going to see
that<00:01:32.390> these<00:01:33.390> sprockets<00:01:33.750> are<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> be

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
that these sprockets are going to be

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.609 
that these sprockets are going to be
lined<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.860> 180<00:01:35.790> degrees<00:01:36.180> off<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.810> they're

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
lined up 180 degrees off so they're

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.499 
lined up 180 degrees off so they're
going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:37.950> pointing<00:01:38.310> down<00:01:39.240> instead<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.990> up

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
going to be pointing down instead of up

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.850 
going to be pointing down instead of up
some<00:01:42.509> people<00:01:42.780> don't<00:01:42.869> understand<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.590> but

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
some people don't understand this but

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.800 
some people don't understand this but
they're<00:01:44.250> going<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> think<00:01:44.759> well<00:01:45.420> if<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> turn

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
they're going to think well if you turn

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.429 
they're going to think well if you turn
this<00:01:46.049> 360<00:01:46.829> degrees<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.149> must<00:01:48.450> turn<00:01:48.689> 360

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
this 360 degrees then this must turn 360

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.530 
this 360 degrees then this must turn 360
degrees<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.860> that's<00:01:50.070> not<00:01:50.280> true<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.820> I'll

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
degrees but that's not true and I'll

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.480 
degrees but that's not true and I'll
show<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.110> guys<00:01:52.170> right<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:55.490> it's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
show that to you guys right now so it's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.330 
show that to you guys right now so it's
not<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.850> perfect<00:01:57.829> this<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.250> an

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
not going to be perfect this is just an

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.850 
not going to be perfect this is just an
example<00:01:59.460> just<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.270> guys<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.570> see<00:02:00.860> what's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
example just so you guys can see what's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.230 
example just so you guys can see what's
going<00:02:02.159> on

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.740 

all<00:02:06.240> right<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.810> we're<00:02:08.239> right<00:02:09.239> back<00:02:09.479> where<00:02:09.539> we

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
all right so we're right back where we

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.009 
all right so we're right back where we
started<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.500> crank<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.039> turned<00:02:12.019> 360

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
started with the crank it's turned 360

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.440 
started with the crank it's turned 360
degrees<00:02:13.680> now<00:02:14.550> let's<00:02:14.760> look<00:02:14.880> up<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:15.239> at<00:02:15.360> our

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
degrees now let's look up here at our

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.890 
degrees now let's look up here at our
sprockets<00:02:16.310> hey<00:02:17.310> where<00:02:17.940> does<00:02:18.060> our<00:02:18.150> markings<00:02:18.599> go

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
sprockets hey where does our markings go

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.410 
sprockets hey where does our markings go
we<00:02:19.230> had<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> marking<00:02:19.860> up<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.550> we<00:02:21.239> had<00:02:21.390> a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
we had a marking up here and we had a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.620 
we had a marking up here and we had a
marking<00:02:21.870> right<00:02:22.590> here<00:02:23.180> now<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.970> marking<00:02:27.480> is

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
marking right here now this marking is

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.170 
marking right here now this marking is
pointing<00:02:27.959> 180<00:02:28.470> degrees<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.580> opposite<00:02:30.030> way

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
pointing 180 degrees the opposite way

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.740 
pointing 180 degrees the opposite way
and<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.930> was<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:32.250> guy<00:02:32.720> sorry<00:02:35.480> okay<00:02:36.480> here<00:02:36.660> we

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and so was this guy sorry okay here we

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.199 
and so was this guy sorry okay here we
go<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:38.280> marking<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.880> pointing<00:02:39.180> straight

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
go this marking is pointing straight

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.500 
go this marking is pointing straight
down<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:42.200> can<00:02:43.200> get<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.530> there<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:43.860> see<00:02:44.510> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
down and can get in there and see that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.210 
down and can get in there and see that
line<00:02:45.780> yeah<00:02:47.299> that<00:02:48.299> one's<00:02:48.540> pointing<00:02:49.220> straight

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
line yeah that one's pointing straight

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.970 
line yeah that one's pointing straight
down<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.810> same<00:02:51.810> thing<00:02:51.840> on<00:02:52.049> this<00:02:52.230> side<00:02:52.440> we<00:02:52.950> have

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
down and same thing on this side we have

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.750 
down and same thing on this side we have
this<00:02:53.430> mark<00:02:53.730> pointing<00:02:54.150> down<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:55.760> this

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
this mark pointing down and this

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.720 
this mark pointing down and this
pointing<00:02:57.450> down<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:57.900> you're<00:02:58.739> 180<00:02:59.160> degrees<00:02:59.519> off

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
pointing down so you're 180 degrees off

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.880 
pointing down so you're 180 degrees off
therefore<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.840> are<00:03:00.870> not<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.349> compression

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
therefore you are not in compression

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.120 
therefore you are not in compression
stroke<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:03.209> line<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.569> up<00:03:03.690> this<00:03:03.930> way<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:07.130> one

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
stroke if you line it up this way so one

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.729 
stroke if you line it up this way so one
thing<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:08.519> did<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:09.840> make<00:03:10.019> sure<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.470> was

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
thing that I did to make sure that I was

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.610 
thing that I did to make sure that I was
on<00:03:11.359> compression<00:03:12.359> stroke<00:03:12.690> was<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.790> took<00:03:14.790> off<00:03:15.000> the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
on compression stroke was I took off the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.620 
on compression stroke was I took off the
spark<00:03:16.620> plug<00:03:16.859> from<00:03:17.730> number<00:03:18.030> one<00:03:18.180> cylinder

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
spark plug from number one cylinder

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.050 
spark plug from number one cylinder
which<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:19.190> on<00:03:20.190> your<00:03:20.430> engine<00:03:20.700> that's<00:03:20.850> going<00:03:21.000> to

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
which is on your engine that's going to

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.229 
which is on your engine that's going to
be<00:03:21.239> your<00:03:21.959> left<00:03:22.170> side<00:03:22.549> very<00:03:23.549> very<00:03:23.970> first

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
be your left side very very first

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.509 
be your left side very very first
cylinder<00:03:24.600> it's<00:03:25.380> also<00:03:25.530> marked<00:03:26.040> on<00:03:26.250> your<00:03:28.519> spark

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
cylinder it's also marked on your spark

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.250 
cylinder it's also marked on your spark
plug<00:03:29.760> coil<00:03:31.370> number<00:03:32.370> one<00:03:32.790> number<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:33.840> cylinder

plug coil number one number one cylinder
this<00:03:34.950> coil<00:03:35.310> came<00:03:35.639> right<00:03:35.940> out<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:37.400> here<00:03:38.400> I

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
this coil came right out of here I

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.920 
this coil came right out of here I
plugged<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.500> up<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:41.120> while<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> had<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.750> plugged

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
plugged it up and while I had it plugged

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.340 
plugged it up and while I had it plugged
up<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.470> turned<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.340> crank<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:44.970> lined<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.930> up<00:03:46.049> to

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
up I turned the crank and lined it up to

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.740 
up I turned the crank and lined it up to
top<00:03:46.560> dead<00:03:46.739> center<00:03:47.100> with<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.430> markings<00:03:47.910> on<00:03:48.120> the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
pulley and on the case and as I got it

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.809 
pulley and on the case and as I got it
to<00:03:54.269> top<00:03:54.450> dead<00:03:54.600> center<00:03:54.989> if<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:56.310> have<00:03:56.609> it<00:03:56.730> on

to top dead center if you have it on
compression<00:03:57.150> stroke<00:03:57.540> you'll<00:03:57.750> feel<00:03:57.989> air

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
compression stroke you'll feel air

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.530 
compression stroke you'll feel air
pressure<00:03:59.160> build<00:03:59.549> up<00:03:59.700> inside<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.180> cylinder

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
pressure build up inside that cylinder

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.199 
pressure build up inside that cylinder
and<00:04:00.840> try<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.590> squeeze<00:04:02.190> its<00:04:02.430> way<00:04:02.639> through<00:04:02.970> where

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
and try to squeeze its way through where

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.289 
and try to squeeze its way through where
however<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:03.930> have<00:04:04.109> it<00:04:04.260> plugged<00:04:04.470> up<00:04:05.090> now<00:04:06.090> if

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
however you have it plugged up now if

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.879 
however you have it plugged up now if
you<00:04:06.420> do<00:04:06.569> not<00:04:06.720> have<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.049> on<00:04:07.139> compression<00:04:07.500> stroke

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
you do not have it on compression stroke

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.720 
you do not have it on compression stroke
you're<00:04:08.549> not<00:04:08.639> going<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.819> feel<00:04:08.940> anything<00:04:10.160> as<00:04:11.160> you

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
you're not going to feel anything as you

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.349 
you're not going to feel anything as you
line<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.030> up<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.239> top<00:04:12.449> dead<00:04:12.630> center<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:14.359> that's

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
line it up to top dead center so that's

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.509 
line it up to top dead center so that's
really<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.810> way<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.769> know

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
really the way to know

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.330 
really the way to know
if<00:04:17.940> you're<00:04:18.750> on<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.579> compression<00:04:20.579> stroke<00:04:20.849> is

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
if you're on a compression stroke is

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.409 
if you're on a compression stroke is
you're<00:04:23.340> going<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.490> feel<00:04:23.699> pressure<00:04:23.910> coming<00:04:24.270> out

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
you're going to feel pressure coming out

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.350 
you're going to feel pressure coming out
of<00:04:24.569> the<00:04:24.690> cylinder<00:04:25.639> the<00:04:26.639> other<00:04:26.970> thing<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.240> can

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
of the cylinder the other thing you can

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.960 
of the cylinder the other thing you can
do<00:04:27.539> if<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:27.990> want<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.400> if<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.550> don't<00:04:29.729> want<00:04:29.910> to

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
do if you want to if you don't want to

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.790 
do if you want to if you don't want to
do<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.360> way<00:04:30.479> is<00:04:30.990> remove<00:04:31.380> your<00:04:31.530> rocker

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
do it that way is remove your rocker

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.790 
do it that way is remove your rocker
cover<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.660> look<00:04:33.660> at<00:04:33.780> your<00:04:33.930> camshaft<00:04:34.139> lobes

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
cover and look at your camshaft lobes

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.589 
cover and look at your camshaft lobes
and<00:04:35.660> make<00:04:36.660> sure<00:04:36.810> they're<00:04:37.080> pointing<00:04:38.069> up<00:04:38.280> and

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
and make sure they're pointing up and

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.219 
and make sure they're pointing up and
towards<00:04:39.599> each<00:04:39.870> other<00:04:41.180> on<00:04:42.180> this<00:04:42.900> side<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.080> the

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
towards each other on this side of the

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.040 
towards each other on this side of the
engine<00:04:43.380> or<00:04:44.130> actually<00:04:44.580> it's<00:04:44.699> on<00:04:44.870> should<00:04:45.870> be<00:04:45.900> the

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
engine or actually it's on should be the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.050 
engine or actually it's on should be the
same<00:04:46.229> on<00:04:46.349> both<00:04:46.530> sides<00:04:46.639> I'm<00:04:47.639> not<00:04:47.819> sure<00:04:47.970> about

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
same on both sides I'm not sure about

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.430 
same on both sides I'm not sure about
the<00:04:48.240> other<00:04:48.389> side<00:04:48.599> but<00:04:48.780> on<00:04:48.900> this<00:04:49.050> side

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
the other side but on this side

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.649 
the other side but on this side
both<00:04:50.069> camshafts<00:04:50.639> should<00:04:50.880> be<00:04:50.970> pointing<00:04:51.330> up<00:04:51.419> and

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
both camshafts should be pointing up and

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.749 
both camshafts should be pointing up and
pointing<00:04:51.720> a<00:04:52.259> little<00:04:52.800> bit<00:04:52.919> towards<00:04:53.190> each<00:04:53.520> other

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
pointing a little bit towards each other

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.360 
pointing a little bit towards each other
and<00:04:54.750> then<00:04:55.349> you'll<00:04:55.530> know<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:55.740> it's<00:04:56.190> on

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
and then you'll know that it's on

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.249 
and then you'll know that it's on
compression<00:04:56.909> stroke<00:04:57.240> that's<00:04:57.900> if<00:04:58.139> you

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
compression stroke that's if you

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.529 
compression stroke that's if you
actually<00:04:58.409> visually<00:04:59.130> want<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.520> see<00:04:59.699> it<00:04:59.819> by

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
actually visually want to see it by

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:07.100 
actually visually want to see it by
removing<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.550> rocker<00:05:02.550> cover<00:05:05.750> all<00:05:06.750> right<00:05:06.930> I

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
removing the rocker cover all right I

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.960 
removing the rocker cover all right I
hope<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:07.919> uh<00:05:07.949> clears<00:05:08.729> a<00:05:09.000> few<00:05:09.539> questions<00:05:10.229> up

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
hope that uh clears a few questions up

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.150 
hope that uh clears a few questions up
thank<00:05:11.970> you
