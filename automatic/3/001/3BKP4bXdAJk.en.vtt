 there started no further 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.569
 happen here so she singled out for that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.769
 to make ice cream dry 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.960
 hold in your hands and here it pops up 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.180
 and can unscrew 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.340

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.570
 pour click 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.360

 beautiful truth of the tube will not stand it 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.430

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.430

 sticks or yogurt yogurt 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.900
 can use the purchase or homework 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.930
 the capacity of which you will beat 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.990
 blender and of course fruits and berries 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.640
 this time i use blackcurrant 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.120
 red currant 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.660
 bananas and peaches capacity where we will 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.390
 shoot down 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:43.050
 impose with it can be

 i use frozen berries and usually 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.610
 add yogurt 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.409
 about 200 grams 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:18.390
 also in order to good block more 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.580
 you can add a spoonful of iodine 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.310
 instead of sugar because honey is much 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.990
 the disease and will be much tastier that's how 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.020

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.230
 very tasty and appetizing begin 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.230

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.210

00:05:54.809 --> 00:06:01.599
 after fixing the problem we will continue 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:04.180
 then adheres better to the glass 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:09.909
