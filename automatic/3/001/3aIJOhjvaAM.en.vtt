00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.920

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.630
 doctor for you know better 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.490
 for example you have a shampoo and you do not 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.949
 know that active principle already spoken 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.060
 You've heard him well but you do not know what 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.660
 means 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.650
 I'm going to talk about argan oil today. 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:35.400
 angel he is the gold in hoxha why why 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:37.660
 he is and came out of a walnut that is of the tree 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.610
 earn thorny 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.910
 only a tree very rare people who 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.130
 only gives a desert of morocco only if 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.760
 I have no other place has not just got 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:53.590
 there in the desert foci and to make a liter 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.650
 people are needed without the 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.620
 We need to make a book so that's why. 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.430
 it 's so expensive you buy that 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.400
 vial of oil of argan oil 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.770
 argan is rich in fatty acids and 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.829
 vitamins a and e has a high power 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.810
 moisturizer in the salon it can be 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.520
 added a few drops 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.259
 before doing the chemistry at the time of 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.600
 preparing a culture you can 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.060
 add a few droplets this will 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.299
 to reduce a hair chemistry pact 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.170
 to reduce the aggression of this food in 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.060
 wires 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.920
 At home you can adding the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.770
 any mask you like some 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.659
 droplets will enhance this feat of 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.329
 your mask giving a lot more hair 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.639
 healthy 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.429
 the problem is when you buy 

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:44.850
 because generally you are going to buy you 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.979
 sometimes you think the product is 100% 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.539
 100% pure vegetable is not usually it 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.090
 was healed with other eyes then 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.909
 open your eyes when it comes to buying and 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.680
 preference is given to purchasing a 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.700
 ever 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.100
 both vegetable 100% eyes seeing the rh 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.400
 also improve the elasticity of the yarns 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.110
 has antioxidant power 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.509
 that means he avoids the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.540
 aging can be used 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.660
 with colored hair and I think silver 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.420
 keep a color for longer hair 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.150
 oily can also be used only people 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.610
 that we have consideration is using in 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.320
 three times a week maximum 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.470
 it can be used on oily hair 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.930
 because it has a rapid absorption so it 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.959
 that sticky look does not stay here 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.720
 is not to waste hair to 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.060
 also has a very good use and is 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.239
 convenient aging people can 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.510
 be worn along with your anti-aging mask 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.440
 ei is also anti-inflammatory and stays three 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.190
 years 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.709
 Erdan can also be used in 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.260
 thicknesses else who was meditating on 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.110
 Sometimes I think Dad can use the oil 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.180
 of argan because he will get 3 to 1 he 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.519
 will be a very powerful graduation 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.930
 can be used during breastfeeding without 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.930
 problems for the baby 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.180
 Now when you go to use agatha is 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.110
 be careful not to get exposed 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.209
 much to the sun ika beach using Itabom 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.720
 why use anytime not only the league 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.090
 but any oil is in a source of 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.360
 excessive heat , we end up affecting the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.730
 if you will use it on the skin as 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.320
 moisturizer or admiration and cement 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.239
 Then you have to wash well with 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.720
 specific soap for the area 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.410
 to not stay to is not between the forums 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.700
 foot 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:41.549
 The usage tip is to use a few drops of 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.250
 today was before a tincture or before 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.150
 of any chemistry this will prevent 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.739
 the aggression of the thread and also add a 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.600
 I dropped two droplets 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.660
 before using his former vice 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.120
 so much so that it will further enhance 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.330
 power to your face mask is that it is 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.470
 Back to your tips let your enjoy 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.030

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.460
 Let's make several videos watched. 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.640
 for you to understand more each component 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.130
 of the product formulation is taubatÃ© 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.200
 forgetting to show this one is a 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.020
 of the various products I found at home 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.380
 which has the formulation allergan and this 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:23.220
 here is a thermal protector written here 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:28.440
 in its composition and producing proteins 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.840
 the sign of the matrix amino acids in a lot 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.990
 but here there are several things here then 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.090
 sometimes you have in your cosmetics the 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.580
