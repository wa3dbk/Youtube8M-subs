00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.709
 and there are guys matthew strength and today the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.510
 Channel in the beautiful son of Brazil 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.809
 the helicopter tips video says 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.809
 coast 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.890
 If you, on a journey, manage and 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.180
 to become a commander hamilton 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.340
 here are some tips you can 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.649
 improve only gaming if you already drive 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.510
 well and have known a tip it is important that 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.430
 I did not mention it in the video. 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.290
 comments to help the community 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.420
 The first tip are for those who are ill 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.670
 entered the le five seconds later already 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.019
 hit the first building ahead before 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.519
 to enter a crowded server already 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.579
 want to fly out there 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.680
 have a training center in ct you 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.360
 can learn the controls calmly and 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.559
 little by little and improving your 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.689
 movement 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.670
 so feel confident try 

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:05.799
 maneuvers to go under the bridge 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.509
 countless times over time you will 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:12.790
 acquiring skill by improving 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:14.530
 noted his drive with him 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.900
 indications of what to use and how to 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.020
 use listen us look there a primary if 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.820
 must be 762 to 25 millimeters and can be 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.460
 very effective against find 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.780
 exibility but snipers is still 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.399
 more recommended 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.770
 in addition to being more effective against 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.409
 vehicles, including other vehicles 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.159
 762 helicopter requires more than 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.770
 of the player 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.240
 you have to aim right in kindergartens 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.770
 this makes you better your 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.409
 family 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.229
 the secondary recommended laser guided 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.120
 I do not recommend heat-guided you already 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.100
 use 762 with the main 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.140
 sometimes it can even hurt if it is the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.710
 if perhaps you do not trust your 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.960
 look 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.810
 you pit the other put him before 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.390
 Shoot with 7 62 and your enemy is 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.830
 with the 762 will have enough time for 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.049
 finish with it but it is highly 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.770
 recommended in open maps such as 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.770
 your story 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.360
 in the improvements recommend the frog farm 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.099
 feeder runs 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.870
 the radar was really very useful 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.209
 especially on maps with poor eyesight 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.130
 as the break but many 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.410
 buildings is very easy to helicopter 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.569
 go through the corner of the funk year map and 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.220
 so we can expect to prevent more 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.560
 this would be very difficult to happen 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.330
 this case was using radar because 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.410
 all air vehicles are exhausted 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.410
 I kill myself 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.549
 already the food of the mail gives practically 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.340
 plus 1 second of burst with this 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.170
 youth may seem little but the x1 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.849
 really useful since your 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.130
 machine gun will take a little longer 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.450
 to warm up and this gives you the right to 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.450
 to be able to miss a style 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.910
 against the measure for its protection 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.970
 against the distinguished ones is among the 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.100
 faithful to the cm protect them for less 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.170
 time but charges faster are 20 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.450
 seconds the seed protests for more 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.280
 time but it's 23 seconds 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.540
 besides other advantages it is not 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.400
 totally reliable 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.560
 so you articles and mr the missile can 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.330
 to hit anyway because he stays 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.610
 surrounding it for a while until it 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.290
 could then go a little tip as soon as 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.660
 the Chilean missile began to surround 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.060
 to stick from any building or even 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.740
 even on the floor as it will soon strike 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.760
 then exploded before running the 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.760
 risk of hitting 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.550
 another very quick and very useful tip is 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.770
 a bank makes you not 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.170
 hit by augustin even his faithful 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.910
 or c - have loaded for this 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.620
 It's enough that you stay more or less in the 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.230
 height and side for those who are 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.060
 shifting if well executed as 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.220
 measure yourself around exploding in the air 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.220
 as if you had declared segment 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.340
 then pro guys have just hope heart 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.320
 have helped someone independent 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.390
 feedback from this video can bring more 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.070
 one with helium tips if you know of 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.600
 any important tip I said 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.520
 leave in the comments to help 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.320
 community, whoever wants my channel goes 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.600
 leave the description and you can not 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.620
 It will help a lot later. 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.620
 so thanks
