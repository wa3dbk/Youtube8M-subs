00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.500
 Today we bought an apple in the supermarket 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.630
 what is the mega and we look good to me 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.590
 it caught the attention first that the brightness 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.090
 of the apple was like almost those fruits 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.860
 artificial ones that they sell so do not be so 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.290
 toy stores or kissing furniture stores 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.470
 above those of the furniture of the 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.930
 new furniture this 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.270
 and it occurred to me to do a test 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.510
 [Music] 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:37.250
 scraping the apple has like a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.250
 kind of wax 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.930
 that covers the outside of the block 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.610
 and it seems that is what gives it shine 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.970
 and that 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.940
 that tone is pleasing to the eye I do not know 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.399
 if it's a chemical or if it's 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.540
 doing so is something natural if it is 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.660
 something artificial 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.190
 so do not stain what do you think 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.070
 what are you 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.920
 eating thinking you're 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.060
 savoring a fruit or eating something 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.770
 natural 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.770
 you realize that many of the 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.659
 Well, the processes are totally 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.670
 controlled by machines and chemicals 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.939
 and for 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.090
 so controlling the market is already 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.090
 something 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.250
 we are eating this what 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.409
 and we 've been eating it for years and I 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.400
 I imagine all kinds of all kinds of 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.659
 fruits and some vegetables also have 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.119
 this process 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.810
 and they can test us at home 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.070
 can you try 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.409
 to see what happens the same this 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.560
 with any fruit that you make the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.060
 apra I think it's lemons 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.060
 but I do not know 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.530
 look level 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.950
 then like 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.819
 as will be 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:24.540
 what covers the output of the apple 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.540
 from vÃ©lez 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.880
 with the strength to break the skin of the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.740
 apple but 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.740
 It looks so bright I am 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.820
 peel them 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.980
 good fiber is that fiber is 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.810
 next 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.810
 that the fiber is in the shell but 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.610
 well that was the test of the apple 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.819
 he did something interesting to me and that 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.819
 share it with you 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.230
 it's sad to realize that many of 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.490
 the products that we are consuming 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.080
 they are so processed or they are 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:34.080
 apparently so controlled to create a 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.080
 benefit 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.280
 so much to the industry 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.739
 to industry like us or to 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.700
 wrong I do not know I do not know I do not know what to think 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.950
 but, yes, it is going to be something that 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.120
 place to go and cut the apple 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.170
 directly from the tree 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.879
 happens after that step before arriving 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.790
 our hands go through a process of 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:04.750
 quality of cultivation 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.269
 it is cannon to find this know that what 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.030
 I better say we do not know then 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.730
 do not know much about cancer but 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:17.139
 ugt that that is what is causing you 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.289
 cancer and that you to consume a 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:24.280
 apple believing that it is the most natural 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:28.430
 is bringing diseases or diseases to your life 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:32.300
 or even sometimes the same vaccines 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.570
 force us in each country to take and that 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.090
 surely it is nothing other than something 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.650
 that maybe 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.940
 brings a control to the population to the 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.070
 society but good 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.700
 I leave this in consideration of each 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.370
 one and this if you have something to comment 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.230
 leave it here in the comments 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.500
 talk if you have already done this test 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.900
 with some other fruit 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.480
 in what country was it also to know this 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.340
 this was in Mexico and because this was a 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.889
 Apple 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.430
 I think it was American 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:15.200
 forget to mention them 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.200
 to the label of d 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.060
 california then this 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.969
 but it is a product that we consume very 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.639
 often here in mexico ok 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:30.310
 then to your consideration any 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.710
 comment is well received and we can 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.660
 touch other topics this in relation to 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.660
 this thanks until the next
