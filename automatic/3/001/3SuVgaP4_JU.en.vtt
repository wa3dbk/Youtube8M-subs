00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
boys yeah I think I think it may make

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.789 
boys yeah I think I think it may make
the<00:03:08.610> whole<00:03:08.700> season<00:03:09.090> worthwhile<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.840> mean<00:03:10.260> every

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
the whole season worthwhile I mean every

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.350 
the whole season worthwhile I mean every
choose<00:03:11.040> every<00:03:11.579> decision<00:03:11.790> we<00:03:12.060> turned<00:03:12.269> that

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
choose every decision we turned that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.080 
choose every decision we turned that
into<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.320> good<00:03:13.739> season<00:03:13.920> up<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.730> really

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
into a good season up so really

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.930 
into a good season up so really
something<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.900> look<00:03:16.049> forward<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.730> think

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
something to look forward to and I think

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.729
