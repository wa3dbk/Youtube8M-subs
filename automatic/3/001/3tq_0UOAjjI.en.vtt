00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.340 
the Mesa Mesa plateau you can see it's a
nice-sized<00:03:14.579> Mesa<00:03:15.090> if<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.600> ever<00:03:15.750> freaking

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
nice-sized Mesa if it ever freaking

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.910 
nice-sized Mesa if it ever freaking
loads<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:17.269> right<00:03:18.269> down<00:03:18.450> here<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:19.530> will<00:03:19.709> know

loads in right down here you will know
what<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:21.329> is<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:23.250> end<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.579> portal

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
what that is that is the end of portal

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.930 
what that is that is the end of portal
and<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.829> one<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.100> those<00:03:26.190> end<00:03:26.519> portals

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
and this is one of those end portals

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.520 
and this is one of those end portals
where<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.690> you're<00:03:27.900> going<00:03:28.079> through<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
yeah here's the coordinates now we'll

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.280 
yeah here's the coordinates now we'll
put<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.500> coordinates<00:03:47.069> for<00:03:48.859> this<00:03:49.859> spawner

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
put the coordinates for this spawner

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.750 
put the coordinates for this spawner
just<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.470> can<00:03:52.739> if<00:03:53.069> you<00:03:53.190> want<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.430> dig<00:03:53.609> down

you can dig down safely on top of the
spawner<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:57.620> yeah<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:59.100> there's<00:03:59.579> that<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:03.060> I

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
spawner and yeah so there's that and I

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.539 
spawner and yeah so there's that and I
will<00:04:03.359> put<00:04:03.389> the<00:04:03.660> coordinates<00:04:03.930> for<00:04:04.470> all<00:04:04.829> of<00:04:05.760> the

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
will put the coordinates for all of the

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.800 
will put the coordinates for all of the
strongholds<00:04:08.549> in<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.910> description<00:04:09.420> as<00:04:09.540> well
