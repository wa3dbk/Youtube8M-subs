yesterday<00:01:13.710> we're<00:01:14.100> gripping<00:01:14.490> rapid<00:01:14.880> fire<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
yesterday we're gripping rapid fire I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.100 
yesterday we're gripping rapid fire I
lied<00:01:16.140> sort<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.250> rapid<00:01:18.180> fire<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> must

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
lied sort of rapid fire is a must

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.530 
lied sort of rapid fire is a must
because<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.830> rate<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.729> fire<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.299> thing

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
because the rate of fire on this thing

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.420 
because the rate of fire on this thing
is<00:01:21.750> horrible<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> worst<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is horrible it's the worst in the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.630 
is horrible it's the worst in the
submachine<00:01:23.759> gun<00:01:24.030> category<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.280> good

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
submachine gun category but the good

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.510 
submachine gun category but the good
thing<00:01:26.700> about<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> has<00:01:27.720> no<00:01:28.080> recoil

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
thing about it is it has no recoil

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.010 
thing about it is it has no recoil
whatsoever<00:01:29.520> even<00:01:29.820> when<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> put<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.509> rapid

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
whatsoever even when you put the rapid

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.929 
whatsoever even when you put the rapid
fire<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.920> kicks<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.310> up<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.490> little<00:01:32.790> bit

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
fire on it just kicks it up a little bit

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.240 
fire on it just kicks it up a little bit
so<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> don't<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.170> grips<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.500> necessary

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so I don't think grips that necessary

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.130 
so I don't think grips that necessary
what<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.460> tend<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.360> rapid<00:01:36.780> fire<00:01:36.960> in

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
what I tend to go with is rapid fire in

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.080 
what I tend to go with is rapid fire in
silence<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.650> because<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> know<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> got<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
silence here because you know you got to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.640 
silence here because you know you got to

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
of domination sometimes I switch out

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.300 
of domination sometimes I switch out
toughness<00:02:26.720> for<00:02:26.960> flak<00:02:27.170> jacket<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.860> don't<00:02:28.250> know

toughness for flak jacket I don't know

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.070 
toughness for flak jacket I don't know
it<00:02:28.460> depends<00:02:28.820> on<00:02:29.000> what<00:02:29.360> I'm<00:02:29.480> feeling<00:02:29.660> at<00:02:29.960> the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
it depends on what I'm feeling at the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.540 
it depends on what I'm feeling at the
time<00:02:30.380> moment<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.600> overall<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.500> freakin<00:02:34.250> give

this<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.820> peacemaker<00:02:35.690> 9<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.890> don't<00:02:37.070> know<00:02:37.160> it's

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
this a peacemaker 9 I don't know it's

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.930 
this a peacemaker 9 I don't know it's
got<00:02:37.520> great<00:02:38.060> range<00:02:38.860> great<00:02:39.860> accuracy<00:02:40.280> like<00:02:40.820> I

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
got great range great accuracy like I

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.900 
got great range great accuracy like I
said<00:02:41.120> no<00:02:41.330> recoil<00:02:41.750> its<00:02:42.170> damage<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.860> okay<00:02:43.700> and

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
said no recoil its damage is okay and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.480 
said no recoil its damage is okay and
you<00:02:44.870> know<00:02:44.959> it's<00:02:45.290> just<00:02:45.380> not<00:02:45.770> as<00:02:46.010> good<00:02:46.100> as<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
you know it's just not as good as the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.940 
you know it's just not as good as the
MSMC<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.270> PDW<00:02:47.930> but<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.200> think<00:02:48.680> it's<00:02:48.800> better

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
MSMC and PDW but I think it's better

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.070 
MSMC and PDW but I think it's better
than<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.489> other<00:02:49.730> four<00:02:50.030> submachine<00:02:50.570> guns<00:02:50.780> I'd

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
than the other four submachine guns I'd

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.330 
than the other four submachine guns I'd
let<00:02:51.470> me<00:02:51.590> know<00:02:51.709> what<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:51.980> guys<00:02:52.070> think

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
hopefully this a class setup could help

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.650 
hopefully this a class setup could help
you<00:02:54.920> guys<00:02:55.040> out<00:02:55.280> because<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:55.700> know<00:02:55.760> every<00:02:56.420> single

you guys out because I know every single
person<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.320> freaking<00:02:57.650> game<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:58.130> using<00:02:58.580> the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
person the freaking game is using the

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.000 
person the freaking game is using the
peacemaker<00:02:59.270> right<00:02:59.510> now<00:02:59.690> and<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.770> know<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.890> lot

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
peacemaker right now and you know a lot

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.270 
peacemaker right now and you know a lot
of<00:03:01.220> them<00:03:01.459> tend<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.820> go<00:03:01.940> with<00:03:02.150> silencer<00:03:02.780> and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
of them tend to go with silencer and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.150 
of them tend to go with silencer and
laser<00:03:04.280> sight<00:03:04.720> but<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.750> guess<00:03:05.810> if<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:06.860> don't

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
laser sight but I guess if you don't

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.010 
laser sight but I guess if you don't
have<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.489> rapid<00:03:07.940> fire<00:03:08.090> considering<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.780> unlock

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
have a rapid fire considering you unlock

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.620 
have a rapid fire considering you unlock
it<00:03:09.140> at<00:03:09.230> level<00:03:09.470> 15<00:03:09.860> I<00:03:10.100> guess<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.300> got<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.540> use

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
it at level 15 I guess you got to use

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.229 
it at level 15 I guess you got to use
something<00:03:11.989> like<00:03:12.020> that<00:03:12.730> sound<00:03:13.730> sir<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.030> not<00:03:14.209> a

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
something like that sound sir is not a

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.020 
something like that sound sir is not a
must<00:03:14.540> though<00:03:14.890> until<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.340> get<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.640> rapid

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
must though until you get that rapid

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.000 
must though until you get that rapid
fire<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.450> know<00:03:17.570> try<00:03:17.870> like<00:03:18.140> long<00:03:18.440> barrel<00:03:18.890> or

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
fire you know try like long barrel or

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.380 
fire you know try like long barrel or
something<00:03:19.340> not<00:03:19.519> even<00:03:19.700> long<00:03:19.850> barrel<00:03:20.180> i<00:03:20.239> got

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
something not even long barrel i got

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.840 
something not even long barrel i got
from<00:03:20.510> j<00:03:20.780> increase<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.650> damage<00:03:21.830> i<00:03:22.250> don't<00:03:22.790> know

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
from j increase the damage i don't know

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.800 
from j increase the damage i don't know
i<00:03:22.880> just<00:03:22.910> tried<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.330> whole<00:03:23.540> bunch<00:03:23.720> of

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
i just tried a whole bunch of

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.660 
i just tried a whole bunch of
combinations<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:24.739> is<00:03:24.830> what<00:03:24.950> i<00:03:24.980> found<00:03:25.220> to

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
combinations this is what i found to

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.789 
combinations this is what i found to
work<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:26.000> best<00:03:26.209> but<00:03:26.540> uh<00:03:26.570> of<00:03:26.989> course<00:03:27.500> you're

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
work the best but uh of course you're
