properties and then save this as a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.280 
properties and then save this as a
template

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290

property we want to link it to a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.810 
property we want to link it to a
property<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.080> model<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.100> used<00:02:35.580> in

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
property in the model that is used in

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.310 
property in the model that is used in
the<00:02:35.940> sheep<00:02:36.150> property<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.960> model<00:02:37.290> that

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
the sheep property so the model that

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.550 
the sheep property so the model that
were<00:02:37.650> using<00:02:38.090> if<00:02:39.090> we<00:02:39.390> select<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.870> we<00:02:40.140> can<00:02:40.350> come

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
were using if we select that we can come

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.440 
were using if we select that we can come
here<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:40.860> we<00:02:40.920> can<00:02:40.980> link<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.850> these<00:02:42.000> different

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
here and we can link to these different

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.960 
here and we can link to these different
items<00:02:42.810> but<00:02:43.380> we<00:02:44.220> don't<00:02:44.400> actually<00:02:44.580> have<00:02:44.910> a

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
items but we don't actually have a

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.260 
items but we don't actually have a
custom<00:02:45.660> property<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.070> part<00:02:47.370> yet<00:02:47.610> so

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
custom property for this part yet so

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.449 
custom property for this part yet so
before<00:02:48.630> we<00:02:48.780> actually<00:02:48.810> do<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.560> before<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.430> are

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
before we actually do this before we are

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.420 
before we actually do this before we are
able<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.910> link<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:52.320> need<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.650> exit<00:02:53.280> that

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
able to link this we need to exit that

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.380 
able to link this we need to exit that
and<00:02:53.700> let's<00:02:53.940> go<00:02:54.150> back<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.200> part<00:02:59.030> so<00:03:00.030> we<00:03:00.209> can

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
and let's go back to that part so we can

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.940 
and let's go back to that part so we can
see<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.780> part<00:03:01.080> actually<00:03:01.290> doesn't<00:03:01.800> have<00:03:01.890> a

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
see this part actually doesn't have a

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.070 
see this part actually doesn't have a
material<00:03:02.459> applied<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.600> we're<00:03:03.720> going<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.870> come

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
material applied so we're going to come

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.990 
material applied so we're going to come
in<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.440> apply<00:03:04.740> material<00:03:05.250> let's<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.610> say<00:03:05.760> a

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
in and apply material let's just say a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.480 
in and apply material let's just say a
simple<00:03:06.330> plain<00:03:06.720> carbon<00:03:07.050> steel<00:03:07.440> material<00:03:08.010> so

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
simple plain carbon steel material so

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.310 
simple plain carbon steel material so
now<00:03:08.580> we<00:03:08.640> have<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.880> material<00:03:09.660> applied<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.170> with

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
now we have a material applied and with

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.090 
now we have a material applied and with
that<00:03:10.530> comes<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.190> weight<00:03:11.900> but<00:03:12.900> we<00:03:13.170> still<00:03:13.530> need<00:03:13.860> to

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
that comes a weight but we still need to

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.910 
that comes a weight but we still need to
do<00:03:14.570> additional<00:03:15.570> feature<00:03:15.810> additional<00:03:16.709> work<00:03:16.890> to

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
do additional feature additional work to

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.490 
do additional feature additional work to
be<00:03:17.280> able<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.489> get<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:18.030> into<00:03:18.570> our<00:03:18.600> drawing

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
be able to get that into our drawing

we<00:03:39.810> are<00:03:39.989> going<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.380> call<00:03:40.620> our<00:03:40.799> property<00:03:41.280> the

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
we are going to call our property the

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.039 
we are going to call our property the
first<00:03:41.820> one<00:03:42.000> we're<00:03:42.180> going<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.390> choose<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.900> we

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
first one we're going to choose is we

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.890 
first one we're going to choose is we
want<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.320> call<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> property<00:03:44.010> material<00:03:44.840> now<00:03:45.840> we

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
want to call a property material now we

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.800 
want to call a property material now we
need<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.380> make<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:47.060> give<00:03:48.060> this<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.390> value

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
need to make this give this a value

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.229 
need to make this give this a value
somehow<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:50.160> we<00:03:50.280> can<00:03:50.459> come<00:03:50.640> in<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.060> use

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
somehow so we can come in and use

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.710 
somehow so we can come in and use
default<00:03:51.930> or<00:03:52.640> built<00:03:53.640> in<00:03:53.910> values<00:03:54.510> that

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
default or built in values that

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.170 
default or built in values that
SolidWorks<00:03:55.200> has<00:03:55.670> here<00:03:56.670> we're<00:03:56.790> going<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.000> say

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
SolidWorks has here we're going to say

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.080 
SolidWorks has here we're going to say
material<00:03:57.540> as<00:03:58.350> soon<00:03:58.530> as<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.739> do<00:03:58.799> that<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.640> pulls

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
material as soon as I do that it pulls

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.170 
material as soon as I do that it pulls
in<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.380> code<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:02.010> SolidWorks<00:04:02.519> uses<00:04:02.940> for

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
in a the code that SolidWorks uses for

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.300 
in a the code that SolidWorks uses for
this<00:04:03.299> material<00:04:03.840> for<00:04:04.290> this<00:04:04.440> custom<00:04:04.890> property

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
this material for this custom property

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.759 
this material for this custom property
and<00:04:05.489> then<00:04:06.269> it<00:04:06.390> gives<00:04:06.510> us<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.840> value<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.440> it's

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
and then it gives us the value that it's

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.580 
and then it gives us the value that it's
evaluating<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.640> write<00:04:08.970> now<00:04:09.290> let's<00:04:10.290> do<00:04:10.470> the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
evaluating to write now let's do the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.780 
evaluating to write now let's do the
same<00:04:10.769> thing<00:04:10.830> for<00:04:11.340> weight

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.370

future<00:06:12.510> times<00:06:12.930> we<00:06:13.320> use<00:06:13.500> this<00:06:13.680> template<00:06:14.130> it

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
future times we use this template it

future times we use this template it
will<00:06:14.610> automatically<00:06:15.300> open<00:06:15.450> with<00:06:15.960> this<00:06:16.169> weight

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
will automatically open with this weight

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.770 
will automatically open with this weight
the<00:06:17.340> weight<00:06:17.520> and<00:06:17.729> the<00:06:17.820> material<00:06:18.240> inserted
