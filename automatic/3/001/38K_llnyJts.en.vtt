about<00:02:34.380> doing<00:02:35.150> mocking<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> system<00:02:36.900> up<00:02:37.020> and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
about doing mocking the system up and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.310 
about doing mocking the system up and
changing<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> bloated<00:02:38.490> 8<00:02:38.640> inch<00:02:38.790> system

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
changing it to a bloated 8 inch system

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.820 
changing it to a bloated 8 inch system
using<00:02:40.320> some<00:02:40.500> coil<00:02:40.710> spacers<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.680> mounting<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
using some coil spacers and mounting the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.320 
using some coil spacers and mounting the
amounts<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.610> axles<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> little<00:02:45.240> bit

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
amounts on the axles a little bit

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.100 
amounts on the axles a little bit
different<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.660> give<00:02:45.780> me<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> little<00:02:45.990> more

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
different to give me a little more

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.540 
different to give me a little more
height<00:02:46.350> but<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.740> think<00:02:46.950> what<00:02:47.070> I'm<00:02:47.130> gonna<00:02:47.190> do<00:02:47.370> now
