00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.880
 And here, folks here are welcome. 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.930
 tech news and last year's Christmas 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.650
 smooth squash group attacked the psn and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.160
 good 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.800
 to xbox live who is trying to play in this 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.010
 day failed and they used 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.679
 routers to do this 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.070
 attack happened the following 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.550
 many people do not change the username and password 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.030
 routers' pattern so dry the 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.010
 router 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.370
 it comes with the default user and password 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.539
 so it is very easy to invade this 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.110
 router 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.170
 this way the group could invade 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.980
 thousands of routers is using the password 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:01.920
 the good boss user is there the music tip 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.019
 password and user account of your router and a 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.390
 video of a guy is doing very 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.659
 success on youtube 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.610
 why he bought a very expensive drone and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.040
 with the whole day playing with Tony 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.960
 thing that anyone would do ferraz 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.210
 buy a chronic s 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.270
 Until then, the only problem is that the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.060
 Tony ran out of battery and of course the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.909
 fall but the speed that are falling 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.460
 until it was slow then it would not break the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.610
 the problem is that under the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.720
 today it was had a small pond 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 Thousand throne and falling into this water the reaction 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.729
 I think it would look like 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.460
 many people he tried to save the throne 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.899
 threw himself into the water and got 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.180

 and until the next technical mills 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.270

 it's worth knowing the solar network 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.360
 injury seems a contract in Portuguese a 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.510
 support in Portuguese as well as a 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.060
 minimum payment of $ 1 or whatever 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.630
 your channel made only a dollar in that 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.050
 month 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.000

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.250
