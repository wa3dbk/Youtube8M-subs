three four five six cards now in my hand
and<00:00:26.119> I<00:00:28.010> wanted<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.099> card<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.609> would<00:00:29.730> really

shoot<00:00:30.510> me<00:00:30.720> down<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.109> map<00:00:32.030> but<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.300> don't

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
shoot me down the map but I just don't

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.930 
shoot me down the map but I just don't
have<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:36.860> think<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.040> I'm<00:00:38.129> gonna<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.610> is

play this dig-in card that's gonna allow

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.340 
play this dig-in card that's gonna allow
me<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:44.270> move<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.539> area<00:00:47.840> I'm<00:00:48.840> gonna<00:00:48.989> put<00:00:49.200> myself

believe that his dig in card does give
him<00:02:34.260> one<00:02:34.859> extra<00:02:35.459> die<00:02:35.640> for<00:02:36.000> defense<00:02:36.359> but<00:02:38.480> this

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
him one extra die for defense but this

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.539 
him one extra die for defense but this

guy is crawling up out of the hole I

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.460

scar<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:53.060> let's<00:02:54.060> use<00:02:54.389> that<00:02:56.389> that's<00:02:57.389> gonna<00:02:57.569> take

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
scar so let's use that that's gonna take

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.379 
scar so let's use that that's gonna take
us<00:02:57.989> down<00:02:58.169> 1<00:02:58.530> 2<00:02:58.799> 3<00:02:58.970> 5<00:02:59.970> cards<00:03:01.639> so<00:03:02.639> we're<00:03:03.030> gonna<00:03:03.120> use

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
us down 1 2 3 5 cards so we're gonna use

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.369 
us down 1 2 3 5 cards so we're gonna use
the<00:03:03.599> guard<00:03:03.900> action<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:05.430> turn<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.480> shoot<00:03:07.049> at

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
the guard action to turn and shoot at

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:13.640 
the guard action to turn and shoot at
this<00:03:07.590> guy<00:03:07.829> as<00:03:08.189> he's<00:03:08.489> coming<00:03:08.819> up<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:12.500> weapon<00:03:13.500> of

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
this guy as he's coming up and weapon of

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.440 
this guy as he's coming up and weapon of
choice<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:14.250> guess<00:03:14.459> right<00:03:14.700> now<00:03:14.909> would<00:03:15.150> be<00:03:15.180> the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
choice I guess right now would be the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.699 
choice I guess right now would be the
assault<00:03:16.079> rifle<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:18.239> I'm<00:03:18.449> gonna<00:03:18.569> be<00:03:18.780> using<00:03:18.959> to

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
assault rifle so I'm gonna be using to

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:28.250 
assault rifle so I'm gonna be using to
attack<00:03:20.549> dice<00:03:22.819> against<00:03:25.639> one<00:03:26.639> die<00:03:26.970> or<00:03:27.449> defense

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
attack dice against one die or defense

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:37.520 
attack dice against one die or defense
for<00:03:29.129> the<00:03:29.340> drone<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:32.190> here<00:03:32.459> we<00:03:32.549> go<00:03:36.530> alright

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
for the drone so here we go alright

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.689 
for the drone so here we go alright
that's<00:03:37.799> canceled<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:39.349> got<00:03:40.349> one<00:03:40.680> wound<00:03:40.979> there

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
that's canceled I got one wound there

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.050 
that's canceled I got one wound there
so<00:03:42.389> we've<00:03:43.260> wounded<00:03:43.769> him<00:03:43.949> but<00:03:44.370> we<00:03:44.519> didn't<00:03:44.879> take

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
so we've wounded him but we didn't take

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.699 
so we've wounded him but we didn't take
him<00:03:45.239> out<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:47.220> let's<00:03:47.400> pick<00:03:47.609> up<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.879> wound<00:03:48.709> marker

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
him out so let's pick up a wound marker

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.670 
him out so let's pick up a wound marker
put<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.310> underneath<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.970> figure<00:03:51.389> to<00:03:52.229> indicate

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
put it underneath the figure to indicate

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.729 
put it underneath the figure to indicate
that<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:53.129> drone<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.699> wounded

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
that the drone is wounded

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.199 
that the drone is wounded
ok<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:55.979> think<00:03:56.220> I'm<00:03:56.519> gonna<00:03:56.669> let<00:03:56.909> a<00:03:57.769> coal<00:03:58.879> guard<00:03:59.879> on

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
ok I think I'm gonna let a coal guard on

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.659 
ok I think I'm gonna let a coal guard on
this<00:04:00.599> drone<00:04:03.260> coal<00:04:04.260> special<00:04:04.859> ability<00:04:05.310> says

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
this drone coal special ability says

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.119 
this drone coal special ability says
that<00:04:06.030> he<00:04:06.209> can<00:04:06.419> use<00:04:06.599> any<00:04:06.780> card<00:04:07.109> as<00:04:07.379> a<00:04:07.409> guard<00:04:07.769> card

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
that he can use any card as a guard card

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.599 
that he can use any card as a guard card
and<00:04:09.259> even<00:04:10.259> if<00:04:10.379> another<00:04:10.590> person<00:04:10.829> has<00:04:11.189> guarded

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
and even if another person has guarded

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.689 
and even if another person has guarded
this<00:04:11.790> turned<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:12.689> that's<00:04:12.870> really<00:04:13.049> neat<00:04:13.699> that's

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
this turned so that's really neat that's

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.370 
this turned so that's really neat that's
one<00:04:14.939> reason<00:04:15.150> why<00:04:15.419> I<00:04:15.449> brought<00:04:15.930> cold<00:04:16.889> along<00:04:17.699> I

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
one reason why I brought cold along I

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.259 
one reason why I brought cold along I
think<00:04:19.380> I'm<00:04:19.470> gonna<00:04:19.620> get<00:04:20.430> rid<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.639> this<00:04:20.820> forced

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
think I'm gonna get rid of this forced

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.330 
think I'm gonna get rid of this forced
entry<00:04:21.719> card

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.240 

and<00:04:25.840> we'll<00:04:26.840> let<00:04:26.960> him<00:04:27.170> take<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.470> shot<00:04:27.800> how<00:04:28.070> many

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
and we'll let him take a shot how many

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:36.790 
and we'll let him take a shot how many
spaces<00:04:28.730> do<00:04:29.090> we<00:04:29.210> have<00:04:29.480> one<00:04:29.810> two<00:04:30.170> three<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:36.380> only

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
spaces do we have one two three the only

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.110 
spaces do we have one two three the only
weapon<00:04:37.220> I<00:04:37.460> have<00:04:37.940> that<00:04:38.240> has<00:04:38.450> that<00:04:38.660> range<00:04:39.020> is<00:04:40.120> the

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
weapon I have that has that range is the

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.970 
weapon I have that has that range is the
pistol<00:04:41.740> it's<00:04:42.740> got<00:04:42.950> a<00:04:42.980> range<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.490> three<00:04:44.980> the

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
pistol it's got a range of three the

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.400 
pistol it's got a range of three the
assault<00:04:46.370> rifle<00:04:46.790> could<00:04:47.060> try<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:47.570> shoot<00:04:48.080> but

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
assault rifle could try to shoot but

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.320 
assault rifle could try to shoot but
because<00:04:48.800> he's<00:04:49.010> one<00:04:49.310> space<00:04:50.140> out<00:04:51.140> of<00:04:51.440> range<00:04:52.330> he

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
because he's one space out of range he

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.510 
because he's one space out of range he
would<00:04:53.720> get<00:04:53.840> an<00:04:53.960> extra<00:04:54.410> defense<00:04:54.800> die<00:04:55.130> so<00:04:55.490> I

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
would get an extra defense die so I

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.800 
would get an extra defense die so I
think<00:04:55.640> it's<00:04:55.940> kind<00:04:56.420> of<00:04:56.630> gonna<00:04:56.750> balance<00:04:58.390> so<00:04:59.390> let

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
think it's kind of gonna balance so let

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.000 
think it's kind of gonna balance so let
me<00:04:59.930> see<00:05:00.140> what<00:05:00.290> I<00:05:00.320> can<00:05:00.410> do<00:05:00.710> with<00:05:00.950> this<00:05:01.480> pistol<00:05:02.480> I

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
me see what I can do with this pistol I

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.910 
me see what I can do with this pistol I
don't<00:05:04.010> really<00:05:04.160> use<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.580> pistol<00:05:05.000> that<00:05:05.030> much

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
don't really use the pistol that much

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.890 
don't really use the pistol that much
but<00:05:06.920> it's<00:05:07.160> it's<00:05:07.550> really<00:05:07.880> gonna<00:05:08.240> come<00:05:08.360> down<00:05:08.570> to

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
but it's it's really gonna come down to

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.950 
but it's it's really gonna come down to
a<00:05:08.930> 1<00:05:09.260> in<00:05:09.380> 1<00:05:09.590> here<00:05:09.980> one<00:05:10.940> attack<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.570> one<00:05:11.780> that's

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
a 1 in 1 here one attack and one that's

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.770 
a 1 in 1 here one attack and one that's
inside<00:05:12.610> let's<00:05:13.610> see<00:05:13.790> what<00:05:13.940> we<00:05:14.030> can<00:05:14.180> do

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.800 

1<00:05:17.780> &amp;<00:05:18.200> 0<00:05:19.160> defense<00:05:19.760> I<00:05:20.330> think<00:05:20.450> we<00:05:20.780> got<00:05:20.960> him<00:05:22.690> he<00:05:23.690> only

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
1 &amp; 0 defense I think we got him he only

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.960 
1 &amp; 0 defense I think we got him he only
had<00:05:24.050> one<00:05:24.080> hit<00:05:24.560> point<00:05:24.800> left<00:05:25.100> so<00:05:25.430> this<00:05:25.640> drone<00:05:25.940> is

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
had one hit point left so this drone is

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.140 
had one hit point left so this drone is
killed<00:05:26.920> and<00:05:28.360> he<00:05:29.360> dropped<00:05:29.750> a<00:05:30.760> hammer<00:05:31.760> burst

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
killed and he dropped a hammer burst

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.120 
killed and he dropped a hammer burst
well<00:05:32.810> let's<00:05:32.960> let's<00:05:33.170> put<00:05:33.440> that<00:05:33.590> down

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.400 

very<00:05:37.130> good
