00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.420
 that is, I really really enjoy myself 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 too much I really hope not to become 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.380
 monotonous at home write apple trees without 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.360
 without problems and will continue to do them 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.029
 if anything, for myself it is enough for me 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.740
 amuses too much to do them however is below 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.960
 the last video of the broadcast on the bed 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.050
 comments that incited me 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.970
 particularly aa go I was there 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.489
 as soon as I read them or reacted 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.910
 kind of that certain scenes absolutely 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.800
 pathetic like that and therefore nothing 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.870
 I continue to do them, however, really 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.920
 if you bore me to write it under the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.020
 video is like saying ok I will take note of it and 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.899
 I will continue to do it for myself 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.629
 but maybe I avoid the weapons over you 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.410

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.780
