00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this sometimes is because the few spur

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.170 
this sometimes is because the few spur
has<00:01:00.300> been<00:01:00.480> accidentally<00:01:01.079> knocked<00:01:01.320> off<00:01:02.180> in

to<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> display<00:01:18.149> on<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> timer<00:01:19.130> being

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
to the display on the timer being

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.789 
to the display on the timer being
completely<00:01:20.610> blank<00:01:21.110> same<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> boiler

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
completely blank same with the boiler

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.499 
completely blank same with the boiler
now<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.860> may<00:01:26.130> not<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.970> done<00:01:27.270> this

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
now you may not know you have done this

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.990 
now you may not know you have done this
also<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.350> towels<00:01:28.860> will<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.880> this

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
also because towels will be up to this

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.380 
also because towels will be up to this
level<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.830> always<00:01:31.979> worth<00:01:32.159> finding<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
level so it's always worth finding the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.510 
level so it's always worth finding the
few<00:01:33.630> spur<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.770> making<00:01:34.979> sure<00:01:35.280> they've

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
few spur and just making sure they've

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.719 
few spur and just making sure they've
actually<00:01:35.759> turned<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:37.759> in<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.909> position<00:01:40.729> you

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
actually turned on in that position you

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.240 
actually turned on in that position you
might<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.210> simple<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:43.100> but<00:01:44.100> your

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
might be as simple as that but your

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.940 
might be as simple as that but your
displays<00:01:44.700> will<00:01:44.909> come<00:01:45.689> back<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.470> you'll

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
displays will come back on and you'll

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.510 
displays will come back on and you'll
have<00:01:47.130> heat<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.340> hot<00:01:47.579> water<00:01:47.820> again<00:01:49.159> these<00:01:50.159> few

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
have heat and hot water again these few

heat here we have it turned down below
10<00:02:35.580> degrees<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.200> heating<00:02:37.380> will<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:37.770> come

10 degrees so the heating will not come

10 degrees so the heating will not come
on<00:02:38.130> until<00:02:38.850> we've<00:02:38.970> turned<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.360> up<00:02:39.480> I'll<00:02:40.290> suggest

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
on until we've turned it up I'll suggest

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.170 
on until we've turned it up I'll suggest
initially<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.310> turn<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.580> all<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.730> way<00:02:41.850> up<00:02:42.060> to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
initially you turn it all the way up to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.540 
initially you turn it all the way up to
number<00:02:42.300> 30<00:02:42.660> on<00:02:43.530> wait<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.010> see<00:02:44.190> whether<00:02:44.370> your

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
number 30 on wait and see whether your

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.830 
number 30 on wait and see whether your
idea<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.060> start<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.450> heat<00:02:45.630> up

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
idea is start to heat up

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.590 
idea is start to heat up
I've<00:02:46.830> been<00:02:46.980> done<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:48.150> can<00:02:48.270> then<00:02:48.330> turn

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
I've been done that you can then turn

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.480 
I've been done that you can then turn
your<00:02:48.780> back<00:02:48.930> down<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.100> comfortable
