on my wrist here's the comparison of
size<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:54.659> the<00:05:54.689> ipod<00:05:55.680> nano<00:05:56.360> it's<00:05:57.360> really<00:05:57.899> about

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
size to the ipod nano it's really about

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.439 
size to the ipod nano it's really about
the<00:05:58.560> same<00:05:58.589> size<00:05:59.039> but<00:05:59.520> with<00:05:59.789> squared<00:06:00.149> corners

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
the same size but with squared corners

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.969 
the same size but with squared corners
around<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:01.110> so<00:06:01.349> it's<00:06:01.919> not<00:06:02.009> overly<00:06:02.370> that<00:06:02.939> big

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979

nighthawk<00:06:12.620> you<00:06:13.620> can<00:06:13.740> see<00:06:13.889> that's<00:06:14.069> about<00:06:14.310> the

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
nighthawk you can see that's about the

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:23.059 
nighthawk you can see that's about the
same<00:06:14.610> size<00:06:18.289> here<00:06:19.289> is<00:06:19.529> a<00:06:19.560> tag<00:06:20.069> a<00:06:21.949> little<00:06:22.949> bit

smaller

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.030 

now<00:06:28.810> I'll<00:06:28.990> be<00:06:29.140> ridiculous<00:06:29.650> and<00:06:29.770> I'll<00:06:29.830> go<00:06:29.980> ahead

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
now I'll be ridiculous and I'll go ahead

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:36.390 
now I'll be ridiculous and I'll go ahead
and<00:06:30.130> just<00:06:30.310> put<00:06:30.370> all<00:06:30.610> these<00:06:30.730> on<00:06:35.100> yes<00:06:36.100> this<00:06:36.370> looks

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
and just put all these on yes this looks

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.280 
and just put all these on yes this looks
ridiculous<00:06:37.150> but<00:06:37.330> this<00:06:37.510> shows<00:06:37.780> you<00:06:37.960> a<00:06:37.990> good

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
ridiculous but this shows you a good

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.260 
ridiculous but this shows you a good
size<00:06:38.560> comparison<00:06:39.280> of<00:06:39.490> the<00:06:39.730> ipod<00:06:40.120> nano<00:06:40.420> watch

wrist<00:06:50.580> I<00:06:51.580> think<00:06:52.540> the<00:06:52.600> ipod<00:06:52.870> nano<00:06:53.110> watch<00:06:53.350> is

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
wrist I think the ipod nano watch is

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.080 
wrist I think the ipod nano watch is
probably<00:06:53.920> the<00:06:54.010> most<00:06:54.190> comfortable<00:06:54.670> i<00:06:54.820> have<00:06:54.940> out

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
probably the most comfortable i have out

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.700 
probably the most comfortable i have out
of<00:06:55.210> these<00:06:55.330> it's<00:06:55.630> more<00:06:55.840> flexible<00:06:56.320> because<00:06:56.470> of

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
of these it's more flexible because of

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.190 
of these it's more flexible because of
the<00:06:56.770> silicone<00:06:57.220> band<00:06:57.520> and<00:06:57.880> actually<00:06:58.660> molds<00:06:59.050> to

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.200 
the silicone band and actually molds to
