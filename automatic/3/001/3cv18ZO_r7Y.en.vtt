00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 in continuation 61 75 love of 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.870
 father these missions are unlocked 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.320
 after the mission gathering the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.110
 family after these missions are going to 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.929
 call both tracy and both james good 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.190
 well this is the order is random or 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.789
 either it can be fast it can be very late 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.419
 it's money 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.419
 and there is more 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.240
 Oh 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.240
 it's so small 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
 hewitt 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.930
 today luxor 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.970
 well here you can accept or you can deny 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.390
 the help to tracy or is it optional and 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.780
 It also does not ask you 100% requirement or 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.050
 it is an optional family mission but 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.420
 it's good that you do it for good 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.759
 come together and reconcile with the children of 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.210
 michael would be cool, good as 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:13.979
 we were far be called a taxi 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.090
 to get faster faster, good 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.579
 realize that it is too far 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.520
 so I'm going to put as destiny a 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.700
 little bit more more a little bit away from the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.149
 main location 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:33.810
 well there comes the taxi and let's see what 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.810
 problems has tracing with this subject 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.410
 well let's go to him as I say you can 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.890
 choose the same tracy sign or choose 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.920
 another destination by car and has 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.020
 delayed too much time and it would be a 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:54.340
 little boring also travel so much 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.880
 well then let the taxis have 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.740
 Mexican music and if the saints 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 efe in good before you leave taxi 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.390
 I'm going to grab the taxi to go up 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.340
 well I think this was unnecessary 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.280
 do it I'm going to change the radius this 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.390
 I think it was unnecessary to do it because 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.610
 we have to get on the tracy vehicle 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.950
 there is your vehicle 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.220
 we have to get into tracy's car and 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.070
 let's find this guy 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.650
 good hawaiian is not like first destination 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:41.920
 that is here very close to this mission is 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.920
 simple recontra is very very easy 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.410
 not only is doing a small 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.920
 persecution and all that but it 's very very 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.150
 easy 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.420
 well we hope the guy apparently where 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.400
 it is not there there is nothing we have to go 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.410
 to another place we have to go to a 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.640
 motel 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.270
 and see if these subjects are hiding very 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.270
 Quick 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.310
 arrives here tells us how he has 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.220
 known and all that good we are here 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.220
 in the destination what we have to see if 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.100
 it's around here observe racing 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.920
 and we are not going to go to the cusco level of 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.130
 rockford pleasure let's see if there is 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.610
 find in this good guy that is 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.610
 very close 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.770
 and there is nothing either 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.459
 we have to go to another rock destination 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.140
 yes he has his own thing 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.020
 and well after what happened with the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:59.810
 'low and everyone knew well since it was activated 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:03.480
 a true red dot that is the stalker 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.670
 it's just back 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.860
 he has a pimp car apparently 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.470
 dead 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.440
 and then it has been removed we have removed 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.170
 well this to eliminate it was optional 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.959
 you could also simply subtract 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.639
 stop it but nothing like it happens 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.620
 way is fine 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.629
 we listen to the talk they are going to have 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.629
 them two by the death of the subject 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.290
 baby 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:09.509
 you have to believe in love in showmatch 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.970
 my all 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.840
 well here ends the mission with 50 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.380
 spaces and simple we have rescued 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.690
 well we have saved resides his stalker 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.830
 well then in this way I would already be 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.440
 concluding this mission on account 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.690
 It's very simple and they did not ask you for a 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.710
 requirement for 100% good up here 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.180
 that this video we see in the next 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.180
