00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.820 
giving it a little bit more of a neck
because<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.110> want<00:02:25.350> an<00:02:25.440> area<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:25.950> able<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.220> cut

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
because I want an area to be able to cut

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.310 
because I want an area to be able to cut
and<00:02:28.830> I'm<00:02:28.950> going<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.220> start<00:02:29.460> cooling<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:30.320> I

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
and I'm going to start cooling it as I

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.790 
and I'm going to start cooling it as I
shape<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.830> little<00:02:32.010> bit<00:02:36.380> it's<00:02:37.380> all<00:02:37.650> on

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
shape it a little bit it's all on

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.650 
shape it a little bit it's all on
getting<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.250> isomalt<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.210> perfect

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
getting that isomalt to the perfect

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.880 
getting that isomalt to the perfect
consistency<00:02:39.900> as<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:41.040> are<00:02:41.300> needing<00:02:42.300> it

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
consistency as you are needing it

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.360 
consistency as you are needing it
otherwise<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:45.480> could<00:02:45.660> end<00:02:45.840> up<00:02:46.050> with<00:02:46.260> spots<00:02:47.190> on

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
otherwise you could end up with spots on

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.440 
otherwise you could end up with spots on
it<00:02:47.550> if<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.300> can<00:02:48.480> see<00:02:48.660> here<00:02:49.640> we<00:02:50.640> are<00:02:50.670> actually<00:02:51.060> a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
it if you can see here we are actually a

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.910 
it if you can see here we are actually a
darker<00:02:51.959> color<00:02:52.200> as<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.740> turn<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.459> gets<00:02:53.670> lighter

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
darker color as I turn it gets lighter

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.980 
darker color as I turn it gets lighter
and<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.280> would<00:02:56.400> actually<00:02:56.810> could<00:02:57.810> cause

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
and so that would actually could cause

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.670 
and so that would actually could cause
troubles<00:02:58.410> down<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.650> line<00:03:03.260> I'm<00:03:04.260> not<00:03:04.320> actually

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
troubles down the line I'm not actually

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.740 
troubles down the line I'm not actually
pumping<00:03:05.340> any<00:03:05.490> more<00:03:05.730> air<00:03:05.940> into<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.390> I'm<00:03:06.570> just

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
pumping any more air into it I'm just

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.690 
pumping any more air into it I'm just
holding<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.440> air<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.220> doesn't<00:03:08.550> come

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
holding the air so that it doesn't come

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.220 
holding the air so that it doesn't come
back<00:03:08.760> up<00:03:09.090> my<00:03:09.270> tube<00:03:09.510> as<00:03:09.660> I'm<00:03:10.320> cooling<00:03:10.709> it

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.880 

getting<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:18.110> some<00:03:19.110> people<00:03:19.380> like<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.560> use

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
getting there some people like to use

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.030 
getting there some people like to use
their<00:03:20.370> arm<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.940> test<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.140> find<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.860> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
their arm to test it I find that the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.640 
their arm to test it I find that the
cheek<00:03:23.330> will<00:03:24.330> always<00:03:24.660> let<00:03:24.840> me<00:03:24.959> know<00:03:24.989> whether

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
cheek will always let me know whether

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.770 
cheek will always let me know whether
it's<00:03:25.890> too<00:03:26.100> hot<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:27.030> know<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.209> don't<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.630> any

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
what it would look like if I blew it

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.010 
what it would look like if I blew it
really<00:04:51.910> thin<00:04:53.190> not<00:04:54.190> so<00:04:54.430> pretty<00:04:54.639> and<00:04:55.360> why<00:04:55.930> don't

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
they do if it's too thin it will always

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.080 
they do if it's too thin it will always
break<00:05:02.500> so<00:05:02.800> if<00:05:02.919> you<00:05:03.039> try<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.370> build<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.729> snowman
