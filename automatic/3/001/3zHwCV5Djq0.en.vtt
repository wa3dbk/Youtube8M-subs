there's a power slot there that's

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.170 
there's a power slot there that's
basically<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.260> back<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:41.100> VGA<00:03:41.490> and<00:03:41.520> HDMI<00:03:41.790> is

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
basically the back so VGA and HDMI is

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.630 
basically the back so VGA and HDMI is
your<00:03:42.300> only<00:03:42.450> connectivity<00:03:43.200> if<00:03:43.710> used<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.040> stuff

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
your only connectivity if used is stuff

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.140 
your only connectivity if used is stuff
like<00:03:44.730> DVI<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.390> then<00:03:45.480> maybe<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:47.640> may<00:03:47.820> put<00:03:48.120> you

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
like DVI and then maybe that may put you

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.590 
like DVI and then maybe that may put you
off<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.360> bit<00:03:48.600> but<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.900> looks<00:03:49.080> really<00:03:49.290> cool

messing<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.639> settings<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.300> weren't

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
messing the settings I just weren't

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.749 
messing the settings I just weren't
happy<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.259> was<00:04:31.380> too<00:04:31.590> wide<00:04:32.100> were<00:04:32.460> whitewashed

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
happy it was too wide were whitewashed

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.510 
happy it was too wide were whitewashed
and<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:34.080> still<00:04:34.410> feel<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:34.740> there<00:04:35.250> could<00:04:35.490> be

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
and I still feel that there could be

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.129 
and I still feel that there could be
more<00:04:35.759> color<00:04:36.060> in<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.300> screen<00:04:36.509> I<00:04:36.539> do<00:04:36.660> feel<00:04:36.990> it's

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
more color in the screen I do feel it's

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.749 
more color in the screen I do feel it's
still<00:04:37.259> a<00:04:37.500> bit<00:04:37.919> too

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
still a bit too

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.300 
still a bit too
as<00:04:39.449> I<00:04:39.600> said<00:04:39.810> whitewash<00:04:40.320> it's<00:04:40.590> hard<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.949> explain

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
as I said whitewash it's hard to explain

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.029 
as I said whitewash it's hard to explain
in<00:04:41.669> a<00:04:41.729> way<00:04:41.759> but<00:04:42.509> it<00:04:42.660> just<00:04:42.810> white<00:04:43.229> balance<00:04:43.740> out

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
in a way but it just white balance out

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.260
