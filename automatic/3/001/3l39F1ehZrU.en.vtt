00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:26.289
 rise we will move away with a sandpaper 80 it 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.410

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:36.210
 is very important and that you have a lot in 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.210
 remote account very well because I do not know 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.780
 when the leg falls 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.590

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.829
 although feel the girlfriends 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.960
 to what degree do you have to fix it 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.229
 the phase to the future 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.229
 and the dimension also of the league 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.229
 made 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.390
 ready let's choose 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.140
 now we are going to load a portion of 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.390
 pasta and here we have it 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.390
 with a trickle of catalyst 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.010
 ship you are a minimum amount 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.350
 these very small amounts 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.350
 low 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.470
 to beat it 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.659
 ah 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.440
 low 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.440
 ah 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.930
 We have already beaten and apologize for the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.220
 delay 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.690
 already has a uniform color already 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.710
 we can apply it 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.710
 let's apply it 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.450
 very good how easy is this 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.290
 ready 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.040
 they were observed to see how 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.360
 it widened 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:50.240
 He looked very small 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.240
 the detail but if they are fixed as not 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.020
 and this and stay 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.710
 and ready 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.720
 and there it is 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.960
 to give you this work that we are 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.960
 showing 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.310
 a slight detail but you have to see it 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.910
 the shape 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.520
 that 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.250
 the application that you put 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.460
 you have to stay in these details in 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.130
 the first 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.910
 so that no other pasta enzymes for 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.910
 that you do not look bad 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.780
 and then this 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.350
 I hope this part works for you already 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.540
 nothing else is sanding that would be what they go 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.220
 to do if they already have a little more 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.870
 knowledge they will know what they can do 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.870
 and I hope you like this video 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.120
 right now the weather is very cold we will 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.340
 take a long time 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.010
 that would be my daughter 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.180
 then this is the video name and 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:17.900
 then we will show you how to remove 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.830
 excess paste and sanding ok 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.940
 I hope this part works for you and we 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.940
 we see until the next
