hi<00:00:00.599> there<00:00:00.840> welcome<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:01.890> origami<00:00:02.280> design

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
hi there welcome to this origami design

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.019 
hi there welcome to this origami design
tutorial<00:00:03.179> we'll<00:00:03.360> be<00:00:03.540> talking<00:00:03.750> about<00:00:03.959> anchors

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
tutorial we'll be talking about anchors

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.280 
tutorial we'll be talking about anchors
there's<00:00:06.029> two<00:00:06.330> ways<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.569> can<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:06.930> your<00:00:07.049> page

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
there's two ways you can have your page

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.400 
there's two ways you can have your page
behave<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:08.340> can<00:00:08.580> either<00:00:08.670> move<00:00:09.269> freely<00:00:10.019> and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
behave it can either move freely and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.140 
behave it can either move freely and
smoothly<00:00:11.010> when<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.519> scroll<00:00:11.759> up<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.090> down

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
smoothly when you scroll up and down

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.860 
smoothly when you scroll up and down
like<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.900> page<00:00:13.549> or<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.179> snap

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
like this page or you can have it snap

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.189 
like this page or you can have it snap
by<00:00:16.529> putting<00:00:16.949> anchors<00:00:17.609> at<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> end<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.960> each

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
by putting anchors at the end of each

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.130 
by putting anchors at the end of each
page<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.949> every<00:00:20.340> time<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.580> go<00:00:20.789> down<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.270> snaps<00:00:21.840> to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
page so every time I go down it snaps to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.339 
page so every time I go down it snaps to
an<00:00:22.230> anchor<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.490> same<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.060> go<00:00:24.180> up<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:25.279> do<00:00:26.279> this

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
an anchor the same if I go up to do this

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.750 
an anchor the same if I go up to do this
you<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> origami<00:00:28.859> design<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.580> go<00:00:29.699> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
you go to origami design you go to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.690 
you go to origami design you go to
insert<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.929> choose<00:00:31.170> anchor<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.430> actor

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
insert and you choose anchor the actor

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.220 
insert and you choose anchor the actor
will<00:00:32.790> lay<00:00:32.969> itself<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> right-hand<00:00:34.140> side

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
will lay itself on the right-hand side

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.810 
will lay itself on the right-hand side
of<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.500> screen<00:00:34.620> where<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.190> drag<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
of your screen where you can drag it to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.660 
of your screen where you can drag it to
wherever<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.270> want<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.860> if<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.950> set<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.309> here

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
wherever you want it if I set this here

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.569 
wherever you want it if I set this here
at<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> bottom<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.690> page<00:00:40.219> and<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.340> turn

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
at the bottom of this page and I turn

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.869 
at the bottom of this page and I turn
this<00:00:41.790> paid<00:00:42.690> from<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.989> one<00:00:43.290> page<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> two<00:00:44.550> page

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
this paid from a one page to a two page

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.310 
this paid from a one page to a two page
length<00:00:46.340> this<00:00:47.340> page<00:00:47.700> will<00:00:48.030> snap<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> this

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
length this page will snap to this

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.639 
length this page will snap to this
anchor<00:00:49.739> every<00:00:50.160> single<00:00:50.430> time<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.820> go<00:00:51.000> up<00:00:51.649> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
anchor every single time I go up and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.479 
anchor every single time I go up and
down<00:00:53.449> now<00:00:54.449> there's<00:00:54.840> two<00:00:55.079> ways<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.680> handle

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
down now there's two ways you can handle

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.010 
down now there's two ways you can handle
an<00:00:56.550> anchor<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.030> either<00:00:57.120> set<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.719> snap

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
an anchor you can either set this snap

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.290 
an anchor you can either set this snap
which<00:00:58.859> gives<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> behavior<00:00:59.699> I'll<00:01:00.030> just

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
which gives it the behavior I'll just

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
which gives it the behavior I'll just
talked<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.760> you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:03.449> also<00:01:03.600> set<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.379> free

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
talked about you can also set it to free

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.240 
talked about you can also set it to free
if<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> set<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.360> free<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.290> will<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.650> snap<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
if you set it free you will not snap the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.310 
if you set it free you will not snap the
angle<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:08.700> anchor<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.600> pass<00:01:10.020> it

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
angle or anchor you will just pass it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
angle or anchor you will just pass it
and<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> will<00:01:10.890> keep<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.549> scrolling<00:01:12.360> smooth

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and it will keep the scrolling smooth

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.100 
and it will keep the scrolling smooth
motion<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.909> reason<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.570> three

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
motion and the reason we have three

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.100 
motion and the reason we have three
anchors<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.189> want<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.580> trigger

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
anchors is if you want to trigger

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.960 
anchors is if you want to trigger
something<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> exact<00:01:20.280> moment<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.759> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
something at the exact moment when you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.170 
something at the exact moment when you
pass<00:01:21.740> this<00:01:22.740> point<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.850> make<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.119> happen

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
pass this point you can make that happen

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.570 
pass this point you can make that happen
with<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> free<00:01:24.869> anchor<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.890> also<00:01:26.009> set<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
with a free anchor you can also set a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.300 
with a free anchor you can also set a
trigger<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.270> says<00:01:28.009> go<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.689> this<00:01:30.689> anchor<00:01:31.310> so

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
trigger that says go to this anchor so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.550 
trigger that says go to this anchor so
if<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> free<00:01:32.850> anchor<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.049> want

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
if you have a free anchor and you want

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.530 
if you have a free anchor and you want
to<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> mark<00:01:35.640> somewhere<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.329> your

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
to you know a mark somewhere in your

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.749 
to you know a mark somewhere in your
design<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> button<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.369> tap<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
design and have a button you can tap to

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.950 
design and have a button you can tap to
go<00:01:38.909> there<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.509> use<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.869> functionality

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
go there you can use this functionality

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.319 
go there you can use this functionality
which<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.829> also<00:01:43.950> put<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.460> triggers<00:01:45.060> on

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
which you can also put the triggers on

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.010 
which you can also put the triggers on
anchors<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:46.799> here<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.630> when<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> go

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
anchors as you can see here so when I go

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.670 
anchors as you can see here so when I go
and<00:01:49.320> pass<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.520> free<00:01:51.149> anchor<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.290> fire<00:01:52.649> off

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and pass this free anchor I can fire off

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.959 
and pass this free anchor I can fire off
a<00:01:53.130> career<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.799> put<00:01:55.950> trigger<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.369> pages

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
a career you can put trigger on pages

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.539 
a career you can put trigger on pages
