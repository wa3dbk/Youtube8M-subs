any<00:02:06.030> longer<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.440> it<00:02:07.590> was

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
any longer but it's I know it was

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.199 
any longer but it's I know it was
emotional<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.190> me<00:02:08.399> i<00:02:08.459> know<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.700> emotional<00:02:09.179> for

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
emotional for me i know is emotional for

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.940 
emotional for me i know is emotional for
Brett<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.019> for<00:02:10.170> most<00:02:10.319> people<00:02:10.769> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
Brett as it is for most people and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.699 
Brett as it is for most people and
that's<00:02:11.550> why<00:02:11.730> i<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.269> tug<00:02:13.050> will<00:02:13.530> be

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.229 
that's why i think the the tug will be
there<00:02:13.920> for<00:02:14.160> him<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> maybe<00:02:14.610> want<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.910> come<00:02:15.090> back
