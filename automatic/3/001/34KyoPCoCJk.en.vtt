00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.889
 today it's about this funny stuff 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:14.009
 this is packing material like it is at 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.130
 many packages in it is like that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.980
 ordered and I want you today 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.390
 show what we can do with it and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.199
 Although I'm the first set aside her 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:34.320
 Does that know if you 're a hobby photographer 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:36.660
 is and you want to make a recording 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.149
 a macro for example now from the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.350
 Zipper you have the camera very much 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.190
 Keep calm you need a little one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.719
 Tripod somehow around this high 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.510
 compensate for differences and the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.850
 camera must be kept quiet 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:56.420
 and there are so-called housing sacks 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:03.030
 and I just thought of it now 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:06.299
 I have a piece of imitation leather over and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.770
 completely with this so first 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.430
 I'll take your bag outside then 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.659
 I feel that comes with these flakes 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.960
 up here then the zipper 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.950
 afterwards, and then I have 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.869
 finished a fountain bag and can for 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.790
 Take an example here now 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.590
 and you will surely become one now 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.500
 ask, yes, but why should so long the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.650
 is the next tip that makes 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.610
 yes I'll say about 30 cm long about 25 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.729
 30 cm long then you do not always have one 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.710
 short lens of the camera 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:54.990
 if you look at the cameras 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:58.830
 set to take a picture then 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.250
 it works and it is 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.900
 wonderful and fast made lasts 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.869
 Not ten minutes and you have something like that 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.190
 finished and through these bells now 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.720
 they really weigh nothing 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.950
 The sack as such is also light 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.040
 really featherweight and so can 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.080
 conveniently stored in a photo bag 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.440
 You can always take with you and that 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.630
 is done so fast so tinkers 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.030
 if you like 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.950
 I wish you a lot of fun with it and 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.250
