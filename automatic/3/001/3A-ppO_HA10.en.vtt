00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.450 
so I kind of sucks and also at the way
his<00:02:16.390> hands<00:02:16.750> are<00:02:16.930> sculpted<00:02:17.350> it's<00:02:17.590> really<00:02:18.250> hard

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
his hands are sculpted it's really hard

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.430 
his hands are sculpted it's really hard
for<00:02:18.610> him<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.880> hold<00:02:19.060> his<00:02:19.120> lightsaber<00:02:19.569> so<00:02:20.319> that

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
for him to hold his lightsaber so that

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.280 
for him to hold his lightsaber so that
kind<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.680> sucks<00:02:21.480> but<00:02:22.480> there's<00:02:22.960> not<00:02:23.110> much

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
kind of sucks but there's not much

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.050 
kind of sucks but there's not much
really<00:02:23.560> too<00:02:23.710> long<00:02:23.860> as<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.160> can<00:02:24.340> see<00:02:24.520> it's<00:02:24.850> just

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
really too long as you can see it's just

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.380 
really too long as you can see it's just
here<00:02:25.240> black<00:02:25.870> little<00:02:26.380> plain<00:02:26.740> figure<00:02:27.310> here<00:02:28.000> but

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
here black little plain figure here but

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.420 
here black little plain figure here but
you<00:02:28.750> can<00:02:28.959> see<00:02:29.200> they're<00:02:29.379> kind<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:29.950> see<00:02:30.099> his<00:02:30.190> face

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
you can see they're kind of see his face

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.059 
you can see they're kind of see his face
and<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:31.390> can<00:02:31.629> get<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.110> take<00:02:32.319> off<00:02:32.500> but<00:02:32.769> I'm<00:02:33.040> not

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
and you can get to take off but I'm not

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.260 
and you can get to take off but I'm not
going<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.370> do<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.549> right<00:02:33.730> now

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
going to do that right now

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.080 
going to do that right now
so<00:02:35.170> I'm<00:02:35.410> gonna<00:02:35.530> give<00:02:35.710> him<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.980> 3.5<00:02:36.730> out<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.030> 5

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
so I'm gonna give him a 3.5 out of 5

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.170 
so I'm gonna give him a 3.5 out of 5
just<00:02:38.050> because<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.500> he<00:02:39.280> can't<00:02:39.550> stand<00:02:39.790> up<00:02:40.000> this

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
just because the he can't stand up this

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.840 
just because the he can't stand up this
up<00:02:40.390> which<00:02:41.200> really<00:02:41.230> sucks<00:02:41.740> and<00:02:42.040> it's<00:02:42.670> not

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
up which really sucks and it's not

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.330 
up which really sucks and it's not
really<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.210> much<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.570> a<00:02:43.750> needed<00:02:44.050> figures

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
really that much of a needed figures

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.380 
really that much of a needed figures
since<00:02:45.340> there's<00:02:45.520> not<00:02:45.670> really<00:02:45.850> much<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.120> him

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
since there's not really much of him

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.610 
since there's not really much of him
shown<00:02:46.660> in<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.960> :<00:02:47.230> horns

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
shown in the : horns

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.580 
shown in the : horns
I<00:02:47.650> mean<00:02:48.010> maybe<00:02:48.430> every<00:02:48.910> eight<00:02:49.780> episodes<00:02:50.410> or

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
I mean maybe every eight episodes or

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.720 
I mean maybe every eight episodes or
something<00:02:50.860> like<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.190> don't<00:02:51.400> show<00:02:51.610> them

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
something like that I don't show them

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.970 
something like that I don't show them
like<00:02:52.690> mention<00:02:53.350> him<00:02:53.500> or<00:02:53.620> something<00:02:53.860> like<00:02:53.920> that

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
like mention him or something like that

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.150 
like mention him or something like that
so<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.900> pretty<00:02:55.990> much<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:56.650> guy<00:02:56.860> and

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
so it's pretty much it to this guy and

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.150 
so it's pretty much it to this guy and
I'll<00:02:58.000> see<00:02:58.210> you<00:02:58.330> guys<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.930> next<00:02:59.080> review
