00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello and welcome I am 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.060
 old ex and in this video I show 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.589
 you like her high quality 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.130
 space makes and which means here too 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.130
 needed 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.560
 if you just watch this video so 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.619
 probably megabau no own network 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.689
 player on the ju on the playstation 4 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.330
 or to do it on the xbox 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.190
 The procedure I am relatively equal 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.129
 That's why I show you the whole 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.900
 building on the mio as the first time the 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.019
 basic question what equipment 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.400
 you need a computer 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:49.750
 or laptop the elgato game capture hd 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.239
 a console a tv as well 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.730
 headset or in-stall microphone 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.489
 the gamepads ag vl card requires her 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.410
 that's why it's the picture of yours 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.300
 TV also your computer or 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.239
 could transfer laptop and that 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.160
 Of course in the finest quality what would have 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.800
 I can talk to the microphones 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.050
 warmly the pigs 22 from turtle beach 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.600
 recommend because this super easy too 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.850
 service is and a really good quality 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.490
 with alternative I recommend 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.170
 you the microphone of yeti all 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.330
 products that I experienced and 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.250
 I'll postpone laying down in the 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.170
 So please have a look at the description 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.880
 if you have all the equipment together 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.800
 we can already get started 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.780
 start with the wiring to us 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.130
 as must be plugged into each other 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.030
 at this point it should be short 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.679
 to note that showed york third the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.979
 Conveniently bring all cables 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.619
 closes the hdmi video review on the one hand 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.470
 in the review console itself as well as in 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.099
 the agathe game capture that 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.110
 supplied hdmi cable from elgato 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:55.810
 you close on the other side the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.929
 game capture as well as with the other 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.090
 end to your television to the end 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.330
 you think the usb cable indie game 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.390
 capture as well as in your computer 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.360
 now only that would be missing or that 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.690
 microphone closes in my case the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.120
 turtle beach to the inline amplifier am 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.390
 You will find the end of the inline amplifier 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.000
 the jack and a usb port the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.980
 jack itself comes in the tv and 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.980
 the USB connection to your computer 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.209
 finished with a beach microphone easy 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.549
 Plug the USB cable into the computer 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.019
 for closing the interface has from the 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.879
 game capture ag 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.519
 how exactly that is adjusted and 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.709
 works so the first look betrays 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.420
 already that the interface is very very 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.670
 clean, we click on 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.950
 settings we can adjust what you want 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.930
 input device we have from the video up 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.379
 to represent xbox wallace 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.480
 hde no circumstances component for the 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.659
 players who do not play on the wii 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.930
 on the review then of course, too 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.359
 still the profile of hd 720 to 10 80 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.340
 quality come on over change and then 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.810
 is it already the picture here have 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.480
 we different regulators the the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.639
 brightness contrast color saturation change 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.650
 in the audiobereich you can also again 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.720
 make some settings profile 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.920
 or I do not have it extended 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.720
 you do not necessarily need busy work 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.849
 and if necessary came to the standard 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.769
 restore everything is right 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.319
 set you can already see the 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.049
 home screen in my case the 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.220
 Review transmitted directly from 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.230
 TV screen on the program above 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.790
 we can do a cinema because the tool 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.079
 make same notions case 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.660
 we forgot something 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.930
 At the play tower we can only fix and 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.389
 the decibel number changes below 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.209
 live commentary selects your headset 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:52.870
 or how comfort is important 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.030
 turn on the whole field so 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.709
 that it only turns green then 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.230
 active and you can there as well 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.000
 volume control in live streaming 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.519
 you can also go directly to 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.010
 twitter for example stream here 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.660
 just set everything 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.250

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.590

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.859
 the red button and it goes straight to 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.370

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:21.070

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.530

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.620
