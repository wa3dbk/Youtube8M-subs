00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.640
 his doubts his best and today 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.220
 I make this video for you 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.000
 to show a rather fun glitch on 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.830
 Minecraft 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.100
 so I will try to send to 8 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.439
 each en I hope they will accept 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.870
 so this is first of all what is it 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.210
 that it's the bug it's just 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.730
 a bug that involves blowing up 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.269
 cubes on stairs in fact there 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.120
 always bounces what happens here 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.400
 I drop cubes and that's when 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.379
 you see it bounces by crazy I find 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.729
 it's rather fun so it 's not very 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.040
 useful but it's still worth doing 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.870
 because I find these expensive so 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.210
 as you see I have done several 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.540
 find biscaye and smaller ones 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.400
 bigger in this wooden trash can 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.839
 all of them so that will work you with 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.150
 any stairs long that 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.970
 it is a staircase and its height 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.939
 any length 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.580
 here I show you on it you can 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.210
 access everywhere 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.210
 so that can stop here or even 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.230
 it happens so far we can 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.580
 and i also show you at ba2 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.770
 on this enstone alliance disk so 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.540
 as you can see I did not do any 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.510
 corner the ring that it is to show that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.710
 it really works and even like that 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.870
 do not have to hit here 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.790
 I think it's prettier 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.590
 but you do not have to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.190
 put designated just as long as 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.390
 that's so without doing anything so bah 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.420
 it's all that's easy 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.430
 must move cubes and can still 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.860
 stairs it can be pregnant history 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.660
 in brick in still google sends and where 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.720
 I immediately started with 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.770
 aulas brick i made a mini stuff 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.170
 to show that it was not working and there 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.040
 you just have to throw anybody 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.040
 calculation so that's bulli essarts like 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.290
 you see so I advise you to 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:18.420
 throw you rather to the middle so 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.300
 here up to the paz on the ubs at the fossa a 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.880
 tendency to lock on the sides 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.760
 no actually it does not work at all m 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.410
 so basically he knew how to do it really 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.400
 sure on this part there is see you 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.770
 see that we do in any case 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.780
 so here I hope you'll have but 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.280
 skeptical nietzsche I still remember 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.739
 once it's not very useful but 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.489
 it's rather bland his business in all 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.270
 case 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.510
 so here we go 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.430
 so I wanted on this video and I 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.430
 tell you soon and
