00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.190
 Please get in the ride is on 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.470
 still seats available 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.059
 yes that is unfortunately no roller coaster too 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.040
 I would wish it too 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.200
 but our tactic is turning today 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.780
 around the topic and we want from 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.820
 you know what kind of forces are working 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.289
 after the train and why you fall at the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.869
 not looping down we have 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:34.980
 Asked now there may be that her husband 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:37.260
 is that a lame tech tech tv too 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.059
 Guest at the Freihof Gymnasium GÃ¶ppingen 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.120
 what do the students know about the subject? 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.520
 roller coaster 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.449
 come on the roller coaster come for example 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.850
 the g-forces of kinetic energy 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.710
 braking energy and accelerating power 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.480
 is bewegungs cook so I think the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.399
 love must and one or blasted along 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.930
 water then what does not work out 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.129
 there's the kinetic again 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.710
 energy when you go forward and 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.540
 of course also to the outside and I believe 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.369
 the force is called centrifugal force in the 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.880
 Roller coaster there is the centrifugal force and the 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.500
 Gravity that is centrifugal but 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.770
 only a sparkle actually that 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.030
 contrary the centrifugal force now has 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.460
 also what to do with the flies on it 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.590
 why you drop a looping 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.610
 not allowing one to looping after that 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.070
 is flung outwards 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.850
 centered capital force so outward 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.630
 drawn 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.960
 yes because you force through the rotation 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.300
 I believe is pushed outward and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.310
 thus in the railway Rhine the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.159
 earth attraction that is a yes me 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.600
 always down but when in the 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.220
 practically thought over and still 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.479
 is pushed outwards 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.550
 and then you can not get it down 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.640
 you can fall out sometime when the 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.860
 train too slow as a roller coaster in the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.929
 there is still the looping 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.239
 Centrifugal forces which almost press the 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.770
 roller coasters against the looping so that the 

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.780
 not crashes but there are still 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.190
 precautions for under the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.190
 so that the rail is not supported 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.679
 yes love tech tv fans I stand here 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.729
 again in the big auditorium 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.319
 experimental physics not with professor 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.900
 denninger and I stop here sometimes 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.750
 the big lecture for the beginners in 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.300
 physics and you kind of beginner ago 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.220
 let and also for engineers 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.430
 we deal with the topic of 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.900
 today's broadcast namely the movement in 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.030
 a roller coaster 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.300
 this is a typical example of 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.390
 Introduction to mechanics and us 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.730
 want us today with the forces in 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.790
 employing a roller coaster 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.640
 and then explain how it works in one 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.480
 choose looping which forces would 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.000
 because now in roller coasters actually 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.200
 only two very fundamental forces the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.370
 a force is gravity 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.890
 gravitational force with which they call and 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.260
 She sees all objects with one 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.840
 uniform acceleration direction 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.519
 Earth center why do we fall 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.120
 then not just through the floor 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.829
 there because there is a second force 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.980
 namely the electromagnetic force the 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:17.090
 holding everything together what is matter 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.030
 the floor metals our body and 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.310
 this force ensures that we are stuck 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.269
 On the floor we feel the in 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.370
 our legs 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.430
 we would feel that if we were there 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.370
 sit and these forces are now in 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.670
 skilfully used a roller coaster 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.850
 through the rails guidance eg by 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.730
 turns and thereby the centrifugal force 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.190
 the outside feels much stronger 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.019
 it can be as the earth attraction it 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.489
 also gives a looping that it is in 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.590
 essentially a vertical one 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.959
 seemed circle there , the forces act 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.500
 to the outside and I explain that to you 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.570
 now a looping in a roller coaster 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.540
 is essentially a vertical one 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.549
 standing rails circle serving 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.299
 that you are in the truest sense of the word 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.430
 Word turns over a looping gets along 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.680
 a relatively high speed 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.710
 drive through it so you at the highest 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.890
 do not place 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.510
 but you fall down with high 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.950
 speed in this circle in 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.170
 loses speed is on top 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.710
 slowest will be accelerated again and 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:29.310
 how fast do you have to go to the 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.440
 highest point of looping is that 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.170
 It is relatively easy to use centrifugal force 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.060
 divided the speed square 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.370
 through the radius of the circle I have 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.130
 very simple numbers taken at ten 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.020
 meter circle radius and one 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.260
 speed of ten meters per 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.200
 seconds you get just one 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.040
 acceleration of earth acceleration 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.420
 corresponds and you have to be with about 36 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.730
 kilometers up here 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.120
 so you do not fall off 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.600
 in a circle then enters one below 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.000
 very high acceleration on the up to 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.430
 six times the earth acceleration 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.680
 For this example that is too much 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.810
 so that you can make such simple circles 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.810
 not more than loopings these days 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.580
 One uses the above 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.300
 are much stronger crowned 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.730
 below 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.900
 pay attention to your next 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.690
 roller coaster ride once on the exact 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.680
 form of this loopings and now want 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.680
 we'll show it in an experiment 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.800
 This is a model of a roller coaster with 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.330
 a steep section after the lift bar 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.130
 steep section serves enough 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.590
 to get speed and if 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.480
 now the carts enough 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.910
 you can have the speed 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:51.330
 looping through will show that 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:53.130
 but now, if the dare 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.800
 do not have enough speed 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.500
 so we start too deep then we will 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.900
 the following happen 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.280
 one falls out of the looping and 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.670
 this should be done in a correct way 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.800
 roller coaster never happen 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.690
 and here is another 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.370
 Demonstration experiment if I have the 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.770
 Ball around in a circle very fast 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.390
 move it is pushed outwards and 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.340
 After a while, it will be through friction 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.890
 slower and eventually falls 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.890
 down and that looks like this 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:35.410
 I hope you had fun with us in 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:38.220
 small demonstration experiments up 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.220
 next time
