spa full and running you will need to

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.230 
spa full and running you will need to
get<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.890> chemical<00:00:05.310> balance<00:00:05.430> correct

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
get the chemical balance correct

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.960 
get the chemical balance correct
before<00:00:06.990> starting<00:00:07.350> any<00:00:07.529> chemical<00:00:08.189> regime<00:00:08.550> you

before starting any chemical regime you

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.000 
before starting any chemical regime you
need<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.210> baseline<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:10.080> what<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.559> water<00:00:10.800> is

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
need a baseline of what the water is

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.120 
need a baseline of what the water is
like<00:00:11.190> first<00:00:12.080> always<00:00:13.080> test<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.590> water<00:00:13.799> first

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130

thing<00:00:14.450> you<00:00:15.450> will<00:00:15.599> always<00:00:15.750> need<00:00:16.139> some<00:00:16.350> shock

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
thing you will always need some shock

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.650 
thing you will always need some shock
but<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.460> will<00:00:17.580> need<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.789> know<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.060> calcium

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
but you will need to know the calcium

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.490 
but you will need to know the calcium
level<00:00:19.020> metals<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.980> other<00:00:20.369> levels<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> spa
