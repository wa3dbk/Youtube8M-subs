00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.890
 namely that have mentioned it and 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.350
 thank you so much for thanking you 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.130
 i have chosen me i am glad 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:46.020
 huge on it and then show you now 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:47.579
 times what it is all about here already 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:01:01.910
 times much better packaged has it on 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:01:01.910
 8 ok 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.990
 and indeed 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.470
 is it a climate of which the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.960
 which has forged a file 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.920
 very curious the first time that I like that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.920
 some will keep in hand 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:34.830
 you probably see a crazy ride 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.190
 not quite good really cool the dialogue 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.150
 from the arrows is still completely in it 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.150
 train on both sides 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.620
 also up here you have right 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.760
 natural jinping even has that 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.130
 distances are quite right and me 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.630
 could of course remove that now 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.570
 if I wanted to honestly enjoy it 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.300
 me very well so i liked the king 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:16.360
 forum already like the video of 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.710
 He is really cool from the feeling 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.080
 I also have a narrow blade 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.280
 not so here the change next time 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.010
 I think that's almost it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.770
 narrowest bell I've got that is so 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.180
 then usually a completely different knife me 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.540
 I believe would not otherwise be able and 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.060
 will try that paragraph 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.060
 winding to give you can not wait 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.480
 of course, I still have to hone 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.790
 he has really great work 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.280
 done 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:55.060
 Nice to find there is only the need 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:57.630
 last and stefan and there I get myself 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.570
 just a little sleep to belong 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:05.830
 very cool free look like it 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.000
 okay, but I have to 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.959
 not necessarily a few chords 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.830
 make developments 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:15.150
 He also has material for me 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.150
 for the handle with sent 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.300
 so it looks 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.579
 I'm not sure what it's for now 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:39.760
 it was definitely wooden house church 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:46.840
 Something native is that 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:48.549
 certainly chic something narrower 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.329
 knife was my account bush was 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:04:00.040
 of course , I'm gonna do something 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:04:05.010
 other times, kult en hei have karben 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.010
 style really cool 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:13.750
 yes i will keep you up to date 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:16.959
 Keep up with the knife so does that 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.380
 will certainly be a project longer 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.970
 Let's see if I'm in the fall 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.410
 already finished or if that is 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.669
 in the winter has definitely got 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.539
 I'm tidy now for the cold days 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.889
 what to do 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:31.900
 very very very cool thing I had 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.949
 even thought about it once I did 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.090
 sometime in the past 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.560
 I had even before sometime in the 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.280
 future times a knife from a file 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.220
 to forge 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.830
 but this is much better, of course 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:48.340
 forged by the professional and me 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:52.320
 all I had to do now were the last few 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:56.610
 make things manager 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.610
 This structure is really cool 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:09.830
 and I suppose that shone 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:19.449
 afterwards also if you are the right one 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:19.449
 sandpapered awesome 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.389
 yes you see I'm a bit 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.669
 I'm a bit there 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.270
 Overwhelmed 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.440
 really great stuff so a great one 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.940
 price does not actually go now 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.789
 can 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.840
 that's how it was done is what you do 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:42.580
 alone can not manage at all 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:49.180
 really great yes to the text I am 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.280
 that's really and really exciting 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.380
 Unique price and I am pleased 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.620
 huge 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.810
 That will be the first fair where I am 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.090
 I can do a lot myself 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:05.289
 very cool or six minutes 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.919
 I'll get that knife again 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:11.319
 without looking exactly at the camera 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.729
 Thank you for watching many many 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:17.610

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.610
