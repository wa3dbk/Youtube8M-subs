are<00:02:40.150> your<00:02:40.420> PCI<00:02:40.780> my<00:02:41.470> for<00:02:41.859> PCI<00:02:42.220> brackets<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:43.150> is

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
are your PCI my for PCI brackets this is

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.199 
are your PCI my for PCI brackets this is
for<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.750> capture<00:02:44.109> card<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.440> apparently<00:02:45.209> they

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
for the capture card and apparently they

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.440 
for the capture card and apparently they
didn't<00:02:46.480> include<00:02:46.599> a<00:02:47.170> screw<00:02:47.799> that<00:02:48.730> screws<00:02:49.209> in

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
didn't include a screw that screws in

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.129 
didn't include a screw that screws in
the<00:02:50.340> friggin<00:02:51.340> graphics<00:02:52.329> card<00:02:52.599> so<00:02:52.900> that's<00:02:52.989> a

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
the friggin graphics card so that's a

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:58.129 
the friggin graphics card so that's a
little<00:02:53.230> bit<00:02:53.379> strange<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.989> I<00:02:56.440> guess<00:02:56.799> that

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
little bit strange so I guess that

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.170 
little bit strange so I guess that
doesn't<00:02:59.139> have<00:02:59.409> anything<00:02:59.739> but<00:03:00.549> there<00:03:00.790> that

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
doesn't have anything but there that

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.589 
doesn't have anything but there that
blue<00:03:01.569> chip<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.530> fan<00:03:02.889> is<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:04.180> graphics

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
blue chip of the fan is the graphics

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.520 
blue chip of the fan is the graphics
card<00:03:04.840> itself<00:03:05.430> right<00:03:06.430> in<00:03:06.670> there<00:03:07.440> trying<00:03:08.440> to

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
card itself right in there trying to

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.030 
card itself right in there trying to
focus<00:03:08.769> is<00:03:09.069> in<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:09.430> best<00:03:09.849> I<00:03:10.150> can<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:11.590> this<00:03:11.739> is

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
focus is in this best I can so this is

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.129 
focus is in this best I can so this is
the<00:03:12.159> graphics<00:03:12.519> card<00:03:12.730> itself<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.810> I'm<00:03:13.989> gonna

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
the graphics card itself and I'm gonna

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.890 
the graphics card itself and I'm gonna
try<00:03:14.409> and<00:03:14.530> do<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:14.709> unstow<00:03:15.310> lesion<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.840> the

basically<00:03:54.459> for<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:55.919> HP<00:03:56.919> computer<00:03:57.669> it<00:03:58.060> is<00:03:58.299> a

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
basically for this HP computer it is a

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.110 
basically for this HP computer it is a
little<00:03:59.109> bit<00:03:59.290> different<00:03:59.590> from<00:03:59.709> normal<00:04:00.519> gaming

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
little bit different from normal gaming

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.379 
little bit different from normal gaming
computers<00:04:01.569> so<00:04:02.230> what<00:04:02.379> it<00:04:02.470> does<00:04:02.650> have<00:04:02.859> is<00:04:03.389> this

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
computers so what it does have is this

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:05.909 
computers so what it does have is this
little<00:04:04.659> screw<00:04:04.900> right<00:04:05.019> here<00:04:05.079> which<00:04:05.319> holds<00:04:05.650> all

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
little screw right here which holds all

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
of them all the PCI brackets in place so

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.860 
of them all the PCI brackets in place so
you<00:04:08.739> unscrew<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.310> pull<00:04:09.729> that<00:04:09.760> out<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.329> then

you have access to your PCI cards you

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.370 
you have access to your PCI cards you
pull<00:04:14.620> down<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.829> little<00:04:15.099> PCI<00:04:15.989> little<00:04:16.989> button

increase<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.590> with<00:04:36.889> these<00:04:37.040> old<00:04:37.280> ones<00:04:37.460> they

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
increase and with these old ones they

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.450 
increase and with these old ones they
somehow<00:04:38.360> draw<00:04:38.750> power<00:04:38.960> from<00:04:39.110> this<00:04:39.560> little

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
somehow draw power from this little

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.020 
somehow draw power from this little
connector<00:04:40.850> right<00:04:41.000> here<00:04:42.370> which<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.639> believe<00:04:43.940> the

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
connector right here which I believe the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.640 
connector right here which I believe the
job<00:04:44.180> powerful<00:04:44.600> more<00:04:44.780> have<00:04:44.900> fan<00:04:45.139> control<00:04:45.530> or

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
job powerful more have fan control or

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.860 
job powerful more have fan control or
something<00:04:45.979> of<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.280> sort<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.760> don't<00:04:47.690> know<00:04:47.750> about

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
something of the sort I don't know about

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.689 
something of the sort I don't know about
these<00:04:48.020> older<00:04:48.470> cards<00:04:48.800> but<00:04:49.040> I<00:04:49.100> do<00:04:49.190> know<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.580> new

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
these older cards but I do know the new

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.730 
these older cards but I do know the new
ones<00:04:49.850> have<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.090> 6<00:04:50.600> pin<00:04:50.810> connector<00:04:51.229> or<00:04:51.380> 8<00:04:51.530> pin

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
ones have a 6 pin connector or 8 pin

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.469 
ones have a 6 pin connector or 8 pin
connector<00:04:52.160> so<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:53.090> went<00:04:53.750> from<00:04:53.930> an<00:04:54.139> HDMI<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.479> DVI

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
connector so I went from an HDMI and DVI

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.909 
connector so I went from an HDMI and DVI
and<00:04:57.220> s-video<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.760> dual<00:04:59.450> DVI<00:04:59.810> in<00:05:00.050> s-video<00:05:00.350> so

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
and s-video to a dual DVI in s-video so

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.550 
and s-video to a dual DVI in s-video so
no<00:05:01.820> biggie

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
no biggie

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.460 
no biggie
HDMI<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:03.650> DVI<00:05:04.040> are<00:05:04.520> completely<00:05:05.090> compatible

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
HDMI and DVI are completely compatible

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.980 
HDMI and DVI are completely compatible
because<00:05:06.470> they<00:05:07.220> are<00:05:07.400> both<00:05:07.760> digital<00:05:08.240> so<00:05:08.870> let's

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
because they are both digital so let's

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.890 
because they are both digital so let's
go<00:05:09.080> ahead<00:05:09.169> and<00:05:09.290> boot<00:05:10.280> this<00:05:10.610> guy<00:05:10.820> up<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.750> just

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
go ahead and boot this guy up and I just

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.400 
go ahead and boot this guy up and I just
realized<00:05:12.050> I<00:05:12.290> have<00:05:12.380> no<00:05:12.410> power<00:05:12.740> in<00:05:13.190> so<00:05:14.200> let's<00:05:15.200> see

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
realized I have no power in so let's see

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.750 
realized I have no power in so let's see
if<00:05:15.530> this<00:05:15.680> go<00:05:15.950> ahead<00:05:16.100> and<00:05:16.220> boots<00:05:16.370> up<00:05:16.490> I'm<00:05:16.610> gonna

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
if this go ahead and boots up I'm gonna

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.129 
if this go ahead and boots up I'm gonna
head<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:17.000> put<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.180> back<00:05:17.240> up<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:17.660> we'll<00:05:18.020> see

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
head and put it back up and we'll see

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.510 
head and put it back up and we'll see
