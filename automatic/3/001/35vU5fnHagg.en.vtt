00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
connects on to the main minigun so you

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.660 
connects on to the main minigun so you
can<00:01:09.939> have<00:01:10.030> it's<00:01:10.179> a<00:01:10.359> preview<00:01:10.719> want<00:01:11.399> and<00:01:12.399> then

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:24.779 
connected so these are the parts which

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:29.910 
connected so these are the parts which
you<00:01:25.779> receive<00:01:26.289> in<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.459> minigun<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.590> get<00:01:29.770> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.879 

right<00:01:51.389> so<00:01:52.389> obviously<00:01:53.139> you<00:01:53.349> have<00:01:53.469> to<00:01:53.649> put<00:01:53.859> the

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:53.889 
right so obviously you have to put the

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:56.940 
right so obviously you have to put the
minigun<00:01:54.340> together<00:01:55.229> which<00:01:56.229> if<00:01:56.499> you're<00:01:56.770> not

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
minigun together which if you're not

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.440 
minigun together which if you're not
very<00:01:57.099> good<00:01:57.189> at<00:01:57.340> putting<00:01:57.579> things<00:01:57.729> together<00:01:58.090> may

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
very good at putting things together may

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.760 
very good at putting things together may
take<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:58.899> a<00:01:58.959> few<00:01:59.020> minutes<00:01:59.849> so<00:02:00.849> yeah<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:02.590> is

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
take you a few minutes so yeah this is

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:13.580 
take you a few minutes so yeah this is
what<00:02:02.919> it<00:02:03.069> looks<00:02:03.249> like<00:02:03.489> when<00:02:04.090> Eve<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:09.310> here<00:02:09.580> is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.340 

um<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:15.130> was<00:02:15.310> fairly<00:02:16.020> simple<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.080> construct<00:02:19.350> but

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
um it was fairly simple to construct but

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.810 
um it was fairly simple to construct but
there<00:02:21.070> is<00:02:21.250> there<00:02:21.610> was<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> few<00:02:22.090> problems<00:02:23.580> as<00:02:24.580> you

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
there is there was a few problems as you

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.890 
there is there was a few problems as you
can<00:02:24.970> see<00:02:25.210> this<00:02:25.420> handle<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.190> top<00:02:27.460> here<00:02:27.900> was

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
can see this handle on the top here was

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.110 
can see this handle on the top here was
very<00:02:29.140> difficult<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:31.800> put<00:02:32.800> into<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.460> gap

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
very difficult to put into the gap

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.280 
very difficult to put into the gap
between<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:36.330> minigun<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:40.660> use<00:02:41.050> some

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
between the minigun and I to use some

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.420 
between the minigun and I to use some
pliers<00:02:42.300> which<00:02:43.300> may<00:02:43.510> sound<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.900> bit<00:02:43.930> silly<00:02:44.290> but

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.660 

yeah<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.550> was<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> bit<00:02:48.940> annoying<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.640> but<00:02:51.640> I

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
yeah it was a bit annoying and but I

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.550 
yeah it was a bit annoying and but I
eventually<00:02:52.090> got<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.570> through<00:02:52.840> on<00:02:53.110> this<00:02:53.350> sort

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
eventually got it through on this sort

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.490 
eventually got it through on this sort
of<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.010> what<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.370> looks<00:02:54.550> like<00:02:55.500> when

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
of this is what it looks like when

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.950 
of this is what it looks like when
you've<00:02:56.710> fully<00:02:57.190> connected<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.540> know<00:02:58.720> its

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
you've fully connected it you know its

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.770 
you've fully connected it you know its
glory<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:01.870> decided<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.410> go<00:03:02.620> for<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:05.070> the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
glory and I decided to go for the the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.960 
glory and I decided to go for the the
this<00:03:08.070> cap<00:03:09.070> at<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.370> end<00:03:11.400> if<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.550> can<00:03:12.730> see<00:03:12.940> that

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
this cap at the end if you can see that

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.770 
this cap at the end if you can see that
instead<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:15.310> one<00:03:16.350> because<00:03:18.750> personally<00:03:19.750> I

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
instead of this one because personally I

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.710 
instead of this one because personally I
think<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.170> looks<00:03:20.200> better<00:03:21.030> as<00:03:22.030> many<00:03:22.390> fellow

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
think it looks better as many fellow

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.980 
think it looks better as many fellow
youtubers<00:03:23.440> may<00:03:23.680> say<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.780> um<00:03:26.610> yeah<00:03:27.990> that's
