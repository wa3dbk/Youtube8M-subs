good morning today's activity will be
fabricating<00:00:04.950> hour<00:00:05.160> whitening<00:00:05.430> trays<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.839> have

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
fabricating hour whitening trays we have

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.970 
fabricating hour whitening trays we have
our<00:00:07.319> model<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:08.040> we<00:00:08.189> have<00:00:08.519> poured<00:00:09.059> and

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
our model that we have poured and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.340 
our model that we have poured and
trimmed<00:00:11.690> this<00:00:12.690> model<00:00:12.960> was<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.590> horseshoe<00:00:14.280> pour

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
trimmed this model was a horseshoe pour

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.099 
trimmed this model was a horseshoe pour
that<00:00:16.350> was<00:00:16.590> inverted<00:00:17.690> and<00:00:18.690> we've<00:00:18.930> done<00:00:19.050> a

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
that was inverted and we've done a

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.370 
that was inverted and we've done a
slight<00:00:19.800> trim<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:21.060> want<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.420> use<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.630> model<00:00:22.260> with

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
slight trim we want to use a model with

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.859 
slight trim we want to use a model with
a<00:00:22.410> limited<00:00:22.859> base<00:00:23.100> for<00:00:23.699> our<00:00:24.060> whitening<00:00:24.600> tray

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
a limited base for our whitening tray

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.770 
a limited base for our whitening tray
fabrication<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:33.180> part<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> equipment

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
fabrication so part of the equipment

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.990 
fabrication so part of the equipment
that<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.140> use<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.350> our<00:00:34.739> fabrication<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.850> our

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
that we use for our fabrication of our

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.959 
that we use for our fabrication of our
whitening<00:00:36.420> tray<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.590> vacuform<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.820> our

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
whitening tray is a vacuform this is our

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.650 
whitening tray is a vacuform this is our
vacuum<00:00:39.149> form<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.620> need<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.149> have<00:00:42.149> caution

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
vacuum form you need to have caution

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
vacuum form you need to have caution
around<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.649> has<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> heater<00:00:44.190> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
around it because it has a heater and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.830 
around it because it has a heater and
gets<00:00:45.059> very<00:00:45.329> hot<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.570> run<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
gets very hot so you you can run the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.040 
gets very hot so you you can run the
risk<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.140> getting<00:00:49.260> burns<00:00:53.300> this<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.539> at<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> top

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
risk of getting burns this is at the top

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.220 
risk of getting burns this is at the top
is<00:00:55.289> where<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> heat<00:00:56.690> gets<00:00:57.690> very<00:00:57.989> hot

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
is where we have the heat gets very hot

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
is where we have the heat gets very hot
so<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.590> don't<00:00:58.770> want<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.039> touching<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.969> top

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
so we don't want to be touching the top

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.689 
so we don't want to be touching the top
of<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:01.440> piece<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.829> equipment<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.579> going

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
of this piece of equipment you're going

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.330 
of this piece of equipment you're going
to<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.879> using<00:01:03.059> our<00:01:03.420> handles<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.350> slide<00:01:04.650> away

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.399 

this<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> frame<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.299> which<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.990> put<00:01:13.260> our

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
this is the frame in which we put our

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.560 
this is the frame in which we put our
resin<00:01:13.740> sheets<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.460> six<00:01:15.119> by<00:01:15.299> six<00:01:15.360> resin<00:01:16.170> sheet

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
resin sheets a six by six resin sheet

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.719 
resin sheets a six by six resin sheet
gets<00:01:18.570> placed<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.380> perfectly<00:01:19.890> centered<00:01:20.250> if

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
gets placed and perfectly centered if

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.050 
gets placed and perfectly centered if
it's<00:01:20.970> not<00:01:21.180> centered<00:01:21.630> correctly<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.729> pull

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it's not centered correctly and we pull

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.590 
it's not centered correctly and we pull
down<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.659> fabricate<00:01:25.290> our<00:01:25.409> trade<00:01:26.150> it<00:01:27.150> will<00:01:27.390> miss

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
down to fabricate our trade it will miss

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.289 
down to fabricate our trade it will miss
shape<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.740> will<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.430> tray<00:01:30.060> foam

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
shape and we will not get the tray foam

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.460 
shape and we will not get the tray foam
that<00:01:30.600> we're<00:01:30.810> looking<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:32.780> how<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.930> works<00:01:34.229> is

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that we're looking for how this works is

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.069 
that we're looking for how this works is
you<00:01:34.650> place<00:01:34.680> through<00:01:35.280> resin<00:01:35.820> inside<00:01:37.520> centre<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
you place through resin inside centre it

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.539 
you place through resin inside centre it
pull<00:01:40.079> down<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> frame<00:01:40.680> almost<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
pull down the frame almost like it's a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.440 
pull down the frame almost like it's a
picture<00:01:41.909> frame<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:44.369> then<00:01:45.060> there's<00:01:45.360> this

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
picture frame and then there's this

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.470 
picture frame and then there's this
little<00:01:45.659> black<00:01:45.960> button<00:01:46.229> lift<00:01:46.920> up

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.010 

when<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:51.380> seal<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.100> frame<00:01:52.550> into<00:01:52.940> place<00:01:56.020> we're

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
when you seal the frame into place we're

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.530 
when you seal the frame into place we're
going<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.200> pull<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:57.710> off<00:02:00.670> like<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:04.330> we<00:02:05.330> want

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
going to pull this off like so we want

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.840 
going to pull this off like so we want
to<00:02:05.600> make<00:02:05.720> sure<00:02:05.870> that<00:02:06.290> our<00:02:06.320> base<00:02:06.710> is<00:02:07.040> flat<00:02:07.490> and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
to make sure that our base is flat and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.760 
to make sure that our base is flat and
that<00:02:08.150> we<00:02:08.270> have<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.480> nice<00:02:08.750> dry<00:02:09.050> model<00:02:09.470> we<00:02:09.560> don't

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
that we have a nice dry model we don't

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.300 
that we have a nice dry model we don't
want<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.040> be<00:02:10.900> putting<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.200> resin<00:02:12.680> over<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.100> wet

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
want to be putting the resin over a wet

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.310 
want to be putting the resin over a wet
model<00:02:13.730> we<00:02:13.910> won't<00:02:14.120> get<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.390> adherence<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.110> the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
model we won't get the adherence to the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.190 
model we won't get the adherence to the
model<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.920> good<00:02:16.070> seal<00:02:19.690> once<00:02:20.690> we've<00:02:20.900> pulled

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
model and a good seal once we've pulled

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.370 
model and a good seal once we've pulled
the<00:02:21.380> frame<00:02:21.650> up<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.310> top<00:02:23.170> we're<00:02:24.170> going<00:02:24.290> to

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
the frame up to the top we're going to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.670 
the frame up to the top we're going to
use<00:02:24.620> our<00:02:25.060> heat<00:02:26.060> source<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.750> heat<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.260> resin

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
use our heat source to heat the resin

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.710 
use our heat source to heat the resin
and<00:02:27.860> how<00:02:28.340> we<00:02:28.400> do<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.820> we<00:02:28.940> pull<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.510> over

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
and how we do that is we pull it over

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.670 
and how we do that is we pull it over
and<00:02:30.310> center<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.400> over<00:02:31.820> our<00:02:32.030> framed<00:02:32.680> resin

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
and center it over our framed resin

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:43.750 
and center it over our framed resin
sheet<00:02:36.190> there<00:02:40.690> okay<00:02:41.690> so<00:02:42.200> as<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.070> can<00:02:43.220> see<00:02:43.550> our

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
sheet there okay so as you can see our

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.000 
sheet there okay so as you can see our
resin<00:02:44.300> sheet<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.750> beginning<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.350> soften<00:02:45.560> and

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
resin sheet is beginning to soften and

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.360 
resin sheet is beginning to soften and
start<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.700> droop<00:02:46.940> down<00:02:47.180> we're<00:02:47.510> looking<00:02:47.840> for

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
start to droop down we're looking for

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.030 
start to droop down we're looking for
about<00:02:49.370> one<00:02:49.640> inch<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:50.090> droop<00:02:50.590> before<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:51.770> are

feeling sheet is cooled slightly and

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.790 
feeling sheet is cooled slightly and
we're<00:03:57.430> going<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.760> now<00:03:58.060> just<00:03:58.300> peel<00:03:58.780> this<00:03:59.140> right

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.439 

you<00:04:17.940> want<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.209> peel<00:04:18.389> it<00:04:18.419> off<00:04:18.630> right<00:04:19.290> away<00:04:23.449> this

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.930 
you want to peel it off right away this
will<00:04:24.660> show<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.930> we<00:04:25.650> had<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> delay<00:04:26.729> in<00:04:26.760> getting

will show you we had a delay in getting

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.430 
will show you we had a delay in getting

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
this separated for filming purposes only

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.670 
this separated for filming purposes only
so<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.530> can<00:04:31.710> see<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:32.900> what<00:04:33.900> happens<00:04:34.380> is<00:04:34.650> that

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
so you can see that what happens is that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.450 
so you can see that what happens is that
some<00:04:35.220> of<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.610> plaster<00:04:36.180> actually<00:04:36.660> does<00:04:36.990> adhere

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
some of the plaster actually does adhere

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.420 
some of the plaster actually does adhere
into<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.580> acrylic<00:04:39.680> so<00:04:40.680> we<00:04:40.830> wouldn't<00:04:41.100> want<00:04:41.310> to
