kind of text which can be entered and we
have<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:32.029> robot<00:00:32.930> which<00:00:33.590> is<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:34.790> be<00:00:34.910> operated

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
have the robot which is to be operated

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.870 
have the robot which is to be operated
from<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.690> distance<00:00:36.050> with<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.470> remote<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:37.130> when

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
from a distance with the remote and when

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.870 
from a distance with the remote and when
we<00:00:38.060> operate<00:00:38.329> this<00:00:38.900> but<00:00:39.470> we<00:00:39.620> can<00:00:39.770> notice<00:00:40.130> how<00:00:40.670> it

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
we operate this but we can notice how it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.389 
we operate this but we can notice how it
functions<00:00:41.510> as<00:00:42.079> per<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.530> requirement<00:00:43.280> is

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
functions as per the requirement is

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.939 
functions as per the requirement is
concerned<00:00:43.600> now<00:00:44.600> when<00:00:45.590> we<00:00:46.239> so<00:00:47.239> when<00:00:47.449> we<00:00:47.629> say<00:00:48.289> ok

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
concerned now when we so when we say ok

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.779 
concerned now when we so when we say ok
the<00:00:49.730> we<00:00:50.449> press<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.840> button<00:00:50.870> say<00:00:51.679> forward<00:00:52.160> we

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
the we press the button say forward we

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.000 
the we press the button say forward we
go<00:00:52.969> and<00:00:53.179> depress<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.629> button<00:00:53.750> forward<00:00:54.170> you

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
go and depress the button forward you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.689 
go and depress the button forward you
can<00:00:55.219> see<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:57.260> robot<00:00:57.620> now<00:00:57.800> moves<00:00:58.219> in<00:00:58.550> the

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
can see the the robot now moves in the

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.189 
can see the the robot now moves in the
forward<00:00:59.269> direction<00:00:59.780> we<00:00:59.960> have<00:01:00.050> the

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
forward direction we have the

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.259 
forward direction we have the
deliberately<00:01:00.559> kept<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:01.010> at<00:01:01.129> a<00:01:01.219> fixed<00:01:01.460> place<00:01:01.670> so

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
deliberately kept it at a fixed place so

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.329 
deliberately kept it at a fixed place so
as<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.539> see<00:01:02.719> that<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.289> motors<00:01:03.620> rotate<00:01:03.829> in<00:01:04.160> that

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
as to see that the motors rotate in that

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.350 
as to see that the motors rotate in that
direction<00:01:04.510> and<00:01:05.510> when<00:01:05.780> we<00:01:06.280> we<00:01:07.280> say<00:01:07.460> stop

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
direction and when we we say stop

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
direction and when we we say stop
it<00:01:08.930> goes<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.470> stop<00:01:09.740> function<00:01:10.840> so<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:12.170> goes

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
it goes to the stop function so it goes

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.300 
it goes to the stop function so it goes
to<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.590> stop<00:01:12.830> function<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:13.520> when<00:01:14.150> we<00:01:14.360> say<00:01:15.310> we

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
to the stop function and when we say we

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.590 
to the stop function and when we say we
go<00:01:16.490> over<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.909> say<00:01:17.480> a<00:01:17.780> forward<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.970> reverse<00:01:19.970> it

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
go over to say a forward a reverse it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.680 
go over to say a forward a reverse it
goes<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:20.990> reverse<00:01:22.120> you<00:01:23.120> can<00:01:23.150> see<00:01:23.300> it<00:01:23.480> goes

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
goes to the reverse you can see it goes

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.930 
goes to the reverse you can see it goes
to<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.900> rivers<00:01:24.940> now<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.830> interesting<00:01:28.460> part

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
to the rivers now the interesting part

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.520 
to the rivers now the interesting part
is<00:01:29.090> we<00:01:29.600> can<00:01:29.810> stop<00:01:30.440> it<00:01:30.590> now<00:01:31.420> which<00:01:32.420> stops<00:01:32.780> the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
is we can stop it now which stops the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.620 
is we can stop it now which stops the
app<00:01:33.800> can<00:01:34.160> be<00:01:34.190> raised<00:01:34.490> up<00:01:34.760> and<00:01:35.030> down<00:01:35.240> now

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
app can be raised up and down now

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.150 
app can be raised up and down now
supposing<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.200> heart<00:01:36.440> needs<00:01:36.650> to<00:01:36.890> be<00:01:36.920> raised

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
supposing the heart needs to be raised

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.650 
supposing the heart needs to be raised
up<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:37.940> goes<00:01:38.210> up<00:01:38.510> this<00:01:38.750> way<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:41.210> can<00:01:41.420> be

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
up it goes up this way and it can be

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.820 
up it goes up this way and it can be
stopped<00:01:42.290> also<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.360> can<00:01:44.540> come<00:01:44.810> down<00:01:44.840> by

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
stopped also and it can come down by

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.590 
stopped also and it can come down by
pressing<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.280> down<00:01:46.400> button<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:47.180> can<00:01:47.360> come

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
pressing the down button it can come

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.440 
pressing the down button it can come
down<00:01:48.400> you<00:01:49.400> can<00:01:49.550> see<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.820> arm<00:01:49.970> is<00:01:50.180> coming<00:01:50.390> down
