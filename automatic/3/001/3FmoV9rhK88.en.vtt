00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
around 200 to 300 million but you might

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.919 
around 200 to 300 million but you might
want<00:02:01.830> to<00:02:01.890> add<00:02:02.099> you<00:02:02.520> know<00:02:02.549> maybe<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:03.030> engine

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.150 

those<00:02:06.929> are<00:02:07.140> exiting<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:09.679> mean<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.769> landing

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
those are exiting I mean the landing

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.430 
those are exiting I mean the landing
gears<00:02:11.430> alone<00:02:11.849> are<00:02:12.239> what<00:02:12.510> twenty<00:02:13.140> million

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
gears alone are what twenty million

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.819 
gears alone are what twenty million
dollars<00:02:13.980> twenty<00:02:14.790> five<00:02:14.970> million<00:02:15.299> dollars

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
dollars twenty five million dollars

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.250 
dollars twenty five million dollars
crazy<00:02:16.829> so<00:02:17.519> I've<00:02:17.670> seen<00:02:17.940> plenty<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.480> these<00:02:18.840> ones

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
crazy so I've seen plenty of these ones

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.770 
crazy so I've seen plenty of these ones
and<00:02:19.620> these<00:02:19.680> ones<00:02:20.160> but<00:02:20.400> I've<00:02:21.120> never<00:02:21.299> seen<00:02:21.569> that

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
and these ones but I've never seen that

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.130 
and these ones but I've never seen that
before<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.410> looks<00:02:22.560> like<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> freaking<00:02:23.280> PSP

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140
