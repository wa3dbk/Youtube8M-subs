that's not the way it's done they said
it's<00:00:10.559> all<00:00:10.740> done<00:00:11.040> with<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> mind<00:00:12.530> the<00:00:13.530> smaller

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
it's all done with the mind the smaller

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.580 
it's all done with the mind the smaller
craft<00:00:14.340> can<00:00:15.299> be<00:00:15.330> controlled<00:00:16.049> with<00:00:16.230> one

the<00:00:24.000> energy<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.840> directed<00:00:25.410> into<00:00:25.650> these

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
the energy is directed into these

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.640 
the energy is directed into these
crystals<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:26.970> board<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.420> craft<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:28.019> keepin<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
crystals on board to craft to keepin a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.790 
crystals on board to craft to keepin a
store<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.010> energy<00:00:29.660> and<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.990> propels<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
store of energy and this propels the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.190 
store of energy and this propels the
crap<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:33.000> one<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.239> these<00:00:33.420> meetings<00:00:33.809> at

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
crap and at one of these meetings at

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.020 
crap and at one of these meetings at
this<00:00:34.380> point<00:00:34.649> investigators<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.520> oh<00:00:35.730> yeah

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
this point investigators have oh yeah

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.959 
this point investigators have oh yeah
because<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.690> was<00:00:36.750> thinkin<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.530> goes

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
because it was thinkin that it goes

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
because it was thinkin that it goes
exactly<00:00:41.180> we<00:00:42.180> couldn't<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.559> don't

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
exactly we couldn't get it you don't

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.420 
exactly we couldn't get it you don't
need<00:00:44.280> fuel<00:00:46.430> now<00:00:48.770> one<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> ways<00:00:50.129> they

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
need fuel now one of the ways they

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.459 
need fuel now one of the ways they
travel<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.270> they<00:00:51.539> go<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.379> these

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
travel is they go in and out of these

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.049 
travel is they go in and out of these
dimensions<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.670> was<00:00:53.789> talking<00:00:54.059> about<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
dimensions that I was talking about and

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.020 
dimensions that I was talking about and
my<00:00:57.059> hobbies<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.840> ventures<00:00:58.770> even<00:00:59.100> showing<00:00:59.520> it's

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
my hobbies of ventures even showing it's

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.070 
my hobbies of ventures even showing it's
a<00:01:00.180> perfect<00:01:00.629> example<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:01.559> they're<00:01:01.770> doing

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
a perfect example of what they're doing

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.080 
a perfect example of what they're doing
because<00:01:04.080> they<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.549> planet<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.229> densest

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
because they this planet is the densest

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.789 
because they this planet is the densest
it's<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> most<00:01:09.420> difficult<00:01:09.659> planet<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.619> live

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it's the most difficult planet to live

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.190 
it's the most difficult planet to live
on<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.369> universe

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:35.420 

the<00:01:25.930> bottom<00:01:26.350> feeders<00:01:29.640> say<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.909> sound

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.530 

density<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.750> these<00:01:37.990> beings<00:01:39.150> come<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.360> earth

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
density so these beings come to earth

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.590 
density so these beings come to earth
they<00:01:41.140> can't<00:01:41.470> take<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:41.770> density<00:01:42.430> it's<00:01:43.330> too

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
they can't take that density it's too

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.080 
they can't take that density it's too
much<00:01:43.869> for<00:01:44.229> them

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
much for them

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.240 
much for them
so<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.570> why<00:01:46.810> they<00:01:47.050> created<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:47.979> little

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
so this is why they created the little

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.080 
so this is why they created the little
brace<00:01:48.570> they<00:01:49.570> are<00:01:49.869> robotic<00:01:50.530> beings<00:01:51.090> now

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
brace they are robotic beings now

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.090 
brace they are robotic beings now
everything<00:01:53.020> can<00:01:53.140> robot<00:01:53.590> me<00:01:53.740> think<00:01:53.979> of

a robot to help us we're going to make
it<00:02:11.560> look<00:02:11.709> like<00:02:11.890> ah<00:02:12.100> sorry<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.670> they're<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
it look like ah sorry so so they're the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.660 
it look like ah sorry so so they're the
ones<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.390> come<00:02:25.690> in<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.860> other<00:02:27.010> ones<00:02:27.310> can't

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
ones that come in the other ones can't

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.319 
ones that come in the other ones can't
handle<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.420> density<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.670> know<00:02:30.670> some<00:02:31.000> people

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
handle the density I know some people

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.660 
handle the density I know some people
talked<00:02:31.690> about<00:02:31.840> seeing<00:02:32.350> Nordics<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.370> their

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
talked about seeing Nordics in their

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.970 
talked about seeing Nordics in their
bedrooms<00:02:34.239> at<00:02:34.570> all<00:02:34.810> blogs<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.590> things<00:02:35.799> like

bedrooms at all blogs and things like

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.310 
bedrooms at all blogs and things like
that<00:02:36.040> which<00:02:36.579> are<00:02:36.700> not<00:02:36.880> real<00:02:37.239> those<00:02:37.959> are<00:02:37.989> her

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
that which are not real those are her

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.870 
that which are not real those are her
breasts<00:02:38.920> are<00:02:39.220> projected<00:02:40.060> from<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.110> craft<00:02:41.880> the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
breasts are projected from the craft the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.020 
breasts are projected from the craft the
loot<00:02:43.090> guys<00:02:43.360> are<00:02:43.690> real<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.519> other<00:02:45.700> ones

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
loot guys are real but the other ones

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.789 
loot guys are real but the other ones
are<00:02:46.209> projections<00:02:46.720> because<00:02:47.350> they<00:02:47.500> can't

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
are projections because they can't

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.720 
are projections because they can't
handle<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.370> density<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:50.470> when<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.400> crafts

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
handle the density so when the crafts

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.770 
handle the density so when the crafts
come<00:02:52.090> in<00:02:52.329> out<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:53.110> atmosphere<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:55.570> order

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
come in out of the atmosphere in order

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.440 
come in out of the atmosphere in order
to<00:02:55.959> come<00:02:56.230> in<00:02:56.650> they<00:02:57.250> have<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.760> lower<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
to come in they have to lower the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.490 
to come in they have to lower the
vibration<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.980> craft<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.090> ship<00:03:01.500> in

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
vibration of the craft of the ship in

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.539 
vibration of the craft of the ship in
order<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.890> get<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.370> enter<00:03:03.760> this<00:03:03.910> density<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:06.340> as

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
order to get to enter this density so as

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.229 
order to get to enter this density so as
they<00:03:06.850> go<00:03:07.180> over<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.600> vibration<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.620> crack

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
they go over the vibration of the crack

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.380 
they go over the vibration of the crack
some<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.540> see<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.810> light<00:03:11.350> it<00:03:11.620> appears<00:03:12.390> and

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
some of you see a light it appears and

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.789 
some of you see a light it appears and
many<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.930> have<00:03:14.019> done<00:03:14.079> that<00:03:14.440> all<00:03:14.650> the

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
many of you have done that all the

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.740 
many of you have done that all the
Centers<00:03:15.340> there's<00:03:15.850> a<00:03:15.940> lot<00:03:16.090> out<00:03:16.329> there<00:03:16.359> there's

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
Centers there's a lot out there there's

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.300 
Centers there's a lot out there there's
a<00:03:16.810> ship<00:03:17.109> out<00:03:17.320> there<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.859> if

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
a ship out there and if

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.089 
a ship out there and if
come<00:03:18.700> from<00:03:18.970> because<00:03:19.900> they<00:03:20.319> have<00:03:20.500> worn<00:03:20.770> the

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
come from because they have worn the

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.010 
come from because they have worn the
density<00:03:21.580> of<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.970> crap<00:03:22.270> and<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.810> suddenly

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
density of the crap and it suddenly

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.740 
density of the crap and it suddenly
disappears<00:03:23.890> when<00:03:24.880> they<00:03:25.000> get<00:03:25.180> ready<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.510> leave

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
disappears when they get ready to leave

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.470 
disappears when they get ready to leave
they<00:03:26.140> raise<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.980> vibrational<00:03:27.790> frequencies

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
they raise the vibrational frequencies

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.570 
they raise the vibrational frequencies
of<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.840> craft<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.410> go<00:03:29.560> back<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.459> other

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
of the craft to go back to the other

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.960 
of the craft to go back to the other
dimension<00:03:31.050> by<00:03:32.050> doing<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.709> they<00:03:33.489> suddenly

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
dimension by doing that they suddenly

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.370 
dimension by doing that they suddenly
disappear<00:03:34.510> because<00:03:35.500> you're<00:03:35.890> in<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.160> other
