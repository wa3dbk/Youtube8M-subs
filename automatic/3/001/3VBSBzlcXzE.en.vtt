well<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:23.400> think<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.299> kind<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.630> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
well and I think this is kind of like a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.149 
well and I think this is kind of like a
combination<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.619> few<00:01:25.830> different<00:01:25.920> things

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
combination of a few different things

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.240 
combination of a few different things
maybe<00:01:26.930> some<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.080> grapefruit<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:29.130> in

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
maybe some of the grapefruit going in

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
maybe some of the grapefruit going in
there<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:30.030> primarily<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:30.930> me<00:01:31.049> I'm<00:01:31.200> smelling

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
there but primarily for me I'm smelling

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.530 
there but primarily for me I'm smelling
like<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> very<00:01:32.070> sweet<00:01:32.400> orange<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.360> how<00:01:33.509> I

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
like a very sweet orange is how I

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.590 
like a very sweet orange is how I
describe<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.460> flavor<00:01:35.759> smells<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.270> light

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
describe it the flavor smells very light

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.999 
describe it the flavor smells very light
so<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.220> really<00:01:38.520> crispy<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.240> not

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
so really like really crispy it's not

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.889 
so really like really crispy it's not
it's<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.189> overly<00:01:41.820> sweet<00:01:42.060> by<00:01:42.270> any<00:01:42.450> means<00:01:42.689> and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
it's not overly sweet by any means and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.289 
it's not overly sweet by any means and
this<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.229> actually<00:01:43.470> toned<00:01:44.399> down<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.640> lot<00:01:45.030> more

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
this is actually toned down a lot more

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.389 
this is actually toned down a lot more
than<00:01:45.659> what<00:01:46.409> I've<00:01:46.530> seen<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.890> past<00:01:46.979> week

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
in the formula but I just noticed that

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.690

juice<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.000> tobacco<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.260> doesn't<00:02:53.860> seem<00:02:54.010> to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
juice in the tobacco and doesn't seem to

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.210 
juice in the tobacco and doesn't seem to
affect<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.460> at<00:02:54.580> all<00:02:54.930> no<00:02:55.930> effect<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:57.010> smoke

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220

affect it at all no effect on the smoke
ability<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.700> anything<00:02:58.060> it's<00:02:58.360> if<00:02:59.200> anything

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
ability of anything it's if anything

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.270 
ability of anything it's if anything
it's<00:03:00.220> just<00:03:00.570> more<00:03:01.570> stable<00:03:02.110> I'm<00:03:02.680> trying<00:03:03.160> to

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
it's just more stable I'm trying to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.770 
it's just more stable I'm trying to
explain<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:03.670> better<00:03:03.820> but<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.060> can't<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.570> just

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
explain that better but I can't is just

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.270 
explain that better but I can't is just
it<00:03:04.990> just<00:03:05.140> seems<00:03:05.380> more<00:03:05.590> stable<00:03:05.950> than<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.160> was

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
it just seems more stable than it was

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.720 
it just seems more stable than it was
before<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:07.180> not<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:09.160> past<00:03:09.340> I've<00:03:09.490> gotten

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
before so not that the past I've gotten

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.920 
before so not that the past I've gotten
a<00:03:09.760> little<00:03:09.910> bit<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.180> harshness<00:03:10.540> in<00:03:10.840> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
a little bit of that harshness in the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.960 
a little bit of that harshness in the
back<00:03:11.110> just<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.890> thought<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.490> was<00:03:12.550> mainly<00:03:12.760> from

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
back just I thought it was mainly from

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.510 
back just I thought it was mainly from
the<00:03:13.030> tobacco<00:03:13.540> but<00:03:13.690> maybe<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.080> because<00:03:14.520> maybe

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
the tobacco but maybe it's because maybe

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.670 
the tobacco but maybe it's because maybe
just<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.880> formula<00:03:16.239> that<00:03:17.080> of<00:03:17.200> course<00:03:17.350> could<00:03:17.560> be

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
just the formula that of course could be

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.229 
just the formula that of course could be
all<00:03:17.770> speculation<00:03:18.370> but<00:03:18.700> that's<00:03:18.940> just<00:03:19.030> what<00:03:19.209> I

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
all speculation but that's just what I

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:27.810 
all speculation but that's just what I
notice<00:03:19.570> here<00:03:25.350> yeah<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.830> flavor<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.400> spot-on

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
notice here yeah the flavor is spot-on

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.490 
notice here yeah the flavor is spot-on
from<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.660> taste<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:28.989> flight<00:03:29.170> respond

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
from the taste of the flight respond

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.860 
from the taste of the flight respond
from<00:03:29.800> what<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:30.250> smell<00:03:30.580> which<00:03:31.209> was<00:03:31.450> just<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.840> very

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
from the taste of the smoke it's a very

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.140 
from the taste of the smoke it's a very
sweet<00:04:15.010> citrus<00:04:15.989> primarily<00:04:16.989> orange<00:04:17.940> maybe<00:04:18.940> even

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
sweet citrus primarily orange maybe even

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.670 
sweet citrus primarily orange maybe even
a<00:04:19.239> little<00:04:19.269> bit<00:04:19.449> creamy<00:04:19.780> but<00:04:20.139> I<00:04:20.320> don't<00:04:20.500> think

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
a little bit creamy but I don't think

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.020 
a little bit creamy but I don't think
there's<00:04:20.889> any<00:04:21.070> kind<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.310> vanilla<00:04:21.639> or<00:04:21.699> anything

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
there's any kind of vanilla or anything

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.330 
there's any kind of vanilla or anything
in<00:04:22.150> there<00:04:22.330> just<00:04:23.169> to<00:04:23.320> really<00:04:23.500> smooth<00:04:23.919> flavor<00:04:24.190> a

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
in there just to really smooth flavor a

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.210 
in there just to really smooth flavor a
little<00:04:24.430> bit<00:04:24.610> mellow<00:04:25.020> maybe<00:04:26.020> even<00:04:26.320> too<00:04:26.919> mellow

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
little bit mellow maybe even too mellow

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.730 
little bit mellow maybe even too mellow
I<00:04:27.460> would<00:04:28.330> say<00:04:28.510> that<00:04:29.410> would<00:04:29.500> be<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.710> only

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
I would say that would be the only

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.860 
I would say that would be the only
drawback<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.550> flavor<00:04:30.760> does<00:04:31.060> die<00:04:31.360> down<00:04:31.630> a

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
drawback and the flavor does die down a

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.770 
drawback and the flavor does die down a
little<00:04:31.930> bit<00:04:32.430> faster<00:04:33.430> than<00:04:33.820> expected<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.539> about

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
little bit faster than expected so about

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.189 
little bit faster than expected so about
the<00:04:35.110> 40-minute<00:04:35.830> mark<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:37.360> almost<00:04:37.630> gone<00:04:37.840> so<00:04:38.169> I

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
the 40-minute mark it's almost gone so I

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.320 
the 40-minute mark it's almost gone so I
mean<00:04:38.470> that's<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.949> solid<00:04:39.160> session<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:39.880> it's<00:04:40.180> not

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
mean that's a solid session so it's not

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.420 
mean that's a solid session so it's not
like<00:04:40.539> flavored<00:04:40.930> eyes<00:04:41.050> doubt<00:04:41.289> in<00:04:41.560> 15<00:04:42.100> minutes

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
like flavored eyes doubt in 15 minutes

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.909 
like flavored eyes doubt in 15 minutes
by<00:04:42.550> any<00:04:42.669> means<00:04:42.850> but<00:04:43.810> yeah<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:43.960> just<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.560> would

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
by any means but yeah I just I would

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:45.930 
by any means but yeah I just I would
think<00:04:45.039> of<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.280> flavor<00:04:45.490> was<00:04:45.639> a<00:04:45.699> little<00:04:45.850> bit

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
think of the flavor was a little bit

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.020 
think of the flavor was a little bit
stronger<00:04:46.180> it<00:04:46.630> might<00:04:47.080> be<00:04:47.229> even<00:04:47.320> more<00:04:47.620> enjoyable

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
stronger it might be even more enjoyable

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
stronger it might be even more enjoyable
but<00:04:49.030> overall<00:04:49.300> this<00:04:49.419> is<00:04:49.479> a<00:04:49.660> great<00:04:49.840> flavor

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
but overall this is a great flavor

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.110 
but overall this is a great flavor

who Kapena actually came out with 50

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.969 
who Kapena actually came out with 50
grand<00:05:06.070> packs<00:05:06.400> so<00:05:06.669> it's<00:05:06.970> like<00:05:07.090> a<00:05:07.120> little

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
grand packs so it's like a little

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.050 
grand packs so it's like a little
cardboard<00:05:08.979> version<00:05:09.340> of<00:05:09.430> this<00:05:09.550> is<00:05:09.760> actually

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
cardboard version of this is actually

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.820 
cardboard version of this is actually
really<00:05:10.090> cool<00:05:10.300> looking<00:05:10.750> they<00:05:11.349> seem<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.560> be<00:05:11.710> in

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
really cool looking they seem to be in

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.860 
really cool looking they seem to be in
pretty<00:05:11.860> limited<00:05:12.580> quantities<00:05:13.030> so<00:05:13.330> I<00:05:13.360> mean<00:05:13.720> it's

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
pretty limited quantities so I mean it's

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.330 
pretty limited quantities so I mean it's
a<00:05:13.930> little<00:05:14.110> bit<00:05:14.200> harder<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:14.560> find<00:05:14.740> like<00:05:15.220> the
