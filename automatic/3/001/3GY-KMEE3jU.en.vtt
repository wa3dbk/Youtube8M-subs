00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
template now after you cut out the parts

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.970 
template now after you cut out the parts
the<00:00:23.279> first<00:00:23.490> thing<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.210> fold<00:00:24.480> up<00:00:24.980> some

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the first thing to do is to fold up some

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.429 
the first thing to do is to fold up some
of<00:00:26.039> these<00:00:26.099> sections<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:26.789> shown<00:00:27.170> here<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.380> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
of these sections as shown here this is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.830 
of these sections as shown here this is
what<00:00:28.650> I'm<00:00:28.740> doing<00:00:28.920> I'm<00:00:29.250> folding<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.269> bodies<00:00:30.720> of

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
what I'm doing I'm folding the bodies of

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.229 
what I'm doing I'm folding the bodies of
the<00:00:30.929> birds<00:00:31.170> inwards<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.980> then<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> wings

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the birds inwards and then the wings

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.020 
the birds inwards and then the wings
upwards<00:00:33.770> now<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.980> also<00:00:35.100> will<00:00:35.430> cut<00:00:35.670> out<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
upwards now you also will cut out the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.600 
upwards now you also will cut out the
two<00:00:36.239> tails<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.620> birds<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.520> what

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
two tails of the birds and this is what

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.580 
two tails of the birds and this is what
the<00:00:38.730> tail<00:00:38.910> looks<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:40.020> fold<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.559> half

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the tail looks like and fold it in half

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.810 
the tail looks like and fold it in half
and<00:00:41.100> then<00:00:41.129> fold<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.579> tabs<00:00:42.739> outwards<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.670> is

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and then fold the tabs outwards this is

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.310 
and then fold the tabs outwards this is
a<00:00:44.879> close-up<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> tail<00:00:46.170> looks<00:00:46.379> like

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
a close-up of what the tail looks like

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
a close-up of what the tail looks like
so<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> next<00:00:49.620> step<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.550> glue<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.180> bodies

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
so the next step is to glue the bodies

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.270 
so the next step is to glue the bodies
together<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.469> want<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> make<00:00:52.829> sure<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
together you want to make sure that you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.459 
together you want to make sure that you
only<00:00:53.550> glue<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.059> bottom<00:00:54.899> part<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> body

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
only glue the bottom part of the body

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.889 
only glue the bottom part of the body
don't<00:00:55.949> glue<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> heads<00:00:56.520> together<00:00:56.899> because

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
don't glue the heads together because

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.170 
don't glue the heads together because
you'll<00:00:58.079> be<00:00:58.109> attaching<00:00:58.829> those<00:00:59.489> hearts<00:00:59.940> or

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you'll be attaching those hearts or

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.630 
you'll be attaching those hearts or
other<00:01:01.079> items<00:01:01.500> between<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> beaks

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
other items between the beaks

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.490 
other items between the beaks
so<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.300> glue<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.719> bottom<00:01:04.019> parts<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
so just glue the bottom parts of the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.030 
so just glue the bottom parts of the
bird

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.980 

so<00:01:12.850> what<00:01:12.940> I'm<00:01:13.000> doing<00:01:13.060> now<00:01:13.300> is<00:01:13.570> I'm<00:01:13.780> removing

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
so what I'm doing now is I'm removing

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.410 
so what I'm doing now is I'm removing
the<00:01:14.350> card<00:01:14.740> from<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.310> rest<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.730> card<00:01:16.120> stock

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.710 
the card from the rest of the card stock
and<00:01:17.350> I'm<00:01:17.500> gonna<00:01:17.650> fold<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.490> center<00:01:19.000> center

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
and I'm gonna fold the the center center

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.300 
and I'm gonna fold the the center center
of<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.930> card<00:01:20.170> now<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.620> might<00:01:20.830> want<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.040> try<00:01:21.250> to

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
of the card now you might want to try to

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.230 
of the card now you might want to try to
fold<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.090> card<00:01:22.360> first<00:01:23.350> before<00:01:24.010> full<00:01:24.520> gluing

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
fold the card first before full gluing

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.310 
fold the card first before full gluing
the<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:27.010> bodies<00:01:27.310> together<00:01:27.900> otherwise<00:01:28.900> it's<00:01:29.230> a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
the the bodies together otherwise it's a

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.290 
the the bodies together otherwise it's a
little<00:01:29.650> bit<00:01:29.770> hard<00:01:30.160> to<00:01:30.220> align<00:01:30.700> as<00:01:30.940> you<00:01:31.030> can<00:01:31.150> see

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
little bit hard to align as you can see

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.630 
little bit hard to align as you can see
here<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:32.290> was<00:01:32.410> a<00:01:32.440> little<00:01:32.680> bit<00:01:32.830> misaligned<00:01:33.070> so

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
here it was a little bit misaligned so

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.430 
here it was a little bit misaligned so
I'm<00:01:33.730> gonna<00:01:33.880> reglue<00:01:34.330> this<00:01:34.570> section<00:01:40.320> now<00:01:41.320> it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
I'm gonna reglue this section now it

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.530 
I'm gonna reglue this section now it
should<00:01:41.590> fold<00:01:41.800> properly<00:01:42.010> so<00:01:42.970> make<00:01:43.150> sure<00:01:43.180> when

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
should fold properly so make sure when

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.530 
should fold properly so make sure when
you<00:01:43.570> fold<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.020> card<00:01:44.260> it<00:01:44.650> folds<00:01:45.040> flat<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.700> that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
you fold the card it folds flat and that

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:57.290 
you fold the card it folds flat and that
everything<00:01:46.960> is<00:01:47.340> perfectly<00:01:48.340> aligned

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.520 

okay<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.420> next<00:01:58.540> step<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.200> create<00:01:59.350> the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
okay the next step is to create the

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.110 
okay the next step is to create the
backing<00:01:59.890> of<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.070> card<00:02:00.310> I'm<00:02:00.490> using<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.880> pink

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
which are six and a quarter inches by

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.230 
which are six and a quarter inches by
four<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.290> a<00:02:08.350> half<00:02:11.550> I'm<00:02:12.550> cutting<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> card

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.610 
a quarter inch dimension and then I'm
going<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.490> be<00:02:18.610> cutting<00:02:18.820> two<00:02:19.300> sections<00:02:19.780> off<00:02:20.020> at

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
going to be cutting two sections off at

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:32.190 
going to be cutting two sections off at
about<00:02:20.830> four<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.280> half<00:02:21.310> inches

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.589 

this<00:02:32.770> is<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.010> first<00:02:33.220> section<00:02:33.459> make<00:02:34.330> sure<00:02:34.360> you

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
this is the first section make sure you

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.770 
this is the first section make sure you
keep<00:02:34.780> track<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.260> which<00:02:35.440> edge<00:02:36.480> which<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.660> the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
keep track of which edge which of the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.720 
keep track of which edge which of the
two<00:02:37.930> edges<00:02:38.140> match<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:39.069> when<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.310> glue<00:02:39.550> these

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
two edges match so when you glue these

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.390 
two edges match so when you glue these
sections<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.450> your<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:41.200> your<00:02:41.230> Center<00:02:41.650> white

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
sections to your to your Center white

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.900 
sections to your to your Center white
card<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.690> those<00:02:43.870> two<00:02:44.110> edges<00:02:44.140> will<00:02:44.890> will<00:02:45.640> also

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
card that those two edges will will also

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:53.430 
card that those two edges will will also
match<00:02:46.120> like<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:51.480> okay<00:02:52.480> now<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.720> want<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.230> glue

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
match like so okay now you want to glue

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.770 
match like so okay now you want to glue
these<00:02:53.620> two<00:02:54.040> sections<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:55.000> your<00:02:55.030> main<00:02:55.540> card<00:02:57.780> I'm

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
these two sections to your main card I'm

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.750 
these two sections to your main card I'm
going<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.049> glue<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.410> on<00:02:59.709> top<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.489> white

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
going to glue this on top of a white

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.330 
going to glue this on top of a white
sheet<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.030> paper<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:02.560> extra<00:03:03.069> glue

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
sheet of paper so that the extra glue

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.600 
sheet of paper so that the extra glue
will<00:03:04.299> stay<00:03:04.599> on<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.900> paper<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.739> not<00:03:06.040> get<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.400> my

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
will stay on the paper and not get on my

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.509 
will stay on the paper and not get on my
cutting<00:03:06.880> board<00:03:07.319> I'm<00:03:08.319> using<00:03:08.530> Elmer's<00:03:08.830> glue<00:03:09.250> to

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
cutting board I'm using Elmer's glue to

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.009 
cutting board I'm using Elmer's glue to
glue<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.880> edges<00:03:10.030> which<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.660> little<00:03:10.900> bit

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
glue the edges which is a little bit

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.569 
glue the edges which is a little bit
stronger<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.680> then<00:03:12.190> I'm<00:03:12.280> going<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.430> use<00:03:12.549> a

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
stronger and then I'm going to use a

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.020 
stronger and then I'm going to use a
glue<00:03:12.849> stick<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:13.510> glue<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:15.400> center<00:03:15.730> part

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
glue stick to glue the the center part

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.880 
glue stick to glue the the center part
of<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.180> card<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.720> this<00:03:17.380> will<00:03:17.590> hopefully

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
of the card and this will hopefully

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.850 
of the card and this will hopefully
reduce<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.700> amount<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.500> warping<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.620> card

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
reduce the amount of warping the card

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.280 
reduce the amount of warping the card
wall<00:03:21.180> will<00:03:22.180> have<00:03:22.440> from<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.650> Elmer's<00:03:24.160> glue<00:03:25.290> you

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
wall will have from the Elmer's glue you

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.870 
wall will have from the Elmer's glue you
know<00:03:26.380> wait<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.920> want<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.099> be<00:03:27.220> careful<00:03:27.489> and

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
know wait you want to be careful and

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.539 
know wait you want to be careful and
make<00:03:27.970> sure<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.540> you<00:03:28.660> align<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:30.220> outside

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
make sure that you align the outside

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:42.350 
make sure that you align the outside
card<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.829> inside<00:03:32.829> fold<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.849> Center<00:03:34.239> fold

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.830 

okay<00:03:43.080> now<00:03:43.260> let's<00:03:43.470> glue<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.890> other<00:03:44.130> section

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
okay now let's glue the other section

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.300 
okay now let's glue the other section
now<00:03:45.840> I'm<00:03:45.900> using<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.230> new<00:03:46.440> sheet<00:03:46.740> of<00:03:46.770> paper<00:03:47.010> in

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
now I'm using a new sheet of paper in

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.190 
now I'm using a new sheet of paper in
the<00:03:47.400> back<00:03:47.580> so<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.150> don't<00:03:48.390> use<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.870> don't<00:03:49.080> get

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
the back so that I don't use I don't get

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.280 
the back so that I don't use I don't get
any<00:03:49.350> of<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.650> glue<00:03:50.520> onto<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.970> card<00:03:51.300> again<00:03:52.170> I'm

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
any of the glue onto the card again I'm

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.260 
any of the glue onto the card again I'm
using<00:03:52.440> Elmer's<00:03:52.740> glue<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.580> for<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.880> edges

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
using Elmer's glue to that for the edges

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.540 
using Elmer's glue to that for the edges
and<00:03:54.450> then<00:03:55.020> a<00:03:55.050> glue<00:03:55.380> stick<00:03:55.410> for<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:56.040> center<00:03:56.460> of

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
and then a glue stick for the center of

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:14.870 
and then a glue stick for the center of
the<00:03:56.670> card

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.800 

you<00:04:15.420> take<00:04:15.630> off<00:04:15.780> any<00:04:15.990> extraneous<00:04:17.690> pieces<00:04:18.690> of

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
you take off any extraneous pieces of

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.030 
you take off any extraneous pieces of
glue<00:04:19.520> okay<00:04:20.520> again<00:04:20.700> align<00:04:21.300> the<00:04:21.510> cardstock<00:04:22.260> to

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
glue okay again align the cardstock to

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.700 
glue okay again align the cardstock to
the<00:04:23.160> center<00:04:23.610> fold<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:25.350> want<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.560> make<00:04:25.680> sure

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
the center fold you want to make sure

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.470 
the center fold you want to make sure
that<00:04:26.010> it's<00:04:26.250> properly<00:04:26.670> aligned<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.270> center

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
that it's properly aligned to the center

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.610 
that it's properly aligned to the center
folds<00:04:27.810> when<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.050> open<00:04:28.380> it<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.890> opens<00:04:29.220> properly

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
folds when you open it it opens properly

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.980 
folds when you open it it opens properly
like<00:04:31.620> so<00:04:35.210> now<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.270> may<00:04:36.450> have<00:04:36.540> noticed<00:04:36.870> that

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
like so now you may have noticed that

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
like so now you may have noticed that
the<00:04:37.410> edges<00:04:37.740> were<00:04:37.830> not<00:04:38.010> perfectly<00:04:38.570> all<00:04:39.570> the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
the edges were not perfectly all the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.730 
the edges were not perfectly all the
side<00:04:41.010> edges<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:42.140> top<00:04:43.140> and<00:04:43.350> bottom<00:04:43.470> edges

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
side edges and the top and bottom edges

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.730 
side edges and the top and bottom edges
weren't<00:04:44.070> perfectly<00:04:44.400> aligned<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:45.600> could<00:04:45.750> trim

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
weren't perfectly aligned you could trim

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.780 
weren't perfectly aligned you could trim
off<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:48.120> edges<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.690> few<00:04:49.440> millimeters<00:04:49.950> and<00:04:50.130> this

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
off the edges a few millimeters and this

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.500 
off the edges a few millimeters and this
will<00:04:52.100> align<00:04:53.100> both<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.730> center<00:04:54.060> white

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
will align both of the center white

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:08.400 
will align both of the center white
cardstock<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.830> outer<00:04:56.040> pink<00:04:56.490> card

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.040 

okay<00:05:09.160> the<00:05:09.430> next<00:05:09.670> step<00:05:09.850> is<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:10.150> glue<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.630> tails

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
okay the next step is to glue the tails

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.500 
okay the next step is to glue the tails
on<00:05:11.320> now<00:05:12.040> you've<00:05:12.430> already<00:05:12.610> followed<00:05:13.120> the<00:05:13.240> tails

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
on now you've already followed the tails

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.410 
on now you've already followed the tails
I'm<00:05:14.320> gonna<00:05:14.470> put<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.800> glue<00:05:15.010> on<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.250> small<00:05:16.090> tabs

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
I'm gonna put the glue on the small tabs

these<00:05:21.130> tails<00:05:21.490> are<00:05:21.940> identical<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:22.870> you<00:05:23.010> could

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
these tails are identical so you could

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.360 
these tails are identical so you could
use<00:05:24.160> either<00:05:24.400> tail<00:05:24.760> for<00:05:25.090> either<00:05:25.270> bird<00:05:25.710> and<00:05:26.710> make

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
in this example I'm going to use the

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:21.300 
in this example I'm going to use the
simple<00:06:11.520> simple<00:06:12.520> hearts

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310

okay<00:06:22.030> so<00:06:22.330> again<00:06:23.430> luckily<00:06:24.430> we<00:06:24.760> do<00:06:24.880> not<00:06:25.000> glue<00:06:25.270> the

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
okay so again luckily we do not glue the

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.379 
okay so again luckily we do not glue the
beaks<00:06:25.810> together<00:06:26.200> so<00:06:26.530> we<00:06:26.650> could<00:06:26.770> slide<00:06:27.130> in<00:06:27.400> the

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
beaks together so we could slide in the

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.360 
beaks together so we could slide in the
little<00:06:28.630> hearts<00:06:28.900> between<00:06:29.320> the<00:06:29.410> beaks<00:06:29.590> now<00:06:30.310> you

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
little hearts between the beaks now you

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.970 
little hearts between the beaks now you
want<00:06:30.610> to<00:06:30.700> put<00:06:31.270> the<00:06:31.419> parts<00:06:31.840> in<00:06:32.020> there<00:06:32.290> open

it<00:06:35.190> aligns<00:06:36.190> properly<00:06:36.880> and<00:06:37.090> then<00:06:37.870> once<00:06:38.290> you're

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.430 
then you could dab a little bit of glue
