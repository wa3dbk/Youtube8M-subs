this excess estrogen your body your body
is<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.290> to<00:00:58.380> go<00:00:58.559> through<00:00:58.770> this

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
is going to go through this

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.310 
is going to go through this
aromatization<00:00:59.640> process<00:01:00.420> which<00:01:00.989> converts

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
aromatization process which converts

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.750 
aromatization process which converts
some<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> testosterone<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.579> have
