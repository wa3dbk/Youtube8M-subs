 reforestation of the riverbanks that 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:27.180
 They provide water for more reservoirs 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:29.490
 trees should mean more rain 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.369
 dam of the river Atibainha between

 of supply of the metropolitan region 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.840
 this is why the maintenance of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.149
 forest fragments like this one in 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.570
 nazaré paulista about 100 km 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.870
 of the capital is fundamental is this forest 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.859
 that guarantees quality water 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.129
 in a spring 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.490
 the hill valley site is the leisure area 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.970

 mainly native to the Atlantic Forest 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.710
 around the river springs 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.530
 the initiative of the producer program 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.799
 water of the ana national water agency 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.360

 launching the water campaign for são paulo 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.890
 to make an alert though Brazil 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.700
 has about 12% of all fresh water 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.820
 of the planet 80% of the resource is in the region 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.790
 north in great são paulo the demand today 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.770
 is 4% higher than the supply of 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.090
 reservoirs in the system region 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.580
 We have about 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.679
 50 thousand hectares of riparian forests 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.480
 should be covered with forests and 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.840
 people are only about 15 thousand 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.700
 covered with flowers 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.319
 I mean, that shows up a little bit 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.209
 that in the most important region of water 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.500
 by one in the metropolitan area of São 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.560
 Paulo, how much work do you have to do? 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.739
 made to recover the quality of these 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.739
 springs
