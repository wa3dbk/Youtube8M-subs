00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
ship and they test their water and they

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.580 
ship and they test their water and they
check<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> water<00:00:52.730> this<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.850> done<00:00:54.149> by

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
check the water this is done by

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.170 
check the water this is done by
engineers<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> company<00:00:56.879> let's<00:00:57.030> say

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
engineers from the company let's say

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.970 
engineers from the company let's say
that<00:00:57.390> gets<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> whatever<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.649> from<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that gets the whatever so from the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.490 
that gets the whatever so from the
government<00:00:59.489> side<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:01.079> are<00:01:01.199> people

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
government side of you there are people

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.349 
government side of you there are people
they<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.710> checking<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> water<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.149> what

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
they are checking the water and so what

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.179 
they are checking the water and so what
sort<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.600> condition<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.260> option<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.860> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
sort of condition is it a option is it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.429 
sort of condition is it a option is it
quite<00:01:05.430> good<00:01:05.689> there<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> problem<00:01:07.320> with

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
quite good there is not a problem with

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.050 
quite good there is not a problem with
the<00:01:07.500> quality<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.070> working<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.790> will<00:01:09.030> be

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the quality of working so you will be

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.560 
the quality of working so you will be
able<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.420> drink<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.810> yeah<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:12.060> reservoir

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
able to drink it yeah the reservoir
