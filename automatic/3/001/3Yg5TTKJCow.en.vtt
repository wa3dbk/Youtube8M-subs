00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.580 
hundred square feet per hour processing
you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.439> also<00:01:55.799> double<00:01:56.609> that<00:01:56.789> if<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.929> take<00:01:58.529> two

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
you can also double that if you take two

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.979 
you can also double that if you take two
machines<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.489> attach<00:02:00.270> them<00:02:00.479> together<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.959> a

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
tandem bar which would basically a

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.659 
tandem bar which would basically a
double<00:02:04.469> your<00:02:04.739> production<00:02:05.039> rate<00:02:05.309> in<00:02:05.489> both

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:05.669 
double your production rate in both

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:07.429 
double your production rate in both
environments<00:02:06.209> either<00:02:06.389> encapsulation<00:02:07.169> or

why dry compound I'm going to show you
the<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:38.430> concept<00:02:39.150> behind<00:02:39.470> what<00:02:40.470> why<00:02:40.830> we<00:02:41.010> use

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the the concept behind what why we use

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.100 
the the concept behind what why we use
this<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.720> ink<00:02:43.440> out<00:02:43.710> of<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.130> regular<00:02:45.110> pen

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
this so this is ink out of a regular pen

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.180 
this so this is ink out of a regular pen
that's<00:02:46.920> gonna<00:02:47.100> represent<00:02:47.460> our<00:02:47.700> soil<00:02:48.030> okay<00:02:49.190> I'm

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that's gonna represent our soil okay I'm

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.060 
that's gonna represent our soil okay I'm
going<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> take<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.520> little<00:02:50.730> bit<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.940> compound

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
going to take a little bit of compound

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.320 
going to take a little bit of compound
and<00:02:53.070> put<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.430> right<00:02:53.490> there<00:02:55.310> on<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.370> area

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
and put that right there on that area

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.320 
and put that right there on that area
and<00:02:58.550> this<00:02:59.550> will<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.510> agitation<00:03:02.150> as<00:03:03.150> you

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
and this will be the agitation as you

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.440 
and this will be the agitation as you
see<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:04.140> breaks<00:03:04.470> down<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.950> ink<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.450> absorbs

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
see it breaks down the ink and absorbs

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.820 
see it breaks down the ink and absorbs
it<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.980> ink<00:03:08.990> is<00:03:09.990> absorbed<00:03:10.560> into<00:03:10.710> the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
it so the ink is absorbed into the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.610 
it so the ink is absorbed into the
compound<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.960> becomes<00:03:13.500> your

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
compound and that becomes your

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.130 
compound and that becomes your
extraction<00:03:14.190> process<00:03:14.670> right<00:03:14.910> there<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:16.050> this

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
extraction process right there and this

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.250 
extraction process right there and this
is<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.350> nice<00:03:16.620> visual<00:03:16.950> for<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.000> show<00:03:18.240> people<00:03:18.660> how

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
is a nice visual for you show people how

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.220 
is a nice visual for you show people how
compound<00:03:19.860> works
