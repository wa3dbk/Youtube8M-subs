00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.440
 how many times have you heard one 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.119
 person who diet but does not lose weight 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.070
 how many times have you received your studies 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.210
 a person who after doing one 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.610
 food evaluation 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.080
 daily and it seems impossible that it is 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.510
 on leave 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.210
 in these cases we are facing or 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.710
 sometimes adding this to soccer 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.350
 or we find ourselves dealing with 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.570
 with a person who for some reason is 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.260
 affected by andrea and dysmetabolism 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.970
 linked to its oxidative capacity 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.170
 statistically static I can tell you that 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.530
 this condition 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.149
 you find about 15 20 percent of the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.970
 people who turn to me 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.360
 after being abused often and or 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.070
 do not believe in the hills as already 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.790
 explained my video article 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.670
 previous one 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.680
 in short, calories in medicine not 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.290
 we grow fat simply 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.910
 because we eat more the story that 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.130
 is told to us 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.560
 about the calories they give up 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.360
 those consumed in large oars while 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.920
 they are inferior to those consumed by 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.470
 mario I'm afraid they are partially 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:30.170
 correct but highly misleading as 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.210
 previously explained the various 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.159
 interventions of our articles 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.010
 organism is not a stove that drop of 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.799
 minds but the foods once broken down 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.500
 micro macro nutrients that make up 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.020
 they are sown thus giving birth to one 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.210
 series of endocrine hormonal reactions 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.500
 my Jewish takes away which will activate 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.369
 will shut down specific metabolic pathway 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.960
 I advise all those who are 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.030
 interested in learning more about the subject 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.100
 to take a look at my video article 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.880
 on enjoying the calories you find 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.610
 published in youtube and in itunes le 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.829
 send instead the theme concerns instead the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.290
 Today's theme that is why people in 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.720
 strict diet fail to lose weight 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.790
 the reasons can be several 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.260
 simplest reason is given by the type of 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.200
 used animals 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.120
 of the program to limit as well as the 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.569
 freedom breakdown of customers during 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.659
 the day you remember 100 kcal 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.730
 ricardi the 100 kcal of pasta you are 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.890
 burned in a calorie in a field of m 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.769
 they always give 102 knights but if 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.769
 introduced into a biological organism 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.560
 therefore they produce very different results 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.720
 in these cases a careful analysis of the 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.269
 food program structure with 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.310
 consequent change in the reports of 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.180
 customers and giuseppe in general 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.099
 enough to resolve the issue 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.200
 however there are cases in which it is the 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.359
 quantity that the quality of what 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.489
 it is consumed during the day not 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.609
 justifies the fact that not that not 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.069
 exams are also lost 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.650
 related to thyroid function as well 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.120
 how the major hormonal axis results 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.359
 be normal 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.489
 and yet they suffer a great one 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.829
 overweight suffer from falling are 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.379
 expected in these houses usually the 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.480
 problem can be given by any 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.760
 drugs that they have taken or that are 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.919
 taking but chronic pull there are 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.049
 drugs with hormonal action such as ad 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.750
 example a contraceptive pill the 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:33.829
 cortisone anti-inflammatory drugs not 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.049
 some antihistamine steroids some drugs 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.760
 to regulate blood pressure 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.609
 statins for the control of 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.579
 cholesterol etc. so on that they have 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.870
 an action becomes on the metabolic pathways 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.780
 relating to the situation of the various are 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.260
 energy states and sugar and amino acids 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.750
 fats these molecules act by inhibiting 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.449
 in some more sensitive subjects 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.790
 the proliferation of vito melt though 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:00.709
 let's dream of high structures 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.470
 generically called organelles 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.690
 present in our cells and deputies 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.010
 at various levels to the oxidation of 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.900
 food substrates for energy purposes 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.239
 whoever came out used the pill 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.859
 contraceptive the prosthesis knows this well 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.500
 than maintaining power 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.880
 stuffed the simple introduction of 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.280
 these drugs bring about a change 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.500
 from body composition in some 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.440
 cases the change is minimal or just 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.030
 perceptible in many others we witness 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.280
 to a progressive weight gain 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.320
 however not huge but exist 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.080
 important slice of the population in which 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.550
 the answer turns out to be so 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.470
 important in just a few 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.420
 weeks the person literally yes 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.280
 turns 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.990
 of course what was said for the first 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.570
 of cortisone also applies to others 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.820
 drugs I have previously 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.190
 mentioned in these cases you can search 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.750
 the rule and you can try to regulate 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.890
 the power supply to contain 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.770
 weight gain 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.530
 however until you use the 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.330
 drug will be almost impossible 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.610
 family 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.470
 moreover the succession of the drug does not 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.490
 always coincides when you pristina of 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.470
 Roman 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.350
 there are people who before returning to 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.710
 function normally functional between 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.930
 quotes need months and others is me 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.510
 it happened often connected that it arrives 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.880
 to the profits that arrived land taken on 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.070
 birth control pills you need 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.980
 instead many years 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.390
 or I stop here for today then with the 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.340
 first part of the video and I give you 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.840
 appointment for a few days for the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.980
 second part 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.980
 thanks for having me similar
