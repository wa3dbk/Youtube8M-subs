00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
a 400 watt power supply with 80-plus

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.900 
a 400 watt power supply with 80-plus
efficiency<00:00:23.500> and<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:25.420> is<00:00:25.660> just<00:00:26.020> for<00:00:26.320> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
efficiency and this is just for a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.310 
efficiency and this is just for a
computer<00:00:27.910> that<00:00:28.090> you<00:00:28.330> know<00:00:28.449> I<00:00:28.480> had<00:00:29.020> enough

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
computer that you know I had enough

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.590 
computer that you know I had enough
packs<00:00:29.650> to<00:00:29.920> build<00:00:30.130> another<00:00:30.400> PC<00:00:30.880> Xone<00:00:30.910> to<00:00:31.449> make

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
packs to build another PC Xone to make

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.139 
packs to build another PC Xone to make
sure<00:00:31.779> that<00:00:31.960> it<00:00:32.920> has<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.129> better<00:00:33.370> person<00:00:33.940> plate

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
sure that it has a better person plate

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.139 
sure that it has a better person plate
then<00:00:34.960> then<00:00:35.590> you<00:00:35.829> know<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.340> usual<00:00:36.670> ones<00:00:36.850> so<00:00:37.120> I

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
then then you know the usual ones so I

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.750 
then then you know the usual ones so I
picked<00:00:37.660> this<00:00:37.809> up<00:00:37.960> on<00:00:38.110> picks<00:00:38.350> menu<00:00:38.680> for<00:00:38.920> 30

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
picked this up on picks menu for 30

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.440 
picked this up on picks menu for 30
years<00:00:40.059> which<00:00:40.480> is<00:00:40.780> I<00:00:41.079> think<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.800> great<00:00:42.040> price

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

believe and that floppy with some molex
cables<00:01:13.420> on<00:01:13.539> as<00:01:13.689> well<00:01:13.899> and<00:01:16.020> there's<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.259> actual

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:17.819 
cables on as well and there's the actual

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.359 
cables on as well and there's the actual
specifications<00:01:18.819> of<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.349> first<00:01:20.349> apply<00:01:20.709> as<00:01:21.219> you

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
specifications of the first apply as you

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.309 
specifications of the first apply as you
can<00:01:21.520> see<00:01:21.670> it's<00:01:21.819> got<00:01:21.969> two<00:01:22.149> 12-volt<00:01:22.810> rails

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
can see it's got two 12-volt rails

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.779 
can see it's got two 12-volt rails
running<00:01:23.859> at<00:01:24.159> 17<00:01:24.819> amps<00:01:25.479> each<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:27.340> total

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
running at 17 amps each and then total

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:33.239 
running at 17 amps each and then total
of<00:01:27.880> 400<00:01:28.420> watts<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:31.499> so<00:01:32.499> let's<00:01:32.679> get<00:01:32.859> it<00:01:32.950> opened

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
of 400 watts and so let's get it opened

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:39.949 
of 400 watts and so let's get it opened
up<00:01:33.340> so<00:01:35.009> inside<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.159> box<00:01:36.399> you<00:01:36.669> get<00:01:37.319> the<00:01:38.669> manual

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
up so inside the box you get the manual

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:42.870 
up so inside the box you get the manual
user<00:01:40.959> manual<00:01:41.439> in<00:01:41.829> thenor<00:01:42.399> you<00:01:42.490> got<00:01:42.669> your

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
user manual in thenor you got your

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.909 
user manual in thenor you got your
standard<00:01:43.270> how<00:01:43.569> to<00:01:43.630> set<00:01:43.959> it<00:01:43.990> up<00:01:44.200> how<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:44.439> use<00:01:44.740> it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:44.919 
standard how to set it up how to use it

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:48.569 
standard how to set it up how to use it
and<00:01:45.419> you<00:01:46.419> get<00:01:46.599> a<00:01:46.659> power<00:01:47.259> cable<00:01:47.499> you<00:01:48.279> can<00:01:48.310> see

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
and you get a power cable you can see

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.349 
and you get a power cable you can see
here<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.969> Irish<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.899> UK<00:01:50.200> plug<00:01:50.669> and<00:01:51.669> then

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
here the Irish and the UK plug and then

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.620 
here the Irish and the UK plug and then
you<00:01:52.509> get<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:52.959> power<00:01:53.709> supply<00:01:54.069> itself<00:01:54.459> which<00:01:55.419> is

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
you get the power supply itself which is

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.239 
you get the power supply itself which is
quite<00:01:56.049> light<00:01:56.429> you<00:01:57.429> also<00:01:57.579> have<00:01:57.849> a<00:01:57.880> bag<00:01:58.659> of

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249 
quite light you also have a bag of

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:04.730 
quite light you also have a bag of
screws<00:02:00.249> to<00:02:00.849> screw<00:02:00.939> it<00:02:01.119> onto<00:02:01.239> your<00:02:01.389> case<00:02:02.819> so

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
screws to screw it onto your case so

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.279 
screws to screw it onto your case so
you<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.640> see<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.939> first<00:02:06.259> time<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:08.009> uh<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
you can see the first time but uh so the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.030 
you can see the first time but uh so the
power<00:02:10.500> supply<00:02:10.530> comes<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.819> bubble<00:02:12.120> wrap<00:02:13.040> take

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
power supply comes in a bubble wrap take

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.720 
power supply comes in a bubble wrap take
it<00:02:14.220> off<00:02:14.340> here<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.239> this<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.160> back<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
it off here so this is the back of the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.460 
it off here so this is the back of the
power<00:02:17.940> supply<00:02:18.000> it's<00:02:18.569> got<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> kind<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.380> a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
power supply it's got a kind of a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.400 
power supply it's got a kind of a
honeycomb<00:02:19.849> mesh<00:02:20.849> thing<00:02:21.420> for<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> better

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
honeycomb mesh thing for a better

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.330 
honeycomb mesh thing for a better
airflow<00:02:22.970> power<00:02:23.970> plug<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.680> on/off<00:02:25.680> switch<00:02:25.950> you

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
airflow power plug and on/off switch you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.380 
airflow power plug and on/off switch you
can<00:02:26.459> see<00:02:26.640> here<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.790> thing<00:02:29.790> might<00:02:30.180> be

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
can see here this is a thing might be

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.339 
can see here this is a thing might be
probably<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.349> 12<00:02:31.620> centimeter<00:02:32.099> pan<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:33.660> should

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
probably a 12 centimeter pan it should

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.130 
probably a 12 centimeter pan it should
be<00:02:34.500> quite<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.610> know<00:02:35.730> looks<00:02:36.390> nice<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.780> overall

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
be quite you know looks nice the overall
