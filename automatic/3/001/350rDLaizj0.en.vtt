first<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:31.019> actives<00:00:31.650> actives<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.430> would<00:00:32.579> highly

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
first is actives actives I would highly

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.450 
first is actives actives I would highly
recommend<00:00:33.450> getting<00:00:33.480> blink<00:00:34.040> because<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.340> may

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
recommend getting blink because you may

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.479 
recommend getting blink because you may
hear<00:00:35.820> me<00:00:35.940> baring<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.750> Cervantes<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:37.920> get

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
hear me baring a Cervantes to with get

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.580 
hear me baring a Cervantes to with get
their<00:00:39.120> scalings<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.899> pretty<00:00:40.260> much<00:00:40.379> almost

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
their scalings are pretty much almost

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.170 
their scalings are pretty much almost
the<00:00:40.800> same<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.070> think<00:00:41.280> they<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> same<00:00:41.610> HP

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
the same I think they have the same HP

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.290 
the same I think they have the same HP
scaling<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.110> almost<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> same<00:00:44.219> ulti<00:00:44.640> so

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
scaling so and almost the same ulti so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.299 
scaling so and almost the same ulti so
you<00:00:45.420> may<00:00:46.079> want<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.289> compare<00:00:46.440> those<00:00:46.739> two<00:00:46.920> except

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you may want to compare those two except

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.310 
you may want to compare those two except
the<00:00:47.430> difference<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.820> Sylvanas<00:00:48.270> has<00:00:48.420> no<00:00:49.020> type

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the difference is Sylvanas has no type

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.810 
the difference is Sylvanas has no type
of<00:00:49.500> movement<00:00:49.890> speed<00:00:49.950> increase<00:00:50.430> he<00:00:50.579> has<00:00:50.670> no

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
of movement speed increase he has no

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.500 
of movement speed increase he has no
type<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> initiation<00:00:52.410> ability<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:54.360> it's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
type of initiation ability so it's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.510 
type of initiation ability so it's
strongly<00:00:55.020> strongly<00:00:55.949> recommend<00:00:56.370> buying

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
strongly strongly recommend buying

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.240

greater blink for the short 45 second

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.689 
greater blink for the short 45 second
cooldown<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.230> keep<00:01:01.559> using<00:01:01.710> royalty

ulti is damage over time Nick eats you

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.909 
ulti is damage over time Nick eats you
know<00:04:20.060> shooting<00:04:20.419> at<00:04:20.539> them<00:04:20.750> so<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.500> first<00:04:21.680> a

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
know shooting at them so that first a

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.550 
know shooting at them so that first a
damage<00:04:22.280> tick<00:04:22.690> which<00:04:23.690> is<00:04:23.900> err

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
damage tick which is err

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.280 
damage tick which is err
body<00:04:24.740> within<00:04:25.040> this<00:04:25.400> radius<00:04:25.639> here<00:04:26.180> they<00:04:27.169> would

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
body within this radius here they would

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.350 
body within this radius here they would
be<00:04:27.530> hit<00:04:27.919> with<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.100> jump<00:04:28.280> isolation<00:04:28.910> passive

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
be hit with the jump isolation passive

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.200 
be hit with the jump isolation passive
so<00:04:29.480> they'll<00:04:29.630> be<00:04:29.690> moving<00:04:30.070> 25%<00:04:31.070> slower<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.669> it

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
so they'll be moving 25% slower and it

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.760 
so they'll be moving 25% slower and it
keeps<00:04:32.419> refreshing<00:04:32.960> because<00:04:33.110> wisp<00:04:33.560> is<00:04:33.740> a

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
keeps refreshing because wisp is a

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.190 
keeps refreshing because wisp is a
damage<00:04:34.160> over<00:04:34.430> time<00:04:34.460> effect<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.540> teamfights

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
damage over time effect so teamfights

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.780 
damage over time effect so teamfights

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
great you get increased movements

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.420 
great you get increased movements
because<00:04:50.690> service<00:04:50.900> is<00:04:51.139> really<00:04:51.350> slow<00:04:51.470> magic

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430
