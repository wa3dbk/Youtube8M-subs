00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.340
 and I believe that the olive challenge does not 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:08.769
 happens because he told us very reason big 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.380
 pathways reason is true that they have written 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.349
 seven foreigners but when it occurs 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.810
 the illicit of the seventh foreigner is 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.239
 when they do play at aparicio it 's 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.720
 say in all the games where there is 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:25.449
 participated aparicio has been committed the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.649
 illicit because he is the seventh player of 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.140
 Bolivian professional soccer league 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.720
 that's why it's clear from all 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.510
 reports that when it arrives because if the 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.820
 player would have kept the inscription 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.990
 last year's seventh player 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.770
 would have been berodia 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:46.160
 but it's not the player who's appeared, 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.130
 they change for a certain alfonso who had already 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.490
 played then when playing aparicio in the 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.460
 pitch there is that is committed 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.460
 in success and appearance although this does not 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.110
 believe does not play against bolÃ­var in the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.500
 party winning team 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.940
 wilstermann by 6 goals to 0 or 50 already 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.690
 I understand that if the player is not there 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:15.620
 that by acting provoked the law 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.920
 more song because the other six are 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.170
 well enabled is the seventh is that no 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.620
 is well qualified and that also goes in 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.910
 against the statutes of the federation 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.970
 Bolivian football and league 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:33.800
 professional soccer world why I 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:37.790
 I'm more sure that real potosÃ­ 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.070
 oriente tanker and the other one I think is 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.310
 Aurora and the Federation Court 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.470
 Bolivian football to fail in favor 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.180
 of those equipment removing the points to the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.190
 wilstermann team I think here 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.990
 no matter 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.330
 punishable because the crime was not committed 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.360
 truly the widespread crime have 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.940
 put seven players but if we apply 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.900
 what the league court says that 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.450
 does not exist and because of how and when and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.850
 the explanations that are paid 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.710
 you can save him from wilstermann me 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.530
 I think once they get saved but from the 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.560
 three I do not think they come out I think 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.989
 yes he played 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.510
 aparicio was fine but does not play 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.510
 I see so bolÃ­var 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.870
 as it does not have a legal support 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.450
 he is going so big that there are seven 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.060
 registered but that's not because the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.319
 guy who should have played did not play butt 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.319
 the bad heart
