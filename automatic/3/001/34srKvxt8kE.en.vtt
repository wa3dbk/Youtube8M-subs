00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.849 
gargoyles it's funny it's clever its
touching<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.230> actually<00:02:34.349> sort<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.769> an

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
touching and it's actually sort of an

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.369 
touching and it's actually sort of an
interesting<00:02:35.069> dive<00:02:35.760> into<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.359> rat<00:02:36.540> psyche<00:02:37.140> I

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.789 
again is just sort of a boring village
chef<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:48.030> rat<00:02:48.269> family<00:02:48.540> which<00:02:48.989> again<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.590> just
