00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
amazing what this all I had to do a

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.570 
amazing what this all I had to do a
second<00:00:19.199> recording<00:00:19.590> because<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.279> hit<00:00:20.430> me

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
second recording because it hit me

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.010 
second recording because it hit me
halfway<00:00:20.730> through<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> other<00:00:21.300> recording<00:00:21.779> what

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020

halfway through the other recording what
was<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.150> I<00:00:24.150> feel<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.720> first

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
was going on and I feel that the first

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.080 
was going on and I feel that the first
recording<00:00:25.230> wasn't<00:00:25.500> doing<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.769> justice<00:00:26.160> so

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
recording wasn't doing it justice so

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.290 
recording wasn't doing it justice so
Durant<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.289> entrainment<00:00:28.939> gives<00:00:29.939> true

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
Durant with that entrainment gives true

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.020 
Durant with that entrainment gives true
on<00:00:30.449> ability<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.410> politoed<00:00:32.160> making<00:00:32.640> him<00:00:32.759> just

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
on ability to politoed making him just

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.580 
on ability to politoed making him just
an<00:00:33.230> absolute<00:00:34.230> punk<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:35.579> here's<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.260> why

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
an absolute punk so here's this is why

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.040 
an absolute punk so here's this is why
it<00:00:37.649> works<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.250> well<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.790> you're<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> do

you<00:01:11.729> guys<00:01:11.820> might<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.720> thinking<00:01:13.080> well<00:01:13.110> why

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you guys might be thinking well why

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.740 
you guys might be thinking well why
doesn't<00:01:13.740> he<00:01:13.950> switch<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:15.030> didn't<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.540> it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
doesn't he switch out it didn't if it

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.749 
doesn't he switch out it didn't if it
didn't<00:01:16.020> hit<00:01:16.170> me<00:01:16.380> until<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:17.040> couple<00:01:17.280> turns<00:01:17.580> in

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
didn't hit me until a couple turns in

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.410 
didn't hit me until a couple turns in
where<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:19.229> doctor<00:01:19.530> has<00:01:19.590> arena<00:01:20.040> trap<00:01:20.420> this

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420

poly<00:01:21.689> tote<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.140> locked<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.770> he<00:01:23.009> can't<00:01:23.250> do

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
poly tote is locked out he can't do

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.510 
poly tote is locked out he can't do
anything<00:01:23.580> about<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:25.070> don't<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.280> was<00:01:26.369> just

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
anything about this don't you I was just

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.580 
anything about this don't you I was just
going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> use<00:01:27.180> home<00:01:27.390> claws<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.200> couple<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
going to use home claws and a couple of

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.350 
going to use home claws and a couple of
you<00:01:28.710> probably<00:01:28.860> thinking<00:01:29.280> why<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:29.970> he<00:01:30.210> using

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you probably thinking why is he using

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.380 
you probably thinking why is he using
home<00:01:30.720> claws<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:31.610> like<00:01:32.610> aren't<00:01:33.360> there

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
home claws that's not like aren't there

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.780 
home claws that's not like aren't there
better<00:01:33.659> ways<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.900> boost<00:01:34.290> yourself<00:01:34.790> what's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
better ways to boost yourself what's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.230 
better ways to boost yourself what's
going<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.420> I'm<00:01:37.140> predicting<00:01:38.070> Fisher<00:01:38.430> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
going on here I'm predicting Fisher you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.319 
going on here I'm predicting Fisher you
know<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.780> max<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.380> your<00:01:40.740> accuracy<00:01:41.549> you're

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
know if you max out your accuracy you're

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.789 
know if you max out your accuracy you're
going<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.689> get<00:01:42.780> i<00:01:42.840> believe<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.350> three<00:01:43.619> times

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
going to get i believe it's three times

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.819 
going to get i believe it's three times
accuracy<00:01:44.460> which<00:01:45.030> pretty<00:01:45.689> much<00:01:45.840> makes<00:01:46.290> Fisher

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
accuracy which pretty much makes Fisher

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.940 
accuracy which pretty much makes Fisher
a<00:01:47.130> hundred<00:01:47.759> percent<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:49.170> who<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.470> move<00:01:49.710> at

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
a hundred percent a one who can move at
