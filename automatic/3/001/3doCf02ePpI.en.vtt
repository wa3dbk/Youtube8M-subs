00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.779 

the<00:01:43.280> idea<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:43.789> explain<00:01:44.149> the<00:01:44.299> same<00:01:44.479> thing

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
the idea to explain the same thing

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.209 
the idea to explain the same thing
basically<00:01:46.789> there's<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.469> pretty<00:01:48.469> easy<00:01:48.619> chord

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
basically there's a pretty easy chord

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.730 
basically there's a pretty easy chord
progression<00:01:49.640> we<00:01:50.210> had<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.509> FC<00:01:51.500> in<00:01:51.649> the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
progression we had the FC in the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.770 
progression we had the FC in the
beginning<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.250> then<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:52.850> intro<00:01:53.270> i<00:01:53.479> play<00:01:53.750> it

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
kind of in between the verse and of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.020 
kind of in between the verse and of
course<00:01:56.659> so<00:01:57.200> my<00:01:57.470> verse<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:58.130> play<00:01:58.399> a<00:01:58.429> lot<00:01:58.789> of<00:01:58.939> this

pre-course that kind of do things in
between<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.200> have<00:02:32.640> arpeggios<00:02:33.640> here

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
between that so I have arpeggios here

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.199 
between that so I have arpeggios here
and<00:02:34.659> I<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.870> patterns<00:02:35.440> for<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:35.860> course<00:02:36.209> so

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
and I have patterns for the course so

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.789 
and I have patterns for the course so
for<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.569> other<00:02:37.720> parts<00:02:38.110> like<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.409> intro<00:02:38.769> and

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799

for the other parts like the intro and
the<00:02:39.040> pre-chorus<00:02:39.519> I<00:02:39.790> kind<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.060> do<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:40.330> between

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
the pre-chorus I kind of do in between

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:54.430 
the pre-chorus I kind of do in between
so<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.950> beginning

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.500 

and<00:02:54.800> then<00:02:55.490> when<00:02:55.580> i<00:02:55.610> get<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:55.880> very<00:02:56.120> site<00:02:56.360> is

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
and then when i get to the very site is

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.820 
and then when i get to the very site is
too<00:02:56.690> simple

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.690 

you

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.410 

hold<00:03:21.140> on<00:03:21.319> that<00:03:21.500> seat<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.069> then<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:23.060> drove<00:03:23.300> the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
hold on that seat and then I drove the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.839 
hold on that seat and then I drove the
course<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.959> course<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:25.160> showed<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.489> is<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.700> big

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
course of course I showed you is the big

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:33.809 
course of course I showed you is the big
patterns

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:41.600 

you

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:50.600 

see<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.760> confusing<00:03:43.270> part<00:03:43.330> we<00:03:43.959> go

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.810 

ok<00:03:51.210> so<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.660> course<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.290> we<00:03:53.220> do<00:03:53.370> this<00:03:53.520> part

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
ok so the course is we do this part

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.240 
ok so the course is we do this part
twice<00:03:54.440> then<00:03:55.440> we<00:03:55.530> go<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.950> which<00:03:56.220> is

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
twice then we go to that which is

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.980 
twice then we go to that which is
basically<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.820> same<00:03:56.970> thing<00:03:57.030> they<00:03:57.540> just<00:03:57.570> kind

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
basically the same thing they just kind

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.140 
basically the same thing they just kind
of<00:03:58.050> changed<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.530> way<00:03:58.650> they<00:03:58.800> play<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.100> and<00:04:00.000> then

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
of changed the way they play it and then

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.420 
of changed the way they play it and then
we<00:04:00.240> go<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.540> second<00:04:00.900> line<00:04:01.050> which<00:04:01.800> is<00:04:02.010> G

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
we go to the second line which is G

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.230 
we go to the second line which is G
minor<00:04:02.670> C<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.590> we<00:04:04.590> go<00:04:04.710> to<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.890> f<00:04:05.070> after<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:06.030> we

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
minor C and we go to the f after that we

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.690 
minor C and we go to the f after that we
take<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.570> dsl<00:04:07.170> coda<00:04:07.500> which<00:04:08.010> means<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.400> go<00:04:08.520> back

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
take the dsl coda which means we go back

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.630 
take the dsl coda which means we go back
to<00:04:08.730> this<00:04:09.320> ok<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.950> second<00:04:11.250> time<00:04:11.340> through<00:04:11.520> you

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
to this ok the second time through you

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.590 
to this ok the second time through you
go<00:04:11.760> all<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.000> way<00:04:12.030> through<00:04:12.270> your<00:04:12.360> song<00:04:12.570> and

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
go all the way through your song and

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.570 
go all the way through your song and
when<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.080> get<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.380> co.design<00:04:13.710> you<00:04:14.310> skip

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
when you get to the co.design you skip

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.610 
when you get to the co.design you skip
to<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> other<00:04:14.910> co.design<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:16.410> there's<00:04:16.560> a

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
to the other co.design and there's a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.080 
to the other co.design and there's a
little<00:04:16.709> bridge<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:17.280> i<00:04:17.340> think<00:04:17.579> you<00:04:17.609> can<00:04:17.850> make

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
little bridge but i think you can make

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.670 
little bridge but i think you can make
up<00:04:18.209> your<00:04:18.239> own<00:04:18.359> parts<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:18.930> then<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.410> rest<00:04:19.560> of

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
up your own parts and then the rest of

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.270 
up your own parts and then the rest of
the<00:04:19.769> song<00:04:19.920> is<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.250> same<00:04:20.430> thing<00:04:20.670> ok<00:04:21.420> so<00:04:22.320> it's

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
the song is the same thing ok so it's

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.940 
the song is the same thing ok so it's
basically<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.760> same<00:04:23.850> couple<00:04:24.150> chords<00:04:24.390> just
