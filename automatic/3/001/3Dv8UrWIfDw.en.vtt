is my asymmetrical Dino 2x2
I<00:00:06.170> designed<00:00:07.170> this<00:00:07.319> cube<00:00:07.620> last<00:00:07.919> November<00:00:08.460> and

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
I designed this cube last November and

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.850 
I designed this cube last November and
printed<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.090> on<00:00:09.210> my<00:00:09.269> MakerBot<00:00:10.080> replicator<00:00:10.110> 2

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
printed it on my MakerBot replicator 2

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.480 
printed it on my MakerBot replicator 2
recently<00:00:12.110> this<00:00:13.110> type<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.380> puzzle<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:14.070> known<00:00:14.309> as

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
recently this type of puzzle is known as

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.550 
recently this type of puzzle is known as
a<00:00:14.519> hybrid<00:00:14.820> cube<00:00:15.330> however<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.260> don't<00:00:16.379> believe

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
a hybrid cube however I don't believe

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.380 
a hybrid cube however I don't believe
this<00:00:16.890> any<00:00:17.160> other<00:00:17.279> hybrid<00:00:17.850> cubes<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
this any other hybrid cubes on the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.580 
this any other hybrid cubes on the
market<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.080> rotate<00:00:19.619> similar<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.699> and

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
market that rotate similar to this and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.870 
market that rotate similar to this and
because<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.039> would<00:00:23.160> expect<00:00:23.519> that

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
because of that you would expect that

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029 
because of that you would expect that
this<00:00:24.150> cube<00:00:24.510> would<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:25.170> sort<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.439> unique

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
this cube would have some sort of unique

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.460 
this cube would have some sort of unique
solution<00:00:26.580> associated<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.480> however<00:00:28.140> I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
solution associated with it however I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.050 
solution associated with it however I
don't<00:00:28.740> believe<00:00:29.010> that's<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.429> case<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:29.910> this

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
don't believe that's the case with this

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.770 
don't believe that's the case with this
puzzle<00:00:30.650> with<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> deeper<00:00:32.130> cut<00:00:32.369> puzzle<00:00:33.210> similar

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
puzzle with a deeper cut puzzle similar

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.530 
puzzle with a deeper cut puzzle similar
to<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.110> then<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.399> puzzle<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.090> puzzle

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
to this then this puzzle this puzzle

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.319 
to this then this puzzle this puzzle
piece<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:37.200> would<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:38.180> interfering<00:00:39.180> with

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
piece here would be interfering with

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
piece here would be interfering with
this<00:00:39.570> dead<00:00:39.809> piece<00:00:40.079> over<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.739> then<00:00:41.160> you'd

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
this dead piece over here and then you'd

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.510 
this dead piece over here and then you'd
have<00:00:41.460> more<00:00:41.730> pieces<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.510> center<00:00:42.690> here<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
have more pieces in the center here and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.069 
have more pieces in the center here and
I<00:00:44.520> believe<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.000> would<00:00:45.149> create<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.809> unique

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I believe that would create a unique

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.799 
I believe that would create a unique
solution<00:00:46.289> however<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.390> cut<00:00:48.600> does

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
solution however because the cut does

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.470 
solution however because the cut does
not<00:00:48.989> extend<00:00:49.920> past<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.520> center<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> puzzle

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
not extend past the center of the puzzle

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.830 
not extend past the center of the puzzle
here<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:52.489> think<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.629> this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
here I think that this that this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.650 
here I think that this that this
particular<00:00:55.140> puzzle<00:00:55.829> would<00:00:56.010> solve<00:00:56.910> similar<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
particular puzzle would solve similar to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.920 
particular puzzle would solve similar to
a<00:00:57.690> time-machine<00:00:58.199> puzzle<00:00:59.629> to<00:01:00.629> make<00:01:00.780> this

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
a time-machine puzzle to make this

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.479 
a time-machine puzzle to make this
puzzle<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> little<00:01:01.530> bit<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:01.800> complicated

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
puzzle a little bit more complicated

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.490 
puzzle a little bit more complicated
what<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.780> take<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.229> blue

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
what I can do is I can take this blue

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.980 
what I can do is I can take this blue
piece<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.189> bandage<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.510> blue

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
piece here and bandage it to this blue

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.490 
piece here and bandage it to this blue
piece<00:01:07.200> here<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:09.420> will<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:10.049> create<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
piece here and that will not create a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.070 
piece here and that will not create a
completely<00:01:11.070> unique<00:01:11.400> solution<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
completely unique solution to this

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.990 
completely unique solution to this
puzzle<00:01:13.290> they'll<00:01:14.189> still<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:14.880> other

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
puzzle they'll still be some other

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.719 
puzzle they'll still be some other
twisty<00:01:15.420> puzzles<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> market<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:17.070> would

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
twisty puzzles on the market that would

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.249 
twisty puzzles on the market that would
have<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> similar<00:01:18.570> solution<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:21.259> it

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
have a similar solution to this but it

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.289 
have a similar solution to this but it
would<00:01:22.470> make<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.400> bit<00:01:23.610> more

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
would make it a little bit more

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.840 
would make it a little bit more
difficult<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.869> solve<00:01:25.340> this<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> first

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
difficult to solve this is the first

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.730 
difficult to solve this is the first
operational<00:01:27.479> prototype<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.170> I've<00:01:28.320> printed

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
operational prototype that I've printed

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.190 
operational prototype that I've printed
for<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.100> puzzle<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.520> far<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.200> originally

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
for this puzzle so far I originally

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.080 
for this puzzle so far I originally
designed<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.650> puzzle<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.490> 50

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
designed this puzzle to be a 50

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.109 
designed this puzzle to be a 50
millimeter<00:01:33.270> 2<00:01:33.720> by<00:01:33.840> 2<00:01:33.900> however<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.130> scaled<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
millimeter 2 by 2 however I scaled the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.499 
millimeter 2 by 2 however I scaled the
puzzle<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.720> significantly<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:39.030> 3d

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
puzzle up significantly so that the 3d

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.730 
puzzle up significantly so that the 3d
printer<00:01:39.720> would<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.170> any<00:01:40.320> trouble

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
printer would not have any trouble

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.889 
printer would not have any trouble
printing<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:42.840> now

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
printing this as you can see right now

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.280 
printing this as you can see right now
is<00:01:43.619> about<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> size<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> 62<00:01:44.970> millimeter<00:01:45.450> 4x4

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
is about the size of a 62 millimeter 4x4

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.690 
is about the size of a 62 millimeter 4x4
in<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.369> future<00:01:47.700> I'd<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:49.549> modify<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
in the future I'd like to modify the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.670 
in the future I'd like to modify the
clearances<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.720> puzzle<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.320> rotates

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
clearances on this puzzle so it rotates

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800 
clearances on this puzzle so it rotates
a<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.250> bit<00:01:53.369> better<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:54.299> I'd<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
a little bit better and then I'd like to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.749 
a little bit better and then I'd like to
scale<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.170> back<00:01:55.350> down<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.829> about<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> size<00:01:56.460> of

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
scale it back down to about the size of

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.520 
scale it back down to about the size of
a<00:01:57.119> 56<00:01:57.630> moment<00:01:58.020> or<00:01:58.110> 3x3<00:01:59.360> as<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:00.960> there

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
