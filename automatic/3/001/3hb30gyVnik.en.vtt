00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
short segments at a time it's kind of

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.699 
short segments at a time it's kind of
hard<00:03:58.359> to<00:03:58.480> navigate<00:03:58.840> through<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.530> show

retellings<00:04:04.870> because<00:04:05.139> you<00:04:05.260> keep<00:04:05.379> thinking<00:04:05.620> of

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
retellings because you keep thinking of

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.349

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
watched and sometimes it can interfere

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.559 
watched and sometimes it can interfere
so<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.639> way<00:04:09.730> he<00:04:09.849> gurashi<00:04:10.060> was<00:04:10.329> done

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
so the way he gurashi was done

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.809 
so the way he gurashi was done
definitely<00:04:11.530> new<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:11.859> innovative<00:04:12.010> but<00:04:12.760> I

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
can't quite give it too many points on

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.390 
can't quite give it too many points on

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.710 
but the build-up to that it doesn't
exactly<00:05:29.880> set<00:05:30.880> you<00:05:31.060> up<00:05:31.090> for<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.479> good-looking

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
exactly set you up for a good-looking

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.689 
exactly set you up for a good-looking
payoff<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.590> path<00:05:32.800> of<00:05:33.099> the<00:05:33.160> stories<00:05:33.490> isn't

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
payoff the path of the stories isn't

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.050 
payoff the path of the stories isn't
always<00:05:33.970> good<00:05:34.349> but<00:05:35.550> when<00:05:36.550> you're<00:05:36.669> using<00:05:36.849> the

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
always good but when you're using the

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.600 
always good but when you're using the
same<00:05:37.270> kind<00:05:37.599> of<00:05:37.690> horror<00:05:37.930> in<00:05:38.229> each<00:05:38.560> story<00:05:39.039> to<00:05:39.430> try

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
same kind of horror in each story to try

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.339 
same kind of horror in each story to try
to<00:05:39.669> scare<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.150> person<00:05:40.539> to<00:05:40.659> build<00:05:40.810> them<00:05:41.020> up<00:05:41.139> for

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
to scare the person to build them up for

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.409 
to scare the person to build them up for
the<00:05:41.409> payoff<00:05:41.590> it's<00:05:42.430> gonna<00:05:42.550> be<00:05:42.760> less<00:05:42.909> effective

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
the payoff it's gonna be less effective

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.930 
the payoff it's gonna be less effective
because<00:05:43.659> you<00:05:43.870> just<00:05:44.289> can't<00:05:44.560> do<00:05:44.800> that<00:05:44.830> I<00:05:45.310> mean

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
because you just can't do that I mean

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.750 
because you just can't do that I mean
it's<00:05:46.840> like<00:05:47.020> we<00:05:47.199> using<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.949> same<00:05:48.159> mr.<00:05:48.460> anime

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760
