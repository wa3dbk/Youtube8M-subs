Murdoch ports around the iceberg try to
keep<00:00:30.040> from<00:00:30.160> hitting<00:00:30.309> the<00:00:30.489> propellers<00:00:30.939> that

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
keep from hitting the propellers that

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.770 
keep from hitting the propellers that
looks<00:00:31.270> pretty<00:00:31.419> good

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.420 

okay<00:00:34.470> so<00:00:34.530> now<00:00:34.770> we're<00:00:34.920> watching<00:00:35.100> an

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
okay so now we're watching an

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.030 
okay so now we're watching an
accelerated<00:00:36.030> time<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:37.110> see<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.500> first<00:00:37.770> five

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
accelerated time we see the first five

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.190 
accelerated time we see the first five
compartments<00:00:38.730> flood<00:00:38.970> they<00:00:39.150> equalize<00:00:39.720> pretty

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
compartments flood they equalize pretty

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.670 
compartments flood they equalize pretty
quickly

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
quickly

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.840 
quickly
bouse<00:00:41.310> pulled<00:00:41.760> down

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.450 

we<00:00:46.420> see<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:46.690> port<00:00:46.960> list<00:00:47.170> portlet<00:00:47.829> looks<00:00:48.250> right

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
we see the port list portlet looks right

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.340 
we see the port list portlet looks right
now<00:00:48.640> looks<00:00:48.790> like<00:00:48.820> about<00:00:49.090> nine<00:00:49.270> degrees<00:00:49.420> well

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
now looks like about nine degrees well

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.620 
now looks like about nine degrees well
you<00:00:50.410> can<00:00:50.559> really<00:00:50.710> see<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.250> effect<00:00:52.059> of<00:00:52.480> that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
you can really see the effect of that

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:02.209 
you can really see the effect of that
that<00:00:52.960> list<00:00:53.230> on<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.620> pond<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:53.980> flooding

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.609 

so<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.269> superstructure<00:01:04.049> starts<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> get

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
so you know superstructure starts to get

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.080 
so you know superstructure starts to get
pulled<00:01:04.830> under

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.569

funnels collapse at their base now the

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.249 
funnels collapse at their base now the
bow<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.159> accelerating<00:01:19.030> downward<00:01:19.509> that<00:01:19.720> looks

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
come up we got our maximum peak stress

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.060 
come up we got our maximum peak stress
and<00:01:25.090> yep<00:01:25.450> both<00:01:25.659> brought<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.649> brakes

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
and yep both brought the brakes

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.690 
and yep both brought the brakes
okay<00:01:27.670> bow<00:01:27.880> swinging<00:01:28.390> down<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:29.110> was<00:01:29.259> good<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700

double keel hang on
and<00:01:33.310> then<00:01:33.490> they<00:01:33.640> separate<00:01:34.119> bow<00:01:34.840> plunges

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
and then they separate bow plunges

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.620 
and then they separate bow plunges
straight<00:01:35.649> down<00:01:36.000> all<00:01:37.000> right<00:01:37.090> got<00:01:37.390> masts

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
straight down all right got masts

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.169 
straight down all right got masts
snapping<00:01:38.170> back<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.860> funnels<00:01:39.759> are<00:01:39.909> ripping

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
snapping back the funnels are ripping

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.060 
snapping back the funnels are ripping
backward<00:01:40.600> pulling<00:01:40.899> off<00:01:41.020> all<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.320> davits

boughs<00:01:43.700> going<00:01:44.030> down<00:01:44.210> like<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.420> torpedo<00:01:44.890> here's

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
boughs going down like a torpedo here's

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.560 
boughs going down like a torpedo here's
the<00:01:46.070> angle<00:01:46.220> when<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.640> falls<00:01:46.880> when<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.360> pulls

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
the angle when it falls when it pulls

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.780 
the angle when it falls when it pulls
through<00:01:47.780> into<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.080> stable<00:01:48.500> position<00:01:48.710> let's<00:01:49.640> see

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
through into a stable position let's see

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.660 
through into a stable position let's see
the<00:01:49.910> start

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
the start

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.850 
the start
feeling<00:01:52.479> way<00:01:52.659> over<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.200> port<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.740> looks

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
feeling way over to port that looks

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.249 
feeling way over to port that looks
right<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.850> she<00:01:55.150> goes<00:01:55.330> up<00:01:55.630> that's<00:01:55.810> right<00:01:56.020> she

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
right and she goes up that's right she

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.690 
right and she goes up that's right she
goes<00:01:56.380> almost<00:01:56.680> vertical<00:01:57.070> just<00:01:57.310> when<00:01:57.460> she<00:01:57.580> goes

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
goes almost vertical just when she goes

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.749 
goes almost vertical just when she goes
under<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.119> then<00:01:58.210> boom<00:01:58.420> implode<00:01:59.670> now<00:02:00.670> she

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
under and then boom implode now she

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.880 
under and then boom implode now she
accelerates<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:02.049> all<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.290> stuff<00:02:02.500> starts<00:02:02.710> to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
accelerates and all the stuff starts to

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.010 
accelerates and all the stuff starts to
rip<00:02:03.040> off<00:02:03.220> she<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.299> shell<00:02:04.479> plating<00:02:04.750> going

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
rip off she the shell plating going

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.870 
rip off she the shell plating going
there<00:02:05.350> goes<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.619> double<00:02:05.890> bottom<00:02:06.040> middle

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
there goes the double bottom middle

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.279 
there goes the double bottom middle
bottom<00:02:07.149> frizz<00:02:07.450> being<00:02:07.720> off

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
bottom frizz being off

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.420 
bottom frizz being off
and<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.890> strands<00:02:10.129> falling<00:02:10.489> through

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
and the strands falling through

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.309 
and the strands falling through
so<00:02:12.549> now<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.760> stern<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.150> falling<00:02:13.540> aft<00:02:14.530> end<00:02:14.829> down

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
so now the stern is falling aft end down

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.260 
so now the stern is falling aft end down
and<00:02:16.499> we<00:02:17.159> see<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.459> as<00:02:17.549> spiraling

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.570 

it<00:02:20.690> comes<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.050> bow<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.890> was<00:02:22.070> falling<00:02:22.400> at<00:02:22.490> a

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
it comes the bow that was falling at a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.050 
it comes the bow that was falling at a
stable<00:02:22.820> position<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.440> hits<00:02:24.710> yeah<00:02:25.250> boom<00:02:25.550> it

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
stable position and it hits yeah boom it

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.060 
stable position and it hits yeah boom it
kind<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.300> breaks<00:02:26.540> his<00:02:26.690> back<00:02:26.960> and<00:02:27.650> we<00:02:27.800> see<00:02:27.950> the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
kind of breaks his back and we see the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.560 
kind of breaks his back and we see the
hydraulic<00:02:28.490> outburst<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.120> Down<00:02:29.300> blast

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
hydraulic outburst on a Down blast
