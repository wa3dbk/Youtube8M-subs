00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.890 
would kind of come out ahead of them a
little<00:01:36.060> bit<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:38.060> headlights<00:01:39.060> would<00:01:39.420> flip<00:01:39.690> up

little bit the headlights would flip up
and<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.890> Sprunt<00:01:41.190> would<00:01:41.580> separate<00:01:42.470> these<00:01:43.470> two

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
and the Sprunt would separate these two

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.910 
and the Sprunt would separate these two
little<00:01:45.170> connectors<00:01:46.170> which<00:01:46.320> kind<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.590> slide

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
little connectors which kind of slide

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.290 
little connectors which kind of slide
out<00:01:47.190> like<00:01:47.370> that<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.909> would<00:01:47.970> drive<00:01:48.270> down

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
out like that and it would drive down

00:01:48.300 --> 00:02:01.670 
out like that and it would drive down
like<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:49.070> then<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.430> dune<00:01:50.640> star<00:01:52.370> and<00:02:00.680> desert

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
like that then the dune star and desert

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.630 
like that then the dune star and desert

other side here there we go so they
would<00:02:27.270> basically<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.690> driving<00:02:28.260> like<00:02:28.530> this

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
would basically be driving like this

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.620 
would basically be driving like this
they<00:02:28.950> basically<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.520> track<00:02:29.849> these<00:02:30.360> two

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
they basically have a track these two

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.460 
they basically have a track these two
would<00:02:30.810> slam<00:02:31.230> into<00:02:31.880> Mountain<00:02:32.880> blaster<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:34.350> it

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
would slam into Mountain blaster and it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.330 
would slam into Mountain blaster and it
would<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:34.590> continue<00:02:34.860> driving<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:35.760> this

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
would just continue driving on like this

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
would just continue driving on like this
and<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.400> course<00:02:38.610> these<00:02:38.850> headlights<00:02:39.209> would

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
and of course these headlights would

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.050 
and of course these headlights would
slide<00:02:39.780> down<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:40.350> that

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
slide down like that

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.330 
slide down like that
next<00:02:42.060> wind<00:02:42.360> chaser<00:02:43.130> lightning<00:02:44.130> out<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.280> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
next wind chaser lightning out of the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.009 
next wind chaser lightning out of the
way<00:02:44.459> here<00:02:44.610> for<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> second<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.420> would<00:02:45.600> split

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
way here for a second it would split

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.410 
way here for a second it would split
into<00:02:46.410> two<00:02:46.950> pieces<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:49.340> basically

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
into two pieces like this and basically

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.180 
into two pieces like this and basically
drive<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.810> know<00:02:51.900> do<00:02:52.170> something<00:02:52.380> turn<00:02:52.950> around

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
drive you know do something turn around

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.140 
drive you know do something turn around
and<00:02:53.340> come<00:02:53.700> back<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:56.549> hands<00:02:56.880> would

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
and come back like this the hands would

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.860 
and come back like this the hands would
flip<00:02:57.390> out<00:02:57.569> like<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:59.459> and<00:03:00.180> then<00:03:00.239> it's<00:03:00.569> got<00:03:00.690> two

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
flip out like that and then it's got two

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.340 
flip out like that and then it's got two
little<00:03:01.140> connector<00:03:01.470> ports<00:03:01.830> like<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:04.040> and

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
little connector ports like that and

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.440 
little connector ports like that and
inside<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.620> wheel<00:03:07.830> where<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.910> hub<00:03:09.060> cap<00:03:09.269> is

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
inside of the wheel where the hub cap is

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.930 
inside of the wheel where the hub cap is
is<00:03:09.630> where<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.959> will<00:03:10.080> connector<00:03:10.440> for<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.739> is

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
is where the will connector for it is

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.100 
is where the will connector for it is
and<00:03:11.940> these<00:03:12.560> pop<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.830> like<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.720> it'd

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
and these pop in like that so it'd

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.900 
and these pop in like that so it'd
basically<00:03:16.290> be<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.680> body<00:03:16.980> driving<00:03:17.489> along<00:03:17.730> like

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
basically be the body driving along like

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.559 
basically be the body driving along like
this<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.600> then<00:03:19.319> red<00:03:19.530> lightning<00:03:20.450> will<00:03:21.450> be

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
this and then red lightning will be

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.569 
this and then red lightning will be
hanging<00:03:21.780> back<00:03:22.109> here<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.739> he<00:03:23.310> would<00:03:23.459> basically

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
hanging back here and he would basically

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.530 
hanging back here and he would basically
just<00:03:24.090> drive<00:03:24.359> up<00:03:25.640> into<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.670> back<00:03:26.970> right<00:03:27.329> here

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
just drive up into the back right here

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.990 
just drive up into the back right here
like<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.989> he<00:03:28.890> was<00:03:29.010> literally<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.430> drive<00:03:29.760> up

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
like this he was literally to drive up

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.330 
like this he was literally to drive up
inside<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:35.420> there<00:03:36.420> we<00:03:36.450> go<00:03:36.950> go<00:03:37.950> all<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.310> way

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
inside of there we go go all the way

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.000 
inside of there we go go all the way
open<00:03:38.640> for<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:38.910> little<00:03:39.650> there's<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.709> little

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
open for this little there's a little

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.750 
open for this little there's a little
door<00:03:41.390> that<00:03:42.390> this<00:03:42.570> slides<00:03:43.230> into<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:44.609> would

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
door that this slides into so this would

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.319 
door that this slides into so this would
drive<00:03:45.239> up<00:03:45.480> in<00:03:45.690> like<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.880> they<00:03:47.880> would<00:03:48.030> hit<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
drive up in like that they would hit the

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.479 
drive up in like that they would hit the
brakes<00:03:48.630> this<00:03:49.049> whole<00:03:49.230> thing<00:03:49.470> would<00:03:49.650> basically

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
brakes this whole thing would basically

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.670 
brakes this whole thing would basically
flip<00:03:51.150> up<00:03:51.329> from<00:03:51.630> some<00:03:51.840> total<00:03:52.109> centripetal

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
flip up from some total centripetal

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.130 
flip up from some total centripetal
force<00:03:53.220> they're<00:03:53.880> just<00:03:54.030> basically<00:03:54.359> like<00:03:54.930> that

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
force they're just basically like that

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.590 
force they're just basically like that
and<00:03:55.290> stand<00:03:55.620> up<00:03:55.859> and<00:03:56.070> as<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:56.850> was<00:03:57.090> standing<00:03:57.510> up

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
and stand up and as it was standing up

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.050 
and stand up and as it was standing up
this<00:03:57.810> would<00:03:58.019> slide<00:03:58.380> up<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.370> panel<00:03:59.880> here<00:03:59.940> so

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
this would slide up on a panel here so

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.460 
this would slide up on a panel here so
you<00:04:00.239> can<00:04:00.329> see<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.569> since<00:04:00.810> he's<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.019> big<00:04:01.290> and

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
you can see that since he's so big and

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.210 
you can see that since he's so big and
then<00:04:02.220> this<00:04:02.400> would<00:04:02.790> come<00:04:03.420> back<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.959> form<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:05.040> hit

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
then this would come back and form a hit

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.690 
then this would come back and form a hit
like<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:06.049> that<00:04:07.049> is<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.680> turbo<00:04:08.100> Megazord

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
which I thought was kind of a neat

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.510 
which I thought was kind of a neat
little<00:04:45.570> thing<00:04:45.690> since<00:04:46.080> its<00:04:46.229> car<00:04:46.710> Ranger<00:04:47.280> over

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
little thing since its car Ranger over

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.659 
little thing since its car Ranger over
there<00:04:47.669> in<00:04:47.729> Japan<00:04:51.470> that<00:04:52.470> was<00:04:52.650> spin<00:04:53.220> out<00:04:53.370> attack

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.710 
there in Japan that was spin out attack

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.150 
I think that was the name of the
finishing<00:04:55.470> blow<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:56.009> basically<00:04:56.820> he<00:04:57.270> would

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
finishing blow and basically he would

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.430 
finishing blow and basically he would
race<00:04:59.160> at<00:04:59.400> them<00:04:59.639> and<00:04:59.910> like<00:05:00.419> basically<00:05:00.900> spin

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
race at them and like basically spin

I'm<00:06:01.830> sure<00:06:02.190> you<00:06:02.280> could<00:06:02.430> probably<00:06:02.460> find<00:06:02.849> him<00:06:03.030> for

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
I'm sure you could probably find him for

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.310 
I'm sure you could probably find him for
that<00:06:03.330> price<00:06:03.539> of<00:06:03.720> maybe<00:06:03.840> being<00:06:03.900> a<00:06:04.020> little<00:06:04.080> bit

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
that price of maybe being a little bit

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.159 
that price of maybe being a little bit
cheaper<00:06:04.650> if<00:06:04.710> you<00:06:04.740> look<00:06:04.949> hard<00:06:05.130> enough<00:06:05.250> I

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
cheaper if you look hard enough I

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.680 
cheaper if you look hard enough I
probably<00:06:07.169> spend<00:06:07.560> over<00:06:07.650> $100<00:06:08.310> for<00:06:08.550> him<00:06:08.699> but<00:06:09.659> I

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
probably spend over $100 for him but I

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.120 
probably spend over $100 for him but I
mean<00:06:10.050> if<00:06:10.199> you're<00:06:10.560> a<00:06:10.590> collector<00:06:10.770> he's

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
mean if you're a collector he's

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.999 
mean if you're a collector he's
definitely<00:06:11.550> worth<00:06:11.669> giving<00:06:11.909> and<00:06:12.810> a<00:06:13.800> mingling

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
definitely worth giving and a mingling

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.490 
definitely worth giving and a mingling
just<00:06:14.220> because<00:06:14.370> he<00:06:14.430> looks<00:06:14.639> so<00:06:14.729> cool<00:06:15.199> but<00:06:16.199> that's

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
just because he looks so cool but that's

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.350 
just because he looks so cool but that's
