00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.390
 the device where artists in my opinion, but in a different way to one 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.430
 you can't do top sport culture 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.170
 furthermore, why especially as a supplier in addition to the traditional parties 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.620
 that blockade after the attack where the parties will and petro time it 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.859
 The plate was the number where a nightdress strangled with his jacket Excelsior 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.489
 inadequate 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:27.789
 the that made believers 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.909
 it doesn't matter if it works 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.909
 but what is that all about to life 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.719
 for what 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.780
 quite a few complaints 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.060
 this year it will say 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.060
 Spain itself is being used by employers 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.350
 gavazzi no longer become 9 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.350
 the cultural on top of the attacker of 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.730
 I do know that you are qualified for the World Cup next year 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.470
 October that is actually really going wrong 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.960
 van der e and that is against the rules in the palace it is a boy 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.560
 the monster lost in that period 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.720
 I think in 2008 he was in the top five for twelve but that 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.720
 makes on the golden ball 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.760
 since the arrival of austria 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.290
 I have not been told a word 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.700
 yes you never know what you as a person 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.700
 what 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 we have been seated 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.570
 you are unable to be there according to the source 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.190
 trust us 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.710
 No 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.710
 make it a little nicer 12 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.700
 hopefully be 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.700
 weird, is not it 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.419
 Wilders in particular 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:18.140
 won more than once in a while 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.809
 that is the case for the difficult year 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:25.009
 view last week i hope there will be stools couple cup on longer term 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.619
 not me 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.839
 second keeper 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:38.559
 about 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.629
 poppe 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.279
 but this was this year
