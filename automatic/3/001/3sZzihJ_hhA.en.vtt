00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.450
 for gonzález very good afternoon very good 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.720
 when marching 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.540
 a date I will rush to the end 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.100
 10 what is the first thing that he expects you 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.329
 ask for the body right now in the absence of 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.980
 a week to start the 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.980
 competition that we start well 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.359
 all these competitions start 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.010
 always with many doubts because you do not know 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.190
 actually how is it in shape or 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.780
 even the physical and how is the rival 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.189
 but I think I have a suspicion that 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.259
 let's start well let's win at 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.520
 holland that we are going to suffer a lot with 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.560
 Chile 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.240
 we take it for granted that we will reach 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.329
 australia I hope so and then 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.829
 we pass and there the thing is if it happens second 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.420
 and it's your turn now if you have them, you play 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.090
 the first final of the World Cup in eighth 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.429
 end but the important thing is to start 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.990
 well I think that depending on how close you 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.939
 world have been removing fears not 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.520
 vibrate if so loud and do not see the 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.500
 stars of other selections that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.479
 shine a lot neither messi nor christian nor 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.729
 of the week is all one founded and touched 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.619
 clear we are fused but also and 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.329
 between all the melts at least 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.009
 we have always talked good 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.420
 There is much controversy in any list not 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.679
 in this world cup in all the world 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.479
 that every Spanish arrives a 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.590
 selector inside but this year yes 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.209
 that have been scored good to certain 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.200
 absences that it seems that people are 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.539
 is agreeing much more of the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.299
 absences that those on the street 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.329
 also although they are not definitive but 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.909
 I say the casualties yet I believe the people 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.799
 general I missed some forms of 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.299
 latin madrid for example gabino and for 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.599
 had been the best midfielder 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.829
 defensive league long and in 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.259
 general always discussions with the 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.700
 strikers in their first year in 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.139
 italy and that started as a starter 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.280
 score goals four forwards in 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:16.760
 england or in 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.370
 in Spain 'llorente I think I had a 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.100
 hollow very clear this selection but at 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.290
 selector for your plans catches you 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.150
 best villa towers and diego costa let's go to 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.250
 come see if Diego Costa Diego Costa 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.069
 is waiting too much if the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.260
 too adequate word 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.510
 you are waiting until the end to what 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.939
 the expression is better and it deserves to wait 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.519
 until the end I think so because it is 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:42.280
 a very good player is different from the 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.680
 nine we have and their commitment to 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.859
 Spain the coast spends fights in Brazil 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.120
 with his family he deserves to be 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.200
 we put this subsidiary at least the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.269
 last one goes with that is not strictly 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.280
 in mediaset but I also have a question 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.230
 through your work of cope how are you going 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.790
 to manage I imagine that from here to you 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.019
 go you'll have to leave organized how 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.419
 is going to be the play time in the days 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.849
 that you miss how it happened more or less 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.590
 same in the last eurocopa I will do the 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.949
 three o'clock program that is 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.359
 a special of the world and all the 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:13.770
 types of game that are not those of Spain 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:16.840
 and as we give, it seems to me 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.400
 not to lie and I'll tell you all 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.130
 parties have games every day 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.890
 every day we give two parties 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.140
 and some days we give three because all that 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.910
 I got it on the radio whether it's more or 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.350
 less equal and from carlos partes españa 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.940
 absence I think you can see it is not 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.680
 you can notice now that you are in that hand 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.260
 by hand with carousel that you are already there 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.790
 almost to the part that when the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.190
 Tenderness of the ball the one who commands the maloro 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:45.550
 grama and for me he is the best narrator of the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:47.709
 planet absence of a proper name 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.709
 I can take for offended I am the player 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.630
 tenth voice eighth nothing happens because 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.330
 we think luck to eat so many 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.010
 thank you for having service something that you 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.660
 some afternoons very well and you when 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.050
 will travel brazil had in particular the 8 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.120
 Sunday 8th tells one thing that in 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.620
 sensations impressions you have face 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.270
 to the world right now in the absence of very 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.740
 few weeks what you ask for the 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.910
 body as you feel because you want to 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.370
 I start above all, I want to start 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.510
 to watch football and watch games and see the 32 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.620
 best equipment in the world that are the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.320
 that have qualified for this phase 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.000
 final of the world cup in brazil and 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.440
 optimist with españa the truth many 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.880
 You win the first Spain-Holland 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.900
 let's start well that there is no 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.850
 stumble with chili and do not fall into that 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.260
 temptation that is there to cross over with 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.460
 rods and the first ones of change if you stay 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.140
 second and brazil that the first one is the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.070
 group although today you want to rematch me 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.630
 I think we really want to 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.130
 rematch with Brazil but if it's in the 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.080
 final for example much better than if it is 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.430
 in eighths but good feelings 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.960
 to start from point of view 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.730
 journalistic desire that from the point 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.590
 of football vision and optimistic with 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.090
 Spain seems to always be in these 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.800
 weeks let's say interval just 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.780
 finish the league season and 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.310
 champions and now waiting for the world 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.080
 in this week of intervals always 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.940
 we will have more talk about absences 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.200
 you think that debate is on the street of 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.910
 do you really think that you are getting a lot 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.900
 missing for example the name of gabi 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.910
 which is in the name of all 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.650
 fans and there is much debate 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.030
 to absences I do not think so much 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.370
 I think it's that Gabino has never been 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.680
 be a gabino I want to say if there 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.930
 been several times and now he will be able to 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.340
 put another name if arbeloa is also 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.870
 another is so for example has been and 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.730
 now the champion is no longer 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.200
 he has paid for it too 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.700
 invoice the injury not if there was 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.380
 had the injury not known if it would be 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.970
 here or not but has been two months without 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.070
 play in the final stretch of the season 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.720
 It is also normal or can be understood 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.520
 as normal in addition to juanfran and 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.080
 carvajal also I think that no 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.099
 they are playing they are playing the post 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.080
 from right side in the list 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.669
 definitive but I do not think it does not 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.710
 talks a lot about those who were not them 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.030
 speaks of those who are really is 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.940
 true that I especially miss 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.620
 two injured Victor Valdes and Carles 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.479
 puyol who has also been a sign 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.400
 in this wardrobe of the red as he has 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.990
 been in the barca but removing those 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.069
 names I think there are those who usually 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.889
 be this family with some 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:53.139
 incorporation as deulofeu that aims 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.419
 also a possible candidate to be 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.159
 among the 23 finalists we remember that 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.750
 the south africa world pedro was not 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.310
 in no previous call and it 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.620
 included in the last definitive sale 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.240
 again but he started in the final 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.259
 who fought for example is a case that 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.669
 Pedro was never there 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:08.020
 convocation entered the last and went 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.220
 to the world and good and in the end he finished 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.810
 being a holder and very important in the 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.610
 it can be but removing equipment 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.050
 some exception like that or of gea that 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.699
 would enter as a third goalkeeper for the 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.130
 absence of valdez the block is maintained 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.150
 and I think that very good for me 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.770
 feelings despite the fact that they arrive 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.650
 tired Diego theme coast is being 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.180
 waiting too much not because still 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.650
 he has given us he had not finished the 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.940
 term to give the definitive list if already 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.080
 we had passed the term let's say with what 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.789
 what's happening here there are people 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.860
 graduates people who can next up 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.569
 the day 2 there is time of the forest I could 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.059
 have given before but from the forest 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:39.759
 doubting more for logical reasons for 

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:41.050
 reasons that we can all understand and 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:42.039
 understand the sessions of the games 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.809
 from madrid the athletic they have finished 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.939
 crushed the season are all the 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:47.020
 another day and those in Lisbon half of the 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.759
 team on the ground that could not anymore 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.259
 it's normal to hold on and wait 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.669
 those who are a little more touched 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.809
 among them diego costa but I think that 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.029
 will wait for you and that you will be in the 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:56.379
 world although today you are presenting the 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:58.539
 coverage that you are going to do in mediaset 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:00.099
 for the whole world as you go to 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:02.139
 organize on the subject of laser by 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:03.789
 example your absence the days that are missing 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.199
 you have to organize another one if we talk about 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.580
 laser that if we do not mix everything but 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.409
 as it has happened other times when 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.209
 I'm not on carousel because I'm in 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:11.229
 the TV is with set and they were and 

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:12.999
 garrido and the rest of the team 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.559
 exactly the same, so it does not happen 

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:15.999
 nothing if you notice absence when not 

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.469

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:19.509
 that sure we sure you note 

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:20.529
 it's not sure that I do not have affection 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:22.800
 we wish luck for good thanks 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:22.800
