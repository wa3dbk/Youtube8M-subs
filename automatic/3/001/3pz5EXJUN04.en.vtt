really<00:01:52.860> was<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:54.030> that's<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.390> really<00:01:54.600> good

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
really was so that's a really good

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.359 
really was so that's a really good
feature<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.229> especially<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.070> blanket

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
feature to have especially on a blanket

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.370 
feature to have especially on a blanket
like<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.329> inside<00:01:57.630> material<00:01:57.780> which<00:01:58.259> is

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
like this the inside material which is

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
like this the inside material which is
made<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.710> 100%<00:01:58.920> polyester<00:01:59.549> is<00:02:00.180> really

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
made out of 100% polyester is really

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.240 
made out of 100% polyester is really
great<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:01.079> also<00:02:01.229> known<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.649> batting<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
great it's also known as batting and

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.520 
great it's also known as batting and
what<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.490> does<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> traps<00:02:03.210> warm<00:02:03.600> hair<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
what it does is it traps warm hair and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.800 
what it does is it traps warm hair and
creates<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.070> warm<00:02:05.399> air<00:02:05.700> barrier<00:02:06.240> against<00:02:06.659> your

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
creates a warm air barrier against your

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.869 
creates a warm air barrier against your
skin<00:02:07.049> which<00:02:07.380> keeps<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.710> warm<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:08.819> those

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
skin which keeps you warm just for those

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.839 
skin which keeps you warm just for those
that<00:02:09.060> didn't<00:02:09.330> know<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:11.370> let's<00:02:11.520> go<00:02:11.640> ahead<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
that didn't know so let's go ahead and

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.630 
that didn't know so let's go ahead and
open<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.090> up<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.390> see<00:02:12.510> what's<00:02:12.660> inside

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.980 

so<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.730> proof<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:17.060> authenticity<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.750> going<00:02:17.900> to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
so the proof of authenticity is going to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.420 
so the proof of authenticity is going to
be<00:02:18.050> this<00:02:18.140> little<00:02:18.290> tiny<00:02:18.560> sticker<00:02:19.010> that's<00:02:19.250> going

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
be this little tiny sticker that's going

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.120 
be this little tiny sticker that's going
to<00:02:19.490> be<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:19.700> there<00:02:19.910> most<00:02:20.860> military-issued<00:02:21.860> gear

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
to be on there most military-issued gear

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.350 
to be on there most military-issued gear
is<00:02:22.280> going<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.460> come<00:02:22.610> with<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.910> kind<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.150> green

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
is going to come with this kind of green

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.840 
is going to come with this kind of green
tag<00:02:23.660> is<00:02:23.900> basically<00:02:24.440> like<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> care<00:02:24.950> tag<00:02:25.250> how<00:02:25.790> to

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
products manufacturing corporation I'm

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.080 
products manufacturing corporation I'm
not<00:02:43.040> sure<00:02:43.160> exactly<00:02:43.370> where<00:02:43.640> they're<00:02:43.760> based<00:02:43.910> out

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
not sure exactly where they're based out

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.760 
not sure exactly where they're based out
of<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:44.450> they<00:02:44.600> do<00:02:44.660> make<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.990> good<00:02:45.230> product<00:02:45.470> and

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
of but they do make a good product and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.070 
of but they do make a good product and
this<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.550> basically<00:02:46.730> your<00:02:47.000> proof<00:02:47.270> most

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
this is basically your proof most

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.900 
this is basically your proof most
Chinese<00:02:48.380> knockoffs<00:02:49.070> which<00:02:49.340> are<00:02:49.490> really<00:02:49.790> out

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
Chinese knockoffs which are really out

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.330 
Chinese knockoffs which are really out
there<00:02:50.140> they<00:02:51.140> tend<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.500> not<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:51.890> any<00:02:52.040> kind<00:02:52.250> of

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
there they tend to not have any kind of

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.850 
there they tend to not have any kind of
tag<00:02:52.520> like<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.720> know<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> real

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
tag like this you know this is a real

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.530 
tag like this you know this is a real
specific<00:02:55.460> tag<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:55.940> only<00:02:56.120> see<00:02:56.420> on

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
specific tag that you only see on

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.580 
specific tag that you only see on
genuine<00:02:57.490> US<00:02:58.490> military<00:02:59.030> issued<00:02:59.420> gear<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.380> if

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
genuine US military issued gear so if

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.050 
genuine US military issued gear so if
you<00:03:00.680> look<00:03:00.860> for<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.100> tag<00:03:01.340> you're<00:03:01.790> probably

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
you look for this tag you're probably

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.420 
you look for this tag you're probably
getting<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.540> hundred<00:03:02.810> percent<00:03:02.900> real<00:03:03.470> blanket

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
getting a hundred percent real blanket

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.220 
getting a hundred percent real blanket
if<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:04.880> don't<00:03:05.060> have<00:03:05.210> this<00:03:05.300> tag<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:06.020> might

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
if you don't have this tag you might

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.470 
if you don't have this tag you might
want<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.470> question<00:03:06.890> its<00:03:07.160> reliability<00:03:08.000> and

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
want to question its reliability and

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.560 
want to question its reliability and
also<00:03:08.900> its<00:03:09.740> manufacturing<00:03:10.640> processes<00:03:11.450> that

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
also its manufacturing processes that

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.410 
also its manufacturing processes that
went<00:03:11.720> into<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.130> not<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.310> say<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:13.970> not<00:03:14.240> as

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
went into it not to say that it's not as

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.380 
went into it not to say that it's not as
good<00:03:14.630> it<00:03:15.590> just<00:03:15.620> may<00:03:16.130> be<00:03:16.160> inferior<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.210> real

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
good it just may be inferior to the real

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.740 
good it just may be inferior to the real
thing

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
Vietnam era because of that basically

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.480 
Vietnam era because of that basically
the<00:04:06.200> guys<00:04:06.350> would<00:04:06.590> walk<00:04:06.800> around<00:04:06.980> with<00:04:07.280> these

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
the guys would walk around with these

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.920 
the guys would walk around with these
blankets<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.060> they<00:04:08.120> look<00:04:08.240> like<00:04:08.330> big<00:04:08.540> babies
