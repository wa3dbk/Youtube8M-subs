we go to violent red and yellow we get
to<00:04:25.290> orange<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.860> yellow<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.550> it<00:04:26.669> will<00:04:27.419> create

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
to orange and yellow and it will create

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.670 
to orange and yellow and it will create
green<00:04:28.380> now<00:04:29.870> what<00:04:30.870> I'm<00:04:30.990> going<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.200> do<00:04:31.320> next<00:04:31.470> is

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
green now what I'm going to do next is

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.540 
green now what I'm going to do next is
to<00:04:32.240> intermix<00:04:33.240> my<00:04:33.960> primary<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.040> adjacent

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
to intermix my primary and the adjacent

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.880 
to intermix my primary and the adjacent
secondary<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.450> create<00:04:36.840> what<00:04:37.410> will<00:04:37.590> be<00:04:37.710> right

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
secondary to create what will be right

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.040 
secondary to create what will be right
in<00:04:37.919> between<00:04:38.160> what<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.520> called<00:04:38.760> a<00:04:38.850> tertiary

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
in between what is called a tertiary

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.770 
in between what is called a tertiary
tertiary<00:04:40.050> cover<00:04:40.260> so<00:04:40.830> let's<00:04:41.040> say<00:04:41.310> if<00:04:41.520> i<00:04:41.700> mix<00:04:42.000> red

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
tertiary cover so let's say if i mix red

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.750 
tertiary cover so let's say if i mix red
and<00:04:42.810> orange<00:04:43.080> I'll<00:04:43.560> get<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.830> red<00:04:44.040> orange<00:04:44.340> if<00:04:44.669> i
