00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
smart by mining gas as a circular you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.969 
smart by mining gas as a circular you
always<00:01:39.390> want<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.570> mind<00:01:39.780> gasps<00:01:39.960> as<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.829> number

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
like when the heart rate gets placed the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
like when the heart rate gets placed the
first<00:01:45.750> thing<00:01:45.869> when<00:01:45.960> i<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.229> mind<00:01:46.409> guys

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
first thing when i do is mind guys

despite<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> matchup<00:01:47.909> zerg<00:01:48.390> units<00:01:48.899> are<00:01:49.049> very

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
despite the matchup zerg units are very

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.770 
despite the matchup zerg units are very
guys<00:01:49.439> consuming<00:01:50.040> guys<00:01:50.280> heavy<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.570> really

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
guys consuming guys heavy so you really

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.100 
guys consuming guys heavy so you really
want<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> gas<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:53.250> soon<00:01:53.520> as<00:01:53.640> possible<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.299> now

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
want the gas as soon as possible and now

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.959 
want the gas as soon as possible and now
as<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.560> i<00:01:56.159> don't<00:01:56.399> know<00:01:56.549> where<00:01:56.670> this

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
as you can see i don't know where this

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.209 
as you can see i don't know where this
went<00:01:57.149> i<00:01:57.450> figured<00:01:58.079> well<00:01:58.770> he<00:01:58.890> probably<00:01:59.100> figured

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
went i figured well he probably figured

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.170 
went i figured well he probably figured
that<00:01:59.460> i<00:01:59.579> had<00:01:59.790> too<00:01:59.969> many<00:02:01.759> goliaths<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.090> he

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that i had too many goliaths and he

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.490 
that i had too many goliaths and he
would<00:02:03.299> lose<00:02:03.479> more<00:02:03.719> than<00:02:03.750> he<00:02:03.899> would<00:02:03.990> gain<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
would lose more than he would gain so

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.819 
would lose more than he would gain so
that's<00:02:04.680> why<00:02:04.829> he<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.100> left<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.520> liquors<00:02:06.420> um

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
that's why he just left and liquors um

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.770 
that's why he just left and liquors um
that's<00:02:07.829> kind<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.069> an<00:02:08.220> odd<00:02:08.429> text<00:02:08.729> which<00:02:09.000> i<00:02:09.270> guess

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
that's kind of an odd text which i guess

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.449 
that's kind of an odd text which i guess
he's<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.289> he's<00:02:10.770> gonna<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.069> their<00:02:11.310> hers

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
he's going he's gonna go for their hers

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.310 
he's going he's gonna go for their hers
now

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
now

clickers<00:02:13.320> honestly<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> only<00:02:14.010> wave<00:02:14.490> they're

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
clickers honestly the only wave they're

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.670 
clickers honestly the only wave they're
good<00:02:15.650> versus<00:02:16.650> mech<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:19.110> know<00:02:19.200> they're<00:02:19.530> not

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
good versus mech is you know they're not

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.350 
good versus mech is you know they're not
good<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:20.010> some<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.220> don't<00:02:20.730> know<00:02:20.820> liquors<00:02:21.210> I

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
good for some I don't know liquors I

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.420 
good for some I don't know liquors I
just<00:02:21.540> like<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.870> not<00:02:22.110> because<00:02:22.860> liquor<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.280> like

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
just like the not because liquor is like

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.890 
just like the not because liquor is like
let's<00:02:23.610> look<00:02:23.820> watch<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.180> right<00:02:24.330> here<00:02:24.390> liquors

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
let's look watch this right here liquors

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.890 
let's look watch this right here liquors
they<00:02:25.560> die<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.890> mec<00:02:26.310> pretty<00:02:26.640> badly<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.270> as<00:02:27.720> you

lost and those two lurkers could have

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.340 
lost and those two lurkers could have
been<00:02:34.980> on<00:02:35.220> like<00:02:35.760> before<00:02:36.090> hydrolysis<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.780> for

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
been on like before hydrolysis and for

been on like before hydrolysis and for
Hydra<00:02:37.650> done<00:02:38.010> even<00:02:38.220> more<00:02:38.370> damage<00:02:38.670> than<00:02:38.730> that

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
kind of like the circle so if you can

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.330 
kind of like the circle so if you can
possibly<00:03:21.990> get<00:03:22.380> an<00:03:22.500> edge<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:22.740> your<00:03:22.920> opponent

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
with one of the numbers then it'd be

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.780 
with one of the numbers then it'd be
great<00:03:26.510> right<00:03:27.510> now<00:03:27.720> as<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.590> see<00:03:28.830> I'm<00:03:29.490> just

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820

see<00:03:32.940> I'm<00:03:33.030> managing<00:03:33.360> my<00:03:33.480> minerals<00:03:33.810> really<00:03:34.020> well

see I'm managing my minerals really well
still<00:03:34.500> at<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.860> 15<00:03:35.550> minerals<00:03:35.880> my<00:03:36.600> guess<00:03:36.780> is

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
still at like 15 minerals my guess is

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.090 
still at like 15 minerals my guess is
that<00:03:37.020> like<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> thousand<00:03:37.710> which<00:03:37.830> is<00:03:37.920> not<00:03:38.070> really

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
that like a thousand which is not really

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.940 
that like a thousand which is not really
good<00:03:38.460> I<00:03:38.670> should<00:03:38.940> be<00:03:39.060> getting<00:03:39.470> star<00:03:40.470> parts<00:03:40.770> and

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
good I should be getting star parts and

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.370 
good I should be getting star parts and
vessels<00:03:41.310> very<00:03:41.460> shortly<00:03:41.960> and<00:03:42.960> as<00:03:43.080> you<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.350> see

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
vessels very shortly and as you can see

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.630 
vessels very shortly and as you can see
these<00:03:43.650> mind<00:03:43.890> this<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.250> another<00:03:44.520> reason

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
these mind this is another reason

workers aren't good mines just random

mines<00:03:46.440> around<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:47.010> map<00:03:47.160> are<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.670> kill

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
mines around the map are going to kill

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.730 
mines around the map are going to kill
their<00:03:48.030> girls<00:03:48.270> like<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.630> because<00:03:49.380> lurkers

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
their girls like that because lurkers

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.100 
their girls like that because lurkers
can't<00:03:49.920> really<00:03:50.100> do<00:03:50.280> anything<00:03:50.460> risks<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.880> mines

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
can't really do anything risks and mines

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.230 
can't really do anything risks and mines
hydrolyse<00:03:52.110> own<00:03:52.320> minds<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:53.280> guess<00:03:54.000> it's<00:03:54.030> the

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
hydrolyse own minds and I guess it's the

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.150 
hydrolyse own minds and I guess it's the
one<00:03:54.420> time<00:03:54.450> where<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.840> curs<00:03:55.020> are<00:03:55.140> good<00:03:55.290> just

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
one time where the curs are good just

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.030 
one time where the curs are good just
random<00:03:56.580> lurkers<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.720> your<00:03:58.440> units<00:03:58.740> went<00:03:58.890> over

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
random lurkers and your units went over

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.890 
random lurkers and your units went over
them<00:03:59.190> but<00:03:59.400> again<00:04:00.120> how<00:04:00.300> this<00:04:00.330> would<00:04:00.600> be<00:04:00.720> better

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
them but again how this would be better

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.410 
them but again how this would be better
so<00:04:01.260> gonna<00:04:01.950> expand<00:04:02.370> again<00:04:02.640> key<00:04:02.880> thing<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.090> note

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
so gonna expand again key thing to note

so gonna expand again key thing to note
here<00:04:03.450> I'm<00:04:03.720> expanding<00:04:04.020> while<00:04:04.290> I'm<00:04:04.410> attacking

here I'm expanding while I'm attacking

here I'm expanding while I'm attacking
and<00:04:05.130> scanning<00:04:05.940> before<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.360> move<00:04:06.600> in<00:04:06.750> because

and scanning before I move in because

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.240 
and scanning before I move in because
you<00:04:07.200> know<00:04:07.290> as<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.530> can<00:04:07.650> see<00:04:07.770> lurkers<00:04:08.100> do

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
you know as you can see lurkers do

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.100 
you know as you can see lurkers do
damage<00:04:08.550> like<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.150> he's<00:04:09.540> being<00:04:09.810> kind<00:04:09.990> of

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
damage like that and he's being kind of

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.699 
damage like that and he's being kind of
smart<00:04:10.350> by<00:04:10.730> okay<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.850> was<00:04:11.940> kind<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.180> lame<00:04:12.709> like

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
smart by okay that was kind of lame like

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.490 
smart by okay that was kind of lame like
what<00:04:14.400> do<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.490> call<00:04:14.610> it<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:15.030> couldn't<00:04:15.990> the<00:04:16.230> scan

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
what do you call it I couldn't the scan

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.050 
what do you call it I couldn't the scan
ran<00:04:16.739> out<00:04:16.890> like<00:04:17.040> right<00:04:17.190> away<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.430> now<00:04:17.850> as<00:04:17.970> you

the scan ran out right when the liquor

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.589 
the scan ran out right when the liquor
was<00:04:26.560> about<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.889> die<00:04:27.009> and<00:04:27.550> keep<00:04:28.210> your<00:04:28.330> scanners

I think he hasn't been keeping up with
this<00:04:43.930> macro<00:04:44.139> he's<00:04:44.500> been<00:04:44.650> going<00:04:44.830> serving<00:04:45.190> them

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
this macro he's been going serving them

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.830 
this macro he's been going serving them
Ulis<00:04:45.669> which<00:04:45.819> is<00:04:45.940> not<00:04:46.090> really<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.330> best<00:04:46.419> idea

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
Ulis which is not really the best idea

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.029 
Ulis which is not really the best idea
you<00:04:46.990> should<00:04:47.020> be<00:04:47.139> going<00:04:47.259> muralist<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.770> hydro

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
you should be going muralist and hydro

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.460 
you should be going muralist and hydro
discs<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:49.300> as<00:04:49.569> you<00:04:49.690> can<00:04:49.810> see<00:04:49.840> those<00:04:50.110> middle<00:04:50.379> is

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
discs and as you can see those middle is

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.439 
discs and as you can see those middle is
melted<00:04:50.830> pretty<00:04:51.039> fast<00:04:51.280> oh<00:04:51.520> okay<00:04:52.180> I<00:04:52.210> see<00:04:52.270> what

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
melted pretty fast oh okay I see what

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.029 
melted pretty fast oh okay I see what
he's<00:04:52.569> going<00:04:52.750> he's<00:04:53.259> trying<00:04:53.500> to<00:04:53.590> rush<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.770> the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
fighters which is not really the optimal

idea<00:04:58.830> personally<00:04:59.830> when<00:04:59.919> I<00:05:00.009> play<00:05:00.129> zerg<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.430> I'm

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.760 
idea personally when I play zerg and I'm
facing<00:05:00.759> Mecca<00:05:01.060> I<00:05:01.210> like<00:05:01.389> to<00:05:01.419> go<00:05:01.659> hydrolysis<00:05:02.650> and

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
facing Mecca I like to go hydrolysis and

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.290 
facing Mecca I like to go hydrolysis and

tech<00:05:04.710> probably<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.770> late<00:05:06.340> game<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.789> best

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:06.969 
tech probably the late game the best

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:08.279 
tech probably the late game the best
thing<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.120> do<00:05:07.330> is<00:05:07.479> obviously<00:05:07.629> go<00:05:08.080> high-tech

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
thing to do is obviously go high-tech

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.659 
thing to do is obviously go high-tech
and<00:05:09.060> pretty<00:05:10.060> much<00:05:11.129> what<00:05:12.129> he<00:05:12.190> called<00:05:12.370> it<00:05:12.460> go

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
and pretty much what he called it go

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.629 
and pretty much what he called it go
high-tech<00:05:12.849> and<00:05:13.620> like<00:05:14.620> as<00:05:14.830> you<00:05:14.949> can<00:05:15.069> see<00:05:15.219> like

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
high-tech and like as you can see like

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.540 
high-tech and like as you can see like
any<00:05:15.819> unit<00:05:16.180> neck<00:05:16.539> is<00:05:16.840> get<00:05:17.740> it<00:05:17.830> gets<00:05:18.069> owned<00:05:18.340> by

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
any unit neck is get it gets owned by

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.219 
any unit neck is get it gets owned by
high-tech<00:05:18.699> pretty<00:05:19.180> much<00:05:19.389> because<00:05:19.629> no<00:05:19.840> unit

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
high-tech pretty much because no unit

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.820 
high-tech pretty much because no unit
that<00:05:20.560> is<00:05:20.590> mech<00:05:21.039> can<00:05:21.849> um<00:05:22.560> what<00:05:23.560> do<00:05:23.620> you<00:05:23.680> call<00:05:23.770> it

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
that is mech can um what do you call it

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.740 
that is mech can um what do you call it
no<00:05:24.099> unit<00:05:24.400> that's<00:05:24.580> mech<00:05:24.819> can<00:05:25.150> attack<00:05:25.479> on<00:05:25.659> her

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
no unit that's mech can attack on her

no unit that's mech can attack on her
dark<00:05:25.960> storm<00:05:26.199> so<00:05:26.469> duck<00:05:27.340> swim<00:05:27.580> in<00:05:27.699> that<00:05:27.819> sense<00:05:28.090> is

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
dark storm so duck swim in that sense is

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330 
dark storm so duck swim in that sense is
really<00:05:28.659> good<00:05:28.840> but<00:05:29.259> like<00:05:29.680> it's<00:05:29.889> really<00:05:30.069> late

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
really good but like it's really late

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.189 
really good but like it's really late
and<00:05:30.550> as<00:05:30.849> you<00:05:31.029> can<00:05:31.150> see<00:05:31.180> his<00:05:31.509> mac<00:05:31.719> like<00:05:31.990> he<00:05:32.110> has

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
and as you can see his mac like he has

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.959 
and as you can see his mac like he has
no<00:05:32.319> units<00:05:32.560> all<00:05:32.860> he<00:05:32.979> has<00:05:33.069> is<00:05:33.099> dark<00:05:33.460> swarmy<00:05:33.699> is

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 
no units all he has is dark swarmy is

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.390 
no units all he has is dark swarmy is
like<00:05:34.120> one<00:05:34.330> leg<00:05:34.539> underneath<00:05:34.900> it<00:05:35.169> so<00:05:35.409> you<00:05:36.250> have

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
like one leg underneath it so you have

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.790 
like one leg underneath it so you have
to<00:05:36.520> really<00:05:36.630> sacrifice<00:05:37.630> a<00:05:37.900> military<00:05:38.440> military

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
to really sacrifice a military military

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.610 
to really sacrifice a military military
advantage<00:05:39.550> and<00:05:39.819> to<00:05:40.449> go<00:05:41.020> for<00:05:41.229> early<00:05:41.500> two

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
advantage and to go for early two

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.290 
advantage and to go for early two
fighters<00:05:41.949> but<00:05:42.219> I'm<00:05:42.430> like<00:05:42.699> honestly<00:05:43.060> I'm<00:05:43.180> not<00:05:43.210> a

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
fighters but I'm like honestly I'm not a

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.969 
fighters but I'm like honestly I'm not a
trend<00:05:43.539> here<00:05:43.659> if<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:43.930> was<00:05:44.050> a<00:05:44.110> good<00:05:44.319> transfer<00:05:44.650> then

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
trend here if I was a good transfer then

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.860 
trend here if I was a good transfer then
I<00:05:45.099> would<00:05:45.219> have<00:05:45.250> a<00:05:45.430> good<00:05:45.669> timing<00:05:45.940> attack<00:05:46.210> like

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
I would have a good timing attack like

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.510 
I would have a good timing attack like
if<00:05:47.080> I<00:05:47.229> scat<00:05:47.500> like<00:05:47.740> I<00:05:47.830> would<00:05:47.979> scan<00:05:48.219> that<00:05:48.370> he's

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
if I scat like I would scan that he's

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.580 
if I scat like I would scan that he's
going<00:05:48.789> early<00:05:49.000> hive<00:05:49.599> and<00:05:49.870> then<00:05:50.020> I<00:05:50.050> was<00:05:50.259> timing

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
going early hive and then I was timing

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.080 
going early hive and then I was timing
attack<00:05:50.949> right<00:05:51.159> before<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.550> hive<00:05:51.699> comes<00:05:51.940> out

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
attack right before the hive comes out

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.499 
attack right before the hive comes out
and<00:05:52.330> kill<00:05:52.569> all<00:05:52.659> his<00:05:52.840> bases<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:54.270> but<00:05:55.270> I'm<00:05:55.360> not<00:05:55.479> a

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509 
and kill all his bases and but I'm not a

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:56.790 
and kill all his bases and but I'm not a
tramp<00:05:55.750> error<00:05:55.930> so<00:05:56.080> that's<00:05:56.229> why<00:05:56.349> I<00:05:56.379> can't<00:05:56.469> do<00:05:56.680> it

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
tramp error so that's why I can't do it

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.499 
tramp error so that's why I can't do it
that<00:05:56.830> well<00:05:57.069> but<00:05:57.370> real<00:05:57.879> turn<00:05:58.090> players<00:05:58.360> are

mound<00:06:05.440> result<00:06:05.740> and<00:06:07.259> yes<00:06:08.259> but<00:06:08.560> that's<00:06:08.830> why<00:06:09.039> I

mound result and yes but that's why I

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:10.769 
mound result and yes but that's why I
don't<00:06:09.400> really<00:06:09.580> recommend<00:06:09.849> faster<00:06:10.449> fighters

should<00:06:12.699> be<00:06:12.729> going<00:06:12.849> more<00:06:13.060> can't<00:06:13.330> heavy<00:06:13.509> now

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
should be going more can't heavy now

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:17.490 
should be going more can't heavy now
because<00:06:14.849> tanks<00:06:15.849> very<00:06:16.029> useful<00:06:16.479> versus<00:06:16.990> they're

lissenberg storm would be a lot better

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.510 
lissenberg storm would be a lot better
of<00:06:33.430> a<00:06:33.490> combo<00:06:33.820> and

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
of a combo and

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.249 
of a combo and
um<00:06:35.319> right<00:06:36.319> now<00:06:36.349> like<00:06:36.919> let's<00:06:37.819> see<00:06:38.000> he<00:06:38.960> is

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
um right now like let's see he is

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.830 
um right now like let's see he is
sticking<00:06:40.009> to<00:06:40.250> three<00:06:40.430> bases<00:06:40.759> again<00:06:41.180> oh<00:06:41.419> wow

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
sticking to three bases again oh wow

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.510 
sticking to three bases again oh wow
that's<00:06:42.199> he's<00:06:42.560> mackin<00:06:42.919> up<00:06:43.009> quite<00:06:43.220> a<00:06:43.250> bit<00:06:43.430> of

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
that's he's mackin up quite a bit of

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.800 
that's he's mackin up quite a bit of
army<00:06:43.819> I<00:06:43.879> don't<00:06:44.030> think<00:06:44.150> he's<00:06:44.240> got<00:06:44.360> three<00:06:44.509> bases

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
army I don't think he's got three bases

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.899 
army I don't think he's got three bases
anymore<00:06:45.169> because<00:06:45.289> he's<00:06:46.099> backing<00:06:46.460> up<00:06:46.580> a<00:06:46.699> very

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:46.909 
anymore because he's backing up a very

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:48.939 
anymore because he's backing up a very
substantial<00:06:47.150> amount<00:06:47.750> of<00:06:47.780> units<00:06:47.990> so<00:06:48.409> I<00:06:48.440> really

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
substantial amount of units so I really

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.210 
substantial amount of units so I really
think<00:06:49.069> he's<00:06:49.280> at<00:06:50.440> four<00:06:51.440> bases<00:06:51.770> and<00:06:51.979> now<00:06:52.039> as<00:06:52.129> you

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
think he's at four bases and now as you

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.550 
think he's at four bases and now as you
can<00:06:52.310> see<00:06:52.370> doing<00:06:52.849> some<00:06:53.000> glides<00:06:53.240> micro<00:06:53.629> as<00:06:53.840> right

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
can see doing some glides micro as right

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.050
