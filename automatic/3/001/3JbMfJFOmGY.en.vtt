what's going on the really useful
element<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:24.840> me<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> theory<00:01:25.770> I've<00:01:26.040> got<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
element for me was the theory I've got a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.179 
element for me was the theory I've got a
lot<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.520> practical<00:01:27.290> background<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.829> finding

lot of practical background but finding
out<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.090> theory<00:01:30.450> behind<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.900> where<00:01:31.079> it's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
out the theory behind it where it's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.730 
out the theory behind it where it's
driven<00:01:31.470> from<00:01:32.150> its<00:01:33.150> expanded<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:34.049> knowledge<00:01:34.320> or

understanding quite considerably there's

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.740 
understanding quite considerably there's
always<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.320> chance<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.680> network<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
always the chance to network here and

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.679 
always the chance to network here and
there's<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:40.079> lot<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.009> lot<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.329> Chinese<00:01:42.329> people
