00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 the rose is one of the few shrubs 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.609
 which bloom several times per season 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.259
 therefore very intensively consume 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.889
 soil nutrients 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.150
 feeding in principle can be divided into 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.040
 organic and inorganic to 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.260
 organic fertilizer refers to all that 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.470
 what had to nature is it is rotten 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.570
 compost dung herbal infusions from the hall to 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.880
 In general, all that 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.080
 naturally obtained mineral 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.050
 fertilizer this 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.310
 industrialized 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.170
 various mineral salts and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.380
 or in a mixture of the most important nutrients 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.050
 elements for roses are nitrogen phosphorus potassium and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.430
 besides magnesium let's start with nitrogen this 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.739
 element is responsible for growth 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.140
 aboveground part of the plant ie leaves 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.879
 in shoots and especially needed roses 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.610
 spring can be quite easily determined 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.710
 Do roses lack nitrogen if the bush 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.750
 slowly grows lower leaves small 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.820
 tough 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.500
 yellow and fall and in general plants 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.780
 slowly growing means most likely 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.510
 nitrogen is not enough and you need to hold 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.970
 fertilizing with another indicator can 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.830
 be that the lower leaves turn yellow because 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
 that nitrogen is very mobile and easy 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.299
 no part of the plant moves out of it 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.630
 top young leaves where it is needed 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.280
 total phosphorus is responsible for the formation 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.280
 flowers for abundant blooms and for growth 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.560
 root system if rosi is not enough 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.950
 phosphorus, then the leaves also shrink 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.799
 growth slows shoots often thicken 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.710
 bend many blind shoots then 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.680
 there are those who died apical 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.240
 bud and leaves turn blue green 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.299
 or very dark green 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.150
 and edges often with a purple tint in the same way 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.829
 leaf stalks and shoots can also 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.369
 get purple tide 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:51.030
 potassium is needed for general successful 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.880
 plant growth she is responsible for 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.729
 accumulation of sugars shoots and for current 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.310
 leaf sugars shoots and accumulation 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.170
 their wood therefore potassium especially 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.899
 important for roses and in the second half of summer 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.049
 for successful wintering preparation in general 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.129
 we can say that it is so peculiar 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.379
 vitamin for plants 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.900
 if a rose is enough for me to have potassium, then they 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.320
 much more prone 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.450
 disease leaves often turn yellow 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.850
 become chlorine tic 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.610
 yellow asia veins remain green 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.280
 the edges of the leaves dry well and in general 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.280
 the plant looks very depressed bad 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.010
 grows bad winters and very often sick 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.560
 besides these three main macronutrients 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.990
 there are also minor ones 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.110
 equally important for roses though 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.320
 they need far fewer 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.950
 this is magnesium and iron zinc and copper boron 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.110
 molybdenum and a number of others perhaps the most 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.110
 important old age foam elements for roses 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.310
 This magnesium man is not responsible for the brightness 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.770
 flower coloring 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.840
 so if you want to get flowers 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.640
 good quality bright beautiful 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.290
 before flowering very well feed 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.260
 magnesium sulfate roses 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.960
 if the magnesium rose is not enough then the leaves have 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.550
 they become so colorful 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.400
 the middle of the sheet discolored edges 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.040
 remain green appear red 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.350
 spots some parts of the leaves die off 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.790
 and very often the rose could be enough for me 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.010
 excessive acidic soils 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.090
 and another important element for roses is 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.750
 iron is quite a common situation when 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.510
 leaves become susceptible to chlorosis then 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.060
 there was yellow himself and his veins 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.550
 green is the usual picture if 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.390
 the plant lacks iron most often 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.250
 chlorosis develops on alkaline or 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.250
 neutral soils that is if the soil 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.930
 insufficiently acidic to determine chlorosis 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.880
 caused by a shortage of iron or others 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.950
 items are very easy because what 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.959
 leaves are affected if we have chlorosis 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.700
 caused by a shortage of iron then amazed 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.610
 mostly young leaves that is 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.630
 yellowness comes from the top down and if 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.360
 the plant is not enough 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.520
 other elements such as the same potassium 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.150
 or manganese then chlorosis comes from the bottom 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.610
 leaves top leaf and remain green 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.800
 newbie you visited Cupid plant are 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.950
 It is difficult to determine which elements 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.470
 not enough roses symptoms of shortage 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.070
 many elements seem and can be long 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.290
 guess what element 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.570
 guilty but at the same time in appearance 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.910
 leaves you can usually understand what the problem is 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.250
 precisely in nutritional deficiencies 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.090
 they are in disease or affection 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.820
 pests 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.190
 if you find it difficult to diagnose 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.729
 spend liquid top dressing complex 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.729
 fertilizer liquid dressing acts 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.680
 faster and watch the plants if 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.639
 new leaves are not characteristic colors are not 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.250
 will appear means feeding helped besides 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:55.180
 fertilizer is quite important when 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.720
 growing roses have stimulants this 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.000
 substances that allow rosi 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.669
 growth push for example roots or 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.389
 above ground part and in principle very 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.240
 help 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:10.450
 if we assume you grow poorly young 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.120
 sapling if you need to well 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.510
 rooted cuttings 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.060
 most often used several 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.430
 stimulants first of course 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.910
 heteroauxin or root these 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.090
 stimulants improve root growth 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.569
 systems in them are often soaked cuttings 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.539
 before rooting 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:37.199
 it happens that they add to the solution in which 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:39.719
 soaked seedlings before planting even 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.569
 one stimulant which is very common 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:45.800
 I use this sodium humate now there 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:48.330
 there is even paper which contains 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.559
 trace elements additionally this is at the very 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.740
 really very good thing 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:55.349
 humate it stimulates general general 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.300
 plant development improves root growth 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.919
 systems 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.249
 besides, it improves soil fertility 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:05.009
 and watering with mats 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:06.569
 works very well on young people 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.959
 seedlings especially that is if you have 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.969
 rose which you planted she there 

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:14.219
 a week or two thinks not growing but such 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.540
 friend of the hangover very good humates 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.390
 allow 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.770
 stimulate further growth 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.210
 literally water the humate we through 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.980
 week you have a sapling 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.340
 goes to growth in such becomes good 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.710
 green and joyful here are the humates except 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.140
 that help if the rose is bad 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.000
 overwinter again stimulates to 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.480
 he began to wake up his kidneys to 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.860
 she began to grow better and in principle 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.480
 quite frequent their feeding 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.710
 fertilizer combining with field gu 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.920
 mats that is combining stimulation and 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.570
 top dressing 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:54.390
 now began to appear more say 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.220
 so complex and stimulators here are Italian 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.590
 last year I tried enough 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.780
 does not work well they also affect 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.910
 soil fertility well naturally than 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.310
 better soil than more humus in it 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.910
 the better any plant grows in volume 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.910
 including and roses 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:17.190
 [music]
