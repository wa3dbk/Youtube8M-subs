00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
apparently passed a few years ago and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.819 
apparently passed a few years ago and
vetoed<00:01:49.560> by<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.770> governor<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:51.289> I'm<00:01:52.289> expecting

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
vetoed by the governor so I'm expecting

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.529 
vetoed by the governor so I'm expecting
this<00:01:53.100> past<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.579> house<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:54.149> might<00:01:54.359> be<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
this past the house that might be a

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.690 
this past the house that might be a
fight<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:55.259> hopefully<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.009> pass<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> Senate

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
fight but hopefully in pass the Senate

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.760 
fight but hopefully in pass the Senate
and<00:01:56.849> then<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> real<00:01:57.840> fight<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.319> in<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and then the real fight is in that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.039 
and then the real fight is in that
getting<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.729> governor's<00:02:00.030> signature<00:02:00.209> on<00:02:00.569> that
