angle they are let's let's take a look

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.400 
angle they are let's let's take a look
here<00:00:25.640> smaller<00:00:26.640> than<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.000> 45<00:00:28.789> right<00:00:29.789> about<00:00:30.410> 32

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
here smaller than a 45 right about 32

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.500 
here smaller than a 45 right about 32
maybe<00:00:32.390> maybe<00:00:33.390> 20<00:00:34.640> no<00:00:35.640> right<00:00:35.940> around<00:00:36.120> 32

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
maybe maybe 20 no right around 32

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.030 
maybe maybe 20 no right around 32
degrees<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.200> angle<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:39.680> 30<00:00:40.680> yeah

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
degrees is the angle on that 30 yeah

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040 
degrees is the angle on that 30 yeah
right<00:00:41.399> around<00:00:41.610> 32<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.239> 1/2<00:00:42.420> degrees<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
right around 32 and 1/2 degrees is the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.740 
right around 32 and 1/2 degrees is the
angle<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.800> grind<00:00:44.210> there<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> are

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
angle on the grind there so if you are

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
angle on the grind there so if you are
sharpening<00:00:46.200> your<00:00:46.320> knife<00:00:46.379> that's<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
sharpening your knife that's about the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.369 
sharpening your knife that's about the
angle<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.480> you're<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> get<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.200> those

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
angle that you're going to get and those

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.500 
angle that you're going to get and those
are<00:00:49.649> carbide<00:00:50.070> glass<00:00:50.309> breakers<00:00:50.670> or<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.180> glass

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
are carbide glass breakers or not glass

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.850 
are carbide glass breakers or not glass
breaker<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> excuse<00:00:52.230> me<00:00:52.350> those<00:00:52.530> carbide

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
breaker is excuse me those carbide

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.430 
breaker is excuse me those carbide
sharpeners<00:00:53.430> there<00:00:53.670> are<00:00:54.110> removable<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.410> I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
sharpeners there are removable so I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.010 
sharpeners there are removable so I
assume<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.070> replaceable<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.149> well<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
assume they are replaceable as well the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.360 
assume they are replaceable as well the
way<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.260> works<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.800> set<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
way it works is you just set it on a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.430 
way it works is you just set it on a
table<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.359> pull<00:01:00.600> out<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:00.930> knife<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.410> just

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
table you pull out your knife I'm just

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.609 
table you pull out your knife I'm just
going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> pull<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:02.219> dirty<00:01:02.520> benchmade<00:01:03.619> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
going to pull out my dirty benchmade and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.830 
going to pull out my dirty benchmade and
just<00:01:04.860> draw<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.159> straight<00:01:05.369> through<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:06.540> so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
just draw it straight through like so

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.429 
just draw it straight through like so
and<00:01:08.090> it's<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.450> filled<00:01:09.720> sharpener<00:01:10.229> this

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
and it's it's a filled sharpener this

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.050 
and it's it's a filled sharpener this
isn't<00:01:10.820> going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> compare<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.560> say<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
about that anyway so this this could

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.679 
about that anyway so this this could
prevent<00:01:38.460> something<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.450> from

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
prevent something like that from

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.030 
prevent something like that from
happening<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.409> mean<00:01:40.530> there<00:01:40.680> are<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.799> lot<00:01:41.009> of

happening I mean there are a lot of

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.440 
happening I mean there are a lot of
sharpening<00:01:41.549> systems<00:01:41.939> out<00:01:42.090> there<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.390> we

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
sharpening systems out there that we

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.810 
sharpening systems out there that we
could<00:01:42.570> edge<00:01:43.040> Spyderco<00:01:44.040> sharp<00:01:44.340> maker<00:01:44.549> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
could edge Spyderco sharp maker that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.039 
could edge Spyderco sharp maker that
sort<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.119> thing

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049

this little I don't know little blade on

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270 
this little I don't know little blade on
there<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.780> I'm<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.469> sure<00:02:01.649> if<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.009> would<00:02:02.130> trust

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
there so I I'm not sure if I would trust

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.609 
there so I I'm not sure if I would trust
this<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.610> my<00:02:02.729> primary<00:02:03.000> seatbelt<00:02:03.570> cutter<00:02:03.719> but

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
this as my primary seatbelt cutter but

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.980 
this as my primary seatbelt cutter but
you<00:02:05.610> definitely<00:02:05.939> cut<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> few<00:02:06.509> things<00:02:06.719> with<00:02:06.869> it

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you definitely cut a few things with it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.570 
you definitely cut a few things with it
paracord<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.649> sort<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.890> thing<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
paracord that sort of thing and in a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.729 
paracord that sort of thing and in a
pinch<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.229> suspect<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.410> would<00:02:10.530> work<00:02:10.679> just

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
pinch I suspect this would work just

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.070 
pinch I suspect this would work just
fine<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> seat<00:02:11.700> belt<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.030> crank<00:02:12.720> through

fine on a seat belt just crank through
it<00:02:13.200> get

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
it get

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.809 
it get
done<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.019> that<00:02:14.769> also<00:02:14.950> comes<00:02:15.220> with<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.580> nice
