00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.520 
show you how to make a small building on
God<00:00:07.589> radiant<00:00:08.189> cool<00:00:08.660> and<00:00:11.480> here<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:13.290> make

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
and then you go to textures on

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.760 
and then you go to textures on

between<00:00:53.520> these<00:00:53.789> roofs<00:00:54.030> I'm<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
between these roofs I'm just going to

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.229 
between these roofs I'm just going to
choose<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.980> then<00:00:56.699> you're<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
choose this one and then you're going to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.690 
choose this one and then you're going to
wanna<00:00:57.859> view<00:00:59.570> layout<00:01:02.300> YZ<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.189> hit<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
wanna view layout YZ and then hit the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.530 
wanna view layout YZ and then hit the
rotate<00:01:06.150> button<00:01:07.700> rotate<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.060> angle<00:01:09.420> you

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
rotate button rotate it to the angle you

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.410 
rotate button rotate it to the angle you
want<00:01:09.570> your<00:01:09.840> roof<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:12.320> well<00:01:13.320> first<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.070> all

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
want your roof to be well first of all

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.120 
want your roof to be well first of all
you<00:01:15.420> might<00:01:15.600> want<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> turn<00:01:17.540> put<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:19.020> here

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
you might want to turn put this up here

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.210 
you might want to turn put this up here
and<00:01:20.869> then<00:01:21.869> hit<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> rotate<00:01:22.560> button<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.070> you'll

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and then hit the rotate button so you'll

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.859 
and then hit the rotate button so you'll
know<00:01:23.400> where<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.850> when<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.330> rotate<00:01:24.689> it

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
know where it will be when you rotate it

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.429 
know where it will be when you rotate it
so<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.290> where<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.310> right<00:01:27.439> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
so you know where your it's right you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.310 
so you know where your it's right you
got<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> rear

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.899 

alright<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.550> get<00:01:35.640> rid<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.820> the

alright and then you get rid of the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:45.999 
alright and then you get rid of the
rotate

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.139 

and<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.250> go<00:01:47.369> back<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.610> top<00:01:48.270> view<00:01:50.149> like

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and then you go back to top view like

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:04.060 
and then you go back to top view like
shirts<00:01:51.450> right<00:01:51.840> over<00:01:52.110> top<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.350> it

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:16.100 

and<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.400> you<00:02:05.580> hit<00:02:06.350> space<00:02:11.000> view<00:02:14.810> YZ<00:02:15.810> again

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and then you hit space view YZ again

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.000 
and then you hit space view YZ again
rotate<00:02:16.800> again<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:18.570> then<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.110> rotate<00:02:19.470> whip

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
rotate again and then you rotate whip

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.170 
rotate again and then you rotate whip
this<00:02:20.220> one<00:02:20.430> around<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.730> other<00:02:20.880> way<00:02:22.910> does<00:02:23.910> take

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
this one around the other way does take

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.200 
this one around the other way does take
some<00:02:24.420> trial<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.960> error<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:26.030> you're<00:02:27.030> probably

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
some trial and error so you're probably

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.300 
some trial and error so you're probably
going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.570> be<00:02:27.660> trying<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.020> for<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.320> while<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.220> you

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
going to be trying it for a while so you

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.670 
going to be trying it for a while so you
take<00:02:29.580> off<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> rotate<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.540> then<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.020> slide

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
take off the rotate and then you slide

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.540 
take off the rotate and then you slide
it<00:02:31.800> into<00:02:31.950> place<00:02:36.770> I'm<00:02:37.770> going<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.010> just<00:02:38.250> climb<00:02:38.490> up

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
it into place I'm going to just climb up

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.390 
it into place I'm going to just climb up
a<00:02:38.790> little<00:02:39.000> bit<00:02:39.150> see<00:02:39.330> if<00:02:39.360> it's<00:02:39.570> even<00:02:43.400> it's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
a little bit see if it's even it's

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.030 
a little bit see if it's even it's
currently<00:02:44.910> uneven<00:02:45.810> because<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.740> one's<00:02:46.950> that

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
currently uneven because that one's that

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.430 
currently uneven because that one's that
more<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.340> an<00:02:47.460> angle<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.840> you're<00:02:49.080> going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.260> need

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
more of an angle so you're going to need

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.500 
more of an angle so you're going to need
to<00:02:49.560> keep<00:02:49.860> trial<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.610> error<00:02:50.760> adjust<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.300> roof

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
to keep trial and error adjust the roof

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.990 
to keep trial and error adjust the roof
and<00:02:51.840> then<00:02:52.470> I'll<00:02:53.160> just<00:02:53.220> leave<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.820> roof

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
and then I'll just leave the roof

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.510 
and then I'll just leave the roof
crooked<00:02:54.450> when<00:02:55.290> you're<00:02:55.470> done<00:02:55.740> doing<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.070> roof

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:15.020 

make<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.550> simple<00:03:02.970> box<00:03:03.480> put<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.990> in<00:03:04.110> center

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.970 

and<00:03:15.330> then

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.910 

that<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:23.569> got<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.230> might<00:03:24.440> take<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.709> little

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
that you got it might take a little

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.000 
that you got it might take a little
adjustment<00:03:26.049> like<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.230> can<00:03:27.409> adjust<00:03:27.590> it

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
adjustment like you can adjust it

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:36.300 
adjustment like you can adjust it
vertically<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:33.230> take<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.650> off<00:03:33.739> drag<00:03:34.099> her<00:03:34.190> down

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.589 

okay<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:37.549> then<00:03:37.730> hit<00:03:38.110> escape<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:40.370> then<00:03:40.599> add
