why tour with Porter and not tour solo
right<00:03:34.420> now<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.810> do<00:03:35.410> both<00:03:35.739> I<00:03:36.010> mean<00:03:36.250> that<00:03:36.430> was<00:03:36.549> just

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
right now I do both I mean that was just

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.819 
right now I do both I mean that was just
that<00:03:36.820> an<00:03:37.180> idea<00:03:37.480> we<00:03:37.660> had<00:03:37.870> because<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.380> know<00:03:38.530> um

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
that an idea we had because you know um

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.520 
that an idea we had because you know um
we<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:39.489> each<00:03:39.670> other's<00:03:39.940> music<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.600> we've

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
we like each other's music and we've

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.740 
we like each other's music and we've
been<00:03:41.739> on<00:03:41.829> tour<00:03:41.950> before<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.670> our<00:03:43.239> sets<00:03:43.540> are

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
been on tour before and our sets are

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.449 
been on tour before and our sets are
fairly<00:03:44.019> similar<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.739> style<00:03:45.010> just<00:03:45.100> fits

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
fairly similar and the style just fits

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.880 
fairly similar and the style just fits
really<00:03:45.670> well<00:03:45.790> together<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.470> we<00:03:47.470> thought<00:03:47.650> it

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
really well together so we thought it

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.140 
really well together so we thought it
would<00:03:47.920> be<00:03:48.130> something<00:03:48.340> really<00:03:48.700> cool<00:03:48.850> for<00:03:49.030> the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
would be something really cool for the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.780 
would be something really cool for the
fans<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:50.079> just<00:03:50.350> once<00:03:50.650> make<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.370> tour<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.700> we

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
fans to just once make it tour that we

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.310 
fans to just once make it tour that we
played<00:03:52.000> together<00:03:52.150> back<00:03:52.570> to<00:03:52.750> back<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.200> know

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
played together back to back you know

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.650 
played together back to back you know
which<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:53.620> an<00:03:53.709> idea<00:03:53.950> we<00:03:54.130> had<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.549> people<00:03:55.299> seem

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
which is an idea we had and people seem
