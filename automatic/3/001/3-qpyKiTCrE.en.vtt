pesticides sprayed foods but that's not

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.620 
pesticides sprayed foods but that's not
enough<00:01:19.860> check<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.909> researchers<00:01:21.540> have

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
enough check this out researchers have

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.300 
enough check this out researchers have
also<00:01:21.750> shown<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.170> soy<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.890> affect<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
also shown that soy can affect the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.330 
also shown that soy can affect the
hormonal<00:01:23.820> balance<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.540> both<00:01:24.990> men<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.650> women

hormonal balance of both men and women

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.240 
hormonal balance of both men and women
in<00:01:26.549> opposite<00:01:27.420> ways<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.259> women<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:29.009> risk

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
in opposite ways so women can be at risk

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.969 
in opposite ways so women can be at risk
for<00:01:29.579> higher<00:01:29.909> testosterone<00:01:30.650> increased<00:01:31.650> risk

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
for higher testosterone increased risk

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.219 
for higher testosterone increased risk
of<00:01:32.130> breast<00:01:32.340> cancer<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> fat<00:01:33.329> storage<00:01:33.780> while

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
of breast cancer and fat storage while

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.319 
of breast cancer and fat storage while
men<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:34.799> at<00:01:34.920> risk<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.490> higher<00:01:35.729> estrogen

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
men are at risk for higher estrogen

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
men are at risk for higher estrogen
that's<00:01:37.079> leading<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.439> lower<00:01:37.850> testosterone

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that's leading to lower testosterone

this<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.189> because<00:01:41.579> soy<00:01:41.909> contains

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
this is because soy contains

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.469 
this is because soy contains
