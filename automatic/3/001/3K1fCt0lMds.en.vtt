00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.439 

told<00:00:57.979> you<00:00:58.190> there's<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.550> reason<00:00:58.909> why<00:00:59.089> I<00:00:59.120> got<00:00:59.360> all

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
told you there's a reason why I got all

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:12.760 
told you there's a reason why I got all
the<00:00:59.570> star<00:00:59.870> bits<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:07.869> this<00:01:08.869> leads<00:01:09.200> to

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.929 

the<00:01:13.770> fuse<00:01:14.070> boneyard<00:01:14.729> galaxy<00:01:16.490> does<00:01:17.490> anybody

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the fuse boneyard galaxy does anybody

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.620 
the fuse boneyard galaxy does anybody
remember<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:19.500> second<00:01:19.920> star<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.630> ghostly

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
remember the second star in ghostly

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.960 
remember the second star in ghostly
galaxy<00:01:22.079> this<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> same<00:01:22.829> thing<00:01:23.189> except<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
galaxy this is the same thing except it

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.330 
galaxy this is the same thing except it
takes<00:01:24.119> place<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.539> a<00:01:24.570> different<00:01:24.930> course<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
takes place on a different course and I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.039 
takes place on a different course and I
actually<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.180> easier<00:01:27.659> than<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
actually think this is easier than the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:36.020 
actually think this is easier than the
first<00:01:28.229> course<00:01:34.009> really<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.280> way<00:01:35.579> easier

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
first course really this is way easier

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.960 
first course really this is way easier
than<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.390> other<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:37.399> my<00:01:38.399> first<00:01:38.640> time<00:01:38.759> through

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
than the other one my first time through

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:49.960 
than the other one my first time through
the<00:01:39.030> game<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> got<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> first<00:01:40.049> try

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.490 

they<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.030> put<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.330> lot<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.479> coins<00:01:51.810> down<00:01:52.080> here<00:01:52.319> for

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
they do put a lot of coins down here for

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:16.490 
they do put a lot of coins down here for
some<00:01:52.649> reason<00:01:53.009> though<00:01:57.890> right<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.959> remember

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
some reason though right and remember

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.660 
some reason though right and remember
this<00:02:17.930> here<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.079> again<00:02:22.370> pretty<00:02:23.370> much<00:02:23.489> you<00:02:23.609> just

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
this here is again pretty much you just

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.090 
this here is again pretty much you just
have<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.090> all<00:02:24.299> the<00:02:24.630> wind<00:02:25.140> tunnels<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.799> you'll

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
have to all the wind tunnels and you'll

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:54.640 
have to all the wind tunnels and you'll
be<00:02:26.190> fine

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.590 

want<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.710> activate<00:02:56.100> all<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.520> these<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.450> can

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
want to activate all of these so you can

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:14.110 
want to activate all of these so you can
stay

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.339 

this<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.900> bad

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:31.530 

let's<00:03:20.349> do<00:03:20.680> this<00:03:20.800> is<00:03:20.950> my<00:03:21.069> first<00:03:21.310> try<00:03:21.550> before<00:03:30.540> no

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
let's do this is my first try before no

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.360 
let's do this is my first try before no
there's<00:03:31.930> reason<00:03:32.349> it's<00:03:32.849> stockpiling<00:03:33.849> lines<00:03:35.370> so

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
there's reason it's stockpiling lines so

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.890 
there's reason it's stockpiling lines so
what<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.580> have<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:36.819> do<00:03:36.910> here<00:03:39.720> because<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.750> lot

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
what you have to do here because a lot

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.180 
what you have to do here because a lot
of<00:03:40.930> people<00:03:41.260> seem<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.590> have<00:03:41.680> trouble<00:03:41.830> with<00:03:42.069> this

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
of people seem to have trouble with this

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.410 
of people seem to have trouble with this
galaxy<00:03:42.730> I<00:03:44.580> guess<00:03:45.580> I<00:03:45.700> just<00:03:45.730> got<00:03:46.000> lucky<00:03:46.030> and

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
galaxy I guess I just got lucky and

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:55.740 
galaxy I guess I just got lucky and
managed<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.840> activate<00:03:52.709> all<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:54.569> what<00:03:55.569> do<00:03:55.630> they

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
managed to activate all the what do they

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.850 
managed to activate all the what do they
call<00:03:56.069> all<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.280> fans<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.849> first<00:03:58.060> time<00:03:58.329> I<00:04:01.860> had

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
call all the fans the first time I had

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.009 
call all the fans the first time I had
trouble<00:04:03.069> with<00:04:03.220> this<00:04:03.340> race<00:04:03.579> before<00:04:03.849> or<00:04:04.780> the

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
trouble with this race before or the

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.380 
trouble with this race before or the
first<00:04:05.200> version<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.739> anyway<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:07.000> photo

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
first version of it anyway that photo

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:34.750 
first version of it anyway that photo
finish<00:04:07.840> was<00:04:08.110> hilarious

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:42.900 

I<00:04:38.050> just<00:04:39.050> really<00:04:39.290> screwed<00:04:39.650> up<00:04:39.740> last<00:04:39.950> time<00:04:40.220> I

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.650 

didn't<00:04:43.910> take<00:04:44.030> this<00:04:44.240> either<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:47.300> shortcut

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
didn't take this either that shortcut

00:04:47.660 --> 00:05:03.970 
didn't take this either that shortcut
really<00:04:47.930> helps<00:04:48.170> a<00:04:48.260> lot<00:04:56.020> smoke<00:04:57.020> them<00:05:02.950> see<00:05:03.950> how

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
really helps a lot smoke them see how

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.080 
really helps a lot smoke them see how
wasn't<00:05:04.220> too<00:05:04.430> bad<00:05:04.640> I<00:05:06.670> think<00:05:07.670> that<00:05:07.790> the<00:05:07.880> first

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
wasn't too bad I think that the first

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:17.080 
wasn't too bad I think that the first
race<00:05:08.570> with<00:05:08.810> this<00:05:08.990> guy<00:05:09.140> is<00:05:09.170> way<00:05:09.620> harder<00:05:10.010> I<00:05:16.090> think

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
race with this guy is way harder I think

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.910 
race with this guy is way harder I think
there's<00:05:17.240> one<00:05:17.300> more<00:05:17.870> hungry<00:05:18.200> bloom<00:05:18.500> after<00:05:18.680> this

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
there's one more hungry bloom after this

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.620 
there's one more hungry bloom after this
