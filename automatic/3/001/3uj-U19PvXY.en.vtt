For Ever range I'm it is a little
smaller<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.590> definitely<00:00:43.829> has<00:00:44.460> good<00:00:44.910> color

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
smaller but it definitely has good color

concealer it is meant to work with those

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.540 
concealer it is meant to work with those
but<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.559> doesn't<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> don't<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.520> have

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
but it doesn't you don't have to have

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.460 
but it doesn't you don't have to have
them<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.859> to<00:01:01.859> work<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.910> I'm<00:01:03.660> also<00:01:04.019> it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
them to to work with this so I'm also it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.100 
them to to work with this so I'm also it
provides<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.949> 24-hour<00:01:05.670> where<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.479> transfer

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
provides a 24-hour where that's transfer

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.880 
provides a 24-hour where that's transfer
resistant<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.220> me<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.880> long<00:01:09.210> where<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:10.680> is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
resistant it is me for long where it is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
resistant it is me for long where it is
pretty<00:01:11.610> heavy<00:01:11.880> because<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.780> full<00:01:12.990> coverage

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
pretty heavy because it's full coverage

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.370 
pretty heavy because it's full coverage
so<00:01:13.799> usually<00:01:14.340> full<00:01:14.970> coverage<00:01:15.360> foundations<00:01:16.140> are

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
so usually full coverage foundations are

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.950 
so usually full coverage foundations are
a<00:01:16.409> little<00:01:16.619> bit<00:01:16.860> thicker<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:18.240> does<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.659> some

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
a little bit thicker it does have some

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.380 
a little bit thicker it does have some
extra<00:01:19.290> technical<00:01:19.860> qualities<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.119> that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
extra technical qualities to it that

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.080 
extra technical qualities to it that
I'll<00:01:21.509> explain<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.290> second<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.250> I'll<00:01:23.490> leap

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
I'll explain in a second and I'll leap

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.770 
I'll explain in a second and I'll leap
to<00:01:24.390> verbatim<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:26.450> description<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
to verbatim the description of it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.350 
to verbatim the description of it
because<00:01:28.229> sometimes<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.549> don't<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
because sometimes I don't know how to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.520 
because sometimes I don't know how to
speak<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.259> um<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.770> says<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.960> has<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> bold

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
speak but um it says that it has a bold

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.450 
speak but um it says that it has a bold

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
pigments that can effectively cover

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.600 
pigments that can effectively cover

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and the best siliconic elastomers and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.719 
and the best siliconic elastomers and
siliconic<00:01:48.570> esters<00:01:49.079> provide<00:01:49.560> 24-hour<00:01:50.220> wear

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
siliconic esters provide 24-hour wear

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.679 
siliconic esters provide 24-hour wear
with<00:01:51.450> transfer<00:01:52.259> resistance<00:01:53.689> natural

a velvety texture for perfectly smooth
hydrated<00:02:03.719> skin<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.560> I'd<00:02:04.710> say<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.130> pretty

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
hydrated skin so I'd say that pretty

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.960 
hydrated skin so I'd say that pretty
much<00:02:05.700> sums<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:06.869> as<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> description<00:02:08.520> of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
much sums it up as to the description of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.240 
much sums it up as to the description of
what<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.539> does<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.979> let<00:02:11.129> me<00:02:11.160> just

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
what this does for you but let me just

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.030 
what this does for you but let me just
get<00:02:11.580> into

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
get into

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.369 
get into
technicalities<00:02:12.879> of<00:02:12.909> this<00:02:13.299> foundation<00:02:13.480> this

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
broken out from it I saw some reviews

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.890 
broken out from it I saw some reviews
that<00:05:33.979> people<00:05:34.669> were<00:05:34.789> complaining<00:05:35.030> of<00:05:35.479> breaking

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
that people were complaining of breaking

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.140 
that people were complaining of breaking
out<00:05:36.080> but<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.800> honestly<00:05:37.430> don't<00:05:37.610> see<00:05:37.759> how<00:05:37.940> that's

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
out but I honestly don't see how that's

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.050 
out but I honestly don't see how that's
possible<00:05:38.360> because<00:05:38.960> it<00:05:39.680> has<00:05:39.979> no<00:05:40.190> parabens<00:05:40.820> no

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
or something like I really don't see how

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.330 
or something like I really don't see how
you<00:05:51.020> could<00:05:51.199> break<00:05:51.409> out<00:05:51.560> or<00:05:51.770> unless<00:05:52.099> you're

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
you could break out or unless you're

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.850 
you could break out or unless you're
just<00:05:52.400> a<00:05:52.729> very<00:05:52.940> sensitive<00:05:53.419> skin<00:05:53.810> type<00:05:54.050> which<00:05:54.650> is

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
just a very sensitive skin type which is

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.290 
just a very sensitive skin type which is
totally<00:05:55.310> possible<00:05:55.460> because<00:05:56.030> it's<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.270> very

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
totally possible because it's a very

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.589 
totally possible because it's a very
heavy<00:05:56.750> coverage<00:05:57.289> so<00:05:57.979> if<00:05:58.340> you<00:05:58.460> find<00:05:58.759> that<00:05:59.180> it's

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
heavy coverage so if you find that it's

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.020 
heavy coverage so if you find that it's
a<00:05:59.750> little<00:05:59.780> too<00:06:00.139> heavy<00:06:00.349> for<00:06:00.680> you<00:06:00.830> but<00:06:01.130> you<00:06:01.639> want

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
a little too heavy for you but you want

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.390 
a little too heavy for you but you want
that<00:06:02.240> type<00:06:02.479> of<00:06:02.509> coverage<00:06:03.050> and<00:06:03.409> just<00:06:03.650> like<00:06:04.280> I

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
that type of coverage and just like I

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.999 
that type of coverage and just like I
said<00:06:04.639> cut<00:06:04.909> it<00:06:05.090> with<00:06:05.240> a<00:06:05.300> primer<00:06:05.750> make<00:06:06.530> sure<00:06:06.560> it's

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009
