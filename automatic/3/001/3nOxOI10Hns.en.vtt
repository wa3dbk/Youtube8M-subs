00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:09.179

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.070
 this is our home i am sun and 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.360
 then they accompany you I make them do a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.370
 round 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.140
 this is the kitchen we live in 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.990
 seven apartment where everything takes place 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.760
 all life extra academic here like 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.340
 you can see we have the rounds of 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.029
 cleaning the shifts for the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.910
 kitchen 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.590
 these members are very useful because there 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.230
 divide the tasks 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.500
 of course it is not easy to manage the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.210
 study life and management of the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.989
 home and we are seven women in one 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.989
 flat 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.420
 makes me she was committed in the best 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.420
 pleasure well 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.210
 where is the profit today from the prosecution resumes 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.940
 in the cooperatives of the entrepreneur who 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.750
 reja that invests and has its own 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.970
 remuneration 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.250
 so what do you think to solve 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.199
 this point certainly now stronger 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.930
 taxation of annuities you realize 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.140
 that you can do a study experience e 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.820
 of life with students with men with 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.370
 boys who come from all sides 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.590
 of the world and with them there can be a 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.590
 confrontation that really opens you up inside 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.960
 It is important that we bear in mind the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.860
 three pillars always underlying what it is 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.520
 a base meeting if you learn to 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.979
 structuring a thought 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.570
 then politics is not separable 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.130
 economy is not separable from the 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.729
 theology not to be words of the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.740
 philosophy learn knowledge into operation 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.780
 to do and he shovels towards entered 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.319
 direct finance of these teachers 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.450
 the other question that ours asked 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.189
 raffaele we see her sailing tomorrow 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.280
 nod only because it takes it up again 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.740
 just Augustine after the sofia method 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.149
 and very innovative because it puts the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.759
 center the dynamics of the relationship of the 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.970
 reciprocity and therefore first of all 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.520
 students and teachers 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.400
 a relationship in which both are 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.070
 all active according to their task 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.400
 two are protagonists this is seen 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:25.410
 also in academic life where the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.410
 center is the educational community 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.010
 well first of all I would point out the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.890
 I believe that they are all origins 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.610
 different but all of them 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.350
 santino brazilian egyptian french is 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.320
 one of the differences we want immediately 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.200
 is that the teacher in some way there 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.420
 comes to meet not only in the moment 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.390
 which gives us something in class in a way 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.880
 classic but in the corridor takes the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.680
 coffee dealing with us by sharing a 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.780
 doubt therefore arises in everyone's life 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.860
 the days during the lesson prepared 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.560
 exam lesson in sharing the 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.780
 day together this sharing for 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.740
 the general enrichment are and not on 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:16.180
 here to better understand how we can 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:21.630
 build for the future for more cleanings 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.630
 her for crisis situation with jeans 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.720
 one thing sofia and exceptionally unique 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.720
 module 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:48.020
 admit it punch and with whom 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.410
 except to investigate 7 of motion 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.410
 that as well 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.140
 for me personally as a person who does 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.030
 research is possible 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.650
 weaving relationships with others 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.010
 research groups that somehow 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.900
 are related to my perspective e 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.060
 this certainly very important 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.890
 just not to be a happy island e 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.500
 enough, but let's say this happiness 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.069
 even outside happiness in the sense of 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.069
 fertility
