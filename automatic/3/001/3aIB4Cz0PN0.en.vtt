00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello our math course brings 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.340
 today an exercise in reasoning 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.110
 logical problem is the perimeter problem on the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.190
 of the polygon area was an issue 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.940
 demanded by the Brazilian Olympiad 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:24.080
 obmep mathematics in the year 2003 is the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.760
 question of the first stage egg and rum 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.619
 well this issue also involves the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.880
 called the fundamental principle of 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.239
 lato man count 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.370
 so let's announce new card 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.590
 ensures it represents a jump in which all 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.629
 the sides are horizontal or vertical and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.850
 have the same length 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.010
 the perimeter said Pauline of 56 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.309
 centimeters what is your area 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.640
 and here it only had five options 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.129
 in the first place the following he already 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.460
 said here the following that all sides 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.829
 are horizontal or vertical effect 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.799
 then the horizontal sides your hand 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.119
 correct with the radicals and have the same 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:17.970
 This length is paulina 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:20.670
 figure well then this length here is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.430
 equal to this length and arrived and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.490
 all are equal between the perimeter of 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.829
 paulinho is 56 site the perimeter 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:39.630
 remembering that it would be to be in 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:41.340
 exactly is the sum of the lips 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.259
 this figure is not that figure 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.290
 traditional that we have a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.500
 square a rectangle trapeze she has 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.530
 several small sides can not be 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.329
 here and all these sides will go 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.829
 be taken to give the perimeter 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.670
 total 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:03.719
 as a result of the question therefore if the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.880
 people do here a count of all 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.610
 these same sides we will get 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.590
 how many equal sides do we have and adding up 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.700
 all sides we obtain the perimeter of the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.760
 your fault 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:22.400
 let's do it 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:24.680
 Here the perimeter is equal to the sum of the sides 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.970
 perfect, so let's add the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:39.849
 Lips if I get right from here 1 2 3 4 5 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:43.519
 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19 21 23 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:51.349
 456 7 28 perfect 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:56.810
 so I can say that I have is 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:03:02.950
 made the perimeter that was given 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:09.319
 it is numerically equal to that of the subway 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:12.530
 five in six centimeters perfect 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:21.319
 Now if I interview, we feel his 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:27.739
 divide perimeter by the value of one side 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:31.280
 to the side but only in practice I go 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:35.090
 know the number of right side by side 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:53.319
 I'll get the value on one side or 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:56.319
 if I get 2850 here without dividing 56 by 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.319
 exactly 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.970
 2828 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:18.850
 I will get the value of the measure of a 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:24.550
 side or that is 2 or each side 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:26.400
 measure 2 centimeters from here we can give 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.730
 continuity to the resolution of the 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.220
 Perfect 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.980
 he asks what his area is right now 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.900
 here folks to have a 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.800
 how to calculate and 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.870
 Prince 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.760
 I could do for divisions here by 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.320
 example clown figure and rectangular 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.330
 great 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.710
 then the sea with this small return 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.010
 because the sea with this one 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.260
 priest roque and so on 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.000
 but there is another way of doing this 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.440
 maybe a little more 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.420
 smart, right? 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:02.440
 Maybe it's then we can do the 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:05.340
 You can pick up the 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:13.320
 figure in several squares and several 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:16.300
 perfect several squares look right 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.510
 will give a little work to the 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.820
 people put all of them here but what 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.530
 is the understanding of how to solve 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:28.260
 question 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:30.550
 Look what I'm doing. 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.600
 continuing here look I'm joining 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.960
 huh 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:40.740
 and now let's do horizontal - of 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.740
 right horizontally 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:50.640
 we're getting almost complete 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.830
 but this one here 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.380
 and this one here then in practice never 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:01.230
 know the opposite area every four years 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:06.070
 from small for example what is the area 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:11.310
 leave here text here 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:13.480
 I know that each side here is worth 2 cm 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.380
 this is also worth swat in 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:22.630
 horizontal is at 14 né then to 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:28.470
 calculate the area is only we get a 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:31.210
 square the area of ​​a square, right? 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:37.570
 area of ​​a small square is 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:40.050
 How much is two centimeters times two? 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.050
 centimeters 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.120
 this is going to be four centimeters 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.110
 well the question has not yet been 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.510
 finished 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.800
 the examining examiner asks that 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.380
 each of these areas of education 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:03.100
 while his pulse here to stroll and 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:12.300
 Let's count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:16.210
 13 14 15 19 15 hours I have 25 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:19.180
 Squares are not times four cents 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.900
 every day will give no sense to the 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.320
 square 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:27.700
 this is our answer, which is the 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:29.530
 the dedicated item grateful the tension continued
