00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello everyone with you vladimir but family in 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.930
 the gym we will not consider them all 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.130
 the nuances of the traction technique itself and the setting 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.349
 legs and more 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.349
 nothing let's get down to business order yes 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.680
 there are two kinds of deadlift this 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.820
 classic amount 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.220
 I'll show you the first option now. 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.180
 classical to engage in technology under 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.160
 posing legs to the position of the back and 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.360
 the nuances that is first thing 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.559
 most importantly we must approach as much as possible 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.730
 closer to the fingerboard 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.940
 that is, many must be very 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:54.210
 decay next to 2 grab a little bit and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.040
 shoulders here on the side look you back 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.739
 exactly the back should be maximized 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.390
 bend that is first tip if u 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.100
 you have at home the end of the wand is flat 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.869
 wand when you ask a friend with anyone 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 you exercise that is when you 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.530
 become shells 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.540
 that he invested in Moscow but this wand 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.550
 that is, this is the best indicator as 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.100
 you perform the technique that is the beam 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:23.310
 must be from blade lengths to to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.930
 tailbone and in the lumbar region should 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.880
 could such a deflection a fur coat could arm 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.840
 stick that is the fruit attacked which 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.150
 adjacent grandfather on the shoulder blade and tight where 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.190
 tailbone and in the loins should be in the area 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.140
 so that the hand would fit good Prague 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.049
 must be looking fit and us 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.610
 maximally lowered on their feet took 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.570
 two backs always 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.810
 you profile spatula 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:57.760
 jars brought here two motions introduced 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:01.100
 the first movement begins with the heels of dreams 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:08.660
 push immediately try to push 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:13.340
 ground feet here you raised and the second 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:21.580
 the movement goes back to the turn not 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:26.530
 back down to knees and legs 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.920
 this is the most important thing in this movement 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.920
 Besides 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.220
 Fathers should be on the movement with legs 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.849
 we remember you then come again 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.060
 as close as possible 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.599
 creep up spinochku bent bulbs 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.709
 do you feel 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.720
 above the legs we give the legs raised to here and 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.590
 further which eliminates the back 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.510
 since there are no such movements 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.700
 I advise you to do and the transverse spine 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.260
 make it clear already do more on 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.870
 competitions to judge show 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.790
 something I raised give and you will be for that is 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.549
 if you work on 5 to 6 reps 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.579
 in training homework then 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:18.769
 tried to raise 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:22.510
 here again there are such nuances now 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:26.239
 I'll show you the second option is the amount 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.900
 that is, well, Iâ€™m already wider in 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.209
 In principle, all the same moments with the back 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.850
 with also starting with legs keep back 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.030
 Here now just goes another 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.370
 staging is more for people who 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.620
 there may be someone taller than confusion 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.420
 In general, these two performances a person cleans 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.740
 for myself personally that is to 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.570
 specifically 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.200
 it was more convenient to perform this movement that 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.200
 by maximum growth in this movement 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:00.150
 We look from this side because it was 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.240
 obviously foot setting plays goes 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.300
 This is so broad, that is, it is average. 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.680
 makes someone straight generally genuine then 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.600
 have we cut the amplitude into this 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.270
 movement through the shorter the amplitude 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.040
 more we can without raised that is 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:22.260
 again yes and the accent many do 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:29.280
 emphasis on all that it took back as 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:32.730
 keep food and feet 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.120
 him feet pushes reptile glasses raised to 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.470
 knees and back already live they also 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.060
 settled down and on with their feet 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:47.340
 the principle is the same only the difference goes 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.870
 posing leg here's another such nuance 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.240
 grip 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:56.919
 you are different one-sided and 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.470
 different lot that is different watts already 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.270
 more such moments apply when 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.449
 go to the limit building on 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.039
 event that there is no such that 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.319
 you jumped out the bar because already 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.690
 when they wrote skinny and on many are ready for 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.849
 this world is not behind the forearm 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:18.250
 people are intimidated by the fact that they take different 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:24.069
 here it is different watts hereby 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:26.860
 better fit this rhyme to i advise 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.750
 about the seizure they have to wear it once 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.009
 true competition driver or when 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.750
 someone responsible moment not to 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.750
 it was so not breaking anything 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:41.110
 better to work with one-sided sweat 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.469
 because in this her arm go out 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:50.500
 grip in the training process I do 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:53.199
 deserve not touch until all such nuances 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.150
 technicians in the next video i will show you 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.219
 address 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:02.440
 all the advantages of the camp that gives 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:03.430
 come to the theory let's break down the nuances 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.909
 rod Holds 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.860
 Good luck to everyone in training competitions 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:11.699
 life with you was vladimir 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.699
 see you
