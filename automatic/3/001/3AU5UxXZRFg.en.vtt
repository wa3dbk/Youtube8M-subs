00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.520 
I just think I need 3000 shields maybe

do-do-do-do-do<00:02:02.910> there<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:04.320> out<00:02:04.560> in

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
do-do-do-do-do there it is just out in

do-do-do-do-do there it is just out in
distance<00:02:05.760> and<00:02:06.180> what<00:02:06.330> you<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.720> run<00:02:06.960> all

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
distance and what you can do is run all

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.690 
distance and what you can do is run all
the<00:02:07.500> way<00:02:07.620> around<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.980> corner<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.340> you'll<00:02:08.490> see

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the way around the corner and you'll see

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.270 
the way around the corner and you'll see
through<00:02:08.940> my<00:02:09.119> 2,000<00:02:09.690> shields<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.290> 2900

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
through my 2,000 shields and 2900

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.600 
through my 2,000 shields and 2900
hellfire<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.850> try<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:13.650> take<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:13.890> die<00:02:14.310> than<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
hellfire to try and take it die than the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.300 
hellfire to try and take it die than the
drink<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.090> make<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.510> well<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.260> had<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.800> good<00:02:17.130> old

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
drink to make it well I had a good old

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.790 
drink to make it well I had a good old
look<00:02:17.400> around<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.840> appears<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:19.710> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
look around this appears to be the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.960 
look around this appears to be the
closest<00:02:20.250> place<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.970> try<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.390> get<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.870> uh

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
closest place to try and get to it uh

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.190 
closest place to try and get to it uh
and<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.240> yeah<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.450> guess<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.840> out<00:02:25.050> there

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
and so yeah I guess it's just out there

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.430 
and so yeah I guess it's just out there
someone<00:02:25.560> right<00:02:25.710> ahead<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.760> me<00:02:27.140> anyway<00:02:28.140> you

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
someone right ahead of me anyway you

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.380 
someone right ahead of me anyway you
need<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.680> make<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.040> running<00:02:29.610> jump

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
need to make a running jump

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.090 
need to make a running jump
I<00:02:30.450> guess<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.200> you've<00:02:31.320> got<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.650> three<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
I guess if you've got like three and a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.470 
I guess if you've got like three and a
half<00:02:32.220> thousand<00:02:32.640> shields<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.120> probably

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
half thousand shields it probably

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.020 
half thousand shields it probably
wouldn't<00:02:33.690> be<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.810> hard

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
wouldn't be that hard

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.770 
wouldn't be that hard
jumping<00:02:36.030> doesn't<00:02:36.300> seem<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.540> make<00:02:36.660> much

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
jumping doesn't seem to make much

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.300 
jumping doesn't seem to make much
difference<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.830> probably<00:02:38.100> want<00:02:38.280> to

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
difference and you probably want to

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.650 
difference and you probably want to
avoid<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.700> bubbles<00:02:39.000> because<00:02:39.210> they<00:02:39.330> knock<00:02:39.510> you

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
avoid the bubbles because they knock you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.080 
avoid the bubbles because they knock you
backwards<00:02:40.200> which<00:02:41.010> doesn't<00:02:41.550> really<00:02:41.790> help

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
backwards which doesn't really help

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.300 
backwards which doesn't really help
anyone<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:42.660> on<00:02:43.530> if<00:02:43.770> you've<00:02:43.890> got<00:02:44.070> there<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
anyone but on if you've got there and

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.700 
anyone but on if you've got there and
there's<00:02:44.460> anything<00:02:44.640> exciting<00:02:45.180> let<00:02:45.330> me<00:02:45.450> know

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
there's anything exciting let me know

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.860 
there's anything exciting let me know
