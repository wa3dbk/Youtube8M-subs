00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello we vote later takes place 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.279
 One never does it and I have one for you today 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.410
 a six against six team deathmatch 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.599
 on the map hijack the whole with the pnp 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.679
 whoever plays and 41 likes it 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.969
 maybe not so spectacular 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.500
 Sounds like I have only here with 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.210
 Drone contador without and already 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.529
 played patched lightning and there 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.210
 then you are very strong on weapons 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.279
 kills instructed me what to do here 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.900
 even with over 35 in the end, yes 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.789
 I have to say that pretty well 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.529
 and it's always on three maps 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.240
 problem that the mails without really 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.859
 to do a lot for it very easily 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.179
 meet opponents where you not only 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.230
 you have to be offensive game team now 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.090
 also always one step ahead 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.350
 I think that's why I have to be right now 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.700
 so many weapons kiss for such a team 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.170
 deathmatch was something special 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.579
 and i want this video today 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.190
 Just use it for a little 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.600
 give video answer to a video what 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.920
 really very much in our community 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.750
 Strongly made the round and what a 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.670
 has triggered very broad discussion 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.680
 also some of the biggest commentators 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.000
 have such example commander warrior 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.980
 your opinion under this video there 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.870
 let it go to the video of kieler 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.879
 lie about the leg compensation and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.340
 call of duty was a very good one 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.690
 elaborated video was something in mine 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.730
 but a little bit overall 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.430
 the sense media have not missed 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.610
 you can not say but something like that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.110
 a bit yes the ratio of good to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.439
 bad performances in mine too 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.210
 very very blatantly falsified he has 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.860
 really has very very negative about good 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.810
 Internet line talked about delay 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.900
 computation how strong they actually are 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.549
 good lines, so to speak bad 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.869
 and that is in my eyes, however 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.150
 complete bush and I have it in front 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.439
 everything then noticed that I have 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.450
 he then made the video on raid 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.890
 this 93 gameplay and then yes 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.630
 I said I'm new to the internet 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.729
 I'll get the line and then I will 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.110
 Also a better gameplay in the tick 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.189
 In any case , I'm going to get there 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.840
 I'm pretty sure 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.790
 and that is somewhere the opinion 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.899
 from all good call of duty players 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.490
 which I personally know and the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.810
 also active on youtube if you are 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.970
 for example, the mister excursion 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.930
 xbl look who has to mw3 times its 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.909
 get new line 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.560
 and especially mw3 is so a game where 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.070
 the leg compensation supposedly so strong 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.409
 should be 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.079
 and he said it is a completely new one 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.700
 feeling so call of duty to play and he 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.380
 is also then after he his new 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.969
 line comes in mw3 actually one 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.049
 the best known and best player then 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.939
 also become somewhere 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.920
 there you can already see something for 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.239
 significant differences it matters 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 you really a bad one and then 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.069
 has a good lead and a 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.560
 yes there are james for example 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.610
 something similar said that has been stirring 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.770
 yes, partly about his 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.010
 Internet connection on and there are even 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.050
 This job gaga song above market level in 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.640
 a text passage even occurs to you 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.569
 need a fast internet so 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.880
 to be able to play 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.190
 So there you just have to say there is 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.810
 just so many prove that good 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.700
 really so crucial and 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.900
 call of duty and I think that needs 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.220
 one spot will not be discussed 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.019
 and that was not the 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.519
 Intent of kiel young in the video 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.290
 So that was easy from the people 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.510
 misinterpreted and then we have 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.040
 people under my 93 kg of gameplay 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.239
 raid written when your new one 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.860
 then you have your game 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.780
 leaves a lot worse because you then 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.730
 This hardship was compensation as and 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.350
 then I'm up for it too 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.880
 theme'm ever a video response 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.049
 to do it because it's easy 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.000
 complete idiocy is what people do 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.680
 if you just have written 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.269
 Let's have a look at the teacher compensation 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.040
 Of course in individual play times 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.319
 really a hairpiece decided that 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.610
 me too yes if for example that 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.870
 can have very different reasons 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.370
 for example the post in one 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.660
 American lobby where you yourself from 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.549
 Germany comes then you can 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.959
 Of course, none of the Americans 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.640
 Deliver really good connection yourself 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.019
 if you yourself have a good connection 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.549
 and there it can be that the 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.200
 leg compensation once caught hard 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.459
 but basically it's just like that 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.930
 if you look at how many 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.730
 you disadvantage with a bad one 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.440
 connection has so what I have now 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.820
 It could not just be that way 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.959
 simply single shots are not rind 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.519
 be registered and that one 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.370
 in total then more shots, so to speak 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.920
 each opponent needs some running 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.239
 also slower over the map than his 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.799
 I noticed something in the team first of all 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.510
 if you like mike myers at black ops 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.829
 I just played that all the time 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.359
 a gold became a gold of us though 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.060
 both had the same class then what 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.320
 can not be somewhere and what is online 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.370
 then of course it should be much stronger it 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.140
 in private play 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.600
 it's just like that just when 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.230
 one on opponent wide in 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.760
 one-on-one situations that way 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.200
 is brought away and in a funny way 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.540
 direction in which you actually at all 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.440
 do not want to go and you and the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.030
 simply in a sense 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.340
 I would say is unrealistic 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.329
 or so is not preprogrammed by 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.829
 if you play on a better one 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.690
 connection would play and you 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.340
 so to speak then just behind the opponent 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.139
 is and still still too 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.060
 a twisted one, so to speak complete 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.700
 somehow wrong was blocked away 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.900
 that the enemy can kill one directly 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.549
 of course now so that just the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.280
 Delay time if you have an action 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.900
 on his controller that executes that 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.060
 whole of course only delayed in the game 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.530
 then run somewhere and that 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.210
 Above all , you see you fighting very well 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.710
 because you already on the ground 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.330
 lies out of his sight and if you go then 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.640
 the kill cam looks at itself from the opponent 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.500
 then you are not even yes and that 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.849
 are just a thing that with the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.039
 with bad connection there are 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.539
 There are many more disadvantages 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.860
 which one has and, above all, follow 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.990
 of course my black has 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.280
 ops the situation that is nearing 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.860
 my dog ​​because it would have been really good 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.020
 that will be easy 130 140 gameplay 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.099
 bmw was that too and simply because 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.320
 I am more ammunition for each opponent 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.669
 it was intended that 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.590
 I did not have ammo at the end 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.240
 more to say my last 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.770
 make conclusion for the dogs and there 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.270
 you have to say that's how they are 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.010
 according to situations that just then 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.330
 always appears and I think that was 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.159
 but also not at all 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.020
 intention of killer boys to say that 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.280
 a good internet line is a disadvantage 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.870
 to bring in call of duty but it was 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.220
 simply it was more or less about it 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.870
 that really happens 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.729
 occasionally lobbies and isolated 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.020
 Situations are where you are 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.909
 really mean to thailand and then 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.110
 I also agree with him just in it 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.270
 then in the end wrong from the people 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.580
 and I wanted one on that 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.080
 Just point out and yes me 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.150
 Thank you in the place for listening 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.690
 and I say goodbye to the next one 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.690
 times title
