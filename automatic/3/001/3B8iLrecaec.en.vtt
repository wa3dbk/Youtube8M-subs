the bottom see how much ladder we really
want<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.330> use<00:01:49.600> today<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:50.770> we're<00:01:50.860> gonna<00:01:50.920> make

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
want to use today so we're gonna make

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.620 
want to use today so we're gonna make
just<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.399> handsaw<00:01:51.759> cut<00:01:52.000> right<00:01:52.180> here<00:01:52.420> and<00:01:52.540> right

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
just a handsaw cut right here and right

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.570 
just a handsaw cut right here and right
here<00:01:52.689> to<00:01:53.409> free<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:53.890> part<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.250> ladder<00:01:54.399> so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
here to free this part of the ladder so

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.920 
here to free this part of the ladder so
I'm<00:01:54.640> gonna<00:01:54.759> keep<00:01:54.880> working<00:01:55.180> on<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.390> sounds<00:01:55.659> good

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
I'm gonna keep working on it sounds good

Alex keeps it simple with these first
cuts<00:01:57.820> no<00:01:58.210> measuring<00:01:58.689> we're<00:01:59.140> just<00:01:59.320> cutting<00:01:59.530> off

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
cuts no measuring we're just cutting off

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.260 
cuts no measuring we're just cutting off
the<00:01:59.890> section<00:02:00.189> of<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.490> ladder<00:02:00.670> we<00:02:00.850> want<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.119> use

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
the section of the ladder we want to use

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.279 
the section of the ladder we want to use
for<00:02:01.479> our<00:02:01.570> bookshelf

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
for our bookshelf

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.169 
for our bookshelf
all<00:02:02.920> right<00:02:03.039> there<00:02:03.280> we<00:02:03.369> go<00:02:03.490> basically<00:02:03.939> this<00:02:04.119> is

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
all right there we go basically this is

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.300 
all right there we go basically this is
gonna<00:02:04.390> lean<00:02:04.630> on<00:02:04.780> your<00:02:04.899> wall<00:02:05.110> kind<00:02:06.100> of<00:02:06.220> like

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
gonna lean on your wall kind of like

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.639 
gonna lean on your wall kind of like
that<00:02:06.750> you're<00:02:07.750> facing<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.349> we'll<00:02:08.470> just

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
that you're facing it and we'll just

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.160 
that you're facing it and we'll just
throw<00:02:09.000> shelves<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.119> extend<00:02:10.450> these<00:02:10.539> steps<00:02:10.810> to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
throw shelves to extend these steps to

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.020 
throw shelves to extend these steps to
clean<00:02:11.410> up<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.680> top<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.069> our<00:02:12.220> shelf<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:12.700> ensure

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
clean up the top of our shelf and ensure

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.059 
clean up the top of our shelf and ensure
that<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.330> leans<00:02:13.510> flat<00:02:13.959> against<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.350> wall<00:02:14.440> we

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
that it leans flat against the wall we

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.400 
that it leans flat against the wall we
need<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.310> make<00:02:15.459> two<00:02:15.730> even<00:02:16.239> cuts<00:02:16.510> one<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
top and another on the back we'll do the

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.960 
top and another on the back we'll do the
top<00:02:19.750> first<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.410> as<00:02:20.709> usual<00:02:21.130> alex<00:02:21.790> has<00:02:21.940> a

shortcut to getting an even cut we can

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.440 
shortcut to getting an even cut we can
do<00:02:24.100> this<00:02:24.250> with<00:02:24.400> math<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:24.880> we're<00:02:25.000> gonna<00:02:25.090> cheat

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
do this with math but we're gonna cheat

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.600

he's cutting at see no math now we have
a<00:03:06.730> nice<00:03:06.970> scribe<00:03:07.329> line<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.750> we<00:03:07.810> can<00:03:07.930> cut<00:03:08.079> to<00:03:08.109> a

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
a nice scribe line that we can cut to a

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.259 
a nice scribe line that we can cut to a
circular<00:03:08.650> saw<00:03:09.040> jigsaw<00:03:09.609> will<00:03:09.819> knock<00:03:09.970> out<00:03:10.150> these

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269

straight cut here how do you figure out

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.199 
straight cut here how do you figure out
that<00:04:11.780> angle<00:04:12.200> well<00:04:12.520> you<00:04:13.520> just<00:04:13.730> take<00:04:13.880> your<00:04:14.000> same

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209

piece of wood and drop it right there
we're<00:04:16.070> gonna<00:04:16.160> cut<00:04:16.430> straight<00:04:16.549> down<00:04:16.700> that<00:04:17.030> line

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
we're gonna cut straight down that line

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.420 
we're gonna cut straight down that line
and<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:18.019> means<00:04:18.410> that<00:04:18.560> this<00:04:18.830> is<00:04:19.040> gonna<00:04:19.160> rest

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
and that means that this is gonna rest

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.830 
and that means that this is gonna rest
flush<00:04:19.730> on<00:04:19.940> your<00:04:20.060> wall<00:04:20.239> okay

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
so let's make our line sit that right

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.280 
so let's make our line sit that right
there<00:04:24.010> bring<00:04:25.010> it<00:04:25.040> out<00:04:25.220> just<00:04:25.520> past<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.880> step

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
there bring it out just past the step

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.650 
there bring it out just past the step
and<00:04:27.290> Mark<00:04:27.470> your<00:04:27.620> cut<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:29.090> just<00:04:29.150> gives<00:04:29.450> us<00:04:29.570> a

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
and Mark your cut that just gives us a

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.240 
and Mark your cut that just gives us a
little<00:04:29.840> bit<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.140> a<00:04:30.200> flush<00:04:30.440> cut<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.860> come<00:04:31.130> lean

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
little bit of a flush cut to come lean

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.860 
little bit of a flush cut to come lean
against<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.580> wall<00:04:31.730> now<00:04:32.180> we<00:04:32.240> just<00:04:32.450> need<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:32.690> cut

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
against the wall now we just need to cut

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.420 
against the wall now we just need to cut
it<00:04:32.990> straight<00:04:33.200> exactly<00:04:33.919> all<00:04:33.980> right<00:04:34.130> and
