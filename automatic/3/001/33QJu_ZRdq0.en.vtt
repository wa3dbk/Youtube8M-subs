00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.980
 welcome to ducati in bologna at 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.600
 even within the factory then we are 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.200
 near one of the rare pieces the ducati 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.730
 superbike 8,851 a little the beginning of 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.360
 the superbike story of ducati in 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.550
 somehow 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.500
 at the time this bike develops 109 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.040
 horses and a few years after the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.300
 ducati 916 there she develops 114 horses 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.620
 his 20 years before the 8,199 panigale and 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.040
 since he had a fair amount of 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.080
 traveled 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.449
 although of course she is still 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.300
 beautiful this bike is now 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.960
 some twenty years after the mythical 916 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.550
 ducati introduces us to the panigal 899 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.220
 so we're not very far 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.020
 in displacement of this mythical 916 but 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.260
 we are now entitled to 148 horses 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.990
 in free version and so it's the new 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.130
 entry-level ducati superbike for 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.020
 2014 and so it replaces the 848 evo 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.540
 so I'll introduce you a little bit 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.159
 technically this new mini 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.940
 panigale and after I'm going to do some 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.940
 circuit tours with 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.320
 ducati has almost taken over the completeness 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.630
 technology of the failure equaled 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.579
 11.99 but in version 8 99 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.890
 so we find this engine says 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.610
 superquadro with a bore dimension 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.820
 high 100 mm for 880 18 centimeters 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.149
 cubes 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.380
 and then this aluminum shell frame they 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.119
 let the air pass directly to 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.530
 through him up to the air box here 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.030
 even once the bike undresses you 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.860
 realize we hardly see this 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.159
 monocoque frame there are still plenty of 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.530
 cash 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.720
 no, so it's difficult to distinguish it 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.590
 suspensions and are different from the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.480
 11.99 a fork showa big piston like 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.630
 on a lot of hyper Japanese sports 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.200
 a damper h also different since 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.569
 the link at the back also has been 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.799
 changed compared to the 11 99 panigale 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.660
 because there is a swingarm 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.890
 classic and no there is more fashion 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.450
 in the arm so there are small 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.280
 changes of parts that allow 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.500
 ducati to significantly reduce the price 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.500
 of this mini superbike 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.060
 the race was it's the conditions 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.400
 evolve we went from very wet to 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.840
 a little less wet at his fields and 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.550
 So here is the result on the tires 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.330
 rain that degrade significantly as soon as 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.430
 it's dry 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.740
 of course he wears himself a lot like you 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.660
 can see it at imola ago 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.600
 many more constraints on the 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.070
 left part here we finished our 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.750
 sessions on this beautiful circuit 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.780
 of imola steeped in history then this 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.000
 new ducati 899 panigale it's 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.260
 really the new supply of ducati in 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.570
 entry level and at the door already 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.270
 all the audience of 11.99 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.500
 panigale we have traction control which 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.030
 offers me that works very very well 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.280
 in the wet portions is drying 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.630
 it was very well associated with the ducati 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.990
 shifter and there we can spend the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.940
 speeds 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.140
 by mounting the reports without touching 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.010
 the clutch and its islands and well calibrated 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.650
 it's very nice 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.120
 and then the control of the engine brake 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.440
 also he is very nice as the 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.050
 racing abs that brings a lot of 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.820
 short security it's really good for 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.550
 to ride on circuit is very effective 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.410
 especially that engine that accept from 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.760
 take a lot of diet and who accepts 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.440
 to keep the diet between two 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.390
 turns accommodates very well from the usaj 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.290
 on circuit will have to check on the road 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.860
 how it behaves 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.660
 because between the flexibility maybe 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.310
 or maybe a hollow character and well 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.140
 it will still be necessary to check the approval 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.020
 of this engine on the road so in the end 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.669
 this ducati 899 but it's a 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.870
 alternative to the thousand hypersport 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.360
 because it is proposed to 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.250
 at almost the same price and then the student 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.390
 a bit the level of the entry-level 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.790
 superbike at ducati 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.590
 so it's a good surprise 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.419
 go I invite you to read the essay 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.660
 full on motorcycle station.com and then I 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.660
 tell you see you soon
