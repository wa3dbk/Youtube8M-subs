something which Thorin watched his

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.029 
something which Thorin watched his

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
going to be the guy is kind of holding

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.960 
going to be the guy is kind of holding
down<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:30.200> fort<00:02:30.230> here<00:02:30.680> for<00:02:31.040> these<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.549> just<00:02:31.790> had

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
down the fort here for these I just had

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.789 
down the fort here for these I just had
them<00:02:32.060> sharpened<00:02:32.569> Phillies<00:02:33.409> got<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.680> two

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
them sharpened Phillies got the two

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.069 
them sharpened Phillies got the two
swords<00:02:34.159> and<00:02:34.310> he<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.579> he's<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.209> warrior<00:02:35.540> they're

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
swords and he is he's a warrior they're

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.599 
swords and he is he's a warrior they're
the<00:02:36.230> youngest<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.859> fittest<00:02:37.189> and<00:02:37.430> his

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
the youngest and the fittest and his

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.399 
the youngest and the fittest and his
best<00:02:37.879> fighters<00:02:38.359> and<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:38.930> guess<00:02:39.140> they<00:02:39.260> want

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
best fighters and so I guess they want

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.140 
best fighters and so I guess they want
to<00:02:39.439> prove<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.859> to<00:02:40.280> Thorin<00:02:40.549> and<00:02:40.819> what<00:02:41.030> better

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
to prove that to Thorin and what better

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.770 
to prove that to Thorin and what better
time<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.480> do<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.900> there<00:02:42.319> now

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:55.700 

you

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.770
