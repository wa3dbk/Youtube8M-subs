00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.400
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.440
 modding chain point fr today 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.820
 it's hryhoriy that gets into our 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.770
 local they are last ventirad the h5 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.590
 main features of this h5 and 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.050
 its total compatibility with 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.420
 memory cards we will start well 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.510
 sure by the box so of a box all 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 cardboard with on the main phase 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.450
 the projection 3d the collection the drawing 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.890
 3d ventirad itself the scream logo 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.079
 as well as the name the name of the radiator 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.699
 the name of the mark is on the side the 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.489
 name during the model name the h5 on 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.519
 the other side we find the assets of 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.499
 this cooler with a specific design 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.179
 fins compatibility without 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.819
 limits of the memory modules and one 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.129
 installation in five minutes chrono 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:03.379
 on the back we find the dimensions of the 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.350
 ventirad and fan as well as 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.570
 specifications of each of them 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.829
 and finally the compatibility with all 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.240
 the socks of the intel and amd market 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.950
 this is the end of the tour 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.259
 this box we now go on the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.090
 bundle that they too have started again in 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.490
 top right with this little pouch 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.350
 which actually contains the map 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.880
 registration to register on the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.840
 site 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.729
 what is important in fact is that 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.189
 it allows us to increase the guarantee 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.520
 of 3 years and what is not bad 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:41.240
 here we have the words of the records 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.659
 English Japanese Polish Installer 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.460
 or German 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.310
 but no matter the language the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.170
 diagrams are pretty explicit for 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.539
 able to mount the ventirad them without 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.520
 difficulty there are no more worries at this 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.100
 amount five minutes a priori we'll see 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.540
 that of course in the test 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.290
 a syringe of thermal paste and 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.189
 provides metal fasteners 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.020
 additional to install a 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.159
 second fan with small 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.530
 anti vibration pads the tool the tool 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.530
 the cruciform screwdriver 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.070
 we then go to the fixing system 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.390
 So here the fastening system for 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:27.810
 socket amd with its paw beit the system 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.830
 Fixing intel socket in the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.460
 box three under 1,575 in 50 x and 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.110
 13 66 here we have fixing screw for 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.500
 2011 socket and fixing screws 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.050
 two bins blight intel and amd 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.910
 we now go to the cooler on 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.730
 h5 also rent with his fan the xt 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.770
 140 so a 140 mm fan with 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.720
 the characteristic is to be in version 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.160
 slim ice and 13 mm thick 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.570
 we go the anti vibration pads or so 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.820
 his escape rather fixed the fasteners 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.380
 metallic and which allowed to put 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.320
 in place the fan on the computer 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.959
 well worth the two fastening systems 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.320
 at this level the h5 has four 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.730
 heat pipes and has a diameter of 6 mm it 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.860
 just dipped into the fins of 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.570
 radiator with occupant distribution 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.890
 the entire width of this radiator 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.040
 make the most of the created airflow 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.140
 by the x 640 the calm of the latter is 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.880
 income from a stressed sheath and we finish 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.569
 by taking 4 pina translating the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.150
 pwm management of this fan 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.090
 the base the base is cooked swear with a 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.790
 nickel coating we see the tryba gers 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.139
 mirror finish 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.879
 the fastening system were part 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.280
 integral of this base with both 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.200
 vices mounted on springs it can not be 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.950
 see the two holes on both sides 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.250
 radiator 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.469
 hence the utility of the tool provided with 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.840
 in the bundle 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:59.269
 this big screwdriver that will actually allow 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.780
 to sneak between the fins you 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:05.180
 power screw and the radiator on the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.969
 socata the radiator actually makes a 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.780
 height of 160 mm by 143 of width and 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:14.359
 98 thick we can see the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.910
 heat pipes dive into the 38 the 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.479
 letters were composed on the 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.979
 actors when eight aluminum fins 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:26.780
 a plastic top cover and that 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:30.289
 can withdraw from the system radiator 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.860
 clips fills mauricie so the last 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:36.129
 head and tender 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.590
 lower part ends up with this 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.300
 same plastic hood system of course 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.780
 you have to remove the until wrongly 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.379
 remove the bottom part as 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.879
 these friendly initiative of the 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.979
 part of horrible screams that allows us 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:54.849
 my faith if you want to personalize 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:57.370
 the top covers by selling our 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.229
 seating feature 5 is actually 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.960
 the difference in the fins 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:05.500
 stack side to the side we have a system 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.810
 optimization of the airflow that allows 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.069
 to generate an alteration of suicide 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.949
 while reducing turbulence but 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:17.259
 we'll see that all over again 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:20.820
 detail on the boeing website is point 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:24.600
 en having of course test this 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.980
 Last cooler Creole and therefore h5 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.010
 but sure I invite you to go 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.010
 visit 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.930
 this is the end of this 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.850
 presentation 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.230
 Thank you for following us and 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.060
 I would like a next time on the 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.780
 channel tv2 model dot fr has chebib 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.780
 thank you
