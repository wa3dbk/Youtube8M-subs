00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.660
 Oh God 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.960
 Where do I start? 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.440
 From 1 to 10 per level of stress, I have about 6 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.940
 My stress level today is certainly between a 7 and an 8 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.800
 Can I please please? 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.880
 My good phone was just a stressful situation 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.760
 I dropped it, and lost all the contacts 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.420
 Because I just came from the court and wanted to rest, trying to get away from all that stress 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.060
 I want to study 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.920
 My current vacation is a bit of stress 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860
 I am an independent contractor and I work for myself 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.300
 one thing that brings me stress is the deadlines 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.522
 it always seems to be racing in every second 

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:44.822
 I drove to Arizona and again I came back yesterday 

00:00:44.822 --> 00:00:48.800
 The top three things that make me stress me are not having enough time .. * the baby sounds good * 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.440
 All I want to do is relax 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.680
 but do not know how 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.620
 * breathes * 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.860
 Welcome to this guidance meditation 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.320
 Are you ready ? Let's begin. 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 Find a suitable position. 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.840
 Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.780
 * suck the air * 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.120
 Until you get out of breath, let your body begin to relax 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.440
 Feel the beater of a happy cat 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.580
 stertorous 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.860
 stertorous 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.580
 stertorous 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.060
 Now Open Your Eyes 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.860
 Mew! 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.020
 * Jazzy music starts * 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.000
 * Music stops * * Dogs cry out * 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.840
 * Joyful music starts again * 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.880
 You can not be stressed if you sit in a box full of cats 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.420
 as you are surrounded by new creatures as soon as you remember that you need to get it easy 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.500
 was good, unexpected and worshipful 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.388
 Can I do it again? 

00:02:48.388 --> 00:02:49.448
 Do you want to do it again? 

00:02:49.448 --> 00:02:49.940
 Poo 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.660
 Now? 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.160
 Yes!
