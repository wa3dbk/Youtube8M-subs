new running shoes because I am training

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.720

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
for a half marathon and I thought I

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.759 
for a half marathon and I thought I
would<00:00:27.880> use<00:00:28.150> my<00:00:28.390> old<00:00:28.569> shoes<00:00:28.929> that<00:00:29.199> I<00:00:29.230> used<00:00:29.649> last

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
would use my old shoes that I used last

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.800 
would use my old shoes that I used last
year<00:00:30.130> for<00:00:30.609> that<00:00:30.730> half<00:00:30.880> marathon<00:00:31.029> I<00:00:31.329> did<00:00:31.569> and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
year for that half marathon I did and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.380 
year for that half marathon I did and
I've<00:00:32.710> developed<00:00:32.980> a<00:00:33.190> few<00:00:33.370> aches<00:00:33.579> and<00:00:33.790> pains<00:00:34.030> and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
I've developed a few aches and pains and

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.299 
I've developed a few aches and pains and
I<00:00:34.540> identified<00:00:35.440> that<00:00:35.470> these<00:00:35.680> are<00:00:35.859> mostly<00:00:36.100> due

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
I identified that these are mostly due

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.610 
I identified that these are mostly due
to<00:00:36.340> my<00:00:36.550> shoes<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:37.510> way<00:00:37.660> running<00:00:37.960> shoes<00:00:38.199> are<00:00:38.379> is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
to my shoes the way running shoes are is

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.049 
to my shoes the way running shoes are is
that<00:00:38.649> they<00:00:39.010> can<00:00:39.190> only<00:00:39.340> take<00:00:39.640> a<00:00:39.670> certain<00:00:39.969> amount

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
that they can only take a certain amount

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.200 
that they can only take a certain amount
of<00:00:40.300> mileage<00:00:40.480> so<00:00:41.410> after<00:00:42.340> that<00:00:42.550> mileage<00:00:42.940> has

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
of mileage so after that mileage has

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.240 
of mileage so after that mileage has
occurred<00:00:43.660> on<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:43.960> shoe<00:00:44.140> it's<00:00:44.620> really<00:00:45.070> just

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
occurred on the shoe it's really just

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.009 
occurred on the shoe it's really just
becomes<00:00:45.609> useless<00:00:45.850> at<00:00:46.149> that<00:00:46.300> point<00:00:46.539> so<00:00:46.780> if<00:00:46.929> you

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
becomes useless at that point so if you

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.470 
becomes useless at that point so if you
ever<00:00:47.170> have<00:00:47.320> any<00:00:47.440> feet<00:00:48.100> problems<00:00:48.480> definitely

a week you're gonna mean I believe a

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.430 
a week you're gonna mean I believe a
little<00:01:28.090> bit<00:01:28.330> more<00:01:28.480> support<00:01:28.870> than<00:01:28.990> that<00:01:29.170> so

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
little bit more support than that so

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.080 
little bit more support than that so
what<00:01:29.830> I<00:01:29.860> liked<00:01:30.160> about<00:01:30.250> these<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.790> this<00:01:30.970> is

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
what I liked about these is this is

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.440 
what I liked about these is this is
pretty<00:01:31.390> much<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.810> step<00:01:32.410> up<00:01:32.680> as<00:01:32.920> far<00:01:33.190> as<00:01:33.460> having<00:01:34.360> a

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
pretty much a step up as far as having a

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.140 
pretty much a step up as far as having a
little<00:01:34.750> bit<00:01:34.870> more<00:01:35.020> cushion<00:01:35.440> so<00:01:36.070> what<00:01:36.970> they<00:01:37.090> did

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
little bit more cushion so what they did

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.000 
little bit more cushion so what they did
is<00:01:37.300> they<00:01:37.540> just<00:01:37.690> put<00:01:38.020> in<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.260> little<00:01:38.470> bit<00:01:38.650> more<00:01:38.830> so

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
is they just put in a little bit more so

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.440 
is they just put in a little bit more so
