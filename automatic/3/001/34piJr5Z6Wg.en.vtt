00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
tripping on drugs but the important

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.309 
tripping on drugs but the important
thing<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.400> remember<00:02:19.520> is<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.390> many<00:02:20.990> had<00:02:21.200> an

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
thing to remember is that many had an

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.530 
thing to remember is that many had an
axe<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.860> she<00:02:22.310> looked<00:02:22.520> kind<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.880> like<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.060> dragon

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
axe and she looked kind of like a dragon

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.280 
axe and she looked kind of like a dragon
so<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.110> decided<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.860> attack<00:02:25.160> her<00:02:26.170> needless<00:02:27.170> to

so I decided to attack her needless to

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.990 
so I decided to attack her needless to
say<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.470> woke<00:02:27.950> up<00:02:28.069> in<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.310> Pinocchio<00:02:28.730> ride
