00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.589
 here in german 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.650
 varroa mite and against the seems no 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.840
 herb grown too aggressive 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.520
 Chemical ports on duration not because 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.099
 the mite resistant we will need 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.199
 So a sustainable idea like that 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.669
 To offer survival comes this idea 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.669
 from a hamburg 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:33.070
 bring you 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.899
 the books scorpion the land unfortunately 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.989
 from the sixth grade count dead 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:41.790
 varroa mites asia introduced 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.790
 be mite for the bees died 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.080
 button to the victim fell the mites 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:51.130
 transmit dangerous viruses her a 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.130
 little big problem 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.540
 beekeepers fight with the mites 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.920
 chemicals such as formic acid 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.379
 but now there is a new procedure 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.180
 a predator of the mites to the books 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.860
 Scorpio 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.740
 most do not know what 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.310
 Anyway, this book is scorpio and 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.259
 he is just said the bees 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.369
 and is the mild then up to 5 mm in size 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.369
 the books will be scorpio 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.690
 their names 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.180
 It sucks up to nine mild creates 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.680
 he is at a hamburg district during the day 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.660
 school becomes the book scorpion 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 he probably explores the bees 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.690
 will save 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.790
 biology and english teacher torben 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.590
 ships have rediscovered him he was looking for 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.340
 after a predator of the mites because he 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.020
 as beekeepers do not like to use chemicals 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.850
 the most vital are the most 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.939
 Resistant ones are those that survive 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.399
 the procedure 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.920
 and so will the mite last thaler and 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.259
 more resistant than student was shepherd 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.909
 old books representing the symbiosis of books 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.670
 scorpions and bees 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.649
 until the 70s, they still existed 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.420
 but the chemicals in the beekeeping 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.900
 have the books scorpion in 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.030
 Beehives eradicated 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.340
 The pupils are now studying breeding 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.840
 and students of the eleventh grade which 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.840
 conditions are suitable 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.290
 the boiler of st 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.630
 Heat the water all around 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.880
 different the best temperature for 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.880
 the books scorpions is where the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.500
 Temperatures we have an optimal 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.730
 to explore the temperature of the tried 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.950
 to find out where the books are 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.989
 scorpions feel most comfortable and where they are 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.000
 to grow the most we have 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.599
 found out that they are the most 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.040
 stopped at 15 to 25 degrees and 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.739
 we want to go further now 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.220
 Researching students jump as explorers 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.709
 on 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.030
 because well-known bee institutes like that 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.530
 in celle keep scorpion from the books 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.630
 BÃ¶cking examines the varroa mites 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.630
 for 20 years and gives the bees 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.140
 Becking does not mean the books Scorpio 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.600
 to the mites 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.450
 because most sit in the where 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.830
 the bee larvae grow up the books 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.830
 skog and but got caught 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.220
 this is all she is covering 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.810
 louder boys are there 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:33.380
 then sit the ears beside reasons 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.090
 on books scorpion leads shepherd power 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.860
 it's nothing that books scorpions 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.340
 not advertised in the canopies hlten 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.260
 come 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.860
 He wants the total number of mites 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.860
 reduced 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.870
 Michalsky 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.380
 and keeps saying that 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.640
 exponential proliferation of varroa 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.640
 mite up to 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.609
 also in the circle pia from the bee institute in 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.609
 church home with 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.240
 bees mild resistant to breed 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.630
 protect yourself by scorpions 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.790
 can there be an addition 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.120
 where you actually that, of course 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.120
 listen and 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:27.700
 and basically watch past 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.830
 decades through that the effect 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.820
 and at the same time 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.190
 pop 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.020
 are there so teaches us 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.349
 previous experience 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.300
 b can lead to a permanent solution 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.960
 victor from the eleventh grade evaporated 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.960
 oct should 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.680
 the medium becomes the books scorpions 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.330
 to survive 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.240
 at the breeding can 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.530
 then maybe you help books there 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.530
 scorpion first 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.180
 to breed 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.930
 flow 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.509
 vitalie the number of registrations in the cities 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.020
 Hold back for the books and 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.300
 are harmful 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.220
 which also mites against varroa 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.789
 used formic acid kills the 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.789
 scorpions 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.040
 it can be used additionally 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.630
 until there are enough scorpions in the books 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.260
 The hive gives the mites 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.260
 remove 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.340
 wants to be blocked 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.340
 since I caught 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.830
 hydrochloric acid is not yet clear 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.849
 need the beekeeper 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.650
 usual apples 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:47.860
 can he 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.860
 can work optimally 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.910
 the ground falls 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.240
 like to deliver 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.240
 again 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:09.480
 in a beehive developed the 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:14.420
 idealist for the books scorpions 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.420
 the extra designed for it 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.710
 that you are all nests in these 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.570
 columns 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.180
 we have small holes everywhere 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.889
 There, the microscopes build without theirs 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.660
 nests this part of the find if i have 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.720
 still down here in the stock but also at 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.669
 the pages will be high up to 150 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.190
 books scorpions keep the stick clean 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.530
 The students look after them 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.210
 in only one mite per week though 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.680
 you must continue the mite hunter 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.750
 explore alone 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.270
 At least this question books scorpions 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.130
 so interesting that they are scientific 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.620
 should be pursued so we could 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.870
 here maybe in the experimental mode so 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.580
 to create the right starting situation 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.250
 that you seriously scorpion with books 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.380
 Torben Schaefer would have experimented then 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.360
 already achieved a goal but the 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.759
 bee-friend also founded 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.289
 an association with worldwide experiences 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.030
 to collect scorpion books 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:10.199
 maybe for the rescue of the bees 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.849
 also contributing these are such tinkerers 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.710
 at schools and unis the for 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.750
 decisive breakthroughs provide the in 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.919
 the large enterprise or group laboratories 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.840
 not to be found 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.729
 who at nano already have many of them 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.120
 may also be heard 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:26.960
 Professor Hartmut hopefully researched this 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.960
 high tech car
