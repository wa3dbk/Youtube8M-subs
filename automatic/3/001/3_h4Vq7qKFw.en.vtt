00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.480
 Sunday 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.209
 the burnt 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.490
 lausanne and famine 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.490
 the part of the monastier-sur-gazeille located in high-loire 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.689
 the course leila the high-loire la lozÃ¨re and the gard facing jean-pierre 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.839
 pernaut but the tignes station was created per hour the people of the 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.390
 territory and who not want the sovereign risk is to make live theirs 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.810
 territory and who recently declared m 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.930
 renault promotes the path he works with all these providers 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.960
 hosting it's people who determines us more than csn did with a 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.120
 friend the bonus is unique but still works with these are people who 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.290
 come for years all this in one way to bring students from 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.590
 hikers on the way 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.560
 the farmers the territory 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.280
 for the sake of accommodation 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.160
 they are valued each time it was structures because in decline 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.040
 and who go with the summer scene so purely revive see creations of 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.940
 structures 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.080
 it's not necessarily the things of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.040
 it is not necessarily labeled 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.340
 I served well 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.030
 but other exams because it makes the territories live quite happy 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.720
 declared the rural environment especially like that one says a little more the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.160
 responsible for health 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.890
 live the local economy 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.910
 it's lengthening the season 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.860
 there was as soft mobility that the hike bastia mode of 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.670
 gentle movement 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.670
 like to go a little side then the fifth 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.450
 the train was not going out someone should be used to carry 1% 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.729
 finally I managed to extract marked out 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.110
 so we can do trial is 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.750
 and it makes it possible to come to Iran because it hinders 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.109
 here we are really trying to promote as well 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.640
 luggage transport versailles 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.390
 a deficit if the person 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.390
 so not necessarily link with their car before 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.390
 this approach because 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.280
 this job had already been stationed in Scotland 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.690
 in details 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.950
 and then in the north of France 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.850
 at all places where six people could go to iraq 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.759
 to try to create a network did this time in his country m 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.129
 and be able to exchange from a cultural point of view 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:13.970
 outside 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.079
 so because we just do not have a way that works well 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.420
 but there are 20 years ago patients to make a hiking trail to pack it 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.179
 help them recent experiences and know-how even the two men 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.019
 what people can discover too 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.309
 the small local heritage through a personal text of siemens with the 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:34.049
 Saharawi passed and to act like the hike he is also based in Damascus 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.059
 arrai 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.029
 she did not run away 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.029
 today I'm doing my part 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.259
 ap 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.579
