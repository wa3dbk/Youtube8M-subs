let's begin with over here on your page
begin<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> pointy<00:00:49.260> shape<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.620> goes<00:00:50.809> kind

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
begin with a pointy shape that goes kind

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.750 
begin with a pointy shape that goes kind
of<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.140> that's<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> point<00:00:53.340> chef<00:00:53.579> that's

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
of like that that's a point chef that's

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.299 
of like that that's a point chef that's
the<00:00:53.820> front<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.270> dude's<00:00:54.539> head<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.129> now

the front of this dude's head and so now

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
the front of this dude's head and so now
we're<00:00:56.579> gonna<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.789> another<00:00:56.940> pointy<00:00:57.360> shape<00:00:57.510> for

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
we're gonna do another pointy shape for

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.959 
we're gonna do another pointy shape for
his<00:00:57.930> mouth<00:00:58.079> up<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.859> rawr<00:00:59.219> chunky

going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.879> pointy<00:01:03.210> shapes<00:01:03.449> inside<00:01:04.019> for

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
going to have pointy shapes inside for

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.880 
going to have pointy shapes inside for
his<00:01:04.589> teeth<00:01:05.090> 20.2<00:01:06.090> pointing<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:07.320> even<00:01:07.619> his<00:01:07.680> eye
