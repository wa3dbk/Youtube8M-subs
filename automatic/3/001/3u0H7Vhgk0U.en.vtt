okay<00:00:06.580> here<00:00:07.580> we<00:00:07.670> got<00:00:07.850> a<00:00:08.090> flat<00:00:08.630> 13<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:09.469> next

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
okay here we got a flat 13 the next

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.879 
okay here we got a flat 13 the next
chord<00:00:09.980> in<00:00:10.160> our<00:00:10.309> 2<00:00:10.550> 5<00:00:10.790> 1<00:00:11.059> and<00:00:11.270> D<00:00:11.420> flat<00:00:11.709> bridge<00:00:12.709> of

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
chord in our 2 5 1 and D flat bridge of

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.390 
chord in our 2 5 1 and D flat bridge of
blue<00:00:13.070> bossa<00:00:13.480> if<00:00:14.480> you<00:00:14.600> notice<00:00:14.930> this<00:00:15.410> a<00:00:15.650> flat<00:00:15.920> 7

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
blue bossa if you notice this a flat 7

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.910 
blue bossa if you notice this a flat 7
sound<00:00:16.700> has<00:00:17.270> a<00:00:17.330> 13th<00:00:17.990> on<00:00:18.170> it<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:18.470> I<00:00:18.530> wanted<00:00:18.860> to

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
sound has a 13th on it and I wanted to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.080 
sound has a 13th on it and I wanted to
explore<00:00:19.400> this<00:00:20.090> 13th<00:00:21.520> because<00:00:22.520> it<00:00:22.790> gives<00:00:23.000> us

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
explore this 13th because it gives us

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.720 
explore this 13th because it gives us
chance<00:00:23.150> to<00:00:23.540> explore<00:00:23.930> a<00:00:24.200> dominant<00:00:24.920> chord<00:00:25.100> that

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
chance to explore a dominant chord that

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.440 
chance to explore a dominant chord that
does<00:00:26.000> not<00:00:26.180> have<00:00:26.740> altered<00:00:28.000> notes<00:00:29.000> like<00:00:29.270> The

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
does not have altered notes like The

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.310 
does not have altered notes like The
Sharper<00:00:29.900> flat<00:00:30.320> 9<00:00:30.560> sharp<00:00:31.310> or<00:00:31.460> flat<00:00:31.490> 5<00:00:31.970> flat<00:00:32.320> 3rd

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
Sharper flat 9 sharp or flat 5 flat 3rd

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.799 
Sharper flat 9 sharp or flat 5 flat 3rd
flat<00:00:34.070> 13<00:00:34.460> or<00:00:34.670> sharp<00:00:34.879> 11<00:00:35.239> any<00:00:35.360> of<00:00:35.420> those<00:00:35.510> weird

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
flat 13 or sharp 11 any of those weird

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.160 
flat 13 or sharp 11 any of those weird
notes<00:00:36.110> this<00:00:36.620> doesn't<00:00:37.430> have<00:00:37.610> any<00:00:37.790> of<00:00:37.880> those<00:00:38.170> and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
notes this doesn't have any of those and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.260 
notes this doesn't have any of those and
so<00:00:39.320> it<00:00:39.380> gives<00:00:39.500> us<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:39.920> more<00:00:40.550> simple

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
so it gives us a more simple

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.830 
so it gives us a more simple

ninth get that signature gesture let's

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.880 
ninth get that signature gesture let's
put<00:00:56.380> a<00:00:56.410> little<00:00:56.590> slide<00:00:56.890> into<00:00:57.250> it<00:01:01.890> little

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
put a little slide into it little

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.410 
put a little slide into it little
chromatic<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.400> go<00:01:03.520> down<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.910> root<00:01:04.120> of<00:01:04.300> the

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
chromatic to go down to the root of the

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:27.410 
chromatic to go down to the root of the
arpeggio<00:01:05.730> let's<00:01:06.730> fill<00:01:06.970> that<00:01:07.090> arpeggio<00:01:07.600> in

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.940 

the<00:01:28.420> first<00:01:28.630> time<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:28.840> filled<00:01:29.050> it<00:01:29.170> in<00:01:29.290> I<00:01:29.409> used<00:01:29.710> a

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
the first time I filled it in I used a

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.750 
the first time I filled it in I used a
d-flat

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
d-flat

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.850 
d-flat
sounded<00:01:31.360> good<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.630> me<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:32.380> second<00:01:32.710> time<00:01:32.830> I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
sounded good to me the second time I

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.890 
sounded good to me the second time I
filled<00:01:33.130> it<00:01:33.280> in<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.520> used<00:01:33.729> a<00:01:33.820> D<00:01:33.970> natural<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
filled it in I used a D natural the

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.120 
filled it in I used a D natural the
sound<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.229> little<00:01:35.380> good<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:35.770> me

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
sound a little good to me

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.090 
sound a little good to me
both<00:01:36.490> our<00:01:37.150> options<00:01:37.600> one<00:01:37.810> is<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:37.990> D<00:01:38.710> flat<00:01:38.950> of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
both our options one is a D flat of

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.770 
both our options one is a D flat of
national<00:01:39.520> 11th<00:01:39.910> one<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.890> sharp<00:01:41.890> 11<00:01:42.780> they're

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
national 11th one is a sharp 11 they're

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.160 
national 11th one is a sharp 11 they're
both<00:01:43.960> both<00:01:44.350> choices<00:01:44.590> for<00:01:44.979> us

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
both both choices for us

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.960 
both both choices for us
typically<00:01:47.170> when<00:01:47.950> you're<00:01:48.070> resolving<00:01:48.790> a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
typically when you're resolving a

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.469 
typically when you're resolving a
dominant<00:01:49.390> chord<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.750> major<00:01:50.080> chord<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:52.119> tend

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
dominant chord to a major chord we tend

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.450 
dominant chord to a major chord we tend
to<00:01:52.710> hear<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:55.060> use<00:01:55.420> an<00:01:56.350> alternate<00:01:56.950> dominant

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
to hear and use an alternate dominant

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.300 
to hear and use an alternate dominant
chord<00:02:01.470> that<00:02:02.470> doesn't<00:02:02.710> mean<00:02:02.800> you<00:02:02.920> can't<00:02:03.100> alter

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
chord that doesn't mean you can't alter

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.730 
chord that doesn't mean you can't alter
it<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.729> sounds<00:02:04.090> great<00:02:04.300> if<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.570> alter<00:02:04.869> it<00:02:04.960> but

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
it it sounds great if you alter it but

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.810 
it it sounds great if you alter it but
we're<00:02:05.890> trying<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.130> get<00:02:06.250> familiar<00:02:06.520> with<00:02:06.610> the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
we're trying to get familiar with the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.219 
we're trying to get familiar with the
more<00:02:06.970> typical<00:02:07.180> sounds<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:07.840> later<00:02:08.019> we<00:02:08.200> can

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
more typical sounds and later we can

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.770 
more typical sounds and later we can
start<00:02:08.530> experimenting<00:02:08.920> even<00:02:09.850> more<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.420> more

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
start experimenting even more and more

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.180 
start experimenting even more and more
so<00:02:13.780> let's<00:02:14.230> take<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.590> arpeggio

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
so let's take this arpeggio

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.930 
so let's take this arpeggio
and<00:02:15.430> let's<00:02:16.590> change<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.800> up<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.950> little<00:02:18.070> bit<00:02:18.280> one

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
and let's change it up a little bit one

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.540 
and let's change it up a little bit one
three<00:02:19.450> five<00:02:19.810> seven<00:02:19.870> nine

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.750 

that's<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.640> nice<00:02:24.819> like<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:26.520> there's<00:02:27.520> one

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
that's a nice like that there's one

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.360 
that's a nice like that there's one
three<00:02:28.120> five<00:02:28.510> seven

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.800 

it's<00:02:31.910> kind<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.120> cool<00:02:34.180> we've<00:02:35.180> put<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.330> slide<00:02:35.629> in

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
it's kind of cool we've put a slide in

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.830 
it's kind of cool we've put a slide in
there

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.020 

look<00:02:39.200> traumatic

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.610 

one<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.900> things<00:02:46.050> you'll<00:02:46.200> notice<00:02:46.320> is

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
one of the things you'll notice is

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.360 
one of the things you'll notice is
playing<00:02:47.100> these<00:02:47.220> arpeggios<00:02:47.810> eventually

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
playing these arpeggios eventually

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.720 
playing these arpeggios eventually
becomes<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.460> kind<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.940> dude

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
becomes a kind of dude

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.370 
becomes a kind of dude
jamming<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.940> chord<00:02:54.270> choosing<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.170> notes

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
jamming on the chord choosing the notes

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.270 
jamming on the chord choosing the notes
that<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:57.620> eventually<00:02:58.620> you'll<00:02:59.160> start

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
that you like eventually you'll start

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.580 
that you like eventually you'll start
falling<00:02:59.760> into<00:03:00.060> patterns<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.690> dig<00:03:00.930> it

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
falling into patterns that you dig it
