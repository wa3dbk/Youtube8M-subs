00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:00.399 
anyway so they don't cook anymore
if<00:05:55.219> you<00:05:55.430> leave<00:05:57.370> things<00:05:58.370> in<00:05:58.669> a<00:05:58.789> very<00:05:59.270> hot<00:05:59.689> pan<00:06:00.020> or

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
if you leave things in a very hot pan or

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.230 
if you leave things in a very hot pan or
pot<00:06:01.150> they<00:06:02.150> will<00:06:02.419> continue<00:06:02.810> to<00:06:02.960> cook<00:06:03.139> and<00:06:04.240> I

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
pot they will continue to cook and I

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.909 
pot they will continue to cook and I
guess<00:06:05.419> I<00:06:05.569> could<00:06:05.870> blanch<00:06:06.169> them<00:06:06.439> if<00:06:06.650> I<00:06:06.770> were

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
guess I could blanch them if I were

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.320 
guess I could blanch them if I were
really<00:06:07.099> really<00:06:07.400> serious<00:06:07.909> about<00:06:08.060> it<00:06:08.210> and

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:38.029 
the fridge but I'm gonna let them come

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:39.550 
the fridge but I'm gonna let them come
down<00:06:38.210> to<00:06:38.330> room<00:06:38.509> temperature<00:06:38.840> before<00:06:39.020> I<00:06:39.349> put

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
down to room temperature before I put

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.300

them<00:06:39.680> in<00:06:39.830> the<00:06:39.889> fridge<00:06:40.099> and<00:06:40.340> I<00:06:40.430> just<00:06:40.729> read<00:06:41.539> that

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
them in the fridge and I just read that

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.129 
them in the fridge and I just read that
harbors<00:06:43.310> bacteria<00:06:44.120> when<00:06:44.360> you<00:06:44.449> put<00:06:44.690> hot<00:06:44.870> food

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
harbors bacteria when you put hot food

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.140 
harbors bacteria when you put hot food
in<00:06:45.349> the<00:06:45.440> fridge<00:06:45.620> it<00:06:46.219> also<00:06:46.400> brings<00:06:46.729> down<00:06:47.090> the

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
in the fridge it also brings down the

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.629 
in the fridge it also brings down the
temperature<00:06:47.659> of<00:06:48.169> the<00:06:48.229> refrigerator<00:06:48.710> and<00:06:49.190> so

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
temperature of the refrigerator and so

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.369 
temperature of the refrigerator and so
it<00:06:49.789> puts<00:06:49.969> your<00:06:50.060> other<00:06:50.300> refrigerated<00:06:51.020> foods<00:06:51.199> at

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:51.379 
it puts your other refrigerated foods at

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.740 
it puts your other refrigerated foods at
risk<00:06:51.560> so<00:06:51.919> I<00:06:51.949> just<00:06:52.279> always<00:06:52.460> leave<00:06:52.729> my<00:06:52.940> foods<00:06:53.659> out

risk so I just always leave my foods out

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.119 
risk so I just always leave my foods out

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:55.129 
until they're like mostly to room

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:59.070 
until they're like mostly to room
temperature<00:06:55.900> then<00:06:56.900> I'm<00:06:57.560> just<00:06:57.800> gonna<00:06:57.979> put<00:06:58.310> on

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080
