00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
 do not 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.550
 and we arrived at the end of the week as 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:14.440
 always on Fridays is one to speak 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:16.660
 of some accessories today we do not have 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.609
 crazy images and videos or anything but 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.529
 let's be very practical first 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.320
 let's present a scanner remember 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:27.150
 of a staircase one thing if they give two 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.160
 photocopiers printers that have 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.929
 up well this is a scanner now 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.810
 This is the latest generation comes with 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.330
 portable soccer rechargeable batteries 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.640
 touch does not weigh absolutely anything with 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.160
 this gadget that already comes with a 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.200
 built-in screen here and that you can 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.650
 incorporate a 32 gigabyte memory 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.020
 you can do 400 scans with just one 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.730
 charge nothing else it's a scanner for 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.500
 those who do not know if I have a 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.180
 leaf with something that interests me 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.420
 example here I have a programming of 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.269
 channel 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.620
 I pass the scanner and it raises me like this 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.899
 an image so that the same sheet will 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.360
 lift the advantage that this has 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.700
 which is the latest generation is that you would 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.580
 can you lift in a jpg or be a 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.440
 normal image or in a pdf then 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.990
 you can have it if you want to say it's something 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.240
 private encrypted this they are using 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.850
 a lot of lawyers so that for 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.920
 records clear the records these 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.899
 leaves so as not to walk with everything 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.240
 directly you keep it on your card 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.880
 of memory is fully compatible with 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.759
 pc with macri and others and the truth that is 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.000
 very useful but not according to student has 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.250
 to take a note and can not 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.560
 buy has ten leaves seized raisins 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.509
 ten times are two seconds for each 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.709
 sheet to lift it in high definition 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:52.000
 because it goes from 300 to 600 to 900 the truth 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:56.229
 that this gadget can not be asked 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.229
 the classic testing of Fridays 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.670
 is a backpack the portfolio these 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:11.780
 apparently they are from 800 to 900 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:14.379
 weights are a miniature and the truth is 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.180
 I recommend 100% if they have things that 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.010
 documents photos you can get up if 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.510
 you want a page of magazines that 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.000
 a great possibility of USB charging occurs 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.280
 with the minimum classic sb of all here 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.799
 they have the card entry 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.380
 memory card of the mini up to 32 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.970
 gb so for 32 gigs of this 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.489
 document is to have to save the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.980
 accounts mentally we have a few 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.110
 so 400 scans with a single load 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.519
 battery the battery charges very fast and 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.430
 this seems like a wireless 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.989
 blood clearer this seems not but 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.709
 well this is what is called a dock 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.480
 which are the two are speakers where 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.190
 We can put mobile devices in 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.680
 this case we have a phone this is 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.480
 specially designed for android 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.480
 what it does with bluetooth 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.750
 we can play music all 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.180
 steps but that you see it 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.280
 it seems exactly there it is starting 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.620
 raised the volume has a very design 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.510
 nice in you equally to be able 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.150
 appreciate it more if you listen to it live 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.069
 that accepted half as green one for the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.889
 another has movements there is a 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.900
 tablet or with basil makes movements or 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.879
 well but apart from everything because this already 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.639
 exists in the market we are going to lower a 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.430
 little the volume that makes loading the 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.919
 cellular then you do not have download the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.439
 you were going before downloading 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:38.870
 when you put to play it 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.060
 by bluetooth instead now what 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.189
 what it does is load it and use it 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.200
 quiet when you finish playing 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:49.040
 the music in this device you take out and you 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.980
 it is loaded this can also be 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.180
 blame they carry four common batteries like 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.060
 an avoid that there are now 200 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.340
 denominations now is to the common 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.709
 he was not carrying four stacks of those are 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.479
 eight hours of continuous work 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.950
 perfectly with any device 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.920
 have bluetooth 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.040
 of being a pc that has bluetooth what 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.500
 you connect works well plays audio 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.269
 there are applications also aimed at 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.980
 this gadget to synchronize the 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.590
 music of the whole house or not 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.520
 it's just a smartphone 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.419
 not only have they put it as 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.280
 understand it for giving but connects 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.940
 anything in bluetooth and the truth 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:34.660
 It is very cute in design are places more 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.660
 it's a little bit heavier 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.139
 300 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.090
 we have music 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.780
 You can love yourself as always very things 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.550
 interesting today the price was 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.270
 well we closed in the week then we 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.270
 let's go to next Friday
