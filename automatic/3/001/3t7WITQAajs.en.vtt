trying<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.140> make<00:00:22.350> sure<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.710> was<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.100> same

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310

spot<00:00:23.519> at<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> same<00:00:24.150> time<00:00:25.039> is<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.250> last<00:00:26.279> time<00:00:26.760> I

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
spot at the same time is the last time I

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.029 
spot at the same time is the last time I
recorded<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.320> never<00:00:28.500> measuring

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
out to being the same thing I would

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.290 
out to being the same thing I would
check<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.980> one<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:32.910> life<00:00:33.090> throws

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.639 
certain amount of time and one day it'll
be<00:00:35.489> at<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.390> day<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.600> will<00:00:36.660> be<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:36.930> 6<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
be at a for one day it will be at 6 and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.190 
be at a for one day it will be at 6 and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
then it'll be up at 5 and it was just

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.069 
then it'll be up at 5 and it was just
all<00:00:40.320> over<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> place<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.690> did<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.899> this

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
all over the place so I did it on this

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.160 
all over the place so I did it on this
shirt<00:00:43.320> because<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:43.950> fitted<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> kind<00:00:44.850> of

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
shirt because it's fitted so I kind of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.350 
shirt because it's fitted so I kind of
and<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.219> be<00:00:47.309> fitted<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.059> should

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and it's going to be fitted so it should

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.600 
and it's going to be fitted so it should
fall<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.840> same<00:00:49.140> place<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> I

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
fall in the same place so this is a I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.720 
fall in the same place so this is a I
think<00:00:56.780> maybe<00:00:57.780> three<00:00:58.289> or<00:00:58.320> four<00:00:58.500> days<00:00:58.949> now<00:00:59.340> my

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
think maybe three or four days now my

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.399 
think maybe three or four days now my
fourth<00:01:00.000> bottle<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:02.480> this<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.690> basically<00:01:04.199> um

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
fourth bottle so this is basically um

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.109 
fourth bottle so this is basically um
kind<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.500> risen<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.250> me<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.520> cooking<00:01:08.909> it's

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.690 
as I can hopefully I can get it so this
is<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.840> side<00:02:07.140> view<00:02:09.860> then<00:02:10.860> hopefully<00:02:11.490> it's<00:02:11.610> all

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
is the side view then hopefully it's all

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.490 
is the side view then hopefully it's all
straight<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.120> back<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.750> back<00:02:16.050> of

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
straight in the back this is the back of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.620 
straight in the back this is the back of
course<00:02:16.709> um<00:02:17.130> I'm<00:02:17.880> sorry<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.150> don't<00:02:18.330> look<00:02:18.420> it's

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
course um I'm sorry I don't look it's

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.790 
course um I'm sorry I don't look it's
actually<00:02:19.110> straight<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.380> don't<00:02:19.590> know<00:02:19.650> if<00:02:19.740> you

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
actually straight I don't know if you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.610 
actually straight I don't know if you
can<00:02:19.890> still<00:02:19.980> hear<00:02:20.250> me<00:02:20.370> either<00:02:20.490> but<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.840> think<00:02:22.530> I'm

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
can still hear me either but I think I'm

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.949 
can still hear me either but I think I'm
in<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.040> four<00:02:23.400> or<00:02:23.850> five<00:02:24.450> or<00:02:24.690> something

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
in like the four or five or something

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:25.280 
in like the four or five or something
like<00:02:25.020> that

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
like that

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.490 
like that
I<00:02:26.300> think<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.420> four<00:02:27.720> would<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.320> little

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
I think the four would be a little

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.730 
I think the four would be a little
longer

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
longer

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.260 
longer
I'm<00:02:28.800> not<00:02:28.950> sure<00:02:29.190> you'll<00:02:29.580> be<00:02:29.730> able<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.970> see<00:02:30.150> it

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
I'm not sure you'll be able to see it

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.510 
I'm not sure you'll be able to see it
better<00:02:30.450> than<00:02:30.630> me<00:02:30.780> after<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.290> video<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.770> try<00:02:32.459> to

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
better than me after this video I try to

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.949 
better than me after this video I try to
take<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> picture<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.360> was<00:02:33.480> kind<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.750> hard

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
take a picture but it was kind of hard

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.870 
take a picture but it was kind of hard
so<00:02:34.620> that's<00:02:34.770> where<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.010> am<00:02:35.070> now<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:36.950> um<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.489> guess

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
so that's where I am now so um I guess

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.320 
so that's where I am now so um I guess
I'll<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:39.209> go<00:02:39.390> ahead<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.720> do<00:02:39.780> another<00:02:39.810> update

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
I'll just go ahead and do another update

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.900 
I'll just go ahead and do another update
at<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> end<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.810> bottle<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:43.700> then<00:02:44.700> we'll

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
at the end of this bottle so then we'll

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.880 
at the end of this bottle so then we'll
be<00:02:45.060> able<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.330> compare<00:02:45.840> them<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.350> kind<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.680> see

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
be able to compare them and kind of see
