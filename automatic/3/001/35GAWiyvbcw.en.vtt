00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.370 
flat and I mean nerf does Inc angle
their<00:00:25.340> ranges<00:00:25.790> and<00:00:26.060> we<00:00:26.119> fire<00:00:26.540> flat<00:00:26.930> here<00:00:27.200> to

give you a consistent comparable but a a
lot<00:00:31.009> of<00:00:31.130> people<00:00:31.369> will<00:00:31.489> holding<00:00:31.700> out<00:00:31.790> hope<00:00:31.970> that

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
lot of people will holding out hope that

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.270 
lot of people will holding out hope that
it's<00:00:32.390> gonna<00:00:32.540> do<00:00:32.750> better<00:00:32.899> once<00:00:33.140> modded<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:33.739> so

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
it's gonna do better once modded and so

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.250 
it's gonna do better once modded and so
that's<00:00:35.000> what<00:00:35.180> we<00:00:35.329> have<00:00:35.510> here<00:00:35.780> I<00:00:35.960> mean<00:00:36.230> I

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
that's what we have here I mean I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.959 
that's what we have here I mean I
haven't<00:00:36.469> reinvented<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.160> wheel<00:00:37.309> but<00:00:37.640> I<00:00:37.670> did

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
haven't reinvented the wheel but I did

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.389 
haven't reinvented the wheel but I did
take<00:00:38.090> care<00:00:38.149> of<00:00:38.420> restrictors<00:00:38.899> out<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:39.769> so<00:00:40.250> we

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
take care of restrictors out and so we

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.939 
take care of restrictors out and so we
should<00:00:40.579> see<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:40.789> decent<00:00:41.539> bit<00:00:41.629> of<00:00:41.750> an<00:00:41.870> upgrade<00:00:41.989> so

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
should see a decent bit of an upgrade so

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.340 
should see a decent bit of an upgrade so
once<00:00:43.730> again<00:00:43.850> as<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.420> did<00:00:44.449> with<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.870> stock<00:00:45.079> test

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
once again as I did with the stock test

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.439 
once again as I did with the stock test
we've<00:00:45.589> got<00:00:45.800> elite<00:00:46.250> darts<00:00:46.429> we've<00:00:46.760> got<00:00:46.969> standard

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
streamlines and we'll do it within

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.529 
streamlines and we'll do it within
without<00:00:50.269> the<00:00:50.510> barrel<00:00:50.749> so<00:00:51.609> let's<00:00:52.609> get<00:00:53.300> things

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
without the barrel so let's get things

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.299 
without the barrel so let's get things
kicked<00:00:53.839> off<00:00:54.050> we'll<00:00:54.410> do<00:00:54.589> without<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:55.070> barrel

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
kicked off we'll do without the barrel

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.090 
kicked off we'll do without the barrel
first<00:00:55.780> and<00:00:56.780> start<00:00:57.620> with<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:57.920> standard

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
first and start with the standard

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:24.399 
first and start with the standard
streamlines<00:01:22.299> okay<00:01:23.299> there's<00:01:23.750> tiny

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
streamlines okay there's tiny

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.730 
streamlines okay there's tiny
streamlines

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
streamlines

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:51.730 
streamlines
get<00:01:27.740> up<00:01:27.829> load<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.100> up<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:29.600> elite<00:01:29.810> darts

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.380 

there's<00:01:52.740> ten<00:01:53.009> elite<00:01:53.220> darts<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.640> let's<00:01:56.909> see<00:01:57.149> how

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
there's ten elite darts so let's see how

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.309 
there's ten elite darts so let's see how
we<00:01:57.450> did<00:01:58.850> immediately<00:01:59.850> uh<00:02:00.079> spreads<00:02:01.079> all<00:02:01.289> over

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
we did immediately uh spreads all over

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.039 
we did immediately uh spreads all over
the<00:02:01.649> place<00:02:01.920> from<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.819> stock<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:03.869> have

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the place from the stock one we do have

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.050 
the place from the stock one we do have
this<00:02:04.229> slight<00:02:04.860> left/right<00:02:05.399> breeze<00:02:05.729> pretty

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
this slight left/right breeze pretty

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.680 
this slight left/right breeze pretty
similar<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.689> stock<00:02:06.869> test<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.970> as<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.209> come

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
similar to the stock test and as we come

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.770 
similar to the stock test and as we come
upon<00:02:10.049> the<00:02:10.229> lowest<00:02:10.739> streamline

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
upon the lowest streamline

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.770 
upon the lowest streamline
streamline<00:02:12.780> here<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:14.280> at<00:02:14.459> thirty<00:02:15.120> four<00:02:15.450> feet

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
streamline here it's at thirty four feet

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.850 
streamline here it's at thirty four feet
so<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.620> bit<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.860> improvement<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.610> low<00:02:17.730> shot

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
so a bit of improvement on the low shot

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.610 
so a bit of improvement on the low shot
lowest<00:02:19.860> elite<00:02:20.730> Dart<00:02:21.030> here<00:02:21.500> coming<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.590> a

once<00:02:29.459> again<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.940> mill<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.450> groups<00:02:30.720> are

once again the mill the groups are

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.640 
once again the mill the groups are
pretty<00:02:31.590> similar<00:02:32.870> elites<00:02:33.870> seem<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.349> finish<00:02:34.620> a

pretty similar elites seem to finish a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.160 
pretty similar elites seem to finish a
little<00:02:34.950> bit<00:02:35.280> closer<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> center<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.019> the

little bit closer to the center and the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.430 
little bit closer to the center and the
streamlines<00:02:37.620> bugged<00:02:38.099> out<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> bit<00:02:38.579> but<00:02:39.440> guess

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
streamlines bugged out a bit but guess

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.420

guess<00:02:54.959> as<00:02:56.269> we<00:02:57.269> work<00:02:57.510> our<00:02:57.690> way<00:02:57.840> up<00:02:57.870> here<00:02:59.209> trying

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
guess as we work our way up here trying

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.759 
guess as we work our way up here trying
to<00:03:00.239> make<00:03:00.359> sure<00:03:00.420> there<00:03:00.690> isn't<00:03:00.840> anything<00:03:01.260> crazy

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
to make sure there isn't anything crazy

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.099 
to make sure there isn't anything crazy
off<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.190> side<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.459> I'm<00:03:02.760> missing<00:03:03.109> it's

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
off to the side that I'm missing it's

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.990 
off to the side that I'm missing it's
like<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:05.250> our<00:03:05.489> farthest<00:03:06.090> stream<00:03:06.600> line

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
like this is our farthest stream line

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.860 
like this is our farthest stream line
that's<00:03:09.000> at<00:03:09.299> sixty-one<00:03:10.079> feet<00:03:11.420> let's<00:03:12.420> work<00:03:12.630> our

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
that's at sixty-one feet let's work our

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.069 
that's at sixty-one feet let's work our
way<00:03:13.079> all<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:14.100> way<00:03:14.160> up<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.910> top<00:03:15.420> elite

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
way all the way up to this top elite

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.410 
way all the way up to this top elite
Dart<00:03:16.590> yeah<00:03:17.100> looking<00:03:17.489> around<00:03:17.579> I'm<00:03:17.880> not<00:03:18.060> seeing

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
Dart yeah looking around I'm not seeing

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.080 
Dart yeah looking around I'm not seeing
anything<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:18.780> went<00:03:19.019> farther<00:03:19.230> than<00:03:19.350> this<00:03:19.560> one

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
anything that went farther than this one

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.240 
anything that went farther than this one
and<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.430> got<00:03:23.600> just<00:03:24.600> over<00:03:24.989> 71<00:03:25.769> feet<00:03:26.010> so

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
and so that got just over 71 feet so

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.890 
and so that got just over 71 feet so
there<00:03:26.400> we<00:03:26.519> go

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
there we go

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.059 
there we go
taking<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.989> air<00:03:28.109> restrictors<00:03:28.620> out<00:03:28.829> and

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
taking the air restrictors out and

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.879 
taking the air restrictors out and
without<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.139> barrel<00:03:31.139> attachment<00:03:31.380> on<00:03:31.680> there

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
without the barrel attachment on there

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.599 
without the barrel attachment on there
we've<00:03:32.040> cracked<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.639> 70s<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:34.430> popping<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.519> air

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
we've cracked the 70s so popping the air

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.400 
we've cracked the 70s so popping the air
restrictors<00:03:36.060> out<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.389> definitely<00:03:36.959> see<00:03:37.139> a<00:03:37.170> bit

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
restrictors out you definitely see a bit

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.370 
restrictors out you definitely see a bit
of<00:03:37.440> performance<00:03:37.859> other<00:03:38.400> than<00:03:38.639> well<00:03:39.599> a<00:03:39.810> bit<00:03:40.260> of

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
of performance other than well a bit of

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.259 
of performance other than well a bit of
a<00:03:40.440> range<00:03:40.620> improvement<00:03:41.280> other<00:03:41.459> than<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:42.060> darts

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
a range improvement other than the darts

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.089 
a range improvement other than the darts
we'll<00:03:42.450> just<00:03:42.690> go<00:03:42.870> every<00:03:43.319> which<00:03:43.500> way<00:03:43.530> because

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
we'll just go every which way because

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.770 
we'll just go every which way because
they're<00:03:44.310> not<00:03:44.459> even<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.030> elites<00:03:45.239> don't<00:03:45.509> seem

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
they're not even the elites don't seem

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.080 
they're not even the elites don't seem
to<00:03:45.930> be<00:03:46.019> able<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.169> handle<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> power<00:03:46.739> right<00:03:47.090> but

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
to be able to handle the power right but

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.510 
to be able to handle the power right but
okay<00:03:48.239> let's<00:03:48.750> see<00:03:49.019> if<00:03:49.169> the<00:03:49.560> bear

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
okay let's see if the bear

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.490 
okay let's see if the bear
extension<00:03:50.970> helps<00:03:51.240> with<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.630> uh<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:52.260> darts

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
extension helps with that uh the darts

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.250 
extension helps with that uh the darts
going<00:03:52.710> every<00:03:52.920> which<00:03:53.040> way

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
going every which way

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.870 
going every which way
okay<00:03:55.260> back<00:03:55.590> again<00:03:55.950> with<00:03:56.190> our<00:03:56.340> retaliate<00:03:56.850> oh

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
okay back again with our retaliate oh

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.060 
okay back again with our retaliate oh
that's<00:03:57.150> got<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.540> ear<00:03:57.720> structures<00:03:58.080> removed

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
that's got the ear structures removed

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.950 
that's got the ear structures removed
I'm<00:03:59.370> already<00:03:59.550> got<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.910> streamlines<00:04:00.540> loaded

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
I'm already got the streamlines loaded

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.870 
I'm already got the streamlines loaded
up<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.290> barrel<00:04:01.530> attachment<00:04:01.740> on<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:02.730> to

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
up and the barrel attachment on so to

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:59.600 
up and the barrel attachment on so to
see<00:04:03.060> how<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.360> affects<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.720> ranges<00:04:58.610> there's

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
see how that affects the ranges there's

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.650 
see how that affects the ranges there's
all<00:04:59.940> chain<00:05:00.360> both<00:05:02.270> immediately<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.480> can<00:05:03.630> see

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
all chain both immediately you can see

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.630 
all chain both immediately you can see
that<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:04.170> barrel<00:05:04.890> attachment<00:05:05.100> actually

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
that the barrel attachment actually

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.480 
that the barrel attachment actually
brought<00:05:06.420> a<00:05:06.720> lot<00:05:06.900> of<00:05:06.930> those<00:05:07.110> shots<00:05:07.350> right<00:05:07.800> down

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
brought a lot of those shots right down

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.760 
brought a lot of those shots right down
the<00:05:08.640> center<00:05:08.820> and<00:05:09.240> they're<00:05:09.420> all<00:05:09.590> every<00:05:10.590> which

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
the center and they're all every which

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.060 
the center and they're all every which
every<00:05:11.520> which<00:05:11.700> way<00:05:11.730> before<00:05:12.180> loop<00:05:12.450> as<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:13.590> catch

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
every which way before loop as I catch

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.390 
every which way before loop as I catch
myself<00:05:14.340> walking<00:05:15.090> by<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.420> lowest<00:05:15.750> streamline

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
myself walking by the lowest streamline

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.550 
myself walking by the lowest streamline
lowest<00:05:17.400> streamline<00:05:17.820> here<00:05:18.180> about<00:05:18.960> thirty<00:05:19.320> feet

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
lowest streamline here about thirty feet

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.940 
lowest streamline here about thirty feet
so<00:05:19.950> a<00:05:20.160> little<00:05:20.520> shorter<00:05:21.000> but<00:05:21.530> much<00:05:22.530> closer<00:05:22.800> to

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
so a little shorter but much closer to

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.020 
so a little shorter but much closer to
the<00:05:23.040> center<00:05:23.340> so<00:05:23.640> I<00:05:23.820> can't<00:05:24.000> argue<00:05:24.120> with<00:05:24.270> that

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
the center so I can't argue with that

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.880 
the center so I can't argue with that
trying<00:05:27.030> to<00:05:27.060> keep<00:05:27.240> out<00:05:27.420> for<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.810> blue<00:05:28.560> darts

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
trying to keep out for the blue darts

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.060 
trying to keep out for the blue darts
and<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.100> grass<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.580> shade<00:05:29.850> here<00:05:31.040> okay<00:05:32.040> I

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
and the grass and the shade here okay I

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.640 
and the grass and the shade here okay I
think<00:05:32.640> right<00:05:32.910> here<00:05:32.940> we've<00:05:33.930> got<00:05:34.080> our<00:05:34.140> lowest

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
think right here we've got our lowest

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.140 
think right here we've got our lowest
the<00:05:35.160> elite<00:05:35.460> darts<00:05:35.760> and<00:05:37.160> Wow<00:05:38.160> actually<00:05:38.490> lowest

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
the elite darts and Wow actually lowest

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.080 
the elite darts and Wow actually lowest
elite<00:05:39.390> darts<00:05:39.600> coming<00:05:40.200> in<00:05:40.700> right<00:05:41.700> around<00:05:41.940> the

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
elite darts coming in right around the

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.530 
elite darts coming in right around the
43<00:05:42.750> foot<00:05:43.410> mark<00:05:43.680> so<00:05:44.040> that's<00:05:44.850> nice<00:05:45.180> for

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
43 foot mark so that's nice for

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.010 
43 foot mark so that's nice for
consistency<00:05:46.140> purposes<00:05:47.060> working<00:05:48.060> our<00:05:48.360> way<00:05:48.390> up

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
consistency purposes working our way up

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.270 
consistency purposes working our way up
through<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:50.070> group<00:05:51.260> and<00:05:52.260> yeah<00:05:52.740> they're<00:05:53.130> all

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
through the group and yeah they're all

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.400 
through the group and yeah they're all
nice<00:05:53.850> and<00:05:53.880> down<00:05:54.510> the<00:05:54.690> center<00:05:54.930> with<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.169> barrel

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
nice and down the center with the barrel

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.140 
nice and down the center with the barrel
attachment<00:05:55.680> on<00:05:56.010> so<00:05:56.570> can't<00:05:57.570> argue<00:05:57.720> with<00:05:57.840> that

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
attachment on so can't argue with that

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.770 
attachment on so can't argue with that
I'm<00:06:00.150> gonna<00:06:00.300> call<00:06:00.660> the<00:06:01.140> middle<00:06:02.120> say<00:06:03.120> forty<00:06:03.570> nine

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
I'm gonna call the middle say forty nine

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.280 
I'm gonna call the middle say forty nine
two

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
two

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.650 
two
50<00:06:05.070> just<00:06:06.000> from<00:06:06.210> how<00:06:06.360> they're<00:06:06.630> spread<00:06:07.410> out<00:06:07.440> here

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
50 just from how they're spread out here

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.630 
50 just from how they're spread out here
looks<00:06:10.320> like<00:06:10.740> our<00:06:11.040> highest<00:06:12.170> streamline<00:06:13.640> it's

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
looks like our highest streamline it's

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.620 
looks like our highest streamline it's
gonna<00:06:14.820> be<00:06:15.150> up<00:06:15.450> there<00:06:17.030> at<00:06:18.030> highest<00:06:18.570> streamline

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
gonna be up there at highest streamline

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:29.750 
gonna be up there at highest streamline
about<00:06:21.630> 55<00:06:22.530> feet<00:06:22.820> and<00:06:25.100> see<00:06:28.370> okay<00:06:29.370> well<00:06:29.700> I

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
about 55 feet and see okay well I

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.610 
about 55 feet and see okay well I
thought<00:06:30.060> I<00:06:30.090> musta<00:06:30.420> lost<00:06:30.540> one<00:06:30.810> but<00:06:30.960> just<00:06:31.350> count

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
thought I musta lost one but just count

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.380 
thought I musta lost one but just count
them<00:06:31.770> all<00:06:31.860> out<00:06:32.040> behind<00:06:32.310> me<00:06:32.490> and<00:06:32.730> that<00:06:32.970> is<00:06:33.180> in

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
them all out behind me and that is in

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.110 
them all out behind me and that is in
fact<00:06:33.420> the<00:06:33.750> highest<00:06:34.140> elite<00:06:34.380> dart<00:06:34.710> which<00:06:35.130> is<00:06:35.400> C

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
fact the highest elite dart which is C

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.880 
fact the highest elite dart which is C
slightly<00:06:36.840> less<00:06:37.050> than<00:06:37.350> the<00:06:37.740> highest

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
slightly less than the highest

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.400 
slightly less than the highest
streamline<00:06:38.430> and<00:06:38.970> that<00:06:39.600> is<00:06:39.780> sitting<00:06:40.110> right<00:06:40.170> on

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
streamline and that is sitting right on

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.270 
streamline and that is sitting right on
the<00:06:40.560> 54<00:06:41.280> foot<00:06:41.580> mark<00:06:41.850> so<00:06:42.800> it's<00:06:43.800> gonna<00:06:44.010> bring

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
the 54 foot mark so it's gonna bring

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.580 
the 54 foot mark so it's gonna bring
your<00:06:44.460> ranges<00:06:44.760> back<00:06:45.000> a<00:06:45.030> bit<00:06:45.360> using<00:06:46.140> the<00:06:46.320> barrel

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
your ranges back a bit using the barrel

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.170 
your ranges back a bit using the barrel
attachment<00:06:46.860> but<00:06:47.400> if<00:06:47.640> you<00:06:47.820> want<00:06:48.000> to<00:06:48.090> actually

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
attachment but if you want to actually

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.410 
attachment but if you want to actually
hit<00:06:48.510> what<00:06:48.690> you're<00:06:48.810> aiming<00:06:48.870> at<00:06:49.200> I<00:06:50.240> this<00:06:51.240> is<00:06:51.360> the

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
hit what you're aiming at I this is the

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.030 
hit what you're aiming at I this is the
first<00:06:51.630> time<00:06:51.780> I'd<00:06:51.900> actually<00:06:52.140> recommend<00:06:52.620> using

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
first time I'd actually recommend using

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.310 
first time I'd actually recommend using
the<00:06:53.220> barrel<00:06:53.460> attachment<00:06:53.720> you<00:06:54.720> can<00:06:54.750> judge<00:06:55.110> for

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
the barrel attachment you can judge for

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.020 
the barrel attachment you can judge for
yourself<00:06:55.380> looking<00:06:56.010> at<00:06:56.130> the<00:06:56.250> tests<00:06:56.550> over<00:06:56.820> again

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
yourself looking at the tests over again

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.780 
yourself looking at the tests over again
but<00:06:57.240> it<00:06:57.390> definitely<00:06:57.570> brought<00:06:58.310> that<00:06:59.310> random

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
but it definitely brought that random

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.610 
but it definitely brought that random
spreaded<00:07:00.300> darts<00:07:00.600> that<00:07:00.810> you<00:07:01.260> couldn't<00:07:01.530> tell

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
spreaded darts that you couldn't tell

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.900 
spreaded darts that you couldn't tell
where<00:07:01.830> it<00:07:01.920> was<00:07:01.950> going<00:07:02.250> and<00:07:02.430> brought<00:07:02.670> it<00:07:02.790> right

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910 
where it was going and brought it right

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.340 
where it was going and brought it right
down<00:07:03.060> the<00:07:03.240> middle<00:07:04.220> even<00:07:05.220> so<00:07:05.460> as<00:07:06.390> you<00:07:07.170> could<00:07:07.320> see

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
down the middle even so as you could see

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.500 
down the middle even so as you could see
with<00:07:07.800> the<00:07:07.860> air<00:07:08.010> restrictors<00:07:08.490> out<00:07:08.670> so<00:07:09.270> you<00:07:09.330> got

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
with the air restrictors out so you got

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.640 
with the air restrictors out so you got
even<00:07:09.720> more<00:07:09.900> power<00:07:10.170> going<00:07:10.500> it<00:07:10.620> really

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
even more power going it really

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.080 
even more power going it really
fishtailed<00:07:11.610> to<00:07:11.760> even<00:07:11.970> elite<00:07:12.210> darts<00:07:12.480> so<00:07:14.090> maybe

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.090 
fishtailed to even elite darts so maybe

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.770 
fishtailed to even elite darts so maybe
still<00:07:15.570> modded<00:07:15.960> darts<00:07:16.200> are<00:07:16.320> the<00:07:16.380> way<00:07:16.500> to<00:07:16.530> go

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780 
still modded darts are the way to go

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.590 
still modded darts are the way to go
anyway<00:07:18.990> there<00:07:19.290> you<00:07:19.470> go<00:07:19.940> retaliate<00:07:20.940> err<00:07:20.970> they

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 
anyway there you go retaliate err they

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.940 
anyway there you go retaliate err they
are<00:07:21.810> removed<00:07:22.230> that's<00:07:23.160> your<00:07:23.430> test
