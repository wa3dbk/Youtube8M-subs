 friends, hello, we continue our 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.500
 vlog and today we will perform a song 

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:11.600
 called from the depths and 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.740
 You wrote a food poison so I will 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.230
 talk about her when the thought came on 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.150
 the writing of this song is really like 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.580
 ironically the most heartfelt 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.000
 sincere songs are written when you 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.490
 undergoing some tests and here in 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.430
 one of those moments when in life is not 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.879
 everything was smooth just been thinking 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.120
 over what god i would ask 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.239
 at god and these words came from the depths 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.789
 my sings you these words are sincere 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.929
 worship god some kind of request tom 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.299
 so he opened 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:51.260
 the wealth of his love is his mercy for 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:53.420
 my life first and foremost here in this 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.139
 songs is not the basis of some kind of text 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.629
 from the bible 

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:59.179
 but it really is so sincere 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.059
 experiences when god is in your life 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.910
 something does some work this is not 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.780
 always nice but always 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.920
 It is a great blessing, and then 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.170
 Here in this situation, I was born this 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.170
