00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.910 

all<00:02:15.690> right<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.989> first<00:02:16.200> part<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.650> riff

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
all right so the first part of this riff

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.140

is<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.370> part<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.760> at<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.849> very<00:02:24.030> beginning

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
is this part and at the very beginning

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.119 
is this part and at the very beginning
it's<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.810> same<00:02:25.019> thing<00:02:25.050> but<00:02:25.500> spread<00:02:26.010> it

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
it's just the same thing but spread it

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.850 
it's just the same thing but spread it
so<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.569> just<00:02:27.810> you're<00:02:27.930> using<00:02:28.049> your<00:02:28.260> open<00:02:28.620> a

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
string as a pedal point muted and then

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.220 
string as a pedal point muted and then
fifth<00:02:34.530> fret<00:02:34.799> d<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.670> g<00:02:35.700> string<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:39.230> seventh

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
fret d and g string and you just going

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.370 
fret d and g string and you just going
back<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.239> forth<00:02:45.450> between<00:02:45.690> those<00:02:45.930> two<00:02:46.170> like

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
back and forth between those two like

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.930 
back and forth between those two like
this

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.900 

that's<00:02:52.940> it

there sometime you can move my entire

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.250 
there sometime you can move my entire
finger<00:04:07.330> so<00:04:09.540> that's<00:04:10.540> how<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:10.690> play<00:04:10.990> it<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.170> can

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
finger so that's how I play it you can

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.930 
finger so that's how I play it you can
do<00:04:11.350> it<00:04:11.380> ever<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.620> want<00:04:11.800> but<00:04:12.430> that's<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.760> whole

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
do it ever you want but that's the whole

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.890 
do it ever you want but that's the whole
thing<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.420> it's<00:04:13.600> just<00:04:18.090> again<00:04:19.090> if<00:04:19.330> you<00:04:19.450> want<00:04:19.660> at

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
thing so it's just again if you want at

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.230 
thing so it's just again if you want at
the<00:04:20.050> picture<00:04:20.290> of<00:04:20.350> molecule<00:04:22.920> that's<00:04:23.920> that<00:04:24.070> part

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.990 

and<00:04:27.889> then<00:04:28.889> there's<00:04:29.039> the<00:04:29.160> power<00:04:29.370> cord<00:04:29.729> part

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
and then there's the power cord part

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:54.159 
and then there's the power cord part
which<00:04:30.389> is<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:31.380> vs.<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.069> that<00:04:32.280> goes<00:04:32.490> like<00:04:32.520> this

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:01.390 

so<00:04:55.169> that's<00:04:55.320> just
