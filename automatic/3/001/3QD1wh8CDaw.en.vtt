schizophrenia<00:00:09.190> is<00:00:09.340> a<00:00:09.430> very<00:00:10.000> serious<00:00:10.240> mental

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
schizophrenia is a very serious mental

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.930 
schizophrenia is a very serious mental
illness<00:00:11.049> it<00:00:11.740> affects<00:00:12.040> about<00:00:12.160> 1%<00:00:12.519> of

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
illness it affects about 1% of

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.789 
illness it affects about 1% of
population<00:00:13.059> worldwide<00:00:13.719> and<00:00:14.469> one<00:00:14.680> of<00:00:14.740> the

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
population worldwide and one of the

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.470 
population worldwide and one of the
interesting<00:00:15.130> things<00:00:15.370> about<00:00:15.460> it<00:00:15.880> is<00:00:16.029> that<00:00:16.270> it

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
interesting things about it is that it

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.030 
interesting things about it is that it
doesn't<00:00:16.660> show<00:00:16.869> a<00:00:16.900> lot<00:00:17.080> of<00:00:17.200> variation<00:00:17.770> from<00:00:17.950> one

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
doesn't show a lot of variation from one

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.730 
doesn't show a lot of variation from one
country<00:00:18.430> to<00:00:18.640> another<00:00:18.790> to<00:00:19.590> different<00:00:20.590> racial

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
country to another to different racial

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.620 
country to another to different racial
groups<00:00:20.919> different<00:00:21.610> ethnicities<00:00:22.180> so<00:00:22.509> it's

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
groups different ethnicities so it's

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.480 
groups different ethnicities so it's
it's<00:00:22.869> a<00:00:22.960> real<00:00:23.140> serious<00:00:23.470> problem<00:00:23.949> like<00:00:24.100> many

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
it's a real serious problem like many

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.400 
it's a real serious problem like many
groups<00:00:24.760> we<00:00:25.029> started<00:00:25.510> out<00:00:25.630> focusing<00:00:25.840> on<00:00:26.380> a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
groups we started out focusing on a

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.120 
groups we started out focusing on a
particular<00:00:26.769> gene<00:00:27.189> so<00:00:27.699> we've<00:00:27.939> got<00:00:28.180> a<00:00:29.039> sample<00:00:30.039> of

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
particular gene so we've got a sample of

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.420 
particular gene so we've got a sample of
families<00:00:30.609> that<00:00:30.880> our<00:00:31.330> collaborator<00:00:32.080> in<00:00:32.430> Canada

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
families that our collaborator in Canada

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.570 
families that our collaborator in Canada
has<00:00:33.610> collected<00:00:33.879> dr.<00:00:34.330> Ann<00:00:34.420> Bassett<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.739> using

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
has collected dr. Ann Bassett and using

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.220 
has collected dr. Ann Bassett and using
these<00:00:36.670> families<00:00:37.150> we've<00:00:37.330> identified<00:00:37.540> a

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
these families we've identified a

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.060 
these families we've identified a
particular<00:00:38.589> genes<00:00:39.070> called<00:00:39.489> -1<00:00:40.000> AP<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:41.410> seems

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
particular genes called -1 AP that seems

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.260 
particular genes called -1 AP that seems
to<00:00:42.219> have<00:00:42.370> a<00:00:42.399> very<00:00:42.700> important<00:00:43.090> role<00:00:43.239> in

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
to have a very important role in

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.200 
to have a very important role in
increasing<00:00:43.510> risk<00:00:44.140> in<00:00:44.410> these<00:00:44.530> families<00:00:45.210> other

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
increasing risk in these families other

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.270 
increasing risk in these families other
people<00:00:46.660> have<00:00:46.809> looked<00:00:47.079> in<00:00:47.260> other<00:00:47.469> families<00:00:47.770> and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
people have looked in other families and

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.950 
people have looked in other families and
other<00:00:48.399> collections<00:00:49.030> or<00:00:49.149> other<00:00:49.300> populations

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
other collections or other populations

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.709 
other collections or other populations
and<00:00:50.230> as<00:00:50.710> is<00:00:51.010> typical<00:00:51.550> for<00:00:51.879> our<00:00:51.940> field<00:00:52.360> through

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
and as is typical for our field through

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.959 
and as is typical for our field through
mixed<00:00:52.989> results<00:00:53.440> so<00:00:54.070> there's<00:00:54.309> several<00:00:54.640> studies

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
mixed results so there's several studies

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.700 
mixed results so there's several studies
where<00:00:55.210> people<00:00:55.660> find<00:00:55.960> that<00:00:56.110> this<00:00:56.260> gene<00:00:56.469> looks

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
where people find that this gene looks

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.500 
where people find that this gene looks
like<00:00:56.860> it's<00:00:57.010> important<00:00:57.430> in<00:00:57.520> other<00:00:57.640> populations

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
like it's important in other populations

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.060 
like it's important in other populations
and<00:00:58.660> there<00:00:59.230> are<00:00:59.289> a<00:00:59.320> couple<00:00:59.440> of<00:00:59.620> samples<00:00:59.980> where

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
and there are a couple of samples where

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.410 
and there are a couple of samples where
people<00:01:00.370> don't<00:01:00.489> find<00:01:00.730> any<00:01:00.879> evidence<00:01:01.180> for<00:01:01.300> this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
people don't find any evidence for this

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.020 
people don't find any evidence for this
gene<00:01:01.660> for<00:01:02.260> example<00:01:02.800> we've<00:01:03.160> identified<00:01:03.370> one

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
gene for example we've identified one

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.330 
gene for example we've identified one
sample<00:01:04.390> where<00:01:04.839> if<00:01:05.140> you<00:01:05.649> just<00:01:05.890> look<00:01:06.130> at<00:01:06.250> the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
sample where if you just look at the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.670 
sample where if you just look at the
sample<00:01:06.789> by<00:01:06.970> itself<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.990> actually<00:01:08.320> don't<00:01:08.500> see

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
sample by itself you actually don't see

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.779 
sample by itself you actually don't see
any<00:01:08.800> evidence<00:01:09.160> that<00:01:09.220> this<00:01:09.430> gene<00:01:09.670> is

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
any evidence that this gene is

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.940 
any evidence that this gene is
increasing<00:01:10.240> risk<00:01:10.479> but<00:01:11.170> if<00:01:11.319> you<00:01:11.440> then<00:01:11.590> start<00:01:11.860> to

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
increasing risk but if you then start to

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.620 
increasing risk but if you then start to
look<00:01:12.069> at<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.399> interaction<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.149> this<00:01:13.300> gene

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
look at the interaction of this gene

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.270 
look at the interaction of this gene
with<00:01:14.200> another<00:01:14.709> gene<00:01:14.920> on<00:01:15.009> a<00:01:15.069> different

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
with another gene on a different

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.160 
with another gene on a different
chromosome<00:01:15.670> all<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.509> sudden<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:16.869> see<00:01:17.050> that

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
chromosome all of a sudden you see that

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.900 
chromosome all of a sudden you see that
the<00:01:17.289> interaction<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.069> important<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.700> does

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
the interaction is important and does

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.790 
the interaction is important and does
act<00:01:19.209> increase<00:01:19.630> risk<00:01:19.899> so<00:01:20.440> what<00:01:20.649> we've

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
act increase risk so what we've

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.639 
act increase risk so what we've
basically<00:01:21.069> done<00:01:21.490> most<00:01:22.119> recently<00:01:22.599> is<00:01:23.050> we've

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
basically done most recently is we've

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.820 
basically done most recently is we've
taken<00:01:23.890> our<00:01:24.220> set<00:01:24.550> of<00:01:24.670> families<00:01:25.410> these<00:01:26.410> Canadian

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
taken our set of families these Canadian

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.070 
taken our set of families these Canadian
families<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.429> we've<00:01:28.030> actually<00:01:28.209> genotyped

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
families and we've actually genotyped

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.740 
families and we've actually genotyped
them<00:01:29.380> at<00:01:29.619> a<00:01:30.160> million<00:01:30.429> snips<00:01:30.940> these<00:01:31.390> single

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
them at a million snips these single

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.480 
them at a million snips these single

whole<00:01:33.640> genome<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.300> what<00:01:35.050> we've<00:01:35.200> started<00:01:35.440> to

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
whole genome and what we've started to

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:37.260 
whole genome and what we've started to
do<00:01:35.890> now<00:01:36.099> is<00:01:36.340> look<00:01:36.640> for<00:01:36.849> evidence<00:01:37.000> of

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
do now is look for evidence of

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.169 
do now is look for evidence of
interaction<00:01:38.050> between<00:01:38.560> our<00:01:39.220> first<00:01:39.880> gene

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
areas of the genome that we have

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.279 
areas of the genome that we have
statistical<00:01:46.450> reason<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.959> believe<00:01:47.110> that

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
statistical reason to believe that

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.889 
statistical reason to believe that
there's<00:01:47.800> another<00:01:48.459> gene<00:01:48.729> involved<00:01:49.420> there<00:01:49.569> and

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
there's another gene involved there and

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.690 
there's another gene involved there and
what<00:01:50.349> we've<00:01:50.500> started<00:01:50.679> to<00:01:50.920> find<00:01:51.099> out<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.520> really

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
what we've started to find out is really

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.219 
what we've started to find out is really
very<00:01:52.060> very<00:01:52.270> interesting<00:01:52.720> we've<00:01:52.869> we're

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
very very interesting we've we're

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.699 
very very interesting we've we're
identifying<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:54.310> set<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.090> additional<00:01:55.330> genes<00:01:55.810> so

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
identifying a set of additional genes so

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.130 
identifying a set of additional genes so
we<00:01:56.890> currently<00:01:57.069> have<00:01:57.429> five<00:01:57.819> other<00:01:58.060> genes<00:01:58.509> all

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
we currently have five other genes all

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.410 
we currently have five other genes all
of<00:01:59.560> which<00:01:59.739> are<00:01:59.920> in<00:02:00.039> biological<00:02:00.369> pathways<00:02:01.179> that

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
of which are in biological pathways that

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.630 
of which are in biological pathways that
interact<00:02:01.989> with<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.349> first<00:02:02.590> chain<00:02:02.860> so<00:02:03.489> these

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
interact with the first chain so these

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.309 
interact with the first chain so these
are<00:02:03.910> our<00:02:03.940> second<00:02:04.629> set<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:04.780> genes<00:02:05.050> that<00:02:05.140> we're

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
are our second set of genes that we're

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.080 
are our second set of genes that we're
pulling<00:02:05.619> out<00:02:05.800> that<00:02:06.369> have<00:02:06.580> strong<00:02:06.849> statistical

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
pulling out that have strong statistical

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.570 
pulling out that have strong statistical
support<00:02:07.690> that<00:02:08.530> they're<00:02:08.770> also<00:02:08.979> increasing

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
support that they're also increasing

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.000 
support that they're also increasing
risk<00:02:09.729> for<00:02:09.849> schizophrenia<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:11.650> just<00:02:11.890> so

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
risk for schizophrenia and it just so

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.650 
risk for schizophrenia and it just so
happens<00:02:12.459> when<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:12.730> look<00:02:12.879> at<00:02:13.000> which<00:02:13.180> genes<00:02:13.480> are

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
happens when we look at which genes are

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.720 
happens when we look at which genes are
supported<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.500> they're<00:02:14.770> biologically<00:02:15.400> very

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
supported that they're biologically very

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.730 
supported that they're biologically very
closely<00:02:16.000> tied<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.720> first<00:02:16.990> gene<00:02:17.260> which<00:02:17.710> is

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
closely tied to that first gene which is

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.010 
closely tied to that first gene which is
you<00:02:18.370> know<00:02:18.460> what<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.730> would<00:02:18.790> expect

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
you know what you would expect

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.020 
you know what you would expect
so<00:02:20.500> we're<00:02:20.590> actually<00:02:20.830> very<00:02:21.040> very<00:02:21.490> encouraged

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
so we're actually very very encouraged

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.020 
so we're actually very very encouraged
that<00:02:22.060> our<00:02:22.270> method<00:02:22.720> is<00:02:23.010> working<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.220> you

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
that our method is working and that you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.720 
that our method is working and that you
know<00:02:25.120> we're<00:02:25.270> hoping<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:25.780> we'll<00:02:25.900> be<00:02:25.930> able<00:02:26.140> to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
know we're hoping that we'll be able to

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.100 
know we're hoping that we'll be able to
expand<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.030> other<00:02:28.150> datasets<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:28.930> not

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
expand this to other datasets so not

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.870 
expand this to other datasets so not
just<00:02:29.260> do<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:29.620> our<00:02:29.770> Canadian<00:02:30.250> samples<00:02:30.730> but

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
just do this on our Canadian samples but

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.490 
just do this on our Canadian samples but
do<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.240> groups<00:02:31.780> from<00:02:31.960> other<00:02:32.200> backgrounds

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
do it on groups from other backgrounds

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.860 
do it on groups from other backgrounds
so<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.520> think<00:02:33.640> there<00:02:34.030> are<00:02:34.090> there<00:02:34.330> two<00:02:34.750> different

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
so I think there are there two different

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.930 
so I think there are there two different
things<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.650> hopefully<00:02:36.220> misunderstanding

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
things that hopefully misunderstanding

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.170 
things that hopefully misunderstanding
what<00:02:37.060> will<00:02:37.300> help<00:02:37.510> with<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.980> first<00:02:39.340> off<00:02:39.610> there's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
what will help with so first off there's

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.450 
what will help with so first off there's
a<00:02:40.270> big<00:02:40.540> push<00:02:40.810> right<00:02:41.080> now<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:41.860> concept<00:02:42.370> of

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
a big push right now to this concept of

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.970 
a big push right now to this concept of
personalized<00:02:43.030> medicine<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:44.350> idea<00:02:44.740> that

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
personalized medicine and this idea that

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.220 
personalized medicine and this idea that
certain<00:02:45.850> people<00:02:46.270> respond<00:02:46.690> said<00:02:46.960> better<00:02:47.140> to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
certain people respond said better to

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.900 
certain people respond said better to
certain<00:02:47.590> drugs<00:02:47.710> and<00:02:48.040> other<00:02:48.160> people<00:02:48.490> do<00:02:48.670> and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
certain drugs and other people do and

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.580 
certain drugs and other people do and
can<00:02:49.570> we<00:02:49.720> understand<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.350> underlying

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
can we understand the underlying

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.040 
can we understand the underlying
genetics<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.610> causes<00:02:52.330> one<00:02:52.360> person<00:02:52.870> to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
genetics that causes one person to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.990 
genetics that causes one person to
benefit<00:02:53.830> from<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.070> given<00:02:54.280> treatment<00:02:54.700> more<00:02:54.850> than

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
benefit from a given treatment more than

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.510 
benefit from a given treatment more than
another<00:02:55.270> so<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.840> think<00:02:56.050> in<00:02:56.410> terms<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.860> modeling

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
another so I think in terms of modeling

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.550 
another so I think in terms of modeling
who's<00:02:58.090> most<00:02:58.360> likely<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.810> benefit<00:02:59.260> from<00:02:59.320> a

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
who's most likely to benefit from a

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.680 
who's most likely to benefit from a
given<00:02:59.800> therapeutic<00:03:00.280> intervention<00:03:00.970> looking

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
given therapeutic intervention looking

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.300 
given therapeutic intervention looking
at<00:03:01.780> multiple<00:03:02.230> genes<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.770> try<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.010> determine

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
at multiple genes to try to determine

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.010 
at multiple genes to try to determine
that<00:03:03.550> is<00:03:03.730> going<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.000> give<00:03:04.180> us<00:03:04.210> a<00:03:04.480> better<00:03:04.690> fit

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
that is going to give us a better fit

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.450 
that is going to give us a better fit
and<00:03:05.050> then<00:03:05.380> hopefully<00:03:05.560> better<00:03:05.890> therapeutic

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
and then hopefully better therapeutic

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.230 
and then hopefully better therapeutic
outcomes<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:07.960> second<00:03:08.590> potential<00:03:09.090> benefit<00:03:10.090> from

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
outcomes a second potential benefit from

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.990 
outcomes a second potential benefit from
this<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.690> that<00:03:11.080> we<00:03:11.680> might<00:03:11.920> start<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.430> identify

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
this is that we might start to identify

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.090 
this is that we might start to identify
additional<00:03:13.530> potential<00:03:14.530> targets<00:03:15.040> for

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
additional potential targets for

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.790 
additional potential targets for
pharmacologic<00:03:15.850> intervention<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:17.230> many<00:03:17.650> of

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
pharmacologic intervention so many of

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.500 
pharmacologic intervention so many of
the<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.010> medications<00:03:18.940> are<00:03:19.060> used<00:03:19.270> for

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
the the medications are used for

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.510 
the the medications are used for
schizophrenia<00:03:19.690> right<00:03:20.290> now<00:03:20.500> or<00:03:20.860> from<00:03:21.430> a

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
schizophrenia right now or from a

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.330 
schizophrenia right now or from a
relatively<00:03:21.970> limited<00:03:22.330> class<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.870> drugs<00:03:23.410> and

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
relatively limited class of drugs and

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.820 
relatively limited class of drugs and
they<00:03:24.490> target<00:03:24.940> some<00:03:25.720> but<00:03:25.960> not<00:03:25.990> all<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
they target some but not all of the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.100 
they target some but not all of the
symptoms<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.460> illness<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:28.660> one<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:29.020> the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
symptoms of the illness so one of the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.020 
symptoms of the illness so one of the
hopes<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.530> if<00:03:29.680> we<00:03:29.860> identify<00:03:30.010> more<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:30.940> the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
hopes is if we identify more of the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.880 
hopes is if we identify more of the
underlying<00:03:31.390> biology<00:03:31.690> that's<00:03:32.290> going<00:03:32.560> wrong<00:03:32.770> in

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
underlying biology that's going wrong in

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.230 
underlying biology that's going wrong in
the<00:03:32.980> silvus<00:03:33.340> we<00:03:33.520> might<00:03:33.700> be<00:03:33.820> able<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.000> come<00:03:34.180> up

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
the silvus we might be able to come up

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.820 
the silvus we might be able to come up
with<00:03:34.330> some<00:03:34.540> better<00:03:34.720> ideas<00:03:35.170> for<00:03:35.200> how<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.530> treat

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
with some better ideas for how to treat

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:36.090 
with some better ideas for how to treat
it

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
it

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.150 
it
a<00:03:36.540> third<00:03:37.540> area<00:03:37.960> that<00:03:38.350> this<00:03:38.620> might<00:03:38.830> be<00:03:38.860> useful

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
a third area that this might be useful

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.460 
a third area that this might be useful
for<00:03:39.580> is<00:03:40.060> that<00:03:40.360> we<00:03:40.630> know<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:41.230> schizophrenia

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
for is that we know that schizophrenia

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.070 
for is that we know that schizophrenia
is<00:03:41.950> not<00:03:42.160> an<00:03:42.340> entirely<00:03:42.640> genetic<00:03:42.910> disorder<00:03:43.600> so

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
is not an entirely genetic disorder so

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.540 
is not an entirely genetic disorder so
if<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.320> look<00:03:44.500> for<00:03:44.740> example<00:03:44.800> at<00:03:45.160> identical

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
if you look for example at identical

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.750 
if you look for example at identical
twins<00:03:46.000> it's<00:03:46.750> not<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.170> case<00:03:47.380> that<00:03:47.410> every<00:03:47.920> pair

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
twins it's not the case that every pair

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.520 
twins it's not the case that every pair
of<00:03:48.790> identical<00:03:49.180> twins<00:03:49.750> will<00:03:49.870> both<00:03:50.170> have<00:03:50.410> the

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
of identical twins will both have the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.320 
of identical twins will both have the
illness<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:51.280> certainly<00:03:51.640> find<00:03:51.880> about<00:03:52.090> half

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
illness you certainly find about half

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330 
illness you certainly find about half
the<00:03:52.540> time<00:03:52.690> one<00:03:53.140> twin<00:03:53.410> has<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:53.950> other<00:03:54.070> twin

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
the time one twin has it the other twin

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.580 
the time one twin has it the other twin
doesn't<00:03:54.760> so<00:03:55.450> there's<00:03:55.720> something<00:03:56.200> besides

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
doesn't so there's something besides

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.290 
doesn't so there's something besides
genes<00:03:57.100> that<00:03:57.250> are<00:03:57.340> important<00:03:57.760> in<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:57.970> illness

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
genes that are important in the illness

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.070 
genes that are important in the illness
if<00:03:59.110> we<00:03:59.380> can<00:03:59.560> identify<00:03:59.740> what<00:04:00.660> really<00:04:01.660> causes

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
if we can identify what really causes

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.900 
if we can identify what really causes
someone<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.410> have<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.800> genetic<00:04:03.160> risk<00:04:03.340> factors

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
someone to have the genetic risk factors

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.030 
someone to have the genetic risk factors
then<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.780> might<00:04:05.020> make<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.380> easier<00:04:05.770> for<00:04:05.800> us<00:04:06.010> to

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
then that might make it easier for us to

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.650 
then that might make it easier for us to
figure<00:04:06.490> out<00:04:06.670> what<00:04:07.000> are<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.180> specific

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
figure out what are the specific

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.240 
figure out what are the specific
environmental<00:04:08.110> factors<00:04:08.770> that<00:04:09.010> cause

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
environmental factors that cause

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.860 
environmental factors that cause
somebody<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.850> get<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.150> illness<00:04:10.390> or<00:04:10.510> not<00:04:10.570> get

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
somebody to get the illness or not get

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.630 
somebody to get the illness or not get
the<00:04:10.990> illness<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.920> might<00:04:12.130> actually<00:04:12.340> be

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
the illness and that might actually be

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.640 
the illness and that might actually be
an<00:04:12.820> easier<00:04:13.240> Avenue<00:04:13.690> of<00:04:13.780> intervention<00:04:14.470> to

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
an easier Avenue of intervention to

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.320 
an easier Avenue of intervention to
actually<00:04:15.280> prevent<00:04:15.610> people<00:04:15.880> from<00:04:16.060> getting

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
actually prevent people from getting

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.880 
actually prevent people from getting
whatever<00:04:16.600> environmental<00:04:17.260> exposure<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.799> is

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
whatever environmental exposure it is

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.860 
whatever environmental exposure it is
that<00:04:18.130> triggers<00:04:18.520> the<00:04:18.640> disease<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.780> that's

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
that triggers the disease and that's

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.120 
that triggers the disease and that's
probably<00:04:20.290> going<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.470> be<00:04:20.530> easier<00:04:20.770> than<00:04:20.920> say

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
probably going to be easier than say

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.950 
probably going to be easier than say
doing<00:04:21.340> something<00:04:21.609> like<00:04:21.670> gene<00:04:21.910> therapy<00:04:22.450> to

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
doing something like gene therapy to

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.420 
doing something like gene therapy to
actually<00:04:23.290> fix<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.650> underlying<00:04:24.070> genetic

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
actually fix the underlying genetic

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.940 
actually fix the underlying genetic
deficits<00:04:24.940> it's<00:04:25.390> a<00:04:25.540> big<00:04:25.720> puzzle<00:04:25.990> and<00:04:26.620> the

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
deficits it's a big puzzle and the

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.590 
deficits it's a big puzzle and the
analogy<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.310> like<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.580> use<00:04:27.730> is<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.330> say<00:04:28.360> it's

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
analogy I like to use is to say it's

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.480 
analogy I like to use is to say it's
like<00:04:28.720> a<00:04:28.750> jigsaw<00:04:29.229> puzzle<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:30.040> we're<00:04:30.220> doing<00:04:30.430> a

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
like a jigsaw puzzle and we're doing a

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.100 
like a jigsaw puzzle and we're doing a
jigsaw<00:04:30.850> puzzle<00:04:30.880> once<00:04:31.390> you<00:04:31.479> have<00:04:31.660> some<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:31.960> the

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
jigsaw puzzle once you have some of the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.860 
jigsaw puzzle once you have some of the
pieces<00:04:32.320> and

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
pieces and

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.080 
pieces and
it<00:04:33.170> gets<00:04:33.380> easier<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.920> put<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.340> subsequent

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
it gets easier to put the the subsequent

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.790 
it gets easier to put the the subsequent
pieces<00:04:35.240> in<00:04:35.540> place<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.020> there's<00:04:36.530> nothing

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
pieces in place and there's nothing

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.900 
pieces in place and there's nothing
wrong<00:04:36.980> when<00:04:37.250> you're<00:04:37.340> doing<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.550> jigsaw<00:04:37.880> puzzle

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
wrong when you're doing a jigsaw puzzle

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.460 
wrong when you're doing a jigsaw puzzle
we're<00:04:38.420> starting<00:04:38.660> with<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.840> easy<00:04:38.990> stuff<00:04:39.110> like

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
we're starting with the easy stuff like

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.070 
we're starting with the easy stuff like
doing<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.740> edges<00:04:40.070> first<00:04:40.570> so<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:41.600> think<00:04:41.780> in

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
doing the edges first so I think in

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.140 
doing the edges first so I think in
terms<00:04:42.290> of<00:04:42.440> going<00:04:42.770> after<00:04:42.950> jeans<00:04:43.370> that<00:04:43.760> have<00:04:44.120> a

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
terms of going after jeans that have a

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.330 
terms of going after jeans that have a
big<00:04:44.480> effect<00:04:44.510> in<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:45.050> given<00:04:45.260> sample<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.980> then

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
big effect in a given sample and then

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.040 
big effect in a given sample and then
trying<00:04:46.640> to<00:04:46.730> see<00:04:46.820> what<00:04:47.150> other<00:04:47.270> genes<00:04:47.480> interact

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
trying to see what other genes interact

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.260 
trying to see what other genes interact
with<00:04:48.260> those<00:04:48.500> you<00:04:49.430> know<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.550> is<00:04:49.670> very<00:04:49.700> analogous

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
with those you know it is very analogous

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.670 
with those you know it is very analogous
till<00:04:50.570> you<00:04:50.660> start<00:04:50.870> out<00:04:50.960> with<00:04:50.990> a<00:04:51.110> corner<00:04:51.530> then

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
till you start out with a corner then

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.290 
till you start out with a corner then
you<00:04:51.770> do<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:52.010> edge<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.550> then<00:04:53.060> probably

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
you do the edge and then probably

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.700 
you do the edge and then probably
environmental<00:04:53.990> factors<00:04:54.350> are<00:04:54.410> going<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.620> be

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
environmental factors are going to be

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.790 
environmental factors are going to be
