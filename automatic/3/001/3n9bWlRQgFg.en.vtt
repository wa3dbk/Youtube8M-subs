00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.290
 CGT people I hope it goes well I 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 it's going great today we're 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.529
 find for a video that's good 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.389
 a long time because it's almost a 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.849
 week we did not see each other or 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.420
 did not agree so to start 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.650
 this week we will say that already Tuesday 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.949
 a little squat scorer that I did a 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.220
 not so long ago I did six 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.660
 matches with sure but she is very 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.789
 well we'll start right away with the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.619
 guardian 7 ch then this thing what is this 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.440
 we can say 85 dive 83 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.880
 85 reflex positioning 2500 credit this 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.200
 guardian you know a it's not the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.790
 hardly say for me that's the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.219
 best game keeper with damaging art 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.960
 soft play largely without counting the rates 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.370
 are expected 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.690
 second guard second guard well 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.070
 sure a second grade is so a 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.309
 central defender chiellini these are 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 seven-speed 86 defense 82 head 2009 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.460
 without credit ipes again and again and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.469
 another 6 matches 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 I did not score a goal I had 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.219
 a lot of opportunities but I have not 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.829
 scored goal so the second death 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.940
 it's david luiz 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.000
 seventy-seven speeds or an hour 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.530
 of pause 80-74 not so simhd but two 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.299
 ski passes is really huge 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.689
 really for me I find it huge 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.030
 3400 very very good credit defender 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.770
 again so that makes it do 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.960
 still a long curfew of 14 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.729
 years is almost the end so we know 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.770
 very well the good players and the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.330
 players not good and makes him really 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.610
 part of the best defenders of the game 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.420
 simply the second already then do not 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.729
 you do not trust appearances 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.070
 boehner is really exceptional as 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.049
 it annoys me the battery level the 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.460
 early at the 83 speed 70 defense 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.369
 110 76 shots 127-109 not 4000 credit six 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.000
 matches 0 goal and two assists the very 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.560
 very very very good solid defender the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.780
 do not need to introduce it to you 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.720
 long time here is the first holder 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.000
 I read in the not gratos 13 matches 3 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.610
 goals 3 passes excuse me here's bound 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.729
 enough spot stocks is good so 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.090
 our first from the 1st mc plays at the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.670
 haye this novel 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.210
 it is of course de rossi trimmer so there 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.330
 will have regular matches 2 goals 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.680
 pappas of that will come this will come I'll 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.110
 especially taken for the defensive aspect 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.690
 like the other mc you will see who I 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.549
 speak and I think you know of 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.230
 many moss nobody knows 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.180
 so here's 2005 credit from also very 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:28.780
 very good so the first and me too 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.920
 but hey we're going to put that right yeah 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.940
 right now I know you when I 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.069
 will therefore make candreva low to 1800 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.190
 credit six games 5 goals 4 assists 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.989
 this is bad foot 4 technical gesture 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.340
 three stars what annoys me that 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.250
 annoys me but hey it will not stop 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.260
 eat well brakes costs like 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.920
 will decoudra like that it has me well it has 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.810
 helped from very low to 84 speed 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.150
 110-82 basic 80 frames is a very very 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.569
 good Italian player of course 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.870
 make a hell of a match against England 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.549
 then the rising m and emanuelson 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.639
 evolving at milan so it's six 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.940
 matches 5 goals 2 passes of a box 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.859
 yellow 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.959
 we do not care, here are three stars gesture 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.389
 technical three cars the whole world that 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.329
 poses a small problem but it is very 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.989
 very very very very very much so 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.730
 after I tell you what I have for 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.549
 this team 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.200
 why you should buy it already I 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.970
 you write I will briefly explain the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.739
 second mcc sail to the euro to do so 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.540
 we are going to do is just huge 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.769
 here it is just huge I have not 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.049
 scores a lot of goals in 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.590
 marks and that 2 out of 6 games what is 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.459
 not bad for 750 credit but 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.880
 look at these stocks 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.239
 here and stadiums super complete it's 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.579
 the gulli you know the great in a thousand times 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.350
 less heavy of course but if he 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.290
 makes a player think it's 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.550
 gullit who would be the people but hey he 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.870
 does not have the level of quality but it's 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.830
 just about the stadiums you 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.650
 are you going to understand then four to seven 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.360
 son speeds men is just huge 88-81 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.240
 dream 73-59 header 62 assists 49 6 matches 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.040
 8 goals 3 passes of the 17000 credit I the 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.990
 bought in kart hunters and 4 and a 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.000
 bad fold four technical gestures 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.770
 it's just a monster so I guess 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.680
 pantone as he must be huge 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.440
 it 's just going exceptional and original ebu 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.890
 doom winnezeele shower that even more 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.340
 huge to six games 11 goals 9 assists 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:30.040
 decisive 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:31.150
 here are 86 84 73 shots 64.84 triple to 4 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.600
 mobile looted four times gesture 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.320
 technical 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.360
 it's the best pe u know rare that 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.500
 I could just test it is 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.910
 just exceptional original giorgini 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.860
 doom is just huge 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.040
 so I took this terrible especially because 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.090
 that the match against against Spain 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.640
 the influenced I say I take a 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.130
 small Dutch team to see the 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.150
 kif and then that's okay what I 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.550
 can tell this team then the points 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.510
 positive is not positive excuse me 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.860
 it's that I never have I do not have 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.750
 lost again with this team and I 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.340
 win with many goals 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.340
 I not only win with two 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.310

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.450
 cost and it cost me thirty five 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:20.340
 thousand credit and of course I would like
