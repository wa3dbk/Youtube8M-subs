00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.029
 but until the football World Cup is still a lot of time and now is first 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.750
 ski-wm in garmisch-partenkirchen announced 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.790
 because you get really keen on a winter weekend even if the snow in the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.000
 Lowland as good as trail is in the mountains, conditions are still 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.390
 my colleague Moritz lang has snow-shoeing or tobogganing ideal for skiing 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.920
 the boards strapped to the roof and different ski areas for us 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.649
 tested 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.649
 first station specialization Schwalbe 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.670
 Utl snow 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.350
 best weather and pistes in all levels of difficulty 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.100
 The weekend did not get crowded in the Eurozone 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.590
 Clear that one of the instructors Münster but just during the week 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.570
 now it has been super 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.530
 that's what it said 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.360
 Since this year, two runs at the Spitzingsee are even easier to reach 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.840
 the old plate lift up to the Roßkopf was replaced by a modern chairlift 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.130
 replaced 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.080
 The new chairlifts bring a lot of wins and ten wins in ten points 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.270
 would 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.910
 Per cent the Varela would have been too expensive Sophos 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.400
 today we are getting up again 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.910
 to have been reported to have been called 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.400
 so wanted to reason 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 who distribute this 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.590
 BZ why 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.590
 when their doors 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.040
 and enjoy the sun 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.780
 After a short rest, it's off to the skis again 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.730
 for the young people then Spitzingsee also offered something 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.140
 there are just a few strong picture on the right 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.650
 Who skiing is not like the earthquake zone 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.000
 for example to the ball 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.930
 The journey takes just under 20 minutes 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.369
 IAA will be under pressure to rush through capital increase on the hype 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.730
 which wrote course and put on the helmet and later rowed one had 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.799
 because you think he thinks there are here 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.469
 brought in which are just there, according to BA "So hard is for defect 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.870
 clean many new for fun the Baltic Sea area stay the current 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.119
 Sale possible 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.269
 Cacau 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.879
 always a modern one gets well and likes 50 to 60 things on it 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.339
 in the future only with helmet 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.969
 Incidentally, a mobile snow-making system provides the right amount of snow 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.040
 the next destination 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.109
 the Ochsenkopf in Upper Franconia 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.879
 The second best but the best for families 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.549
 celebrate the small church and the big ones 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.539
 he will surely have fun too 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.539
 most questions learn skiing here 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.839
 but the adventure region Ochsenkopf has even more to offer 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.959
 a snowshoe hike through the snowy Upper Franconia is a real one 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.059
 Alternative to skiing 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.059
 You are outside and can enjoy the scenery 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:25.159
 When curling anyone can join in only one condition 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.859
 should have no back problems 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.859
 what you want to demonstrate 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:35.559
 Now, standing with a kick emphasizes the swing of the poor 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.089
 three four times 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:39.819
 and closing stops 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.229
 something like that 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.079
 if the little bit continue 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.079
 but it fits the leather and felt already 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.579
 not easy 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.919
 but the main thing is fun 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.159
 and with time you get the hang of it 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:58.420
 our last time 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.549
 the foghorn 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.549
 At the summit you have a breathtaking view 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.039
 Marquardt 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:08.099
 After all, the Nebelhorn is the most important area in the Allgäu 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.449
 from 2002 in Lathi about 20 meters this going on 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.349
 Points for the world ranking 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.209
 March of Switzerland 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.229
 District and have been threatened km 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.570
 both from the market yet flew Colonel Moussa Camara was 105 points 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.110
 can 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.779
 So the seven courses have traveled kilometers 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.479
 but next to it 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.479
 the state parliament has to 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:49.909
 At the middle station there is the so-called Entity Park 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.680
 Here everyone can let off steam who can not ski and still 

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:56.789
 sometimes feel like winter sports 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.840
 Cinema to drive because of vocabulary or Slovaks 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.840
 good 40 degrees the dangerous on as it is in reality 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.250
 yes since then went 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.210
 not so far 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.389
 He has them with a dime if it is going to the normal slope 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:11.449
 very easily 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.080
 Contains facts 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.199
 but the brake is much more important than driving curves though it seemed to be coming 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.409
 decided to temporally tilt 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.979
 Keeping your foot on the easter can be athletic 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.979
 Century off 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.759
 After a hard day in the snow you can spend the night in a fight 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.659
 spend special hotel 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.860
 Adventurers can sleep on the foghorn in the cloud 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.099
 Yes, people always want to experience something new for themselves 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.189
 Undercover boss and ideologically build in the sun just in winter 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:53.479
 stop - stay 5 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.569
 March, people are coming 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.569
 and how are they built or simply set stone on stone 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.430
 that does not work at the size you can imagine how 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.419
 a big balloon of those subordinates 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.150
 then in the end it is too early for her is behind her the air 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
 let out air balloon pulled out EU almost done 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.699
 to bring in the monastery to the minus 3 degrees 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.249
 be smart with the expedition and hot water bottle actually no problem 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.580
 If it gets too cold then you just have to get closer to each other in the KLU 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.750
 cuddling
