Lodge<00:00:50.450> dough<00:00:50.810> ball

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.189 

we're<00:01:00.440> able<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.800> immediately<00:01:01.219> get<00:01:01.489> that<00:01:01.730> out

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
we're able to immediately get that out

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.770 
we're able to immediately get that out
you<00:01:03.199> can<00:01:03.260> see<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:04.119> thickness<00:01:05.119> in<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.600> dough

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
you can see the thickness in the dough

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.230 
you can see the thickness in the dough
on<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:06.500> edge<00:01:06.650> versus<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.580> thinness<00:01:07.820> in<00:01:08.150> the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
on the edge versus the thinness in the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.200 
on the edge versus the thinness in the
middle<00:01:08.509> and<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:10.159> dough<00:01:10.340> is<00:01:10.369> still<00:01:10.909> cold

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
middle and the dough is still cold

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.359 
middle and the dough is still cold
there's<00:01:12.049> no<00:01:12.229> heat<00:01:12.470> involved<00:01:12.799> there's<00:01:13.190> no

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
there's no heat involved there's no

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.639 
there's no heat involved there's no
pressing<00:01:13.909> we're<00:01:14.540> actually<00:01:14.720> spinning<00:01:15.409> the

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
pressing we're actually spinning the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.730 
pressing we're actually spinning the
pizza<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:18.440> spiral<00:01:18.979> mixer<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.990> spiral<00:01:21.530> dough

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
pizza the spiral mixer the spiral dough

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.859 
pizza the spiral mixer the spiral dough
hook<00:01:22.009> spins<00:01:22.430> in<00:01:22.640> its<00:01:22.790> own<00:01:22.940> succumb<00:01:23.450> fferent

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
hook spins in its own succumb fferent

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.490 
hook spins in its own succumb fferent
so<00:01:24.500> we're<00:01:24.649> only<00:01:24.799> mixing<00:01:25.399> 10%<00:01:26.299> of<00:01:26.899> what's<00:01:27.289> in

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
so we're only mixing 10% of what's in

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.310 
so we're only mixing 10% of what's in
the<00:01:27.530> bowl<00:01:27.830> at<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.130> given<00:01:28.520> time<00:01:28.899> so<00:01:29.899> if<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.110> lift

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
the bowl at a given time so if I lift

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.040 
the bowl at a given time so if I lift
this<00:01:30.530> up

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
this up

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.260 
this up
in<00:01:32.320> that<00:01:32.560> you'll<00:01:32.860> see<00:01:33.070> that<00:01:33.250> spiraled<00:01:33.820> Olaf<00:01:34.120> in

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
in that you'll see that spiraled Olaf in

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.730 
in that you'll see that spiraled Olaf in
the<00:01:34.330> back<00:01:34.540> is<00:01:34.750> going<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.050> spin<00:01:35.350> in<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.560> back

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
the back is going to spin in the back

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.970 
the back is going to spin in the back
and<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.610> Lowell<00:01:36.820> rotates<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.690> product<00:01:38.170> into

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
and the Lowell rotates the product into

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.820 
and the Lowell rotates the product into
the<00:01:39.010> dough<00:01:39.280> hook<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:40.540> opposed<00:01:40.900> to<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.170> planetary

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
the dough hook as opposed to a planetary

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.670 
the dough hook as opposed to a planetary
over<00:01:42.220> here<00:01:45.000> where<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.480> planetary<00:01:47.140> is<00:01:47.290> moving

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
over here where the planetary is moving

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.210 
over here where the planetary is moving
is<00:01:47.860> basically<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.460> figure<00:01:48.970> 8<00:01:49.500> motion<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:51.040> it's

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
is basically a figure 8 motion and it's

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.310 
is basically a figure 8 motion and it's
moving<00:01:51.520> all<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.150> ingredients<00:01:52.840> around<00:01:52.960> the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
moving all the ingredients around the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.110 
moving all the ingredients around the
inside<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.920> hole<00:01:54.100> at<00:01:54.430> one<00:01:54.460> time<00:01:57.120> they're

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
inside the hole at one time they're

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.660 
inside the hole at one time they're
pleasantly<00:01:58.690> surprised<00:01:59.140> at<00:01:59.530> how<00:01:59.680> great<00:02:00.520> the

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
pleasantly surprised at how great the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.030 
pleasantly surprised at how great the
dough<00:02:00.880> comes<00:02:01.180> out<00:02:01.420> for<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.350> first<00:02:02.590> time<00:02:02.860> they

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
dough comes out for the first time they

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.590 
dough comes out for the first time they
see<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.370> done<00:02:03.550> in<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.760> spiral<00:02:04.090> versus<00:02:04.570> a

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
see it done in the spiral versus a

see it done in the spiral versus a
planetary<00:02:05.230> mixer

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
planetary mixer

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.040 
planetary mixer
it's<00:02:07.190> been<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.370> great<00:02:07.580> show

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
it's been a great show

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.700 
it's been a great show
we<00:02:10.010> are<00:02:10.190> coming<00:02:10.430> back
