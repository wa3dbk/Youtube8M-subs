gonna<00:01:37.790> make<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:38.180> flicker<00:01:38.480> on<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:38.870> off<00:01:39.140> on<00:01:39.440> and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
gonna make it flicker on and off on and

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.550 
gonna make it flicker on and off on and
off<00:01:39.680> on<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:39.980> off<00:01:40.220> on<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.550> off<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:42.080> be<00:01:42.170> honest<00:01:42.440> I

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
off on and off on and off to be honest I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.120 
off on and off on and off to be honest I
don't<00:01:42.650> know<00:01:42.890> why<00:01:43.070> but<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.760> does<00:01:43.940> um<00:01:44.950> what<00:01:45.950> this

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
don't know why but it does um what this

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:59.670 
don't know why but it does um what this
can<00:01:46.340> do<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:47.320> guess

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:39.190 

the<00:02:00.680> plan<00:02:00.860> noteblock<00:02:35.500> slower<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.770> down<00:02:38.200> cy

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
the plan noteblock slower that down cy

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.200 
the plan noteblock slower that down cy
volumes<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:41.380> friend<00:02:42.380> so<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.620> keep<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:43.010> up<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.280> 50

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.940 

so<00:02:47.210> I<00:02:47.240> guess<00:02:47.540> we<00:02:47.720> can<00:02:47.930> enjoy<00:02:48.230> an<00:02:48.410> annoyance

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
so I guess we can enjoy an annoyance

00:02:48.950 --> 00:03:00.610 
so I guess we can enjoy an annoyance
machine<00:02:49.460> with<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:58.720> okay<00:02:59.720> we<00:03:00.140> have<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.470> do

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
machine with this okay we have to do

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:23.080 
machine with this okay we have to do
every<00:03:00.920> too<00:03:05.620> honey<00:03:20.620> studies<00:03:21.620> like<00:03:22.459> OCD<00:03:22.940> or

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
every too honey studies like OCD or

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.780 
every too honey studies like OCD or
something<00:03:30.040> wish<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.160> was<00:03:31.310> doing<00:03:31.520> a<00:03:31.610> dual

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
something wish I was doing a dual

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.150 
something wish I was doing a dual
commentary<00:03:32.239> it's<00:03:32.750> really<00:03:32.900> easy<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.410> run<00:03:33.980> out

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
commentary it's really easy to run out

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.210 
commentary it's really easy to run out
of<00:03:34.190> ideas<00:03:37.840> now<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:39.410> be<00:03:39.530> honest<00:03:39.830> I<00:03:39.950> don't<00:03:40.010> know

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
of ideas now to be honest I don't know

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.440 
of ideas now to be honest I don't know
what<00:03:40.520> this<00:03:40.700> would<00:03:40.940> be<00:03:40.970> used<00:03:41.390> for<00:03:41.750> but<00:03:43.150> well<00:03:44.150> I

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450

a<00:03:55.010> bad<00:03:55.190> computer<00:03:55.550> back<00:03:55.850> then<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.709> it<00:03:57.709> was

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
a bad computer back then and it was

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.490 
a bad computer back then and it was
really<00:03:58.280> laggy<00:03:58.700> but<00:03:59.030> what<00:03:59.690> we<00:03:59.810> did<00:03:59.989> is<00:04:00.170> we<00:04:00.200> had<00:04:00.470> a

really laggy but what we did is we had a

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.880 
really laggy but what we did is we had a
whole<00:04:00.830> big<00:04:01.250> wall<00:04:01.489> and<00:04:01.760> then<00:04:02.390> we<00:04:02.570> had<00:04:02.890> switches

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
whole big wall and then we had switches

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.550 
whole big wall and then we had switches
along<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.460> walls<00:04:04.640> and<00:04:05.050> there'd<00:04:06.050> be<00:04:06.230> a<00:04:06.260> sign

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
along the walls and there'd be a sign

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.760 
along the walls and there'd be a sign
over<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:07.070> and<00:04:07.310> it's

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
over it and it's

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.350 
over it and it's
a<00:04:08.930> snare<00:04:09.930> drum<00:04:10.410> low<00:04:11.280> pitch<00:04:11.580> snare<00:04:11.970> drum<00:04:12.180> high

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
a snare drum low pitch snare drum high

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.330 
a snare drum low pitch snare drum high
pitch<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.780> we<00:04:13.500> have<00:04:13.770> like<00:04:13.950> all<00:04:14.190> the

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
pitch and we have like all the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.479 
pitch and we have like all the
instruments<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.650> behind<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.800> wall<00:04:16.980> like<00:04:17.340> the

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
instruments and behind the wall like the

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:24.200 
instruments and behind the wall like the
wall<00:04:17.670> would<00:04:17.820> be<00:04:18.000> like<00:04:18.890> right<00:04:19.890> here<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:23.250> you<00:04:23.310> see

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
wall would be like right here so you see

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.290 
wall would be like right here so you see
like<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.480> and<00:04:25.490> decide<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.640> be<00:04:26.790> right<00:04:27.030> there

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
like that and decide to be right there

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.390 
like that and decide to be right there
and<00:04:28.190> so<00:04:29.190> imagine<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:29.880> wall<00:04:30.090> all<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.390> way<00:04:30.660> down

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
and so imagine a wall all the way down

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.470 
and so imagine a wall all the way down
for<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.430> couple<00:04:32.700> a<00:04:33.120> long<00:04:33.660> time<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:36.090> was<00:04:36.270> like

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
for a couple a long time and it was like

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.530 
for a couple a long time and it was like
a<00:04:36.630> beat<00:04:36.930> maker<00:04:37.170> in<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.470> way<00:04:37.590> because<00:04:38.340> you'd<00:04:39.240> flip

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
a beat maker in a way because you'd flip

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.240 
a beat maker in a way because you'd flip
the<00:04:39.750> switch<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.260> register<00:04:40.620> repeater<00:04:40.980> would

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
the switch the register repeater would

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.950 
the switch the register repeater would
go<00:04:41.400> on<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:41.970> be<00:04:42.150> linked<00:04:42.390> to<00:04:42.540> a<00:04:42.570> note<00:04:42.810> block

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
go on and it be linked to a note block

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.470 
go on and it be linked to a note block
and<00:04:43.440> we<00:04:44.100> just<00:04:44.340> had<00:04:44.490> like<00:04:44.640> 13<00:04:45.150> runs<00:04:45.360> two

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
and we just had like 13 runs two

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.980 
and we just had like 13 runs two
repeaters<00:04:45.990> in<00:04:46.110> like<00:04:46.680> 13<00:04:47.580> note<00:04:48.120> blocks<00:04:48.420> and<00:04:48.780> all

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
repeaters in like 13 note blocks and all

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.740 
repeaters in like 13 note blocks and all
down<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.470> road<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.040> you<00:04:50.640> be<00:04:51.000> able<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.300> mix
