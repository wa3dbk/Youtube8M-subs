so you can count see here that is pretty

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.440 
so you can count see here that is pretty
nice<00:01:17.049> performance

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.010 

it's<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.320> amazing<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:24.080> well<00:01:26.540> usually<00:01:27.540> since

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
because I don't think that they

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.300 
because I don't think that they
constantly<00:01:36.780> optimize<00:01:37.319> the<00:01:37.499> game<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:38.100> your

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
