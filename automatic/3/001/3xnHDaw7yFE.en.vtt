help with muscle size and then we'll go

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.279 
help with muscle size and then we'll go
when<00:00:14.370> I'm<00:00:14.460> getting<00:00:14.580> into<00:00:14.820> shape<00:00:15.059> or<00:00:15.389> training

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289

number for bed and stuff help keep the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.910 
number for bed and stuff help keep the
liver<00:00:23.880> clean<00:00:24.210> kidney<00:00:24.630> clean<00:00:24.900> across<00:00:25.590> that

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
liver clean kidney clean across that

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.029 
liver clean kidney clean across that
better<00:00:26.630> immune<00:00:27.630> system<00:00:28.050> up<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.470> I'll<00:00:29.010> give

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
better immune system up and I'll give

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.710 
better immune system up and I'll give
you<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> run-through<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.820> taken<00:00:30.210> at<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> moment

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
you a run-through on taken at the moment

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.990 
you a run-through on taken at the moment
so<00:00:30.840> they<00:00:31.199> come<00:00:31.380> over<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.800> we'll<00:00:32.369> get<00:00:32.460> on

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
so they come over and we'll get on

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.569 
so they come over and we'll get on
through<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.860> basically<00:00:35.130> there's<00:00:35.399> lot<00:00:35.550> of

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
through so basically there's lot of

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.490 
through so basically there's lot of
genetics<00:00:36.090> mother<00:00:36.780> than<00:00:36.930> whey<00:00:37.050> protein

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
genetics mother than whey protein

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.590 
genetics mother than whey protein
isolate<00:00:37.680> check<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.820> I'll<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.090> 50<00:00:39.420> gram

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
isolate check so I'll have 50 gram

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.420 
isolate check so I'll have 50 gram
protein<00:00:39.840> shake<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> I'll<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.160> once

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
protein shake of that I'll have it once

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.500 
protein shake of that I'll have it once
a<00:00:41.550> day<00:00:41.719> it'll<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.500> off<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.920> weights<00:00:44.129> only

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
a day it'll be just off the weights only

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.069 
a day it'll be just off the weights only
so<00:00:45.510> i'll<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.980> with<00:00:47.300> some<00:00:48.300> moxie<00:00:48.510> load<00:00:48.870> i

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
so i'll have that with some moxie load i

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.889 
so i'll have that with some moxie load i
put<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.620> Scoob<00:00:49.980> maybe<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:50.370> 50<00:00:50.730> grams<00:00:51.000> with

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
put in one Scoob maybe out 50 grams with

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.160 
put in one Scoob maybe out 50 grams with
the<00:00:52.140> shape<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.620> lean<00:00:52.949> WPI<00:00:53.610> genetics<00:00:54.210> so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the shape of the lean WPI genetics so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
the shape of the lean WPI genetics so
they<00:00:55.350> keep<00:00:55.590> my<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.489> know<00:00:56.610> my<00:00:56.640> body<00:00:56.910> good<00:00:57.149> for

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
they keep my you know my body good for

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.229 
they keep my you know my body good for
after<00:00:57.690> training<00:00:58.010> then<00:00:59.010> an<00:00:59.160> hour<00:00:59.280> later<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.969> lot

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
after training then an hour later a lot

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.819 
after training then an hour later a lot
of<00:01:00.359> muscle<00:01:00.660> do<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.109> know<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> chicken<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
of muscle do you know the chicken and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.160 
of muscle do you know the chicken and
rice<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:03.449> happen<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> these<00:01:03.989> other

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
rice so this happen to these other

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
rice so this happen to these other
protein<00:01:04.589> powder<00:01:04.860> I'll<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
protein powder I'll going here is the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.120 
protein powder I'll going here is the
lean<00:01:06.180> way<00:01:06.360> such<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.229> same<00:01:07.439> way<00:01:07.680> protein

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
lean way such as the same way protein

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.300 
lean way such as the same way protein
powder<00:01:08.840> basically<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.229> only<00:01:10.439> anytime
