New<00:00:23.460> Holland<00:00:23.730> blue<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.960> also<00:00:25.170> got<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> front

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
New Holland blue it's also got the front

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.730 
New Holland blue it's also got the front
loader<00:00:25.980> attachment<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.599> also<00:00:27.810> got<00:00:28.500> this

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
cage which runs over the top obviously

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.870 
cage which runs over the top obviously
this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.590> because<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.430> forestry

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
this is because it's the forestry

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.870 
this is because it's the forestry
version<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:34.980> pull<00:00:35.219> forward<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.670> bit

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
version so if we just pull forward a bit

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.119 
version so if we just pull forward a bit
so<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.210> see<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> cage<00:00:36.630> better<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.980> can

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
so you can see the cage better you can

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.069 
so you can see the cage better you can
see<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.610> been<00:00:38.700> well<00:00:38.910> designed<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
see that it's been well designed and it

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.080 
see that it's been well designed and it
actually<00:00:40.230> surrounds<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.040> beacon<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.969> it

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
actually surrounds that beacon so it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.270 
actually surrounds that beacon so it
can't<00:00:42.300> get<00:00:42.450> damaged<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.590> also<00:00:43.739> covers<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
can't get damaged it also covers the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.090 
can't get damaged it also covers the
rear<00:00:44.520> window<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.180> also<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.590> lights<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
rear window and also the lights on the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.369 
rear window and also the lights on the
back<00:00:47.660> everything<00:00:48.660> else<00:00:48.899> around<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> front

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
back everything else around the front

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.619 
back everything else around the front
protective<00:00:49.890> or<00:00:50.070> lights<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.059> nothing<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.510> be

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
protective or lights so nothing can be

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
protective or lights so nothing can be
damaged<00:00:51.960> when<00:00:52.440> working<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:53.070> tight<00:00:53.309> areas<00:00:53.340> in

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
damaged when working in tight areas in

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.290 
damaged when working in tight areas in
