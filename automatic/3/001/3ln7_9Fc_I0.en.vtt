00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
put this in and we'll get even fatter or

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.940 
put this in and we'll get even fatter or
you<00:04:15.450> can<00:04:15.600> put<00:04:15.720> this<00:04:15.870> in<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.500> will<00:04:16.590> make<00:04:16.739> it

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
you can put this in and it will make it

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.060 
you can put this in and it will make it
have<00:04:17.790> that<00:04:18.030> like<00:04:18.269> spice<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:19.890> get

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
have that like spice to it that you get

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.110 
have that like spice to it that you get
from<00:04:20.479> from<00:04:21.680> pop<00:04:22.680> candy<00:04:22.979> which<00:04:23.310> kind<00:04:23.669> of<00:04:23.729> you

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
from from pop candy which kind of you

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.120 
from from pop candy which kind of you
know<00:04:24.180> pops<00:04:24.479> in<00:04:24.720> your<00:04:24.750> mouth<00:04:24.930> so<00:04:25.890> I'm<00:04:25.950> going<00:04:26.100> to

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
know pops in your mouth so I'm going to

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.370 
know pops in your mouth so I'm going to
just<00:04:26.280> first<00:04:26.550> make<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.330> bigger<00:04:27.750> first<00:04:28.140> with

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
just first make it bigger first with

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.300 
just first make it bigger first with
this<00:04:28.500> one<00:04:30.260> so<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.440> idea<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:31.919> this<00:04:32.130> is

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
this one so the idea is that this is

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.130 
this one so the idea is that this is
like<00:04:32.490> magic<00:04:32.700> by<00:04:33.120> just<00:04:33.330> adding<00:04:33.540> this<00:04:33.780> extra

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
like magic by just adding this extra

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.260 
like magic by just adding this extra
thing<00:04:34.380> in<00:04:34.530> here<00:04:34.800> it<00:04:35.010> gets<00:04:35.100> even<00:04:35.310> poufier<00:04:35.880> and

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
thing in here it gets even poufier and

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.540 
thing in here it gets even poufier and
oh<00:04:36.600> my<00:04:36.630> goodness<00:04:37.050> isn't<00:04:37.229> that<00:04:37.380> amazing<00:04:37.590> this

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
oh my goodness isn't that amazing this

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.090 
oh my goodness isn't that amazing this
kind<00:04:38.850> of<00:04:39.000> thing<00:04:39.060> here<00:04:39.650> when<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:40.740> do<00:04:40.890> this<00:04:41.040> you

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
kind of thing here when you do this you

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.130 
kind of thing here when you do this you
do<00:04:41.400> need<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.580> add<00:04:41.790> one<00:04:42.060> more<00:04:42.270> spoonful<00:04:42.900> of

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
do need to add one more spoonful of

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.290 
do need to add one more spoonful of
water<00:04:43.470> for<00:04:43.830> this<00:04:43.979> one<00:04:47.030> obviously<00:04:48.030> because<00:04:48.180> if

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
water for this one obviously because if

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.850 
water for this one obviously because if
you<00:04:48.390> don't<00:04:48.540> have<00:04:48.750> more<00:04:49.290> water<00:04:49.500> it's<00:04:49.710> just

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
you don't have more water it's just

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.180 
you don't have more water it's just
going<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.040> kind<00:04:50.250> of<00:04:50.280> be<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:51.169> little<00:04:52.169> weird

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
going to kind of be a little weird

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.940 
going to kind of be a little weird
but<00:04:53.940> if<00:04:54.030> we<00:04:54.180> mix<00:04:54.360> this<00:04:54.570> with<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:54.990> on<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.680> part

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
but if we mix this with it on this part

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.100 
but if we mix this with it on this part
can<00:04:56.040> get<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.220> little<00:04:56.370> tricky<00:04:56.550> because<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:58.020> know

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
can get a little tricky because you know

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.870 
can get a little tricky because you know
it<00:04:58.320> gets<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:59.010> a<00:04:59.040> point<00:04:59.070> where<00:04:59.280> it's<00:04:59.430> almost<00:04:59.670> a

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
it gets to a point where it's almost a

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.970 
it gets to a point where it's almost a
little<00:04:59.970> beyond<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:00.840> size<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.380> this<00:05:01.500> container

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
little beyond the size of this container

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.250 
little beyond the size of this container
so<00:05:02.460> it's<00:05:02.610> a<00:05:02.670> little<00:05:02.850> tricky<00:05:03.180> you<00:05:03.960> can<00:05:04.110> be<00:05:04.230> a

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
so it's a little tricky you can be a

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.930 
so it's a little tricky you can be a
little<00:05:04.440> frustrating<00:05:04.620> for<00:05:05.160> little<00:05:05.400> kids<00:05:05.580> maybe

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
little frustrating for little kids maybe

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.750 
little frustrating for little kids maybe
when<00:05:06.300> they're<00:05:06.420> doing<00:05:06.630> this<00:05:06.750> part<00:05:07.640> does<00:05:08.640> it

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
when they're doing this part does it

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.550 
when they're doing this part does it
does<00:05:08.880> get<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.090> little<00:05:09.240> messy<00:05:12.140> you<00:05:13.140> can<00:05:13.260> see<00:05:13.440> how
