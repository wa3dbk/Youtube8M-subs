thing so I think that's part about being
raped<00:03:30.560> there<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.219> first<00:03:31.489> few<00:03:31.670> years<00:03:31.700> we

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
didn't play really good enough maybe we

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.140 
didn't play really good enough maybe we
had<00:03:35.599> pretty<00:03:36.439> high<00:03:36.939> expectations<00:03:37.939> when<00:03:38.060> it

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
had pretty high expectations when it

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.520 
had pretty high expectations when it
came<00:03:38.269> over<00:03:38.599> and<00:03:38.750> we<00:03:39.019> didn't<00:03:39.200> feel<00:03:39.349> like<00:03:39.409> we

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.090 
Danny said we've been brought up by our
parents<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.150> our<00:04:20.299> older<00:04:21.260> brothers<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.739> you

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
parents and our older brothers that you

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.520 
parents and our older brothers that you
should<00:04:22.310> listen<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.940> coach<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.410> do<00:04:24.410> what

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
should listen to the coach and do what

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.760 
should listen to the coach and do what
the<00:04:24.650> coach<00:04:24.800> say<00:04:25.070> so<00:04:25.340> it<00:04:25.730> was<00:04:26.060> tough<00:04:26.240> but

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
the coach say so it was tough but

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.870 
the coach say so it was tough but
looking<00:04:27.770> back<00:04:27.890> I<00:04:27.920> think<00:04:28.070> it<00:04:28.400> was<00:04:28.640> a<00:04:28.670> great

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
looking back I think it was a great

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.170 
looking back I think it was a great
thing<00:04:29.060> for<00:04:29.270> us<00:04:29.360> because<00:04:29.540> he<00:04:30.700> made<00:04:31.700> him<00:04:31.880> realize

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
thing for us because he made him realize

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.970 
thing for us because he made him realize
the<00:04:32.390> way<00:04:32.540> we<00:04:32.900> wanted<00:04:33.230> to<00:04:33.290> be<00:04:33.380> a<00:04:33.410> bigger<00:04:33.620> part<00:04:33.830> of

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
the way we wanted to be a bigger part of

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.520 
the way we wanted to be a bigger part of
it<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:34.970> in<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.780> long<00:04:35.870> run<00:04:36.110> was<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.440> was

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
it and so in the long run was it was

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.060 
it and so in the long run was it was
really<00:04:36.770> good

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
really good

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.860 
really good
playing<00:04:37.580> in<00:04:37.670> a<00:04:37.730> candy<00:04:38.030> market<00:04:38.390> I<00:04:38.540> think<00:04:38.570> the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
playing in a candy market I think the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.420 
playing in a candy market I think the
media<00:04:39.110> almost<00:04:39.380> a<00:04:39.590> lot<00:04:39.740> of<00:04:39.830> times<00:04:40.040> are<00:04:40.220> trying

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
media almost a lot of times are trying

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.610 
media almost a lot of times are trying
to<00:04:40.550> find<00:04:40.960> something<00:04:41.960> when<00:04:42.140> I<00:04:42.200> got

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
to find something when I got

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.260 
to find something when I got
but<00:04:43.070> I<00:04:43.130> think<00:04:43.190> they're<00:04:43.550> really<00:04:43.580> taking<00:04:44.000> their

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
but I think they're really taking their

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.610 
but I think they're really taking their
game<00:04:44.420> to<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:45.560> next<00:04:45.590> level<00:04:45.920> and<00:04:47.500> it'll<00:04:48.500> be

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
game to the next level and it'll be

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.520 
game to the next level and it'll be
awful<00:04:48.800> hard<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.720> find<00:04:50.720> two<00:04:50.930> similar<00:04:51.260> players

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
awful hard to find two similar players

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.630 
awful hard to find two similar players
to<00:04:52.280> replace<00:04:52.610> them<00:04:52.820> they're<00:04:53.060> really<00:04:53.570> special

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
to replace them they're really special

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.850 
to replace them they're really special

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
it's hard to see that Canucks letting

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.650 
it's hard to see that Canucks letting
them<00:05:05.570> escape<00:05:05.690> as<00:05:06.220> UFAs<00:05:07.220> this<00:05:08.120> is<00:05:08.330> where<00:05:08.540> they

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
them escape as UFAs this is where they

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.040 
them escape as UFAs this is where they
want<00:05:08.930> to<00:05:09.020> stay<00:05:09.410> together<00:05:10.420> would<00:05:11.420> we<00:05:11.570> ever<00:05:11.750> see

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
want to stay together would we ever see

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.320 
want to stay together would we ever see
a<00:05:12.080> day<00:05:12.350> where<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.220> two<00:05:13.400> of<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:13.730> play<00:05:14.000> on

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
a day where the two of you play on

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.110 
a day where the two of you play on
different<00:05:14.810> teams

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
different teams

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.740 
different teams
I<00:05:17.240> think<00:05:17.960> that's<00:05:18.370> only<00:05:19.370> for<00:05:19.850> one<00:05:20.419> team<00:05:20.630> would

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
I think that's only for one team would

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.879 
I think that's only for one team would
want<00:05:21.169> us<00:05:21.290> separate<00:05:22.449> that's<00:05:23.449> I<00:05:23.780> mean<00:05:23.990> we<00:05:24.620> played

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
want us separate that's I mean we played

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.420 
want us separate that's I mean we played
together<00:05:25.040> for<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:25.490> long<00:05:25.520> now<00:05:25.850> so<00:05:26.030> I<00:05:26.090> think<00:05:27.430> I

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
together for so long now so I think I

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.360 
together for so long now so I think I
have<00:05:29.150> a<00:05:29.180> tough<00:05:29.389> time<00:05:29.570> so<00:05:29.720> you<00:05:29.810> know<00:05:30.100> yeah<00:05:31.100> same

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
have a tough time so you know yeah same

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.100 
have a tough time so you know yeah same
thing<00:05:31.400> I'm<00:05:31.790> every<00:05:32.060> we've<00:05:32.449> had<00:05:32.600> to<00:05:32.720> play

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
thing I'm every we've had to play

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.610

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
and which connects drafting us the way

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.010 
and which connects drafting us the way
they<00:05:40.130> did<00:05:40.310> and<00:05:40.600> through<00:05:41.600> a<00:05:41.660> lot<00:05:41.810> of<00:05:41.840> effort

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
they did and through a lot of effort

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.640 
they did and through a lot of effort
into<00:05:42.320> to<00:05:43.100> get<00:05:43.460> us<00:05:43.610> here<00:05:43.699> together<00:05:43.850> I<00:05:44.120> mean<00:05:44.300> it's

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
into to get us here together I mean it's

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.650 
into to get us here together I mean it's
we've<00:05:45.650> been<00:05:45.830> lucky<00:05:46.130> that<00:05:46.280> we<00:05:46.729> can<00:05:47.449> play

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
we've been lucky that we can play

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.680 
we've been lucky that we can play
together<00:05:47.990> for<00:05:48.199> this<00:05:48.440> long<00:05:48.500> and<00:05:49.300> just<00:05:50.300> beat<00:05:50.570> us

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
together for this long and just beat us

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.640 
together for this long and just beat us
off<00:05:50.810> now<00:05:50.840> I<00:05:50.990> don't<00:05:51.410> think<00:05:51.620> that<00:05:51.770> would<00:05:51.889> be<00:05:52.120> a

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
off now I don't think that would be a

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.889 
off now I don't think that would be a
good<00:05:54.650> idea
