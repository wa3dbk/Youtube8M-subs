basically I made these blue heeler shoes

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.499 
basically I made these blue heeler shoes
first<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.190> I<00:01:14.220> wanted<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.670> switch<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.090> black

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
first but I wanted to switch it to black

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.230 
first but I wanted to switch it to black
as<00:01:16.289> you<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.649> tell<00:01:16.920> these<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.460> homemade<00:01:17.940> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
as you can tell these are homemade I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.899 
as you can tell these are homemade I
only<00:01:18.630> use<00:01:18.899> duct<00:01:19.200> tape<00:01:19.369> but<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.460> doesn't<00:01:20.759> matter

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
only use duct tape but it doesn't matter

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.719 
only use duct tape but it doesn't matter
because<00:01:21.210> I'm<00:01:21.869> covering<00:01:22.800> it<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.369> top

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
because I'm covering it with the top

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.169 
because I'm covering it with the top
layer<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.030> lacy<00:01:24.569> fabric<00:01:25.289> so<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.550> part<00:01:26.940> I

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
layer of lacy fabric so on this part I

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.749

would<00:01:27.300> just<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.929> to<00:01:27.960> carefully<00:01:28.950> rip<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.580> old

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
