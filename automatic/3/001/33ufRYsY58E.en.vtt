00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.799
 we will need to degrease and work 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.799
 primer gander and gel itself 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.170
 naturally we have to pick up camouflage 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.130
 under the skin color of each client for this 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.869
 We zhyldar 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.960
 for this we can just mix two 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.510
 gel colors in different proportions mix 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.770
 up to the color you want to get 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.500
 I want the base more frost there to us 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.050
 This is quite a bit spoken for 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.940
 naturalness is the only thing that when we 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.719
 kneading it needs to be done in advance 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.329
 before building up because the process 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.800
 kneading 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:58.409
 supply air to form bubbles with 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.409
 sense where we can work
