any plans to that at all

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.819 
any plans to that at all
well<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.659> mean<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.780> did<00:02:00.990> think<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.380> putting<00:02:01.590> all

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
well I mean I did think of putting all

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.649 
well I mean I did think of putting all
the<00:02:01.860> all<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.520> articles<00:02:02.909> into<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> book<00:02:03.450> but

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the all the articles into a book but

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.850 
the all the articles into a book but
then<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> figure<00:02:04.259> well<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.500> they're<00:02:04.619> already

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
then I figure well if they're already

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.609 
then I figure well if they're already
posted<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.670> blog<00:02:05.869> then<00:02:06.869> people<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.469> go

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
posted on the blog then people can go

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.699 
posted on the blog then people can go
back<00:02:07.770> through<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:09.229> take<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> look<00:02:10.500> at

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
back through and just take a look at

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.820 
back through and just take a look at
them<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.069> then<00:02:11.160> very<00:02:11.760> long<00:02:12.150> sure

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
them and then very long sure

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.610

further<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.900> keep<00:03:46.800> an<00:03:46.950> eye<00:03:47.070> on<00:03:47.100> there<00:03:47.430> of

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
further and keep an eye on there of

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.160 
further and keep an eye on there of
course<00:03:47.790> as<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.150> do<00:03:48.270> updates<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:48.900> forth

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
course as you do updates and so forth

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.690 
course as you do updates and so forth
but<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.560> think<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.220> good<00:03:50.459> place<00:03:50.670> to

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
but I think this is a good place to

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.400 
but I think this is a good place to
begin<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.390> run<00:03:51.570> things<00:03:51.720> up<00:03:51.959> here<00:03:52.110> for<00:03:52.260> this

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.820 
with but then you're trying to break it
down<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.209> know<00:04:21.480> say<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:22.080> it's<00:04:22.560> it's

say that yes I and I grasp that it's it

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.620 
say that yes I and I grasp that it's it
is<00:04:43.860> it's<00:04:44.310> like<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.520> headful<00:04:45.000> thing<00:04:45.240> do<00:04:45.540> you

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
is it's like a headful thing do you

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.050 
is it's like a headful thing do you
think<00:04:45.870> whoa<00:04:46.290> what<00:04:47.190> what<00:04:47.430> you<00:04:47.640> know<00:04:47.760> I<00:04:47.790> mean<00:04:47.970> I

think whoa what what you know I mean I
got<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.390> in<00:04:49.350> there's<00:04:50.010> sections<00:04:50.460> there's

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
got that in there's sections there's

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.720 
got that in there's sections there's
sections<00:04:51.390> of<00:04:51.650> understanding<00:04:52.650> certain<00:04:52.890> areas

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
sections of understanding certain areas

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.540 
sections of understanding certain areas
but<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.720> truth<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.200> it's<00:04:55.590> become<00:04:56.100> it's<00:04:56.400> a

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
but the truth is it's become it's a

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.090 
but the truth is it's become it's a
whole<00:04:56.790> lot<00:04:57.030> simpler<00:04:57.420> now<00:04:57.720> than<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.740> used<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:59.040> be

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
whole lot simpler now than it used to be

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.250 
whole lot simpler now than it used to be
we<00:04:59.460> were<00:04:59.610> all<00:04:59.880> over<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.360> map<00:05:00.570> on<00:05:00.810> this<00:05:01.020> stuff

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
we were all over the map on this stuff

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.860 
we were all over the map on this stuff
and<00:05:01.440> now<00:05:01.919> we've<00:05:02.190> really<00:05:02.760> really<00:05:03.060> snugged<00:05:03.690> it

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
and now we've really really snugged it

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.650 
and now we've really really snugged it
up<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:04.919> anybody<00:05:05.490> who's<00:05:05.880> starting<00:05:06.480> out

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
up and so anybody who's starting out

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.780 
up and so anybody who's starting out
learning<00:05:07.380> this<00:05:07.650> stuff<00:05:07.830> now<00:05:08.250> is<00:05:08.490> actually

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
learning this stuff now is actually

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.790 
learning this stuff now is actually
going<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.210> have<00:05:09.330> a<00:05:09.360> much<00:05:09.780> easier<00:05:09.840> time<00:05:10.530> of<00:05:10.710> it

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
going to have a much easier time of it

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.130 
going to have a much easier time of it
than<00:05:11.220> we<00:05:11.460> ever<00:05:11.669> did<00:05:12.120> in<00:05:12.630> other<00:05:12.750> words<00:05:12.990> it's

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
than we ever did in other words it's

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.200 
than we ever did in other words it's
gotten<00:05:13.590> easier<00:05:13.830> because<00:05:14.310> we're<00:05:14.669> now<00:05:14.910> in<00:05:15.120> the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
gotten easier because we're now in the

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.610 
gotten easier because we're now in the
right<00:05:15.360> direction<00:05:15.570> and<00:05:16.020> we're<00:05:16.169> seeing<00:05:16.410> it

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
right direction and we're seeing it

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.280 
right direction and we're seeing it
we're<00:05:17.490> witnessing<00:05:17.760> results<00:05:18.630> so<00:05:18.840> we're<00:05:19.050> saying

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
we're witnessing results so we're saying
