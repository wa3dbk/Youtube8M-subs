hello welcome to another lego timelapse

hello welcome to another lego timelapse
build<00:00:03.030> this<00:00:03.689> time<00:00:03.990> I<00:00:04.290> am<00:00:04.410> building<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:05.040> custom

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
build this time I am building a custom

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.940 
build this time I am building a custom
set<00:00:05.670> based<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.600> Kestrel<00:00:07.500> from<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.770> game

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
set based on the Kestrel from the game

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.270 
set based on the Kestrel from the game
faster<00:00:08.400> than<00:00:08.519> light<00:00:08.780> now<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.809> love<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.800> game

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
faster than light now I love this game

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.770 
faster than light now I love this game
fell<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.610> love<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.000> first<00:00:12.540> time<00:00:12.719> I

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
fell in love with it the first time I

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.890 
fell in love with it the first time I
played<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:14.009> art<00:00:14.160> style<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.389> music

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
played it the art style and the music

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.800 
played it the art style and the music
and<00:00:16.230> just<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.859> gameplay<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.400> general<00:00:17.850> really

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
and just the gameplay in general really

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.599 
and just the gameplay in general really
really<00:00:19.199> good<00:00:19.410> it's<00:00:19.650> well<00:00:19.890> worth<00:00:20.130> checking<00:00:20.160> out

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
really good it's well worth checking out

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.120 
really good it's well worth checking out
if<00:00:20.670> you've<00:00:20.910> not<00:00:21.090> played<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.420> before<00:00:22.130> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
if you've not played it before the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.790 
if you've not played it before the
design<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> used<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.660> kind<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.960> based<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
design I used it kind of based on the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.509 
design I used it kind of based on the
kusu<00:00:26.490> submission<00:00:27.210> which<00:00:27.890> got<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> ten

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
kusu submission which got to the ten

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.099 
kusu submission which got to the ten
thousand<00:00:29.939> votes<00:00:30.119> level<00:00:30.510> but<00:00:30.689> was<00:00:30.810> turned<00:00:30.960> down

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
thousand votes level but was turned down

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.220 
thousand votes level but was turned down
by<00:00:31.560> Lego<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:33.149> whatever<00:00:33.300> reason<00:00:33.870> there's<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
by Lego for whatever reason there's a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.889 
by Lego for whatever reason there's a
few<00:00:34.649> angles<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> ship<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.880> now<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
few angles of the ship and now on to the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:01:15.850 
few angles of the ship and now on to the
time-lapse

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.890 

great<00:01:16.860> dumb<00:01:17.070> yeah<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.759> I'm<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.750> happy

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
great dumb yeah we are I'm really happy

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.660 
great dumb yeah we are I'm really happy
with<00:01:19.080> how<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.350> came<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:19.770> very<00:01:19.979> rarely<00:01:20.280> does

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
with how this came out very rarely does

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.820 
with how this came out very rarely does
a<00:01:20.990> something<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.110> trying<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.470> build<00:01:22.590> with

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
a something I'm trying to build with

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.880 
a something I'm trying to build with
Lego<00:01:23.040> turn<00:01:23.909> out<00:01:24.119> better<00:01:24.780> than<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.470> thought<00:01:25.710> it

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
Lego turn out better than I thought it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.820 
Lego turn out better than I thought it
would<00:01:26.720> obviously<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.020> can't<00:01:28.259> take<00:01:28.440> credit<00:01:28.649> for

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
would obviously I can't take credit for

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.149 
would obviously I can't take credit for
the<00:01:29.280> design<00:01:29.460> entirely<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.810> tweaked<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.890> couple

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the design entirely I tweaked a couple

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.779 
the design entirely I tweaked a couple
of<00:01:32.280> pieces<00:01:32.460> based<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.360> availability<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:35.070> made

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
of pieces based on availability and made

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.910 
of pieces based on availability and made
the<00:01:36.030> stand<00:01:36.509> which<00:01:36.750> required<00:01:37.229> no<00:01:37.320> creating

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the stand which required no creating

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.910 
the stand which required no creating
with<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.070> whatsoever<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.670> still<00:01:39.830> now<00:01:40.830> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
with you whatsoever but still now you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
with you whatsoever but still now you
may<00:01:41.039> have<00:01:41.130> noticed<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.819> I<00:01:41.970> built<00:01:42.270> two

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
may have noticed that I built two

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.389 
may have noticed that I built two
kestrels<00:01:43.080> that's<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:43.710> I'm<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.310> be

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
kestrels that's because I'm going to be

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.919 
kestrels that's because I'm going to be
giving<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.819> of<00:01:44.909> them<00:01:45.030> away<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.479> call<00:01:45.780> it

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
giving one of them away a call it

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.450 
giving one of them away a call it
shameless<00:01:46.500> self-promotion

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
