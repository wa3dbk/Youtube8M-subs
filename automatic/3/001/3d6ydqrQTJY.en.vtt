00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.529 
me so you don't want to make the same
mistake<00:01:55.009> twice<00:01:55.039> I'll<00:01:55.759> just<00:01:55.940> say<00:01:56.060> take<00:01:56.270> as<00:01:56.420> much

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
mistake twice I'll just say take as much

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.480 
mistake twice I'll just say take as much
time<00:01:56.600> as<00:01:56.810> possible<00:01:56.960> because<00:01:57.950> especially<00:01:58.220> for

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
time as possible because especially for

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.399 
time as possible because especially for
end<00:01:58.610> games<00:01:58.789> like<00:01:59.060> most<00:01:59.750> people<00:01:59.990> tend<00:02:00.110> not<00:02:00.229> to

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
end games like most people tend not to

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.100 
end games like most people tend not to
study<00:02:00.619> them<00:02:00.800> as<00:02:00.920> much<00:02:01.069> so<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.929> looks

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
study them as much so and it looks

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.059 
study them as much so and it looks
simple<00:02:03.289> because<00:02:03.679> there<00:02:03.830> aren't<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:04.009> many

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
simple because there aren't that many

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.279 
simple because there aren't that many
pieces<00:02:04.340> left<00:02:04.550> well<00:02:05.149> one<00:02:05.390> like<00:02:05.630> quick<00:02:05.840> mistaken

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
pieces left well one like quick mistaken

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.199 
pieces left well one like quick mistaken

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.199 
and pawn versus rook and then kind of go
backwards<00:02:24.140> from<00:02:24.290> there<00:02:24.379> add<00:02:25.220> more<00:02:25.550> complexity

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
backwards from there add more complexity

to go perspective play the position out

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.039

get<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> good<00:02:33.359> feel<00:02:33.599> for<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> way<00:02:33.989> you

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
get a good feel for the way you

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.989 
get a good feel for the way you
calculate<00:02:34.409> end<00:02:34.859> games<00:02:35.040> more<00:02:35.579> so<00:02:35.819> than

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:35.999 
calculate end games more so than

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.089 
calculate end games more so than
studying<00:02:36.590> with<00:02:37.590> visiting<00:02:37.920> all<00:02:38.010> the

studying with visiting all the

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.309 
studying with visiting all the

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
theoretical stuff try not to go down

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.739 
theoretical stuff try not to go down
material<00:02:40.889> that's<00:02:41.340> number<00:02:41.790> one<00:02:42.090> if<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.599> are

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:42.749 
material that's number one if you are

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:43.940 
material that's number one if you are
going<00:02:42.930> down<00:02:43.019> material<00:02:43.499> you<00:02:43.560> want<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.769> stick

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
going down material you want to stick

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.119 
going down material you want to stick
probably<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.430> reckoning<00:02:44.939> what<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.569> do<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:45.930> life

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
probably to reckoning what we do in life

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.899 
probably to reckoning what we do in life
echoes<00:02:47.129> in<00:02:47.340> eternity<00:02:47.659> at<00:02:48.659> my<00:02:48.870> signal<00:02:49.200> unleash

hell

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.369 

so<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:03.970> should<00:03:04.239> basically<00:03:04.420> just<00:03:04.810> quit<00:03:05.049> working

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
so I should basically just quit working

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.899 
so I should basically just quit working
on<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.590> openings<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.159> focus<00:03:06.489> on<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.730> end

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
on the openings and focus on the end

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.280 
on the openings and focus on the end
game<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.510> will<00:03:07.659> kind<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.930> give<00:03:08.140> me<00:03:08.260> a

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
game and that will kind of give me a

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.619 
game and that will kind of give me a
better<00:03:08.590> more<00:03:09.280> well-balanced<00:03:10.030> not<00:03:10.299> not

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
better more well-balanced not not

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.479 
better more well-balanced not not
exactly<00:03:10.989> I<00:03:11.440> don't<00:03:11.980> think<00:03:12.010> it's<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.250> good<00:03:12.280> idea

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
exactly I don't think it's a good idea

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.880 
exactly I don't think it's a good idea
just<00:03:12.700> quit<00:03:13.390> onion<00:03:13.690> on<00:03:13.900> your<00:03:14.260> openings<00:03:14.680> but

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
just quit onion on your openings but

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.130 
just quit onion on your openings but
it's<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.489> good<00:03:15.640> idea<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:16.000> focus<00:03:16.780> more<00:03:16.989> on<00:03:17.019> your

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
it's a good idea to focus more on your

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.490 
it's a good idea to focus more on your
end<00:03:17.319> game<00:03:17.500> um<00:03:18.599> but<00:03:19.599> you<00:03:19.840> do<00:03:20.019> have<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.200> work<00:03:20.379> on

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
end game um but you do have to work on

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.289 
end game um but you do have to work on
opening<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.950> little<00:03:21.040> bit<00:03:21.280> focus<00:03:21.760> more<00:03:21.940> negative

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
opening a little bit focus more negative

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.059 
opening a little bit focus more negative
I<00:03:22.510> think<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:22.989> totally<00:03:23.110> makes<00:03:23.379> sense<00:03:23.500> yeah<00:03:23.829> I'm

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
I think it totally makes sense yeah I'm

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.500 
I think it totally makes sense yeah I'm
so<00:03:24.250> this<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.489> silly<00:03:24.670> an<00:03:24.760> opening<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.209> know<00:03:25.329> yet

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
so this is silly an opening you know yet

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.690 
so this is silly an opening you know yet
the<00:03:25.540> Sicilian<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.379> gamers<00:03:26.650> finish<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:27.579> off

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
the Sicilian and gamers finish it off

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.300 
the Sicilian and gamers finish it off
early<00:03:28.060> exactly<00:03:28.599> you<00:03:28.750> might<00:03:28.870> as<00:03:28.959> well<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.860> can

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
early exactly you might as well I can

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.619 
early exactly you might as well I can
just<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.730> know<00:03:30.760> stop<00:03:31.090> working<00:03:31.450> on<00:03:31.510> the

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
just you know stop working on the

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.539 
just you know stop working on the
openings<00:03:32.049> just<00:03:32.319> focus<00:03:32.650> on<00:03:32.739> end<00:03:33.010> games<00:03:33.280> yeah

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
openings just focus on end games yeah

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.630 
openings just focus on end games yeah
well<00:03:33.849> at<00:03:33.910> least<00:03:33.940> I'll<00:03:34.269> finish<00:03:34.540> well<00:03:34.989> okay<00:03:35.799> he

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
well at least I'll finish well okay he

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.020 
well at least I'll finish well okay he
