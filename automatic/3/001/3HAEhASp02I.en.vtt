device<00:02:10.049> I<00:02:10.200> could<00:02:10.350> fit<00:02:10.470> into<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.799> holes<00:02:11.009> can

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
device I could fit into the holes can

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.910 
device I could fit into the holes can
just<00:02:11.730> adjust<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.750> right<00:02:12.989> there<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.440> you

just adjust that right there and you

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.470 
just adjust that right there and you
could<00:02:14.070> literally<00:02:14.370> do<00:02:14.579> that<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.910> between<00:02:15.030> songs

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480

this carve is extended it's cut very
deep<00:02:28.049> here<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.540> no<00:02:30.540> matter<00:02:30.720> how<00:02:30.989> big<00:02:31.170> your

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
deep here so that no matter how big your

deep here so that no matter how big your
hands<00:02:31.769> are<00:02:31.980> they<00:02:32.549> can<00:02:32.730> sort<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.060> fit<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.660> there

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
hands are they can sort of fit in there

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.390 
and the actual horn will never get in
the<00:02:36.570> way<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:37.019> as<00:02:37.380> far<00:02:37.620> as<00:02:37.650> switching<00:02:38.160> goes

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880 
the way of that as far as switching goes
I<00:02:38.760> really<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.390> split<00:02:39.840> sounds<00:02:40.109> and<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.680> like

I really like split sounds and I like
humbucker<00:02:41.310> sound<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:41.970> we<00:02:42.600> have<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> best<00:02:42.930> of

both here so one three and five are just

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.069 
both here so one three and five are just
what<00:02:46.049> you'd<00:02:46.200> expect<00:02:46.290> full<00:02:47.130> bridge<00:02:47.340> humbucker

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
humbuckers rather and just the neck but

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.449 
humbuckers rather and just the neck but
position<00:02:54.720> two<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.140> split<00:02:55.470> inner<00:02:55.739> coils<00:02:56.160> which

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
position two is split inner coils which

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.720 
position two is split inner coils which
gives<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:56.940> really<00:02:57.180> glassy<00:02:58.730> pristine

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.810 

and<00:03:06.810> for<00:03:07.810> split<00:03:08.590> outer<00:03:08.800> which<00:03:09.160> gives<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.520> kind

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
of like a base year and almost chime

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.940 
of like a base year and almost chime
you're<00:03:12.220> kind<00:03:12.490> of<00:03:12.640> tone<00:03:12.790> which<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.300> really<00:03:13.600> like

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
you're kind of tone which I really like

you're kind of tone which I really like
so<00:03:14.950> those<00:03:15.160> are<00:03:15.310> great<00:03:15.460> for<00:03:15.880> like<00:03:16.030> mid<00:03:16.690> gain<00:03:16.930> or

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
so those are great for like mid gain or

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.690 
so those are great for like mid gain or
clean<00:03:17.410> kind<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.800> sounds<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.430> really

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
clean kind of sounds that you really

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:27.150 
clean kind of sounds that you really
want<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:18.940> have<00:03:19.060> cut<00:03:19.390> through<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.930> mix

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.230 

and<00:03:27.370> finally<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.240> know<00:03:28.360> I'm<00:03:28.510> not<00:03:28.890> really<00:03:30.240> the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
and finally you know I'm not really the

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.900 
and finally you know I'm not really the
biggest<00:03:31.810> fan<00:03:31.990> of<00:03:32.020> tone<00:03:32.380> knobs<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.040> what<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:33.820> did

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
biggest fan of tone knobs so what I did

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.240 
biggest fan of tone knobs so what I did
was<00:03:34.150> actually<00:03:34.420> have<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.080> so<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:36.040> only

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
was actually have it so it only

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.190 
was actually have it so it only
activates<00:03:36.550> when<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.150> pull<00:03:37.330> up<00:03:37.360> on<00:03:37.630> this<00:03:37.840> pot

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
activates when you pull up on this pot

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.890 
activates when you pull up on this pot
right<00:03:38.410> here<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:39.610> otherwise<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:40.630> actually

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
right here and otherwise it actually

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.020 
right here and otherwise it actually
just<00:03:41.050> bypasses<00:03:41.710> it<00:03:41.860> so<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.460> can<00:03:42.580> lock<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.910> in

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
just bypasses it so you can lock it in

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.460 
just bypasses it so you can lock it in
at<00:03:43.150> whatever<00:03:43.330> setting<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:43.900> want<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.260> if<00:03:44.350> you

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
at whatever setting you want and if you

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.160 
at whatever setting you want and if you
need<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.860> just<00:03:45.100> recall<00:03:45.490> it<00:03:45.700> just<00:03:46.570> lift<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.050> up

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
need to just recall it just lift it up

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.050 
need to just recall it just lift it up
and<00:03:47.320> you<00:03:47.740> have<00:03:47.980> your<00:03:48.010> tone<00:03:48.370> knob<00:03:48.550> setting<00:03:48.880> and

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
and you have your tone knob setting and

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.580 
and you have your tone knob setting and
otherwise<00:03:49.420> it's<00:03:49.630> bypassed<00:03:50.080> so<00:03:50.260> just<00:03:50.470> go

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
otherwise it's bypassed so just go

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.990 
otherwise it's bypassed so just go
straight<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.040> volume<00:03:51.280> into<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.640> pickups

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
straight to the volume into the pickups

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.449 
straight to the volume into the pickups
which<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.330> kind<00:03:52.510> of<00:03:52.570> nice<00:03:52.720> got<00:03:53.350> a<00:03:53.380> maple<00:03:54.130> neck

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
sorts of fancy woods but the truth is

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.180 
sorts of fancy woods but the truth is

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
is extremely unforgiving on a guitar you

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.370 
is extremely unforgiving on a guitar you
need<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:10.000> go<00:04:10.090> with<00:04:10.239> stability<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.750> nothing

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380

particular model we have alder which is

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.710 
particular model we have alder which is

have an entirely basswood body which is

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.190 
have an entirely basswood body which is
one<00:04:29.860> of<00:04:29.890> my<00:04:30.040> favorite<00:04:30.490> tone<00:04:30.700> woods<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.960> have<00:04:32.080> on

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
one of my favorite tone woods to have on

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.110 
one of my favorite tone woods to have on
a<00:04:32.229> guitar<00:04:32.410> especially<00:04:32.680> for<00:04:33.160> my<00:04:33.460> style<00:04:33.669> music

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
a guitar especially for my style music

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.000 
a guitar especially for my style music
and<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.720> wanted<00:04:35.020> this<00:04:35.169> guitar<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.680> be<00:04:35.800> very

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
and I wanted this guitar to be very

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.280 
and I wanted this guitar to be very
pointy<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:37.000> was<00:04:37.120> very<00:04:37.300> important<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.080> you

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
pointy that was very important that you

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.290 
pointy that was very important that you
pointy<00:04:38.710> because<00:04:39.460> pointy<00:04:40.360> guitars<00:04:40.840> are<00:04:41.020> faster

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.780 

so<00:04:44.570> this<00:04:44.720> finish<00:04:45.020> is<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.230> amber<00:04:45.860> tiger<00:04:46.370> eye<00:04:46.400> on

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
so this finish is the amber tiger eye on

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.810 
so this finish is the amber tiger eye on
a<00:04:46.820> quilt<00:04:47.240> top<00:04:47.510> as<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.810> can<00:04:47.960> see<00:04:48.170> and<00:04:48.610> this<00:04:49.610> is

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
a quilt top as you can see and this is

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.990 
a quilt top as you can see and this is
sort<00:04:50.360> of<00:04:50.480> a<00:04:50.540> more<00:04:51.470> traditional<00:04:51.700> finish<00:04:52.700> if<00:04:52.850> you

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
sort of a more traditional finish if you

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.390 
sort of a more traditional finish if you
will<00:04:53.180> because<00:04:53.570> you<00:04:54.350> know<00:04:54.470> it's<00:04:54.920> one<00:04:55.160> of<00:04:55.280> those

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
will because you know it's one of those

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.640 
will because you know it's one of those
sort<00:04:55.850> of<00:04:55.910> crowd<00:04:56.300> pleasers<00:04:56.870> you<00:04:57.080> see<00:04:57.230> a<00:04:57.260> guitar

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
sort of crowd pleasers you see a guitar

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.370 
sort of crowd pleasers you see a guitar
with<00:04:57.950> this<00:04:58.070> kind<00:04:58.310> of<00:04:58.400> top<00:04:58.640> and<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.750> it<00:05:00.320> just

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
with this kind of top and and it just

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.280 
with this kind of top and and it just
it's<00:05:00.800> just<00:05:00.890> striking<00:05:01.640> but<00:05:02.570> in<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.900> way<00:05:03.050> that<00:05:03.260> I

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
it's just striking but in a way that I

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.410 
it's just striking but in a way that I
feel<00:05:03.560> like<00:05:03.770> won't<00:05:04.040> throw<00:05:04.400> a<00:05:04.430> lot<00:05:04.730> of<00:05:04.760> maybe

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
feel like won't throw a lot of maybe

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.330 
feel like won't throw a lot of maybe
even<00:05:05.540> more<00:05:05.870> old-school<00:05:06.230> people<00:05:06.830> off<00:05:07.010> it's<00:05:07.250> a

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
even more old-school people off it's a

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.600 
even more old-school people off it's a
very<00:05:07.520> classic<00:05:07.880> sort<00:05:08.390> of<00:05:08.540> look<00:05:08.920> and<00:05:09.920> it<00:05:10.370> really

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
very classic sort of look and it really

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.800 
very classic sort of look and it really
suits<00:05:10.940> this<00:05:11.240> this<00:05:11.900> design<00:05:12.350> very<00:05:12.710> nicely

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
suits this this design very nicely

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.150 
suits this this design very nicely
especially<00:05:14.810> with<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.200> black<00:05:15.500> hardware<00:05:15.890> and

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
especially with the black hardware and

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.970 
especially with the black hardware and
pickups<00:05:16.580> I<00:05:16.760> think<00:05:16.940> it's<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.150> nice<00:05:17.300> contrast<00:05:17.980> but

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
pickups I think it's a nice contrast but

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:25.820 
pickups I think it's a nice contrast but
we<00:05:19.100> have<00:05:19.250> more<00:05:19.460> adventurous<00:05:19.910> colors<00:05:20.330> as<00:05:20.480> well

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
kind of based off of a BMW blue that I

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.869 
kind of based off of a BMW blue that I
love<00:05:45.090> called<00:05:45.419> Laguna<00:05:46.229> Seca<00:05:46.379> blue<00:05:46.710> it<00:05:46.919> has<00:05:47.159> this

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
love called Laguna Seca blue it has this

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.149 
love called Laguna Seca blue it has this
matte<00:05:48.120> finish<00:05:48.479> with<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:48.960> slight<00:05:49.349> bit<00:05:49.620> of<00:05:49.680> pearl

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
matte finish with a slight bit of pearl

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.520 
matte finish with a slight bit of pearl
essence<00:05:50.580> or<00:05:50.819> shininess<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.690> it<00:05:51.840> which<00:05:52.349> I<00:05:52.470> think

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
essence or shininess to it which I think

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.469 
essence or shininess to it which I think
really<00:05:52.860> adds<00:05:53.039> a<00:05:53.250> lot<00:05:53.280> you<00:05:53.759> know<00:05:53.879> makes<00:05:54.270> a

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
really adds a lot you know makes a

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.540 
really adds a lot you know makes a
finish<00:05:55.379> move<00:05:55.650> a<00:05:55.770> little<00:05:55.949> bit<00:05:56.099> in<00:05:56.159> the<00:05:56.370> light

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
finish move a little bit in the light

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.770 
finish move a little bit in the light
and<00:05:56.729> this<00:05:57.240> is<00:05:57.560> probably<00:05:59.629> philosophically<00:06:00.629> the

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
and this is probably philosophically the

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.529 
and this is probably philosophically the
opposite<00:06:01.409> of<00:06:01.530> that<00:06:01.710> brown<00:06:02.610> one<00:06:02.639> in<00:06:03.090> that<00:06:03.389> this

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
opposite of that brown one in that this

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.869 
opposite of that brown one in that this
is<00:06:03.690> exactly<00:06:04.430> self-indulgence<00:06:05.430> and<00:06:05.610> nothing

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:05.879 
is exactly self-indulgence and nothing

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:07.550 
is exactly self-indulgence and nothing
else<00:06:06.060> and<00:06:06.270> not<00:06:06.449> really<00:06:06.750> about<00:06:06.840> crowd-pleasing

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
else and not really about crowd-pleasing

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.529 
else and not really about crowd-pleasing
but<00:06:07.919> I<00:06:08.129> just<00:06:08.580> needed<00:06:08.819> to<00:06:08.940> have<00:06:09.060> a<00:06:09.120> very<00:06:09.449> very

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
but I just needed to have a very very

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:12.740 
but I just needed to have a very very
very<00:06:09.990> blue<00:06:10.289> guitar<00:06:10.610> this<00:06:11.610> is<00:06:11.819> the<00:06:12.000> premium<00:06:12.479> top

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
very blue guitar this is the premium top

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.779 
very blue guitar this is the premium top
model<00:06:13.110> that<00:06:13.379> is<00:06:13.530> more<00:06:13.889> indulgent<00:06:14.219> than<00:06:14.639> the

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
model that is more indulgent than the

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:16.490 
model that is more indulgent than the
crowd-pleaser<00:06:15.509> but<00:06:15.870> I<00:06:15.900> actually<00:06:16.080> think<00:06:16.379> that

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
crowd-pleaser but I actually think that

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.439 
crowd-pleaser but I actually think that
this<00:06:16.680> one<00:06:16.919> will<00:06:17.639> probably<00:06:17.789> please<00:06:18.150> a<00:06:18.180> lot<00:06:18.389> of
