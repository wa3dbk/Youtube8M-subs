00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.249 

to<00:00:02.719> me<00:00:03.160> single<00:00:04.160> stroke<00:00:04.490> roll<00:00:04.790> goes<00:00:05.750> through<00:00:06.049> a

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
to me single stroke roll goes through a

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.939 
to me single stroke roll goes through a
you<00:00:06.890> know<00:00:07.009> a<00:00:07.040> procedure<00:00:07.910> where<00:00:08.750> I<00:00:08.780> use<00:00:09.020> three

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:09.949 
you know a procedure where I use three

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.560 
you know a procedure where I use three
gears<00:00:10.549> first<00:00:11.240> of<00:00:11.389> all<00:00:11.510> I<00:00:11.719> always<00:00:12.139> use<00:00:12.500> rebound

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
gears first of all I always use rebound

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.109 
gears first of all I always use rebound
no<00:00:14.570> matter<00:00:14.779> what<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:15.500> speed<00:00:15.770> is<00:00:15.970> well<00:00:16.970> then

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
no matter what the speed is well then

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.670 
no matter what the speed is well then
what<00:00:17.300> I<00:00:17.330> mean<00:00:17.570> is<00:00:17.720> that<00:00:17.900> when<00:00:18.110> I<00:00:18.140> start<00:00:18.440> very

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
what I mean is that when I start very

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.090 
what I mean is that when I start very
slow<00:00:18.980> i<00:00:21.430> play<00:00:22.430> full<00:00:23.090> strokes<00:00:23.480> which<00:00:24.050> are<00:00:24.289> the

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
slow i play full strokes which are the

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.500 
slow i play full strokes which are the
full<00:00:25.310> stroke<00:00:25.490> is<00:00:25.640> a<00:00:25.700> struggle<00:00:26.000> to<00:00:26.090> start<00:00:26.390> from

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
full stroke is a struggle to start from

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.900 
full stroke is a struggle to start from
the<00:00:26.630> top<00:00:26.830> from<00:00:27.830> a<00:00:27.980> high<00:00:28.130> position<00:00:28.610> and<00:00:28.730> goes

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
the top from a high position and goes

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.790 
the top from a high position and goes
back<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:29.330> a<00:00:29.360> high<00:00:29.539> position<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.230> when<00:00:30.619> I<00:00:30.650> do

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
back to a high position and when I do

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.080 
back to a high position and when I do
this<00:00:31.070> I<00:00:31.310> use<00:00:31.940> The<00:00:32.419> Awl<00:00:32.710> technique<00:00:33.710> of<00:00:34.090> catching

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
this I use The Awl technique of catching

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.200 
this I use The Awl technique of catching
the<00:00:35.180> bounce<00:00:35.420> that<00:00:36.670> everybody<00:00:37.670> talks<00:00:37.940> about

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
the bounce that everybody talks about

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.310 
the bounce that everybody talks about
and<00:00:39.880> you<00:00:40.880> know<00:00:40.970> that<00:00:41.180> formula<00:00:41.630> calls<00:00:41.930> of<00:00:42.140> this

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
and you know that formula calls of this

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.620 
and you know that formula calls of this
technique<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.890> free<00:00:43.130> stroke<00:00:43.460> that's<00:00:44.329> a<00:00:44.480> way

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
technique the free stroke that's a way

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.330 
technique the free stroke that's a way
to<00:00:44.690> call<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.110> I'll<00:00:45.290> stop<00:00:45.620> at<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:45.890> top<00:00:46.100> that's

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
to call it I'll stop at the top that's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.020 
to call it I'll stop at the top that's
another<00:00:46.610> way<00:00:47.050> and<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:49.040> I<00:00:49.100> said<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.579> rebound<00:00:49.880> of

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
another way and so I said the rebound of

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.639 
another way and so I said the rebound of
the<00:00:50.120> stick<00:00:50.329> can<00:00:50.540> follow<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:51.020> basically<00:00:51.410> I

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
the stick can follow it basically I

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.010 
the stick can follow it basically I
don't<00:00:51.829> do<00:00:51.980> one<00:00:52.399> to<00:00:52.850> two<00:00:53.059> motions<00:00:53.450> but<00:00:53.600> only<00:00:53.780> one

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
don't do one to two motions but only one

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.069 
don't do one to two motions but only one
motion<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:55.640> this<00:00:55.790> is<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.480> first<00:00:56.780> gear<00:00:57.260> for<00:00:57.620> me

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
motion and this is the first gear for me

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.559 
motion and this is the first gear for me
if<00:01:00.079> I<00:01:00.230> go<00:01:00.379> a<00:01:00.410> little<00:01:00.500> faster<00:01:01.190> gradually<00:01:04.569> you

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:05.569 
if I go a little faster gradually you

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:09.370 
if I go a little faster gradually you
know<00:01:05.600> always<00:01:07.149> catching<00:01:08.149> the<00:01:08.240> bounce<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:08.929> I'm

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
know always catching the bounce and I'm

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.120 
know always catching the bounce and I'm
sitting<00:01:09.709> the<00:01:09.829> free<00:01:10.069> stroke<00:01:10.369> range<00:01:10.729> or<00:01:11.389> rate

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.840 

now<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.159> can<00:01:16.579> do<00:01:16.759> shift<00:01:17.689> into<00:01:18.109> second<00:01:18.529> here

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
now I can do shift into second here

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.340 
now I can do shift into second here
which<00:01:19.850> is<00:01:20.029> always<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.389> free<00:01:20.719> stroke<00:01:20.990> but<00:01:21.229> the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
which is always a free stroke but the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.469 
which is always a free stroke but the
main<00:01:21.529> difference<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:22.279> when<00:01:22.939> I<00:01:23.060> got<00:01:23.240> really

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
main difference that when I got really

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.949 
main difference that when I got really
slow<00:01:24.789> the<00:01:25.789> stick<00:01:25.999> is<00:01:26.149> not<00:01:26.179> always<00:01:26.479> emotional

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
slow the stick is not always emotional

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.529 
slow the stick is not always emotional
and<00:01:27.469> I<00:01:27.529> can't<00:01:27.770> do<00:01:28.429> this<00:01:28.579> just<00:01:28.909> again<00:01:29.179> I<00:01:29.299> have<00:01:29.420> to

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
and I can't do this just again I have to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.959 
and I can't do this just again I have to
stop<00:01:29.779> the<00:01:29.929> stick<00:01:30.139> but<00:01:30.380> when<00:01:30.529> I<00:01:30.729> shift<00:01:31.729> to<00:01:31.849> the

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
stop the stick but when I shift to the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.879 
stop the stick but when I shift to the
second<00:01:32.329> gear<00:01:32.509> of<00:01:32.749> like<00:01:33.229> medium<00:01:33.679> speed<00:01:35.770> just<00:01:36.770> a

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:36.889 
second gear of like medium speed just a

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:39.190 
second gear of like medium speed just a
spin<00:01:37.130> where<00:01:37.310> we<00:01:37.429> would<00:01:37.700> they<00:01:37.849> we<00:01:38.029> use<00:01:38.719> most<00:01:39.049> of

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
spin where we would they we use most of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.819 
spin where we would they we use most of
the<00:01:39.289> time<00:01:40.840> I'm<00:01:41.840> doing<00:01:42.109> the<00:01:42.229> same<00:01:42.380> thing<00:01:42.439> but

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
the time I'm doing the same thing but

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.559 
the time I'm doing the same thing but
now<00:01:42.979> this<00:01:43.189> stick<00:01:43.429> is<00:01:43.579> always<00:01:43.849> emotional<00:01:44.149> and

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
now this stick is always emotional and

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.599 
now this stick is always emotional and
that's<00:01:44.749> this<00:01:45.139> is<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:46.009> know<00:01:46.130> what<00:01:46.310> they<00:01:46.429> call

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
that's this is you know what they call

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.309 
that's this is you know what they call
bouncing<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.299> ball<00:01:47.479> because<00:01:47.779> it's<00:01:47.959> just<00:01:48.139> it

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
bouncing the ball because it's just it

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:57.219 
bouncing the ball because it's just it
feels<00:01:48.349> like<00:01:48.709> bouncing<00:01:49.159> oh<00:01:49.539> this<00:01:50.539> is<00:01:50.719> the

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.359 

ok<00:01:58.219> when<00:01:58.430> I<00:01:58.460> envision<00:01:59.030> new<00:01:59.780> students<00:02:00.350> most<00:02:01.219> of

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
ok when I envision new students most of

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.499 
ok when I envision new students most of
the<00:02:01.490> times<00:02:01.729> they<00:02:02.509> do<00:02:02.570> this<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:04.909> they<00:02:05.090> say<00:02:05.119> I

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
the times they do this and they say I

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.149 
the times they do this and they say I
can<00:02:05.810> go<00:02:05.929> any<00:02:06.110> faster<00:02:06.439> than<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.740> that's<00:02:07.009> a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
can go any faster than this that's a

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.680 
can go any faster than this that's a
reason<00:02:07.490> because<00:02:07.640> they<00:02:07.909> don't<00:02:08.119> know<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.269> shift

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
reason because they don't know to shift

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.250 
reason because they don't know to shift
to<00:02:08.869> third<00:02:09.259> gear<00:02:09.619> which<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.989> same

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
to third gear which is the same

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.970 
to third gear which is the same
technique<00:02:12.769> of<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.910> stick<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:17.810> when<00:02:18.739> you<00:02:18.830> go

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
technique of the stick but when you go

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.460 
technique of the stick but when you go
you're<00:02:19.790> trying<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.180> go<00:02:20.300> real<00:02:20.480> fast<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.170> cannot

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
you're trying to go real fast you cannot

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.110 
you're trying to go real fast you cannot
use<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.830> hand<00:02:22.069> anymore<00:02:22.459> it's<00:02:22.760> too<00:02:22.940> much

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
use the hand anymore it's too much

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.539 
use the hand anymore it's too much
motions<00:02:23.569> too<00:02:23.720> much<00:02:23.870> body<00:02:24.440> involved<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.519> you

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
motions too much body involved so you

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.880 
motions too much body involved so you
have<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:25.970> shift<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:28.459> smaller<00:02:28.819> muscles<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:30.410> you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
have to shift to smaller muscles and you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.210 
have to shift to smaller muscles and you
use<00:02:31.069> finger<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.269> same<00:02:32.450> thing<00:02:32.720> but

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
use finger so it's the same thing but

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.420 
use finger so it's the same thing but
just<00:02:34.299> less<00:02:35.299> body<00:02:35.630> involved<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.950> do<00:02:37.190> this

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
just less body involved and to do this

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.069 
just less body involved and to do this
action<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:37.940> not<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.269> difficult<00:02:38.480> when<00:02:38.959> you

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
action is not that difficult when you

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.380 
action is not that difficult when you
learn<00:02:39.290> how<00:02:40.099> to<00:02:40.130> balance<00:02:40.549> this<00:02:40.849> thing<00:02:41.090> because

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
learn how to balance this thing because

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.420 
learn how to balance this thing because
all<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.660> do<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.870> this<00:02:44.980> doesn't<00:02:45.980> take<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.310> genius

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
all you do is this doesn't take a genius

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.490 
all you do is this doesn't take a genius
to<00:02:46.790> do<00:02:47.030> this<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.810> go<00:02:47.959> back<00:02:49.959> start<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.200> you

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
to do this so go back start that you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.880 
to do this so go back start that you
know<00:02:51.620> chalk<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.190> steep<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:54.230> always<00:02:54.709> side

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
know chalk in the steep and always side

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.530 
know chalk in the steep and always side
them<00:02:55.040> hitting<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.819> breaks<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:57.549> can<00:02:58.549> get<00:02:59.120> alert

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
them hitting the breaks I can get alert

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:10.120 
them hitting the breaks I can get alert
push<00:03:00.349> appears<00:03:00.890> backward<00:03:08.200> in<00:03:09.200> order<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.769> have<00:03:09.920> a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
push appears backward in order to have a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.190 
push appears backward in order to have a
smooth<00:03:10.609> transition<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.600> means<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.019> you

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
smooth transition so that means that you

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.500 
smooth transition so that means that you
learn<00:03:12.410> to<00:03:12.709> never<00:03:13.400> chop<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.030> stick<00:03:14.269> when<00:03:14.420> you

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
learn to never chop the stick when you

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.840 
learn to never chop the stick when you
play<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.780> never<00:03:15.139> do<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:15.739> but<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.400> always<00:03:16.730> you

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
play to never do this but is always you

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.490 
play to never do this but is always you
always<00:03:16.880> catching<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.569> bounce<00:03:17.810> first<00:03:18.170> load<00:03:18.380> to

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
always catching the bounce first load to

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.610 
always catching the bounce first load to
face<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.480> more<00:03:20.480> difficult<00:03:21.019> yet<00:03:21.230> back<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:21.889> slow

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
face and more difficult yet back to slow

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:48.339 
face and more difficult yet back to slow

what<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:57.170> second<00:03:58.170> year<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.410> I'm<00:03:58.590> using<00:03:58.800> my

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
what the second year so I'm using my

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.230 
what the second year so I'm using my
handle<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.730> board's<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.150> can<00:04:00.330> tell<00:04:00.569> I

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
handle of the board's you can tell I

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.720 
handle of the board's you can tell I
always<00:04:03.240> catch<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.480> bounce<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:05.280> go<00:04:05.459> back<00:04:05.670> to

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
always catch the bounce and I go back to

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.480 
always catch the bounce and I go back to
the<00:04:06.000> free<00:04:06.180> stroke
