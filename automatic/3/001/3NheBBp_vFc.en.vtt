backbeat what I mean by that is say we

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.230 
backbeat what I mean by that is say we
have<00:01:46.020> our<00:01:46.170> typical<00:01:46.740> straight<00:01:47.280> ahead<00:01:47.399> rock

no instead of it landing right on the
sea<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.649> put<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> head<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.840> ah<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:05.570> that

sea we put a head on the ah of one that

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:17.050 
sea we put a head on the ah of one that
would<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:06.810> an<00:02:06.869> anticipated<00:02:07.409> back<00:02:07.679> beats<00:02:07.950> us<00:02:15.769> to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
would be an anticipated back beats us to

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.470 
would be an anticipated back beats us to
the<00:02:18.060> end<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.959> what's<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.739> four<00:02:20.360> that's<00:02:21.360> a

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
the end of what's a four that's a

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:34.430 
the end of what's a four that's a
delayed<00:02:21.780> backbeat<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:32.060> some<00:02:33.060> some<00:02:34.049> ways<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
delayed backbeat so some some ways to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.479 
delayed backbeat so some some ways to
use<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.920> concept<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.790> guess<00:02:35.970> would<00:02:36.959> be<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:38.040> long

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
use that concept I guess would be a long

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.759 
use that concept I guess would be a long
example<00:02:38.910> front<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.180> our<00:02:39.329> own<00:02:39.510> songs<00:02:40.019> on<00:02:40.620> our
