00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
the reason being is because the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.470 
the reason being is because the
cornerback<00:03:37.550> took<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.700> spate<00:03:38.940> or<00:03:39.090> took<00:03:39.330> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
cornerback took the spate or took the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.120 
cornerback took the spate or took the
linemen<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.440> defensive<00:03:40.860> end<00:03:40.950> would

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
linemen that the defensive end would

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.470 
linemen that the defensive end would
have<00:03:41.250> been<00:03:41.459> on<00:03:41.700> if<00:03:41.910> he<00:03:42.120> wasn't<00:03:42.450> blitzing<00:03:42.840> now

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
have been on if he wasn't blitzing now

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.620 
have been on if he wasn't blitzing now
the<00:03:45.480> only<00:03:45.600> thing<00:03:45.750> about<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:46.590> formation<00:03:47.100> is<00:03:47.400> a

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
the only thing about this formation is a

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.570 
the only thing about this formation is a
the<00:03:48.630> run<00:03:49.200> defense<00:03:49.410> now<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.100> isn't<00:03:50.310> an

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
the run defense now this isn't an

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.540 
the run defense now this isn't an
every-down<00:03:51.239> kind<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.260> defense<00:03:52.620> at<00:03:52.890> all<00:03:52.920> this

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
every-down kind of defense at all this

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.949 
every-down kind of defense at all this
is<00:03:53.700> not<00:03:53.730> what<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.060> run<00:03:54.269> every<00:03:54.480> single<00:03:54.840> down

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
is not what you run every single down

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.170 
is not what you run every single down
this<00:03:55.140> is<00:03:55.320> like<00:03:55.530> when<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.430> know<00:03:56.640> your<00:03:56.910> opponent

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
this is like when you know your opponent

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.000 
this is like when you know your opponent
is<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.450> pass-heavy<00:03:57.930> kind<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.350> do<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.830> want

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
is a pass-heavy kind of do and you want

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.400 
is a pass-heavy kind of do and you want
to<00:03:59.100> send<00:03:59.250> pressure<00:03:59.550> at<00:03:59.790> them<00:03:59.989> but<00:04:00.989> as<00:04:01.140> far<00:04:01.350> as

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
to send pressure at them but as far as

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.590 
to send pressure at them but as far as
one<00:04:01.709> defense<00:04:02.040> goes<00:04:02.250> someone<00:04:02.730> then<00:04:02.910> be<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> b-cup

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
one defense goes someone then be a b-cup

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.449 
one defense goes someone then be a b-cup
an<00:04:03.780> edgy<00:04:03.930> but<00:04:04.290> as<00:04:04.410> far<00:04:04.560> as<00:04:04.620> run<00:04:04.890> defense<00:04:05.220> goes

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
an edgy but as far as run defense goes

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.610 
an edgy but as far as run defense goes
also<00:04:06.000> one<00:04:06.480> would<00:04:06.600> do<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.900> just<00:04:07.080> run<00:04:07.260> oh<00:04:07.440> one

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
also one would do is just run oh one

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.680 
also one would do is just run oh one
trap<00:04:07.860> where<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.160> are<00:04:08.340> inside<00:04:08.670> zone<00:04:09.000> but<00:04:09.600> this

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
trap where you are inside zone but this

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.970 
trap where you are inside zone but this
is<00:04:09.810> something<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.049> you<00:04:10.230> pull<00:04:10.440> out<00:04:10.470> on<00:04:10.769> like<00:04:10.950> a

second and long or third and long or

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.650 
second and long or third and long or
fourth<00:04:14.280> down<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:14.880> can<00:04:15.060> send<00:04:15.299> he<00:04:15.510> time

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
fourth down so you can send he time

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.360 
fourth down so you can send he time
listen<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.109> something<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:17.040> run<00:04:17.220> every

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
single now you will get ate up every

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.920 
single now you will get ate up every
single<00:04:19.709> down<00:04:20.130> but<00:04:21.090> we<00:04:21.239> will<00:04:21.419> be<00:04:21.450> bringing<00:04:21.720> you

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.340 
single down but we will be bringing you
guys<00:04:22.109> run<00:04:22.860> defense<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:24.270> way<00:04:24.510> no<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.169> can

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
guys run defense so this way no you can

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.560 
guys run defense so this way no you can
mix<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.740> up<00:04:25.890> within<00:04:26.220> this<00:04:26.490> playbook<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.180> you

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
mix this up within this playbook so you

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.210 
mix this up within this playbook so you
so<00:04:27.660> you<00:04:27.720> just<00:04:27.930> don't<00:04:28.050> have<00:04:28.320> this<00:04:28.530> blitz<00:04:28.830> within

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
so you just don't have this blitz within

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.870 
so you just don't have this blitz within

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
with the two people that I think are on

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.690 
with the two people that I think are on
the<00:04:46.200> crossing<00:04:46.590> routes<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:46.980> there<00:04:47.160> he<00:04:47.460> plays

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
the crossing routes and there he plays

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.420 
the crossing routes and there he plays
the<00:04:47.850> end<00:04:48.030> route<00:04:48.240> like<00:04:48.810> God<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.470> picks<00:04:50.160> it<00:04:50.310> off

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
the end route like God and picks it off

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.310 
the end route like God and picks it off
but<00:04:51.180> I<00:04:51.210> like<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.510> man<00:04:51.750> him<00:04:51.900> up<00:04:52.020> with<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.170> two
