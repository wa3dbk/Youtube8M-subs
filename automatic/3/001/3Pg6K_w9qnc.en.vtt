00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
predator tracks on my scx10 but the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.790 
predator tracks on my scx10 but the
stock<00:00:30.359> setup<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.750> had<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:30.960> actually<00:00:31.199> run<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.679> the

stock setup I had I actually run in the
what<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.640> no<00:00:32.850> back<00:00:33.059> rooster<00:00:33.600> crawl<00:00:33.930> or

what is it the no back rooster crawl or
ESC<00:00:34.350> here<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.910> had<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.360> 55<00:00:36.840> turn<00:00:37.079> motor<00:00:37.290> in

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
ESC here and I had a 55 turn motor in

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.520 
ESC here and I had a 55 turn motor in
here<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.980> was<00:00:38.100> running<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.600> 84<00:00:39.600> opinion<00:00:40.379> or

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
here and I was running a 84 opinion or

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.260 
here and I was running a 84 opinion or
84<00:00:40.920> spur<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> 22<00:00:43.670> pinion<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.760> my<00:00:44.879> 55

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
84 spur with a like a 22 pinion on my 55

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.569 
84 spur with a like a 22 pinion on my 55
turn<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.410> was<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.129> slow<00:00:47.399> but

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
turn and it was just really slow but

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.770 
turn and it was just really slow but
after<00:00:47.789> about<00:00:47.910> five<00:00:48.149> minutes<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.539> think<00:00:48.690> we'll

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
after about five minutes I think we'll

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.110 
after about five minutes I think we'll
just<00:00:48.899> overheat<00:00:49.320> because<00:00:49.489> these<00:00:50.489> tracks<00:00:50.850> add

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
just overheat because these tracks add

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.479 
just overheat because these tracks add
at<00:00:51.780> least<00:00:52.050> six<00:00:52.350> pounds<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.039> car<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.430> well

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
at least six pounds to your car as well

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.970 
at least six pounds to your car as well
as<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.149> mean<00:00:54.750> your<00:00:54.870> more<00:00:55.079> dough<00:00:55.170> has<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.440> work<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
as I mean your more dough has to work to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.770 
as I mean your more dough has to work to
turn<00:00:56.160> those<00:00:56.309> things<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.239> said<00:00:57.270> let's<00:00:57.570> try<00:00:57.660> at

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
turn those things so I said let's try at

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
turn those things so I said let's try at
27<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.350> I've<00:00:58.410> got<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> 27<00:00:58.859> turn<00:00:59.280> motor<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.640> here

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
27 so I've got a 27 turn motor in here

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.729 
27 so I've got a 27 turn motor in here
dropped<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> down<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:02.780> look<00:01:03.780> that's<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.049> 16<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
dropped it down do a look that's a 16 a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.240 
dropped it down do a look that's a 16 a
16<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.820> 84<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.900> was<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> lot<00:01:07.350> faster<00:01:07.799> but

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
16 and 84 and it was a lot faster but

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.890 
16 and 84 and it was a lot faster but
after<00:01:08.520> about<00:01:08.580> five<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.240> eight<00:01:09.420> minutes<00:01:09.659> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
after about five to eight minutes it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.060 
after about five to eight minutes it
would<00:01:09.960> overheat<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.740> thing<00:01:10.860> would<00:01:10.979> be

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
would overheat this thing would be

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.670 
would overheat this thing would be
smoking<00:01:11.369> hot<00:01:11.580> again<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:12.900> these

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
smoking hot again it was just these

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.850 
smoking hot again it was just these
tracks<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.130> super<00:01:14.820> are<00:01:15.030> super<00:01:15.360> heavy<00:01:15.619> so<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
tracks are super are super heavy so I

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.460 
tracks are super are super heavy so I
went<00:01:17.100> ahead<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.460> picked<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.140> side<00:01:19.140> wonder

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
went ahead and picked up a side wonder

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.980 
went ahead and picked up a side wonder
SCT<00:01:20.159> short<00:01:20.880> course<00:01:21.119> addition<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.659> reason

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
SCT short course addition and the reason

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.840 
SCT short course addition and the reason
why<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.380> got<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.799> one<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> crawler<00:01:23.610> one

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
why I got this one and not a crawler one

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.969 
why I got this one and not a crawler one
is<00:01:23.970> because<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.049> has<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> ton<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> torque

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
is because this one has a ton of torque

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.120 
is because this one has a ton of torque
I<00:01:26.220> mean<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.000> lot<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.570> torque<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.560> went<00:01:29.070> ahead

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I mean a lot of torque so I went ahead

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.410 
I mean a lot of torque so I went ahead
and<00:01:29.250> picked<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.850> gonna<00:01:29.939> try<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.270> out

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
down here and take my brushless system

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.120 
down here and take my brushless system
out<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.479> yeah<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.740> split<00:01:49.979> head

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
out of there but yeah I'm a split head

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.410 
out of there but yeah I'm a split head
and<00:01:50.250> got<00:01:50.369> another<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.180> how<00:01:51.270> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and got another one just to see how this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.749 
and got another one just to see how this
works<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.649> inboxes<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.280> here

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
works so it's what inboxes in here

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.300 
works so it's what inboxes in here
a<00:01:53.820> couple<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.810> guides<00:01:54.960> whatnot<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:56.219> got<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.579> oh

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
a couple of guides whatnot we got the oh

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.980 
a couple of guides whatnot we got the oh
that<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.399> course<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> fan<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.509> goes<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
that of course the fan that goes on the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
that of course the fan that goes on the
motor<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.409> some<00:02:01.979> people<00:02:02.250> some<00:02:02.610> people<00:02:02.790> were

saying the ass yeah I probably might be
able<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.259> use<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.560> because<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:05.159> gonna

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
able to use this because it's not gonna

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.850 
able to use this because it's not gonna
be<00:02:05.369> able<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.520> fit<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:06.079> fit<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.320> there<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.710> a

lot of people will actually just stick

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.930 
lot of people will actually just stick
it<00:02:09.239> over<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.629> ESC<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.200> let's<00:02:10.470> make<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> ESC

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
it over the ESC so let's make the ESC

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.850 
it over the ESC so let's make the ESC
out<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.360> lot<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.780> people<00:02:12.930> are<00:02:13.110> just<00:02:13.230> saying<00:02:13.440> hey
