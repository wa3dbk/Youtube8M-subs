I<00:00:00.170> know<00:00:01.170> I<00:00:01.680> know<00:00:02.639> you<00:00:02.909> don't<00:00:03.120> really<00:00:03.330> get<00:00:03.629> all

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
I know I know you don't really get all

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.039 
I know I know you don't really get all
this<00:00:04.020> talk<00:00:04.380> about<00:00:04.410> 4G<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:05.609> mean<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.660> think<00:00:06.870> you

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
this talk about 4G I mean you think you

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.169 
this talk about 4G I mean you think you
get<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.440> when<00:00:07.649> they<00:00:07.770> say<00:00:08.010> faster<00:00:08.610> more

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
get it when they say faster more

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.709 
get it when they say faster more
coverage<00:00:09.719> better<00:00:10.260> service<00:00:10.950> but<00:00:11.700> really<00:00:12.150> what

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
coverage better service but really what

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
coverage better service but really what
do<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.900> need<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.259> for<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:14.280> basically<00:00:14.790> use

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
do you need it for you basically use

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.390 
do you need it for you basically use
your<00:00:15.059> phone<00:00:15.480> for<00:00:15.509> calls<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.529> that's<00:00:17.070> not<00:00:17.340> a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
your phone for calls and that's not a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.109 
your phone for calls and that's not a
problem

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
problem

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.620

well<00:00:18.539> usually<00:00:18.840> oh<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.789> do<00:00:21.029> use<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.510> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
well usually oh and you do use it to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.210 
well usually oh and you do use it to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
so apart from calling you see you do use

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.310 
so apart from calling you see you do use
your<00:00:49.739> phone<00:00:50.160> quite<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.579> bit<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.149> data<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.780> your

your phone quite a bit for data and your
service<00:00:52.739> providers<00:00:53.280> network<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.850> now

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
service providers network is now

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.260 
service providers network is now
bombarded<00:00:54.899> by<00:00:54.930> data<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:56.059> imagine<00:00:57.059> what's

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
bombarded by data and imagine what's

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.240 
bombarded by data and imagine what's
happening<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> network<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:58.829> people

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
happening to the network when people

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.970 
happening to the network when people
move<00:00:59.430> around<00:00:59.579> with<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> laptop<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.899> netbook<00:01:01.770> an

demand<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:06.299> data<00:01:06.450> complicates<00:01:07.320> networks<00:01:07.799> by

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
demand for data complicates networks by

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.420 
demand for data complicates networks by
creating<00:01:08.909> tons<00:01:09.270> more<00:01:09.659> signaling<00:01:10.380> which<00:01:11.250> if

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
creating tons more signaling which if

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
creating tons more signaling which if
not<00:01:11.670> controlled<00:01:12.060> well<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:13.020> slow<00:01:13.380> down<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
not controlled well can slow down a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.539 
not controlled well can slow down a
network<00:01:14.280> even<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> point<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.720> collapse

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
network even to the point of collapse

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:17.899 
network even to the point of collapse
excuse<00:01:17.549> me

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
excuse me

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
excuse me
what's<00:01:18.780> signaling<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.880> asked<00:01:21.869> traffics<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
what's signaling so I asked traffics the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.609 
what's signaling so I asked traffics the
signaling<00:01:23.700> experts<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.450> they<00:01:24.960> told<00:01:25.259> me<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
signaling experts and they told me that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.859 
signaling experts and they told me that
signaling<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.340> basically<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.180> enables<00:01:27.689> your

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
signaling is basically what enables your

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.020 
signaling is basically what enables your
service<00:01:28.290> providers<00:01:28.770> network<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.549> function

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
service providers network to function

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.630 
service providers network to function
and<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:31.110> must<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.470> many<00:01:31.920> different<00:01:32.250> types

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
and there must be many different types

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.210 
and there must be many different types
of<00:01:32.790> equipment<00:01:33.360> inside<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.020> network<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:35.040> offer

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
of equipment inside a network to offer

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.480 
of equipment inside a network to offer
both<00:01:35.549> voice<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:35.970> data<00:01:36.600> services<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.650> all

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
both voice and data services and all

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730 
both voice and data services and all
that<00:01:38.820> equipment<00:01:39.210> must<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.869> orchestrated

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
that equipment must be orchestrated

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.090 
that equipment must be orchestrated
together<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.759> things<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.090> work<00:01:42.920> signaling<00:01:43.920> is

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
together for things to work signaling is

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.340 
together for things to work signaling is
the<00:01:44.369> network's<00:01:44.759> internal<00:01:45.540> communication

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the network's internal communication

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.639 
the network's internal communication
system<00:01:46.860> telling<00:01:47.700> each<00:01:47.970> piece<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.329> information

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649

services and how they can use it like at
what<00:01:55.890> speed

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
what speed

at what locations how they should be
billed<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.730> much<00:02:00.300> much<00:02:00.600> more<00:02:00.660> and<00:02:01.260> of<00:02:01.980> course

a communication system needs a language

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.410 
a communication system needs a language
