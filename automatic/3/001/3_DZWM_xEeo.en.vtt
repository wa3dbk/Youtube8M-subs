think is a really cool idea pretty much
the<00:02:19.020> same<00:02:19.170> for<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.440> main<00:02:19.590> menu<00:02:19.910> Isis<00:02:20.910> with<00:02:21.060> all

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
of them they're all the same as the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.240 
of them they're all the same as the
inventory<00:02:24.060> solver<00:02:24.450> thing<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.680> yeah<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.100> is

stuff like this i still develop actually
wait<00:02:34.770> very<00:02:35.460> very<00:02:35.700> blocky<00:02:36.060> there's<00:02:36.570> not<00:02:36.720> much

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
wait very very blocky there's not much

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.350 
wait very very blocky there's not much
texture<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.430> or<00:02:38.580> anything<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.030> really

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
texture to or anything it's just really

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.350 
texture to or anything it's just really
nice<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:40.310> when<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.400> break<00:02:41.550> things<00:02:41.790> once

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
nice and when you break things once

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.580 
nice and when you break things once
again<00:02:42.570> it's<00:02:42.840> pretty<00:02:43.020> much<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.200> same<00:02:43.410> as

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
again it's pretty much the same as

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.260 
again it's pretty much the same as
regular<00:02:43.770> minecraft<00:02:44.520> which<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:44.970> bit<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.210> a

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
regular minecraft which is a bit of a

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.760 
regular minecraft which is a bit of a
downer<00:02:45.420> because<00:02:45.750> i<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:46.020> new<00:02:46.350> breaky

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
downer because i like new breaky

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.150 
downer because i like new breaky
technique<00:02:47.190> e<00:02:47.370> things<00:02:48.170> go<00:02:49.170> back<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.500> our<00:02:49.530> zone<00:02:49.920> I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
technique e things go back to our zone I

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.470 
technique e things go back to our zone I
think<00:02:50.370> they<00:02:50.460> look<00:02:50.610> quite<00:02:50.760> cool<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.210> furnace

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
think they look quite cool the furnace

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.700 
think they look quite cool the furnace
is<00:02:51.570> your<00:02:51.720> favorite<00:02:51.990> not<00:02:52.140> too<00:02:52.260> sure<00:02:52.410> about<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
is your favorite not too sure about the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.920 
is your favorite not too sure about the
crafting<00:02:53.070> area<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.520> think<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.450> looks<00:02:54.570> quite

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
crafting area I think that looks quite

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.930 
crafting area I think that looks quite
cool<00:02:54.960> but<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.950> can<00:02:56.130> be<00:02:56.220> very<00:02:56.250> annoying<00:02:56.670> after

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
cool but it can be very annoying after

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.520 
cool but it can be very annoying after
using<00:02:57.210> it<00:02:57.390> for<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.630> while<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.840> don't<00:02:58.200> know<00:02:58.290> why<00:02:58.470> it

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
using it for a while I don't know why it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.590 
using it for a while I don't know why it
is<00:02:58.650> but<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:59.340> don't<00:02:59.640> think<00:02:59.760> blue<00:02:59.970> suits<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.420> very

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
is but I don't think blue suits it very

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.480 
is but I don't think blue suits it very
well<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.260> chest<00:03:01.560> looks<00:03:01.710> pretty<00:03:02.010> nice<00:03:02.130> but<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
well the chest looks pretty nice but the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.400 
well the chest looks pretty nice but the
brands<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.880> bit<00:03:03.030> monkey<00:03:03.570> in<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.050> the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
brands a bit monkey in it and the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.080 
brands a bit monkey in it and the
furnace<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:04.980> really<00:03:05.250> like<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.550> furnace<00:03:05.910> I

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
furnace I really like the furnace I

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.760 
furnace I really like the furnace I
think<00:03:06.330> they've<00:03:06.810> done<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:07.020> very<00:03:07.200> good<00:03:07.320> job<00:03:07.470> with

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
think they've done a very good job with

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.700 
think they've done a very good job with
that<00:03:07.850> we<00:03:08.850> go<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.210> inventory<00:03:09.750> once<00:03:10.530> again

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
that we go to the inventory once again

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.110 
that we go to the inventory once again
it's<00:03:11.010> one<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.190> them<00:03:11.400> if<00:03:11.580> he<00:03:11.730> things<00:03:11.970> when

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
it's one of them if he things when

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.490 
it's one of them if he things when
you're<00:03:12.240> not<00:03:12.390> really<00:03:12.630> too<00:03:12.900> sure<00:03:12.930> about<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
you're not really too sure about the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.550 
you're not really too sure about the
blue<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.100> Browns<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.240> you<00:03:15.330> know<00:03:15.560> they

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
blue with the Browns but you know they

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.440 
blue with the Browns but you know they
also<00:03:16.800> could<00:03:17.100> have<00:03:17.130> done<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> lot<00:03:17.640> more<00:03:17.880> on<00:03:18.150> this

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
also could have done a lot more on this

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.140 
also could have done a lot more on this

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
and breaking on this is pretty much the

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.310 
and breaking on this is pretty much the
same<00:03:48.030> as<00:03:48.210> everything<00:03:48.600> else<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:48.990> it's<00:03:49.170> got

like<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.500> bit<00:03:49.770> more<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.570> less<00:03:51.570> blocky<00:03:52.260> solver

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
like a bit more of a less blocky solver

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.610 
like a bit more of a less blocky solver
feel<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.160> it's<00:03:53.400> more<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.620> don't

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
feel to it it's more of a so of I don't

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.440

connectors and I think the look proper
night<00:04:07.710> and<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.160> goes<00:04:08.430> really<00:04:08.670> well<00:04:08.910> because

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
night and it goes really well because

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.610

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
they've kind of followed through the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.010 
they've kind of followed through the
theme<00:04:10.890> on<00:04:10.920> all<00:04:11.220> three<00:04:11.490> of<00:04:11.520> them<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.020> they've

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
they could have done more to that that's

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.420 
they could have done more to that that's
very<00:05:01.630> basic<00:05:02.229> that's<00:05:02.530> that's<00:05:03.040> a<00:05:03.160> bit<00:05:03.310> of<00:05:03.370> a

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
very basic that's that's a bit of a

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.030 
very basic that's that's a bit of a
downside<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:03.940> it<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:05.620> was<00:05:05.680> not<00:05:05.860> really

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
downside to it and it was not really

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.520 
downside to it and it was not really
downside<00:05:06.520> but<00:05:06.820> i'm<00:05:07.030> not<00:05:07.450> as<00:05:07.660> happy<00:05:08.169> with<00:05:08.320> that

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
downside but i'm not as happy with that

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.200 
downside but i'm not as happy with that
was<00:05:08.680> there<00:05:08.800> with<00:05:08.950> everything<00:05:09.250> else<00:05:09.400> well<00:05:10.090> then

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
was there with everything else well then

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.520 
was there with everything else well then
this<00:05:10.389> is<00:05:10.570> really<00:05:10.720> cool<00:05:10.960> because<00:05:11.080> it's<00:05:11.320> kind<00:05:11.410> of

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
this is really cool because it's kind of

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.469 
this is really cool because it's kind of
like<00:05:11.680> made<00:05:12.100> it<00:05:12.220> look<00:05:12.370> artistic<00:05:13.030> even<00:05:13.360> though

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
like made it look artistic even though

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.360 
like made it look artistic even though
it's<00:05:13.660> still<00:05:14.110> very<00:05:14.320> basic<00:05:14.860> that<00:05:15.070> made<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.340> look

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
it's still very basic that made it look
