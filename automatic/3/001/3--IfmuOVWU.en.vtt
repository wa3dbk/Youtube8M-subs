of<00:00:00.410> little<00:00:01.410> water<00:00:02.629> droplets<00:00:03.629> in<00:00:04.319> here<00:00:05.160> we're

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
of little water droplets in here we're

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.789 
of little water droplets in here we're
gonna<00:00:05.430> create<00:00:05.910> our<00:00:06.089> noise<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:07.230> inside<00:00:07.680> this

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
gonna create our noise and inside this

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:08.990 
gonna create our noise and inside this
noise<00:00:08.069> we're<00:00:08.280> gonna<00:00:08.370> make<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.730> following

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
noise we're gonna make the following

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.259 
noise we're gonna make the following
adjustments<00:00:09.690> we're<00:00:10.500> going<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:11.040> choose<00:00:11.400> naki

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.359 

for<00:00:15.269> our<00:00:15.480> noise<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:16.529> course<00:00:16.740> we'll<00:00:16.980> set<00:00:17.190> this

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
for our noise of course we'll set this

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.500 
for our noise of course we'll set this
to<00:00:17.640> two<00:00:17.850> vud

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
to two vud

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.519 
to two vud
but<00:00:18.990> we'll<00:00:19.140> set<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> scale<00:00:19.770> down<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.279> twenty

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
but we'll set the scale down to twenty

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.000 
but we'll set the scale down to twenty
the<00:00:22.529> low<00:00:22.830> clip<00:00:23.480> 256<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.880> brightness<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:28.320> 25

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the low clip 256 the brightness to 25

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.760 
the low clip 256 the brightness to 25
and<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:30.689> contrast<00:00:32.390> 256<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:34.649> we

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and the contrast 256 much like what we

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.410 
and the contrast 256 much like what we
did<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> prior<00:00:35.430> example<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.270> going

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
did in the prior example and it's going

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.470 
did in the prior example and it's going
to<00:00:36.480> create<00:00:36.750> these<00:00:36.899> little<00:00:37.260> dots<00:00:38.120> to<00:00:39.120> quickly

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to create these little dots to quickly

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.389 
to create these little dots to quickly
run<00:00:39.690> through<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:40.050> right<00:00:40.530> leg<00:00:40.829> right<00:00:41.129> click

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
run through this right leg right click

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.880 
run through this right leg right click
on<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.180> noise<00:00:42.390> Channel<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> choose<00:00:43.440> copy

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
on the noise Channel and choose copy

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.700 
on the noise Channel and choose copy
channel<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.480> shader<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.289> add<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
channel then go to shader and add a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.330 
channel then go to shader and add a
color<00:00:47.899> paste<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.140> channel<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.620> top<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.190> so

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
color paste a channel on top of it so

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
color paste a channel on top of it so
we've<00:00:50.489> duplicated<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.390> last<00:00:51.660> channel<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
we've duplicated the last channel and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
we've duplicated the last channel and
for<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.699> we're<00:00:54.239> gonna<00:00:54.329> change<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:57.000> seed

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
for this one we're gonna change the seed

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.869 
for this one we're gonna change the seed
so<00:00:58.289> everything<00:00:58.770> alters<00:00:59.309> and<00:01:00.320> we'll<00:01:01.320> set<00:01:01.559> this

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
so everything alters and we'll set this

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:10.690 
so everything alters and we'll set this
to<00:01:02.899> 60%<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:05.000> we'll<00:01:06.000> set<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> mode<00:01:07.909> to<00:01:08.909> screen

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
to 60% and we'll set the mode to screen

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
to 60% and we'll set the mode to screen
we<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.689> twice<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.140> many

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
we do this so we can get twice as many

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.999 
we do this so we can get twice as many
bumps<00:01:14.070> without<00:01:14.310> having<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:16.350> shrink

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
bumps without having to you know shrink

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.710 
bumps without having to you know shrink
down<00:01:17.250> our<00:01:17.460> drops<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.000> where<00:01:18.150> they're<00:01:18.330> barely

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
down our drops to where they're barely

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.859 
down our drops to where they're barely
visible<00:01:19.759> we're<00:01:20.759> also<00:01:20.939> gonna<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.540> one

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
visible we're also gonna do this one

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.359 
visible we're also gonna do this one
more<00:01:22.200> time

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.490 

copy<00:01:26.509> shader<00:01:27.650> color<00:01:28.909> right<00:01:29.909> click<00:01:30.240> paste

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
copy shader color right click paste

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.390 
copy shader color right click paste
we'll<00:01:32.250> set<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.090> screen<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.570> well<00:01:34.400> but

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
we'll set this to screen as well but

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.859 
we'll set this to screen as well but
we're<00:01:35.759> gonna<00:01:35.850> reduce<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.689> opacity<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.829> 40<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
we're gonna reduce the opacity to 40 and

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.700 
we're gonna reduce the opacity to 40 and
we're<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> set<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.590> new<00:01:41.009> seed<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.530> 667<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
we're going to set a new seed of 667 and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.859 
we're going to set a new seed of 667 and
we're<00:01:44.430> gonna<00:01:44.520> change<00:01:44.820> our<00:01:45.030> global<00:01:45.390> scale<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
we're gonna change our global scale to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.830 
we're gonna change our global scale to
10<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.119> create<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.509> lot

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
10 so now this is going to create a lot

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.139 
10 so now this is going to create a lot
of<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:49.649> tiny<00:01:49.979> little<00:01:50.340> dots<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
of really tiny little dots here and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.520 
of really tiny little dots here and
there<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:53.460> here<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.060> our<00:01:54.530> displacement

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
there and so here is our displacement

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.969 
there and so here is our displacement
texture<00:01:57.259> now<00:01:58.259> what<00:01:58.439> we're<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.860> is

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
texture now what we're going to do is

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.170 
texture now what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.250> select<00:01:59.549> our<00:01:59.759> canned

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
we're going to select our canned

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.480 
we're going to select our canned
displacement<00:02:01.020> we're<00:02:01.710> gonna<00:02:01.829> Center<00:02:02.280> this

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
displacement we're gonna Center this

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.560 
displacement we're gonna Center this
access<00:02:04.219> then<00:02:05.219> we<00:02:05.640> are<00:02:05.790> going<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.180> increase

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
access then we are going to increase

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.699 
access then we are going to increase
this<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.170> where<00:02:07.409> our<00:02:08.060> size<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.539> about<00:02:09.899> two<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
this to where our size is about two and

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.680 
this to where our size is about two and
a<00:02:10.830> half

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
a half

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.110 
a half
-<00:02:12.320> Oh<00:02:13.240> 3.6<00:02:14.240> -<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.540> 3.5<00:02:15.470> then<00:02:16.460> we're<00:02:16.670> gonna<00:02:16.760> take

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
- Oh 3.6 - a 3.5 then we're gonna take

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.110 
- Oh 3.6 - a 3.5 then we're gonna take
this<00:02:17.300> material<00:02:17.990> which<00:02:18.410> we're<00:02:18.590> gonna<00:02:18.680> call<00:02:19.750> can

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
this material which we're gonna call can

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.730 
this material which we're gonna call can
displacement<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.570> we're<00:02:23.990> gonna<00:02:24.080> just<00:02:24.350> drop

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
displacement and we're gonna just drop

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.100 
displacement and we're gonna just drop
it<00:02:24.950> on<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:26.000> our<00:02:26.030> can<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.510> really<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> lot

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
it on to our can so this is really a lot

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.560 
it on to our can so this is really a lot
of<00:02:30.170> fun<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.620> see<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.430> little<00:02:31.730> tiny<00:02:31.940> bumps

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
of fun you see all the little tiny bumps

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.190 
of fun you see all the little tiny bumps
that<00:02:33.080> we<00:02:33.260> have<00:02:33.530> along<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.190> edge<00:02:34.670> now<00:02:35.120> which<00:02:36.020> is

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
that we have along the edge now which is

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.860 
that we have along the edge now which is
our<00:02:36.380> water<00:02:36.740> droplets<00:02:37.490> mixed<00:02:38.330> in<00:02:38.480> with<00:02:38.690> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
our water droplets mixed in with the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.050 
our water droplets mixed in with the
bump<00:02:39.110> channel<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.860> water<00:02:40.130> streaks<00:02:40.640> it

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
bump channel in the water streaks it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.690 
bump channel in the water streaks it
really<00:02:41.840> starts<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.530> sell<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.340> entire

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
really starts to sell the entire

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.650 
really starts to sell the entire
composition<00:02:45.490> now<00:02:46.490> all<00:02:46.730> we<00:02:46.910> really<00:02:47.060> have<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.510> do

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
composition now all we really have to do

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.170 
composition now all we really have to do
at<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:48.020> point<00:02:48.080> is<00:02:49.060> create<00:02:50.060> our<00:02:52.180> displacement

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
at this point is create our displacement

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.720 
at this point is create our displacement
bump<00:02:53.720> channels<00:02:54.110> for<00:02:54.440> our<00:02:54.680> lid<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.430> our

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
bump channels for our lid and our

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.450 
bump channels for our lid and our
openings<00:02:56.210> so<00:02:56.990> go<00:02:57.320> ahead<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.650> copy<00:02:57.890> lid

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
openings so go ahead and copy lid

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.880 
openings so go ahead and copy lid
opening<00:02:59.230> cap<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.820> top<00:03:01.820> lid<00:03:02.650> paste<00:03:03.650> those

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
opening cap and top lid paste those

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.070 
opening cap and top lid paste those
together<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:05.330> we're<00:03:05.480> just<00:03:05.600> going<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.810> take

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
together and we're just going to take

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.190 
together and we're just going to take
those<00:03:06.260> down<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.890> set<00:03:07.640> these<00:03:07.850> right<00:03:08.420> in<00:03:08.690> our

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
those down and set these right in our

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.060 
those down and set these right in our
can<00:03:09.650> water<00:03:10.340> bumps<00:03:10.970> we're<00:03:11.840> gonna<00:03:11.930> delete<00:03:12.440> these

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
can water bumps we're gonna delete these

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.760 
can water bumps we're gonna delete these
texture<00:03:13.790> tags<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.540> we're<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:15.350> going<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.560> do

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
texture tags and we're just going to do

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.250 
texture tags and we're just going to do
a<00:03:15.800> quick<00:03:16.310> bump<00:03:16.910> channel<00:03:17.000> for<00:03:17.810> this<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.140> we're

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
a quick bump channel for this so we're

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.630 
a quick bump channel for this so we're
going<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.410> take<00:03:18.620> our<00:03:18.740> can<00:03:19.040> bump<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.520> we

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
going to take our can bump that we

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.760 
going to take our can bump that we
currently<00:03:19.820> have<00:03:20.209> we're<00:03:21.080> gonna<00:03:21.140> copy<00:03:21.560> and

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
currently have we're gonna copy and

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.140 
currently have we're gonna copy and
paste<00:03:22.100> it<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.490> we'll<00:03:22.850> call<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.330> can<00:03:25.150> top<00:03:26.150> and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
paste it and we'll call this can top and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.430 
paste it and we'll call this can top and
what<00:03:29.150> we're<00:03:29.270> gonna<00:03:29.360> do<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:29.810> we're<00:03:30.110> going<00:03:30.260> to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
what we're gonna do is we're going to

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.320 
what we're gonna do is we're going to
turn<00:03:30.680> off<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:31.370> distort<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:33.080> tiles<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.940> small

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
turn off the distort the tiles the small

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.750 
turn off the distort the tiles the small
little<00:03:35.660> drop<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:37.190> we're<00:03:37.310> going<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.459> take<00:03:37.610> this

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
little drop so we're going to take this

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.840 
little drop so we're going to take this
can<00:03:38.060> top<00:03:38.620> drop<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:39.860> on<00:03:40.010> each<00:03:40.340> one<00:03:40.610> of<00:03:40.760> these

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
can top drop it on each one of these

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.720 
can top drop it on each one of these
three<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:46.040> then<00:03:46.130> we're<00:03:46.220> going<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.370> just<00:03:46.520> take

three and then we're going to just take

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.170 
three and then we're going to just take
these<00:03:47.000> three<00:03:47.480> items<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.580> we're<00:03:49.580> just<00:03:49.820> going

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
these three items and we're just going

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.449 
these three items and we're just going
to<00:03:50.470> let<00:03:51.470> make<00:03:51.709> sure<00:03:51.860> I<00:03:51.920> got<00:03:52.040> these<00:03:52.190> three

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
to let make sure I got these three

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:00.690 
to let make sure I got these three
selected<00:03:52.910> move<00:03:53.780> this<00:03:54.050> up<00:03:58.390> one<00:03:59.390> centimeter

looking can out there there are several

noticeable flaws in it one is that

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:43.619 
noticeable flaws in it one is that
there's<00:04:42.280> no<00:04:42.490> way<00:04:42.669> that<00:04:42.789> I<00:04:42.849> know<00:04:42.969> of<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.210> produce

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:43.629

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
beads of water which is something you

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.860 
beads of water which is something you
get<00:04:47.469> in<00:04:47.590> real<00:04:47.770> life<00:04:47.979> also<00:04:48.699> the<00:04:49.240> reflections

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
get in real life also the reflections

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.230 
get in real life also the reflections
are<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.110> little<00:04:50.379> strong<00:04:50.650> as<00:04:50.800> well<00:04:51.009> then<00:04:51.819> let's

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
are a little strong as well then let's

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.450 
are a little strong as well then let's
not<00:04:52.389> talk<00:04:52.569> about<00:04:52.599> the<00:04:52.840> lid<00:04:53.020> but<00:04:53.800> for<00:04:54.129> a<00:04:54.159> quick

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
not talk about the lid but for a quick
