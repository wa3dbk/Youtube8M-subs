00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.399
 we present you the 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.670
 we present you the device app 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.650
 so galaxy s 4 samsung's photo that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.779
 has just been announced so we have a 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.969
 interface that was slightly revised by 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.650
 compared to the galaxy s iii 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.620
 so we have different buttons so we have 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.810
 here for example the possibility of passing 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.030
 on the front camera don that is 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.460
 a 2 megapixel and in the back so we have 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.180
 a 13 megapixel here so we can go 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.280
 from one to the other 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.640
 little novelty on this s 4 we have the 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.140
 possibility to use both sensors 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.769
 simultaneously in fact so here we see at 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 the back is here for sale 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.760
 so we can actually customize it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.309
 so that's actually allowing you to do 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.949
 for example, videoconferencing or 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.889
 nice memories with care on one side 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.149
 finally or on one side and so a landscape 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:52.769
 for example on the other side so that's 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.929
 rather nice and so we can 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.170
 customize her here we have a whole 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.729
 series of effects that can be applied 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.469
 that's the way it's these 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.909
 gorgeous as you see these 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.580
 beautiful as you see it's 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.380
 really it's all cute 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.159
 here and so suddenly you can 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.729
 disable also there are others 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.590
 settings 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.229
 for example the advanced settings here 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.450
 so we can adjust the size of the images 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.340
 which goes up to 13 megapixels 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.380
 on the other hand when we are on the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.149
 maximum resolution of 13 megapixels 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.500
 we are more about the screen ratio 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.930
 as you see here at bands 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.090
 black on each side 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.400
 so that's outside of this setting so 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.560
 so we find the burst function 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.900
 detection so two faces and so on 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.300
 exposure measures isolate him 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.460
 optical stabilizer in the 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.970
 image stabilizer ditto for video 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.580
 so the same we are in maximum in full hd 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.440
 geolocation preview images 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.479
 after capture and that's too much of 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.510
 settings that are pretty classic 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.160
 is used to seeing that we access 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.479
 other functions here so here we have the 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.720
 flash setting 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.700
 here so we at night detection 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.220
 automatic which allows to apply 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.270
 adequate parameters 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.160
 here so we have the opportunity to settle 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.280
 voice commands for example the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.600
 say cheese to start capturing a 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.950
 photo so here we can try it there is 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.320
 a lot of noise behind us so 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.320
 it's not necessarily easy cheese 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.780
 So here we are as we see it 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.340
 operated he just took on the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.140
 voice command this photo is not this 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.830
 that I said cheese here as it is 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.830
 see for example it worked 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.890
 so that was it for the functions 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.440
 main ones so here we have the parameters 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.020
 for video so there's nothing 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.390
 special here we have other functions for 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.770
 find for the most part already on the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.840
 galaxy siii for example sharing 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.240
 automatic photos with friends who 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.690
 have been detected in the photo etc and we 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.400
 finally found a fashion button here that goes 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.380
 actually allow you to apply 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.960
 different different functions by 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.820
 example the word night the sport mode so 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.500
 he will capture faster so we have here 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.420
 actually a little description like 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.400
 you see it the failure mode the famous 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.200
 panorama mode obviously and then the mode 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.940
 man who there is a little newer 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.380
 since in fact that allows you to take 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.540
 several more photos and one of a 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.950
 subject in the foreground and erase in 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.110
 does the people who were able to pass 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.360
 possibly in the background in 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.560
 background in fact so suddenly you 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.780
 have a series of several photos and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.190
 you can live virtually erase 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.540
 the people and they disappear 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.920
 automatically so for that you have to 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.750
 capture multiple photos and so everything 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.910
 is managed automatically by 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.660
 example then it was not obvious 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.420
 to show you that there is no 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.990
 necessarily people who spend that I 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.830
 take here 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.750
 as we see we have several photos 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.010
 we 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.280
 this is going to generate a list 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.870
 of objects that I can delete here 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.030
 so there for example I took several 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.470
 photos and so have we see here an object 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.360
 purple so we do not know exactly what 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.090
 that it is enough to actually click 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.290
 above to remove it so hey right there it's 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.280
 a bit of a simulation because we 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.080
 did not have people passing 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.230
 but if you have a person who passes 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.000
 you can really click on it 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.940
 disappears automatically and that you 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.769
 save your photo as if it 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.530
 had no disruptive object to 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.240
 supra we have the hdr mode of course and 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.070
 we also for example samsung a 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.080
 presented its today the mode are 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.270
 that allows you to actually 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.550
 capture a photo and add a few 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.830
 second two are actually so suddenly 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.750
 it's like a video of 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.789
 few seconds on which the image 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.289
 would be fixed in fact it would be a photo 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.789
 in full resolution 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.070
 so suddenly we see it's not 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.030
 necessarily ultra useful can be more 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.139
 useful but a function that 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.690
 already knew it's the best 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.970
 photo that actually captures many 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.039
 Photos by little bursts of the same scene 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.889
 and that allows you to choose afterwards 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:56.020
 the one you prefer we have the same 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.030
 thing so with meyer pose so this 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.289
 rest a little on the on the same 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.960
 principle it allows you to take 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.120
 several pictures and so choose 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.479
 automatically the picture you 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.479
 choose
