00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.300
 i 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.319
 Y 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.100
 the Mexican team reaches ground 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.240
 American with the obligation of 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.480
 win the 2015 gold cup players 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.580
 Aztecs feel with the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.570
 responsibility to win the title and so 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.070
 be able to go to the confederations cup 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.200
 and we know that we have the responsibility 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.120
 because we want to be in confederations 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.120
 then the team has to 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.760
 and realize what we have to 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:50.070
 do and committed we do not know he 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.219
 level we need to win the cup 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.450
 and committed to winning has always been 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.370
 mandatory blind win 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.700
 I think we're used to that to 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.920
 be forced to win beyond that not 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.340
 I consider myself a winner and that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.110
 I want to win the cup, we will not try 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.740
 make the best hard cup for us 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.600
 because it is very important we know 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.640
 that we have nothing else to gain and 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.380
 we go with that responsibility we join 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.380
 of the challenge that is winning 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.950
 even though mexico failed in all 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.560
 the tournaments in their different categories 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.560
 in this summer the players of the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.479
 senior selection do not feel pressure by 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.990
 the bad results that have come 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.690
 giving in all national categories 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.430
 this group does not think about what has been 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.100
 done now the rest of us 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.530
 we think simply improve day by day 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.899
 improve with these matches improve in 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.390
 the physical training 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.899
 and tactical I do not feel that responsibility 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.090
 nor that weight that the other selections do not 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.890
 they gain nothing but nothing 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.700
 calm and let's play the cup like 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.550
 as it should be and try to win that is what 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.110
 more important I do not know why we 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.080
 they throw in the muertito of all the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.770
 elections I do not understand that is a 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.990
 the female has its goals the sub-20 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.250
 are the suv has its objectives the 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.540
 america cup had its goal us 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.490
 we have last very different than 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.810
 obviously we are going to give an account of what 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.290
 let's do not do what they do 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.290
 other elections 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.360
 the tri could not win in their matches 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.060
 preparation prior to the contest but to 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.080
 Despite this, the campus breathes 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.170
 tranquility and joy very quiet very 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.659
 happy I think it's important inside 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.010
 a selection within a group and nothing 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.739
 we are calm working for 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.209
 get the best way to the cup very 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.129
 well very well I 've always said that 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.099
 came to the selection for me it's always 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.950
 a great compliment not to follow 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.569
 keeping me here after so long 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.299
 it's a nice thing to accumulate matches 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.920
 accumulate official tournaments and good hopefully 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.019
 that you can invent for me obviously 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.000
 for the team that the most important thing I 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.519
 I think that we as a footballer 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.410
 we are used to that pressure and 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.300
 more in a selection like ours 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.180
 that we are still always being asked 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.820
 be friendly or official so the 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.860
 commitment and the pressure of always and 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.840
 we have to play with the 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.209
 quality and proximity always 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.000
 to keep watching more videos we're going 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.790
