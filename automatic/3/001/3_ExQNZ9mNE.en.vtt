nicely<00:03:13.120> into<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:13.690> thing<00:03:13.989> which<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.319> great

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
nicely into this thing which is great

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.870 
nicely into this thing which is great

because the figure this comes with

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.610 
because the figure this comes with
really<00:03:16.180> doesn't<00:03:16.569> have<00:03:16.690> any<00:03:16.840> paint<00:03:17.140> on<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.470> at
