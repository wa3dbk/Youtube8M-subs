straight lines really linear and really

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.880 
straight lines really linear and really
focused<00:02:33.299> stuff<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.810> was<00:02:34.049> inspired<00:02:34.230> by<00:02:34.650> both

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
focused stuff so I was inspired by both

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.270 
focused stuff so I was inspired by both
of<00:02:35.099> these<00:02:35.190> genres<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.690> then<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.590> didn't<00:02:38.190> know

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
of these genres and then I didn't know

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.440 
of these genres and then I didn't know
where<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.459> fit<00:02:38.549> I<00:02:38.849> knew<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.090> wanted<00:02:39.269> to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
where I fit I knew I wanted to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.270 
where I fit I knew I wanted to
contribute<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.079> I<00:02:40.110> took<00:02:40.319> me<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> while<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.769> get

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
contribute so I took me a while to get

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.830 
contribute so I took me a while to get
into<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.790> started<00:02:42.209> doing<00:02:42.390> characters

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
into it I started doing characters

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.710 
into it I started doing characters
initially<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:44.489> guess<00:02:45.329> subconsciously

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
initially and I guess subconsciously

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.030 
initially and I guess subconsciously
what<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.049> was<00:02:46.170> really<00:02:46.290> trying<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.590> do<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.739> learn

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
what I was really trying to do is learn

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.380 
what I was really trying to do is learn
characters<00:02:47.340> learn<00:02:47.700> how<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:47.880> cut<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.299> use

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
characters learn how to cut and use

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.629 
characters learn how to cut and use
these<00:02:48.569> cans<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.470> learn<00:02:49.680> technique<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.579> I

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
these cans and learn technique and I

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.830 
these cans and learn technique and I
started<00:02:50.970> with<00:02:51.060> characters<00:02:51.389> cuz<00:02:51.540> that's<00:02:51.720> what

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
started with characters cuz that's what

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.259 
started with characters cuz that's what
I<00:02:51.870> used<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.079> draw<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.350> books<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.829> I<00:02:52.859> want<00:02:53.069> to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
development at that time and this was

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.020 
development at that time and this was
also<00:03:01.410> before<00:03:01.769> European<00:03:02.370> spray<00:03:02.579> paint<00:03:02.850> came

into play before magazines were coming
into<00:03:04.859> play<00:03:05.040> before<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.370> internet<00:03:05.700> kind<00:03:06.060> of

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
into play before the internet kind of

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.599 
into play before the internet kind of
expanded<00:03:06.930> everything<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.340> was<00:03:08.400> really

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
expanded everything so it was really

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.460 
expanded everything so it was really
pure<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.090> beautiful<00:03:09.359> then<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.170> really

period<00:03:12.299> because<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.049> was<00:03:13.139> a<00:03:13.170> really<00:03:13.530> classic

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
period because it was a really classic

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.960 
period because it was a really classic

number<00:04:46.390> of<00:04:46.570> years<00:04:46.840> it's<00:04:47.110> just<00:04:47.170> gotten<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.620> lot

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
number of years it's just gotten a lot

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.760 
number of years it's just gotten a lot
more<00:04:47.800> refined<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.790> tuned<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.510> past<00:04:49.770> five

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
more refined and tuned in the past five

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.180 
more refined and tuned in the past five
and<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:52.510> painting<00:04:52.960> work<00:04:53.350> that<00:04:53.890> works<00:04:54.070> on

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
and the painting work that works on

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.180 
and the painting work that works on
canvas<00:04:54.640> was<00:04:54.790> more<00:04:55.680> something<00:04:56.680> slightly

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
canvas was more something slightly

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.190 
canvas was more something slightly
relative<00:04:57.790> to<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.000> work<00:04:58.150> I'll<00:04:58.330> do<00:04:58.510> exterior<00:04:59.050> on

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
relative to the work I'll do exterior on

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.260 
relative to the work I'll do exterior on
walls<00:04:59.500> because<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.280> still<00:05:00.520> focuses<00:05:01.000> on<00:05:01.150> the

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
walls because it still focuses on the

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.870 
walls because it still focuses on the
line<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.750> structure<00:05:02.200> and<00:05:02.410> this<00:05:03.370> idea<00:05:03.640> of

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
line the structure and this idea of

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.720 
line the structure and this idea of
balance<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:04.860> then<00:05:05.860> playing<00:05:06.190> off<00:05:06.400> different

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
balance and then playing off different

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.090 
balance and then playing off different
colors<00:05:07.050> gives<00:05:08.050> it<00:05:08.200> a<00:05:08.260> different<00:05:08.590> energy<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:09.070> a

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
colors gives it a different energy and a

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.090 
colors gives it a different energy and a
flow<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.610> I<00:05:10.030> have<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.330> contrast<00:05:10.960> those<00:05:11.770> works

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
flow and I have to contrast those works

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.520 
flow and I have to contrast those works
against<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.700> collage<00:05:13.300> work<00:05:13.630> which<00:05:14.110> you<00:05:14.350> see

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
against the collage work which you see

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.700 
against the collage work which you see
it's<00:05:14.710> all<00:05:14.950> same<00:05:15.760> more<00:05:15.940> artists<00:05:16.390> but<00:05:16.660> you<00:05:17.560> see

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
it's all same more artists but you see

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.160 
it's all same more artists but you see
there's<00:05:17.890> different<00:05:18.220> techniques<00:05:18.670> and<00:05:19.170> again

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
there's different techniques and again

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.570 
there's different techniques and again
it's<00:05:20.290> pretty<00:05:20.440> much<00:05:20.560> reduced<00:05:20.740> me<00:05:20.950> being<00:05:21.250> giving

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
it's pretty much reduced me being giving

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.410 
it's pretty much reduced me being giving
it<00:05:21.670> a<00:05:21.730> chance<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:21.970> showcase<00:05:22.180> different

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
it a chance to showcase different

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.550 
it a chance to showcase different
techniques<00:05:23.140> and<00:05:24.030> how<00:05:25.030> those<00:05:25.210> can<00:05:25.540> play<00:05:26.260> off

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
techniques and how those can play off

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.590 
techniques and how those can play off
the<00:05:26.830> other<00:05:26.950> artists<00:05:27.310> work<00:05:27.490> um<00:05:27.970> I'm<00:05:28.330> always
