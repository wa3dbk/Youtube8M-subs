so<00:00:29.970> we've<00:00:30.150> made<00:00:30.359> every<00:00:30.840> GM<00:00:31.320> harness<00:00:33.200> necessary

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
so we've made every GM harness necessary

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.500 
so we've made every GM harness necessary
to<00:00:34.410> swap<00:00:34.680> any<00:00:34.980> kind<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.340> GM<00:00:35.670> engine<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.180> ever

a couple different lengths of these

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.029 
a couple different lengths of these
harnesses<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.930> end<00:01:01.260> user<00:01:01.410> has<00:01:01.890> some

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
harnesses so the end user has some

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.709 
harnesses so the end user has some
options<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.520> far<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.699> computer<00:01:03.090> mounting<00:01:03.539> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
options as far as computer mounting and

usability yeah if you had a Gen 1 Camaro

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.390 
usability yeah if you had a Gen 1 Camaro
you<00:01:06.330> want<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> put<00:01:06.750> an<00:01:06.840> LS<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.159> plenty

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you want to put an LS in you have plenty

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.370 
you want to put an LS in you have plenty
of<00:01:08.520> glovebox<00:01:09.030> room<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.630> put<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> computer<00:01:10.140> in

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
of glovebox room to put the computer in

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320 
of glovebox room to put the computer in
there<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.400> our<00:01:11.610> standard<00:01:11.790> 4<00:01:12.119> foot

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
there so it's just our standard 4 foot

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.210 
there so it's just our standard 4 foot
length<00:01:12.540> harness<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.470> let's<00:01:13.710> say<00:01:13.830> you're<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
length harness but let's say you're in a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.820 
length harness but let's say you're in a
male<00:01:14.400> well<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.360> no<00:01:15.509> -<00:01:15.750> alright<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.619> guess

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
male well there is no - alright so guess

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.310 
male well there is no - alright so guess
what<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.340> had<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> put<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> computer<00:01:18.000> into

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
what we had to put the computer into

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.870 
what we had to put the computer into
underneath<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> seat<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.670> for

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
underneath the seat so that and for

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.399 
underneath the seat so that and for
those<00:01:20.970> applications<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.750> make<00:01:21.900> an<00:01:22.020> eight-foot

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
those applications we make an eight-foot

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.890 
those applications we make an eight-foot
version<00:01:23.220> excellent<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:24.780> was

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
version excellent you know there was

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.450

there was a time when if a guy wanted to
do<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.729> swap<00:01:27.030> he<00:01:27.240> went<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> junkyard

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
do this swap he went to the junkyard

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.510 
do this swap he went to the junkyard
bought<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> motor<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.009> there<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.310> took

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
bought the motor out of there and took

the wiring harness of whatever he was
yanking<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.259> out<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> became<00:01:32.189> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
yanking it out of and then it became a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.560 
yanking it out of and then it became a
nightmare<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.850> cutting<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.210> thing<00:01:33.420> and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
nightmare of cutting the thing and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.300

pumps<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.630> takes<00:01:45.869> about<00:01:46.079> an

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
pumps and like that it takes about an

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.440 
pumps and like that it takes about an
hour<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> harness<00:01:47.369> that's<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.090> cuz

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
hour to do the harness that's it cuz

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.370 
hour to do the harness that's it cuz
everything's<00:01:48.840> plug-and-play
