00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469

Anna I think the biggest thing for me in
playing<00:04:00.060> her<00:04:00.300> was<00:04:00.510> actually<00:04:00.900> accepting<00:04:01.770> that

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
playing her was actually accepting that

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.340 
playing her was actually accepting that
she's<00:04:02.340> an<00:04:02.459> antihero<00:04:02.850> as<00:04:03.180> much<00:04:03.510> as<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.840> hero<00:04:04.050> and

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
she's an antihero as much as a hero and

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.199 
she's an antihero as much as a hero and
accepting<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.160> there<00:04:05.340> is<00:04:05.490> a<00:04:05.520> judgment<00:04:06.120> in

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
accepting that there is a judgment in

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.730 
accepting that there is a judgment in
the<00:04:06.330> piece<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.569> her<00:04:06.840> actions<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.500> isn't

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
the piece of her actions and it isn't

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.890 
the piece of her actions and it isn't
necessarily<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.520> positive<00:04:09.030> one<00:04:09.240> do<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.510> want<00:04:09.630> you
