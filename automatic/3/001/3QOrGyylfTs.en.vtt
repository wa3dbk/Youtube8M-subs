that I very unfairly banished all other

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.530 
that I very unfairly banished all other

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
forms of nail polish from my home the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.539 
forms of nail polish from my home the
moment<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.990> learned<00:00:13.230> about<00:00:13.440> formula<00:00:14.160> axe<00:00:14.340> for

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.760 
moment I learned about formula axe for
Sephora<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.540> feel<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.080> lot<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.350> ways<00:00:16.500> that

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
Sephora and I feel in a lot of ways that

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.890 
Sephora and I feel in a lot of ways that
was<00:00:16.890> rightfully<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:17.670> because<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.449> was<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.869> good

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
was rightfully so because it was so good

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.140 
was rightfully so because it was so good
and<00:00:19.650> innovative<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.640> was<00:00:20.820> at<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
and innovative for what it was at the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.029 
and innovative for what it was at the
time<00:00:21.330> because<00:00:22.050> basically<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.650> took<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
time because basically it took the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.370 
time because basically it took the
concept<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.699> gel<00:00:24.000> polish<00:00:24.480> which<00:00:24.990> was<00:00:25.170> so

my head that because it was creative

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.640 
my head that because it was creative
nail<00:02:38.970> design<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.840> was<00:02:40.020> going<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.320> be<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> lot

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
nail design it was going to be a lot

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.890 
nail design it was going to be a lot
more<00:02:40.680> expensive<00:02:41.460> than<00:02:41.760> what<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.000> pay<00:02:42.270> for<00:02:42.300> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
more expensive than what I pay for the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.810 
more expensive than what I pay for the
formula<00:02:43.350> axe<00:02:43.500> for<00:02:43.770> example<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.790> think

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
formula axe for example and I think

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.960 
formula axe for example and I think
these<00:02:45.150> are<00:02:45.210> 1099<00:02:46.080> apiece<00:02:46.730> sometimes<00:02:47.730> they<00:02:47.880> are

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
these are 1099 apiece sometimes they are

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.580 
these are 1099 apiece sometimes they are
a<00:02:48.030> little<00:02:48.180> more<00:02:48.300> expensive<00:02:48.540> if<00:02:49.290> it's<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:49.560> a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
a little more expensive if it's like a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.620 
a little more expensive if it's like a
special<00:02:49.890> topcoat<00:02:50.430> or<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> special<00:02:51.060> effect<00:02:51.390> it's

professional only or too expensive and I
didn't<00:03:14.640> really<00:03:14.820> look<00:03:14.940> into<00:03:15.240> it<00:03:15.390> because<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.690> was

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
didn't really look into it because I was

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.180 
didn't really look into it because I was
so<00:03:15.930> happy<00:03:16.140> with<00:03:16.440> what<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.620> had<00:03:16.800> already<00:03:16.980> been

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
so happy with what I had already been

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.420 
so happy with what I had already been
using<00:03:17.430> we<00:03:17.790> got<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.940> good<00:03:18.060> one<00:03:18.239> here<00:03:19.250> it's<00:03:20.250> good

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
using we got a good one here it's good

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.820 
using we got a good one here it's good
so<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.360> is<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.840> first<00:03:22.200> color<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.800> I

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
so this is the first color that I

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.699 
so this is the first color that I
decided<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.780> give<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.959> shot<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.680> thought

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
decided to give a shot and I thought

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.680 
decided to give a shot and I thought
there<00:03:26.220> were<00:03:26.310> two<00:03:26.519> reasons<00:03:26.760> why<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.180> would<00:03:27.540> pick

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
there were two reasons why I would pick

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.690 
there were two reasons why I would pick
a<00:03:27.720> color<00:03:27.989> like<00:03:28.230> this<00:03:28.410> one<00:03:28.860> because<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:29.640> is

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
a color like this one because this is

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.449 
a color like this one because this is
kind<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.090> what<00:03:30.239> I'm<00:03:30.330> into<00:03:30.630> lately<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.260> two<00:03:32.100> if

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
kind of what I'm into lately and two if

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.490 
kind of what I'm into lately and two if
you're<00:03:32.640> really<00:03:32.820> gonna<00:03:33.000> judge<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.480> line<00:03:33.780> you

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
you're really gonna judge a line you

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.290 
you're really gonna judge a line you
have<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.769> judge<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.010> by<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.340> light<00:03:35.640> color<00:03:35.910> in<00:03:36.180> my

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
have to judge it by a light color in my

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.330 
have to judge it by a light color in my
opinion<00:03:36.690> because<00:03:36.980> there<00:03:37.980> are<00:03:38.100> all<00:03:38.190> these

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
opinion because there are all these

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.220 
opinion because there are all these
factors<00:03:38.820> that<00:03:38.850> go<00:03:39.150> into<00:03:39.300> whether<00:03:39.720> or<00:03:39.810> not<00:03:39.930> it's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
factors that go into whether or not it's

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.470 
factors that go into whether or not it's
worth<00:03:40.500> trying<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.250> use<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.060> going<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.360> be

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
worth trying to use is it going to be

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.810 
worth trying to use is it going to be
streaky<00:03:43.019> is<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.380> going<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.739> take<00:03:43.950> forever<00:03:44.250> to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
streaky is it going to take forever to

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.570 
streaky is it going to take forever to
dry<00:03:45.030> is<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.989> practice<00:03:46.920> itself<00:03:47.160> gonna<00:03:47.430> get

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
dry is the practice itself gonna get

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.610 
dry is the practice itself gonna get
floppy<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.239> container<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.780> not<00:03:49.290> be<00:03:49.440> worth

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
floppy in the container and not be worth

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.410 
floppy in the container and not be worth
using<00:03:50.010> later<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:50.670> this<00:03:50.880> one<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.239> called

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
using later so this one is called

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.979 
using later so this one is called
cakepop<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:53.310> basically<00:03:53.489> says<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.269> put<00:03:54.900> it

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
cakepop and it basically says to put it

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.610 
cakepop and it basically says to put it
on<00:03:55.140> with<00:03:55.709> no<00:03:55.980> base<00:03:56.519> coat<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.290> put<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.440> top

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
on with no base coat and put the top

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.490 
on with no base coat and put the top
coat<00:03:58.860> over<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.220> which<00:03:59.430> was<00:03:59.580> also<00:03:59.790> $8.99<00:04:00.600> now

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500

couldn't not put a base coat on so I

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.840 
couldn't not put a base coat on so I

used the orally rubberized bonder base

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.670 
used the orally rubberized bonder base
coat<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.449> point<00:04:34.690> of<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.900> base<00:04:35.020> coat<00:04:35.319> is<00:04:35.530> to

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
coat the point of the base coat is to

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.499 
coat the point of the base coat is to
even<00:04:35.830> out<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.220> nail<00:04:36.370> bed<00:04:36.639> I<00:04:36.880> mean<00:04:37.120> you<00:04:37.270> can

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
even out the nail bed I mean you can

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.200 
even out the nail bed I mean you can
buff<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:37.990> really<00:04:38.380> smooth<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:39.009> all<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.400> but<00:04:39.940> I

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
buff it really smooth and all that but I

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.730 
buff it really smooth and all that but I
also<00:04:40.389> think<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:40.900> every<00:04:41.380> little

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
also think that every little

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.800 
also think that every little
imperfection<00:04:41.860> in<00:04:42.729> your<00:04:42.940> nail<00:04:43.120> bed<00:04:43.360> is<00:04:43.599> going

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
imperfection in your nail bed is going

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.659 
imperfection in your nail bed is going
to<00:04:43.900> show<00:04:44.229> if<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:44.650> don't<00:04:44.680> have<00:04:45.009> a<00:04:45.039> base<00:04:45.250> coat<00:04:45.490> to

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
just even everything out and smooth it

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.189 
just even everything out and smooth it
all<00:04:47.949> out<00:04:48.130> for<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.580> Polish<00:04:48.940> I<00:04:49.180> did<00:04:49.449> choose<00:04:50.139> to
