00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
doing that I have some hacks from people

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.440 
doing that I have some hacks from people
who<00:03:52.980> submitted<00:03:53.340> them<00:03:53.519> I'm<00:03:53.819> pretty<00:03:54.090> sure<00:03:54.180> lying

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
who submitted them I'm pretty sure lying

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.050 
who submitted them I'm pretty sure lying
around<00:03:54.659> so<00:03:54.930> probably<00:03:55.799> do<00:03:55.980> some<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.400> those<00:03:56.489> next

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
around so probably do some of those next

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.839 
around so probably do some of those next
and<00:03:57.319> that's<00:03:58.319> about<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.590> wraps<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.250> up<00:03:59.370> Mushroom

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
and that's about it wraps it up Mushroom

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.929 
and that's about it wraps it up Mushroom
Kingdom<00:04:00.439> meltdown<00:04:01.439> is<00:04:01.739> over<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:02.489> now<00:04:02.519> and

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
Kingdom meltdown is over for now and

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.899 
Kingdom meltdown is over for now and
there<00:04:03.440> may<00:04:04.440> or<00:04:04.620> may<00:04:04.739> not<00:04:04.769> be<00:04:04.919> a<00:04:05.069> third<00:04:05.579> one<00:04:05.729> that

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
there may or may not be a third one that

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.360 
there may or may not be a third one that
is<00:04:06.030> already<00:04:06.299> out<00:04:06.449> but<00:04:06.659> I<00:04:06.690> didn't<00:04:07.019> see<00:04:07.199> it<00:04:07.319> or<00:04:07.560> a

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
is already out but I didn't see it or a

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.789 
is already out but I didn't see it or a
third<00:04:08.699> one<00:04:08.849> coming<00:04:09.180> out<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:09.599> if<00:04:10.199> one<00:04:10.560> does

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
third one coming out so if one does

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.990 
third one coming out so if one does
happen<00:04:11.099> to<00:04:11.430> find<00:04:11.669> its<00:04:11.909> way<00:04:12.090> into<00:04:12.389> my<00:04:14.000> knowledge

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
happen to find its way into my knowledge

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.110 
happen to find its way into my knowledge
base<00:04:15.329> then<00:04:15.629> I<00:04:15.780> will<00:04:16.019> probably<00:04:16.289> do<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:17.120> overall

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
base then I will probably do it overall

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.520 
base then I will probably do it overall
better<00:04:18.299> than<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.570> first<00:04:18.750> sky<00:04:19.139> rid<00:04:19.289> of<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.440> lot

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
better than the first sky rid of a lot

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.009 
better than the first sky rid of a lot
of<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.769> crappy<00:04:20.039> slow<00:04:20.459> down<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.930> know

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
of that crappy slow down and you know

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.870 
of that crappy slow down and you know
popped<00:04:22.320> up<00:04:22.500> occasionally<00:04:22.770> but<00:04:23.159> nowhere<00:04:23.550> near

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
popped up occasionally but nowhere near

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.629 
popped up occasionally but nowhere near
as<00:04:23.909> bad<00:04:24.240> is<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.770> is<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.949> first<00:04:26.190> hack<00:04:26.430> so

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
as bad is that is the first hack so

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.979 
as bad is that is the first hack so
that's<00:04:26.789> pretty<00:04:26.940> much<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.120> I'm<00:04:27.979> gone
