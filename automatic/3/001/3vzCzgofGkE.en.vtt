can see it sort of through the back

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.610 
can see it sort of through the back
although<00:00:38.450> it's<00:00:38.600> an<00:00:38.690> opaque<00:00:38.960> black<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:39.470> can

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
although it's an opaque black you can

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.710 
although it's an opaque black you can
still<00:00:39.830> kind<00:00:39.980> of<00:00:40.070> see<00:00:40.130> what<00:00:40.460> how<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.760> flame<00:00:41.510> was

there<00:00:42.760> it's<00:00:43.760> also<00:00:43.880> ordered<00:00:44.210> with<00:00:44.300> gold

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
there it's also ordered with gold

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.570 
there it's also ordered with gold
hardware<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:46.960> I<00:00:47.960> think<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.950> black<00:00:49.280> and

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
hardware and I think that the black and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.070 
hardware and I think that the black and
gold<00:00:49.670> combination<00:00:50.030> some<00:00:50.540> I<00:00:50.600> was<00:00:50.750> trying<00:00:50.960> to

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
gold combination some I was trying to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.440 
gold combination some I was trying to
come<00:00:51.379> up<00:00:51.410> with<00:00:51.620> something<00:00:52.070> approximating<00:00:52.790> BB

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
come up with something approximating BB

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.290 
come up with something approximating BB

it's<00:01:16.790> very<00:01:17.060> solid<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.690> switch<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.170> working

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
it's very solid the switch is working

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.180 
it's very solid the switch is working
perfectly<00:01:19.220> just<00:01:19.580> like<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.760> should<00:01:21.130> it's<00:01:22.130> not

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
perfectly just like it should it's not

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.190 
perfectly just like it should it's not
moving<00:01:22.580> at<00:01:22.670> all<00:01:22.820> but<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:23.360> visible<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.110> know

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
moving at all but it's visible you know

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.100 
moving at all but it's visible you know
it's<00:01:24.350> not<00:01:24.470> like<00:01:24.530> maybe<00:01:24.950> fix<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.870> that<00:01:26.990> it

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
it's not like maybe fix it so that it

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.020 
it's not like maybe fix it so that it
was<00:01:27.200> not<00:01:27.440> able<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.250> be<00:01:28.340> seen<00:01:28.370> that<00:01:28.760> probably

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
was not able to be seen that probably

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.060 
was not able to be seen that probably
could<00:01:29.180> be<00:01:29.240> done<00:01:29.540> I<00:01:29.780> think<00:01:30.530> someone<00:01:30.770> could<00:01:30.950> go

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
could be done I think someone could go

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.680 
could be done I think someone could go
back<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.280> refinish<00:01:32.000> this<00:01:32.120> little<00:01:32.360> section

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
back and refinish this little section

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.980 
back and refinish this little section
and<00:01:32.780> be<00:01:32.930> fine

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and be fine

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.010
