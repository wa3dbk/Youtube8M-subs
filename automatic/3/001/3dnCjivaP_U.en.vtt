make always use sterile tools when you
cut<00:01:08.259> off<00:01:08.290> leaves<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:09.159> can<00:01:09.369> use<00:01:09.549> single<00:01:09.850> edge

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
cut off leaves you can use single edge

cut off leaves you can use single edge
razor<00:01:10.030> blades<00:01:10.659> they<00:01:10.930> work<00:01:11.110> very<00:01:11.380> very<00:01:11.470> well

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
razor blades they work very very well

and remove all of that damaged portion

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.590 
and remove all of that damaged portion
now<00:01:47.190> we<00:01:48.190> don't<00:01:48.310> want<00:01:48.580> to<00:01:48.670> put<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.120> back<00:01:49.360> into

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
now we don't want to put this back into

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.010 
now we don't want to put this back into
the<00:01:49.810> growing<00:01:50.050> area<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.770> have<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.460> leaf

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the growing area and have that leaf

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.840 
the growing area and have that leaf
exposed<00:01:53.020> because<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.770> may<00:01:53.950> get<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.190> fungal<00:01:54.700> or

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850

exposed because you may get a fungal or
bacterial<00:01:55.360> infection<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.890> we're<00:01:56.980> going<00:01:57.070> to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
bacterial infection so we're going to

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.890 
bacterial infection so we're going to
treat<00:01:57.370> that<00:01:57.610> with<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:57.970> little<00:01:58.240> bit<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.480> a<00:01:58.600> paste

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
treat that with a little bit of a paste

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.740 
treat that with a little bit of a paste
made<00:01:59.710> from<00:01:59.740> a<00:02:00.160> good<00:02:00.340> fungicide<00:02:00.910> in<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.510> case

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
made from a good fungicide in this case

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.260 
made from a good fungicide in this case
I'm<00:02:01.960> using<00:02:01.990> time<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.830> works<00:02:03.460> very<00:02:03.730> well<00:02:03.880> for

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
I'm using time it works very well for

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.780 
I'm using time it works very well for
our<00:02:04.480> purpose<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.950> take<00:02:06.160> a<00:02:06.190> little<00:02:06.460> bit<00:02:06.640> of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
our purpose we take a little bit of

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.580 
our purpose we take a little bit of
thigh<00:02:07.000> melt

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.830 

put<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.680> in<00:02:11.800> water<00:02:13.710> stir<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:14.980> up<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.630> form<00:02:16.630> a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
fairly thick paste like solution and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.980 
fairly thick paste like solution and
then<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:22.990> coat<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:25.000> cut<00:02:25.240> surface<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.810> the

then just coat the cut surface of the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.320 
then just coat the cut surface of the
leaf

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330
