00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
zoom in zoom it right so we can see that

this is the throw knife it says was our

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.060 
this is the throw knife it says was our
retrieval<00:00:42.300> knife<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:43.050> causes<00:00:43.559> instant

retrieval knife that causes instant

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.270 
retrieval knife that causes instant
death<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.760> impact<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.920> can<00:00:46.920> see<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.129> only

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
death on impact and you can see I only

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.869 
death on impact and you can see I only
costs<00:00:47.850> five<00:00:48.149> squat<00:00:48.570> points<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.700> pretty<00:00:50.700> cheap

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
costs five squat points so pretty cheap

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.840 
costs five squat points so pretty cheap
alternative<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.870> m33<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:53.730> its

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
alternative in m33 and I think its

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.720 
alternative in m33 and I think its
memory<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.660> well<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:55.230> had<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.579> can

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
memory to as well we had them you can

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.080 
memory to as well we had them you can
lock<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.329> level<00:00:57.690> 5<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:59.160> hoping<00:00:59.820> that

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
lock it at level 5 so I'm hoping that

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.029 
lock it at level 5 so I'm hoping that
this<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.329> he<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.620> seems<00:01:01.890> as

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
this is he with this because it seems as

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.729 
this is he with this because it seems as
though<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:03.000> frag<00:01:03.300> grenade<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> subtext

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
though the frag grenade and the subtext

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.600 
though the frag grenade and the subtext
are<00:01:05.159> also<00:01:05.430> no<00:01:06.270> default<00:01:06.960> grenades<00:01:07.740> which<00:01:08.040> you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
are also no default grenades which you

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.060 
are also no default grenades which you
are<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.240> automatically<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.619> through<00:01:10.830> life

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
are not automatically so through life

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.550 
are not automatically so through life
must<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.400> something<00:01:11.970> which<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:13.170> happens

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
must be something which just happens

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.770 
must be something which just happens
after<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.850> yeah<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> good<00:01:15.390> look<00:01:15.600> at

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
after that but yeah have a good look at

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.890 
after that but yeah have a good look at
the<00:01:15.869> screen<00:01:16.140> shot<00:01:17.119> it's<00:01:18.119> there<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.600> back

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the screen shot it's there it's back

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.620 
the screen shot it's there it's back
through<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> knife<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.189> looks<00:01:20.939> much<00:01:21.390> better

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
through a knife it looks much better

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.600 
through a knife it looks much better

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340

one's<00:01:26.549> obvious<00:01:26.729> rubbish<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.049> come<00:01:28.430> it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
one's obvious rubbish you as I come it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.010 
one's obvious rubbish you as I come it
was<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.880> normal<00:01:30.119> life<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.810> knife

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
was just a normal life that a knife

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.899 
was just a normal life that a knife
between<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.619> should<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.920> used<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.460> stab

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
between you should know used to stab

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.910 
between you should know used to stab
people<00:01:32.990> exactly<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> same<00:01:34.320> thing<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
people exactly the same thing as the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.880 
people exactly the same thing as the
tactical<00:01:35.430> knife<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:37.200> looks<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.560> bit<00:01:37.710> more

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
tactical knife so this looks a bit more

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.719 
tactical knife so this looks a bit more
better<00:01:38.250> serrated<00:01:38.729> edge<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:41.369> looks<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.640> it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
better serrated edge it looks like it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.539
