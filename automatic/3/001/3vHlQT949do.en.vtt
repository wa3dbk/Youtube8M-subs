00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:17.660
 and or charles bronson here 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.990
 I conclude the game closes the game has been released 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.320
 two weeks on xbox live and is exclusive 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.770
 for xbox 360 and I will show only one 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.750
 bit of the game this is the demo that is 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.700
 available for download 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.230
 free 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.050
 that is if you want to check the game 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.070
 after that video you can go there and 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.260
 download 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.930
 but as I said it is an exclusive game of the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.370
 xbox 360 then you will not find it 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.830
 no playstation 3 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.900
 obvious that it is an exclusive game but how 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.750
 everything for me here at the beginning of the game 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.070
 the graphic art of the game is very very 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.710
 very beautiful 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.160
 so if you like games like art 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.860
 different graphic with a graphic design 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.470
 different check out party I'm sure 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.530
 You'll like it but need it on 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.530
 moment that cubinho there turning him 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.210
 is explaining the history of the game and he 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.520
 said that one as larger the golden body 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.679
 was broken in several parts you 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.880
 You need to find these parts is not 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.710
 universe will end 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.999
 So he said that so you can talk to him. 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.340
 have to find the total body 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:25.159
 then your mission find the pieces 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.630
 of themselves and how much bigger they are. 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.689
 golden pieces 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.299
 so good of history and now it is 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.939
 only start the game and the mechanics of the game is 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.590
 very simple a button jumps 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.069
 Of course when I think left 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.560
 you control the character and the great 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:45.020
 differential of the game is the following you 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.109
 pressing the rb or lb 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.240
 You spin the scenery as I just 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.850
 to do at that exact moment or 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.880
 You solve the puzzles of the game you 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.600
 need to turn the stage is pretty cool as well 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.179
 interesting and very innovative and let's go 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.450
 I'll show this phase maybe a little 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.660
 next so you can 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.680
 understand a little bit of the game but the same 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.670
 I took the scenery that I did not have to do 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.590
 correct twist scenario and you maybe 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.150
 find a solution but I can not 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.170
 get there its popular then I 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.250
 I do 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.080
 direct one more time i'll get it 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.910
 get on that platform then it 's okay 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.860
 interesting this mechanics of jirau 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.420
 scenario 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.330
 I think it's cool, you can go to the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.890
 two sides is not just the right side 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.840
 How I am doing this document to you? 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.610
 can rotate both on the right and 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.739
 on the left side as shown here 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:52.900
 little I want to go left foot lb and 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:56.560
 virtues that such air plus a platform 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.560
 the last one here 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.569
 so this is the great innovation of the game 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.720
 this possibility of you being able to 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.580
 control the scenery by rotating the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.680
 well I fell because I do not have the version 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.360
 complete of the game then it causes 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.120
 You die but you come back there 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.000
 those animals there or that duckling 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.819
 checkpoint I'm not mistaken, I have to 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.319
 reaching that door upstairs left 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:28.300
 sudden and friendly manner have spoken to 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.500
 checkpoint will now spin until they appear 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:36.070
 the door to door 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.280
 crazy up I go in the other 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.280
 dimension 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.690
 now the clubinho explains that in this 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.390
 part in this dimension there are several 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.120
 and I need several parts of the 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.000
 cube so I can open other 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.250
 ports and and so I can access 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.010
 other parts of the world then you arrive 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.230
 here it 's like a lobby to speak 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.810
 the truth because then you come with your 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.910
 parts of the cube and you can access 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.620
 other very much used stages in the game to 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.959
 mario galaxy 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.390
 You have to collect all the 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.190
 stars and this is the same style and is 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.489
 I had all the parts of Cuba 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.530
 could enter into that door that 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.270
 I do not have to, I have to get to 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.220
 that door up there 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:36.610
 iraq for me to see if I can 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:38.260
 find there I got as solving the 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.240
 podium spinning the scenery is well 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.690
 interesting 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.340
 I'll show you this little piece here 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.290
 that you can have a little more 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.330
 game a bit more graphic as a graphic 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.330
 beautiful I found the graphic impressive 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.600
 and a curiosity that is produced by 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.479
 only one person who took several years 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.300
 right to get more this was the dream 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.970
 from him he got and can play the 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.070
 result of a very interesting dream 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.070
 It gets up there. 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.659
 but that's it folks I found up here and 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.699
 sure I'll want I'll buy 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.099
 the game because I want to check the game 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.680
 complete because I like games with 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.409
 different graphic art and such I like 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.210
 game but if you want to check the game 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.319
 As I said, it's available on xbox. 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.349
 live 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:37.000
 you can go in there buy direct or 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.129
 You want you can play that in. 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.099
 playing this document to test for 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:45.129
 see if you like it and such and I recommend it 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.849
 I think it's cool, I recommend it but that's it 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:47.849
 the next video
