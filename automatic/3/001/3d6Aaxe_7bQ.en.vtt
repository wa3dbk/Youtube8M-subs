00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.220
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.960
 I will show you how to put 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.169
 cheat codes on call of duty black 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.050
 ops zombies in my opinion it works in 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.189
 solo and online I tried just 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.960
 solo but not in laye 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.050
 a lot of people during call of 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.239
 duty and that right clicks show the 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.920
 content of the constrained package is 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.239
 normally there you must have posted 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.220

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.210

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:53.120
 of a macintosh was leaving in a 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.670
 user your computer name 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.100
 then you go to the library 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.010
 if you leave directly there will be 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.410
 not the fish ecology applies to young people 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.860

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.479
 you go back into users and we go 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.910
 so many indicators then 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.460
 library then application 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.470
