okay<00:00:01.800> so<00:00:01.860> here<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.429> what<00:00:03.270> used<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.540> be<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.689> skein

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
okay so here is what used to be a skein

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:14.660 
okay so here is what used to be a skein
of<00:00:04.200> white<00:00:04.380> yarn<00:00:05.120> it's<00:00:06.120> obviously<00:00:06.750> not<00:00:06.930> now<00:00:13.670> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
of white yarn it's obviously not now and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.000 
of white yarn it's obviously not now and
I'm<00:00:15.089> gonna<00:00:15.179> put<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> plastic<00:00:15.719> bag<00:00:16.010> to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
I'm gonna put it in a plastic bag to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.560 
I'm gonna put it in a plastic bag to
keep<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.340> from<00:00:17.490> rolling<00:00:17.789> around<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.420> this

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
keep it from rolling around because this

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.689 
keep it from rolling around because this
is<00:00:18.690> not<00:00:18.840> coming<00:00:19.140> out<00:00:19.230> through<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> center<00:00:19.740> I

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
is not coming out through the center I

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.080 
is not coming out through the center I
put<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.300> around<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.570> arm<00:00:21.600> here<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.670> I'm<00:00:23.670> going

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
put it around my arm here and I'm going

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.900 
put it around my arm here and I'm going
to<00:00:24.269> take<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> end<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> yarn<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.789> want

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
to take the end of the yarn and I want

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
to take the end of the yarn and I want
to<00:00:26.970> leave<00:00:27.119> by<00:00:27.570> trial-and-error<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> last

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
to leave by trial-and-error of the last

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.259 
to leave by trial-and-error of the last
one<00:00:28.949> well<00:00:29.099> first<00:00:29.340> I'm<00:00:29.460> gonna<00:00:29.609> write<00:00:29.849> wind<00:00:30.150> it

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
one well first I'm gonna write wind it

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.139 
one well first I'm gonna write wind it
around<00:00:30.480> here<00:00:30.689> Kleist<00:00:31.080> twice<00:00:31.759> clockwise<00:00:32.759> gets

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
around here Kleist twice clockwise gets

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.380 
around here Kleist twice clockwise gets
it<00:00:33.300> through<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.950> little<00:00:34.950> yarn<00:00:35.309> guide<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
it through that little yarn guide and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
it through that little yarn guide and
now<00:00:36.829> I'm<00:00:37.829> gonna<00:00:37.980> leave<00:00:38.250> oh<00:00:38.960> about<00:00:39.960> three<00:00:40.230> four

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
now I'm gonna leave oh about three four

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.299 
now I'm gonna leave oh about three four
inches<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.950> yarn<00:00:41.930> for<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.020> tail<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.219> is

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
inches of yarn for the tail and this is

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.470 
inches of yarn for the tail and this is
gonna<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:44.910> comes<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.270> through<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
gonna be what comes up through the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630 
gonna be what comes up through the
middle<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.860> gonna<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> want<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
middle this is gonna be what I want to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.090 
middle this is gonna be what I want to
start<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.989> leave<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> little<00:00:49.800> groove

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
start with so they leave a little groove

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.619 
start with so they leave a little groove
in<00:00:50.219> there<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> set<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.180> not<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
in there to set that in it's not the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.150 
in there to set that in it's not the
best<00:00:51.780> groove<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.530> needs<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> little

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
best groove it needs to be a little

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.260 
best groove it needs to be a little
deeper<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.640> may<00:00:54.149> take<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> file<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.899> fix<00:00:55.199> that

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
deeper I may take a file and fix that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.200 
deeper I may take a file and fix that
and<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> found<00:00:58.170> works<00:00:58.469> best<00:00:58.829> here

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
and so now what I found works best here

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.910 
and so now what I found works best here
is<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:00.510> slowly<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.320> thing<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.770> for

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
is to go slowly for one thing and for

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.619 
is to go slowly for one thing and for
another<00:01:02.039> thing<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> notice<00:01:02.789> my<00:01:02.820> left<00:01:03.180> hand

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
another thing if you notice my left hand

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.899 
another thing if you notice my left hand
which<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.470> put<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> glove<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.040> because<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.489> don't

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
which I put a glove on because I don't

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.760 
which I put a glove on because I don't
like<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> feeling<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.659> yarn<00:01:07.020> run<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
like the feeling of that yarn run it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.590 
like the feeling of that yarn run it
through<00:01:07.890> my<00:01:08.010> hands<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:08.970> pulling<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
through my hands it's like pulling on a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.380 
through my hands it's like pulling on a
rope<00:01:10.640> if<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.760> keep<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> right<00:01:12.420> angle<00:01:12.990> with

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
rope if I keep it at a right angle with

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.780 
rope if I keep it at a right angle with
the<00:01:15.390> yarn<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.740> from<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> spool<00:01:17.490> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the yarn that's going from the spool to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.440 
the yarn that's going from the spool to
the<00:01:18.479> yarn<00:01:18.689> guide<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.939> keeps<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.270> little

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the yarn guide and that keeps a little

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.789 
the yarn guide and that keeps a little
bit<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.750> tension<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.290> not<00:01:22.439> too<00:01:22.590> much<00:01:22.740> just

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
bit of tension on it not too much just

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.950 
bit of tension on it not too much just
enough<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.520> keep<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:24.479> bit<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.780> tension

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
enough to keep a little bit of tension

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.289 
enough to keep a little bit of tension
and<00:01:26.060> turn<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> knobs<00:01:27.330> slowly<00:01:28.460> at<00:01:29.460> first<00:01:29.520> just

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and turn the knobs slowly at first just

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.700 
and turn the knobs slowly at first just
until<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.689> get<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.930> set<00:01:31.110> up<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.619> can

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
until you get it set up and then you can

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.410 
until you get it set up and then you can
go<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:32.009> bit<00:01:32.159> faster<00:01:34.970> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.060> go<00:01:36.150> too

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
go a little bit faster if you go too

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.690 
go a little bit faster if you go too
fast<00:01:36.600> sometimes<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.140> throws<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.680> yarn<00:01:38.490> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
fast sometimes it throws that yarn that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.999 
fast sometimes it throws that yarn that
you<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:39.000> up<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> top<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.650> comes<00:01:40.860> out

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
you have up in the top that comes out

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.090 
you have up in the top that comes out
the<00:01:41.100> middle<00:01:41.369> off<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.509> spool<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.890> doesn't

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the middle off the spool so that doesn't

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.539 
the middle off the spool so that doesn't
work<00:01:44.250> very<00:01:44.460> well<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.799> go<00:01:46.979> kind<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
work very well so I like to go kind of

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:55.660 
work very well so I like to go kind of
slow<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:47.850> first

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.120 

and<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.210> after<00:01:57.390> oh<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:58.410> a<00:01:58.530> few

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and so this is after oh just a few

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.570 
and so this is after oh just a few
minutes<00:01:59.460> of<00:02:00.230> twisting<00:02:01.230> I<00:02:01.410> don't<00:02:01.800> let<00:02:02.340> me<00:02:02.460> so

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
minutes of twisting I don't let me so

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.670 
minutes of twisting I don't let me so
I'm<00:02:02.670> using<00:02:02.940> my<00:02:03.060> fingernail<00:02:03.420> clippers<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.990> cut

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
I'm using my fingernail clippers to cut

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.630 
I'm using my fingernail clippers to cut
that<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.630> I'm<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:06.870> to<00:02:06.960> pull<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.200> yarn

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
make sure so I'm keeping them in little

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:52.900

so this is using another skein of yarn
this<00:03:58.049> one<00:03:58.320> is<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.680> little<00:03:59.250> thicker<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.610> little

this one is a little thicker a little

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.140 
this one is a little thicker a little
bulkier<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.980> can<00:04:02.160> see<00:04:02.340> actually<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.970> did

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
bulkier and you can see actually I did

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.500 
bulkier and you can see actually I did
find<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.510> center<00:04:03.810> on<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.080> one

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
find the center on this one

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.979 
find the center on this one
and<00:04:05.599> so<00:04:06.110> I'm<00:04:06.440> using<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.909> nifty<00:04:08.239> knitters<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:08.959> I

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
and so I'm using the nifty knitters so I

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.690 
and so I'm using the nifty knitters so I
have<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.349> have<00:04:09.440> two<00:04:09.620> skeins<00:04:09.860> of<00:04:10.010> yarn<00:04:10.069> at<00:04:10.370> once

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
have to have two skeins of yarn at once

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.119 
have to have two skeins of yarn at once
rather<00:04:11.540> than<00:04:11.750> buying<00:04:11.959> two<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.560> don't<00:04:12.769> need<00:04:12.950> to

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
rather than buying two I don't need to

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.789 
rather than buying two I don't need to
I'm<00:04:13.250> only<00:04:13.400> making<00:04:13.549> a<00:04:13.790> hat<00:04:14.110> I'm<00:04:15.110> simply<00:04:15.769> using

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
I'm only making a hat I'm simply using

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.189 
I'm only making a hat I'm simply using
this<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.340> make<00:04:16.370> another<00:04:16.699> ball<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.209> that's

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
this to make another ball and that's

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.390 
this to make another ball and that's
really<00:04:18.410> what<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.620> bought<00:04:18.799> this<00:04:18.979> for<00:04:19.190> when<00:04:19.370> I

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
really what I bought this for when I

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.060 
really what I bought this for when I
need<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.639> use<00:04:19.880> two<00:04:20.120> at<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.299> time<00:04:20.329> and<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:21.769> really

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
need to use two at a time and I really

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.500 
need to use two at a time and I really
just<00:04:22.190> don't<00:04:22.370> need<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.580> buy<00:04:22.760> two<00:04:22.820> skeins<00:04:23.210> of

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
just don't need to buy two skeins of

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.460 
just don't need to buy two skeins of
yarn<00:04:23.960> so<00:04:25.240> again<00:04:26.240> through<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.660> guide<00:04:26.870> 90

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
yarn so again through the guide 90

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.200 
yarn so again through the guide 90
degree<00:04:27.740> angle<00:04:28.570> turning<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:30.040> handle<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:31.400> I'm

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
degree angle turning the handle and I'm

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.760 
degree angle turning the handle and I'm
doing<00:04:32.360> a<00:04:32.479> little<00:04:32.570> bit<00:04:32.780> faster<00:04:33.229> now<00:04:33.380> because

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
doing a little bit faster now because

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.350 
doing a little bit faster now because
it's<00:04:33.949> on<00:04:34.630> there<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:36.699> you<00:04:37.699> can<00:04:37.880> just<00:04:37.940> see<00:04:38.210> I'm

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
it's on there and you can just see I'm

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.050 
it's on there and you can just see I'm
making<00:04:38.510> this<00:04:38.810> little<00:04:39.229> ball<00:04:40.070> or<00:04:40.370> cake<00:04:40.610> a<00:04:40.850> lot

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
making this little ball or cake a lot

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.870 
making this little ball or cake a lot
bigger<00:04:41.930> than<00:04:42.289> I<00:04:42.500> did<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.770> last<00:04:42.949> one<00:04:43.130> for<00:04:43.760> one

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
bigger than I did the last one for one

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.450 
bigger than I did the last one for one
thing<00:04:44.030> it's<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.240> bulkier<00:04:44.600> yarn<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:46.220> wanted

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
thing it's a bulkier yarn and I wanted

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.180 
thing it's a bulkier yarn and I wanted
to<00:04:46.550> see<00:04:46.699> just<00:04:46.729> how<00:04:46.970> big<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.360> can<00:04:47.539> make<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.710> I

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
to see just how big I can make it and I

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.920 
to see just how big I can make it and I
didn't<00:04:49.699> want<00:04:49.850> to<00:04:50.090> go<00:04:50.210> much<00:04:50.360> bigger<00:04:50.539> than<00:04:50.750> this

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
didn't want to go much bigger than this

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.610 
didn't want to go much bigger than this
so<00:04:51.139> I<00:04:51.199> went<00:04:51.380> ahead<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.590> cut<00:04:51.919> it<00:04:52.070> here<00:04:52.370> and

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
so I went ahead and cut it here and

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.120 
so I went ahead and cut it here and
again<00:04:54.620> this<00:04:54.740> is<00:04:54.919> a<00:04:54.949> sturdy<00:04:56.260> solid<00:04:57.260> ball<00:04:58.100> of

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
again this is a sturdy solid ball of

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.930 
again this is a sturdy solid ball of
yarn<00:04:59.169> again<00:05:00.169> I'm<00:05:00.530> tucking<00:05:01.039> in<00:05:01.310> that<00:05:01.490> other<00:05:01.699> end

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
yarn again I'm tucking in that other end

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:10.029 
yarn again I'm tucking in that other end
then<00:05:02.090> I<00:05:02.120> just<00:05:02.389> cut<00:05:02.960> off<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:09.650> will<00:05:09.710> get

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
then I just cut off and I will get

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.270 
then I just cut off and I will get
better<00:05:10.250> at<00:05:10.400> this<00:05:10.520> part<00:05:10.789> I<00:05:10.970> hope

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.890 

I'm<00:05:17.280> really<00:05:17.670> enjoying<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:20.750> put<00:05:21.750> your

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900

I'm really enjoying this and put your
thumbs<00:05:22.110> on<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.920> center<00:05:24.170> and<00:05:25.170> you're<00:05:25.380> gonna

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
thumbs on the center and you're gonna

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.110 
thumbs on the center and you're gonna
make<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:26.150> square<00:05:27.150> knot<00:05:27.210> on<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:29.250> loop<00:05:29.790> coming

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
make a square knot on the loop coming

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.240 
make a square knot on the loop coming
out<00:05:30.210> of<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.420> center<00:05:30.690> at<00:05:30.780> least<00:05:30.960> I<00:05:31.110> do<00:05:31.170> so<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.070> can

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
out of the center at least I do so I can

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.100 
out of the center at least I do so I can
find<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.640> easier<00:05:35.060> put<00:05:36.060> my<00:05:36.240> hands<00:05:36.600> around<00:05:36.810> the

find it easier put my hands around the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.720 
find it easier put my hands around the
outside<00:05:38.960> of<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.440> ball<00:05:40.650> put<00:05:41.010> my<00:05:41.130> thumb's<00:05:41.400> on

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
outside of the ball put my thumb's on

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.250 
outside of the ball put my thumb's on
the<00:05:42.060> spool<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:43.160> push<00:05:44.420> and<00:05:45.420> lift<00:05:45.750> it<00:05:45.930> up<00:05:46.050> just

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
the spool and push and lift it up just

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.900 
the spool and push and lift it up just
right<00:05:46.380> and<00:05:46.710> there<00:05:46.920> it<00:05:46.980> is<00:05:47.100> that<00:05:47.310> is<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.550> nice
