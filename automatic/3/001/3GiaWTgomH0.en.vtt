00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.120 
well is the spin move so first I'm going
to<00:00:22.140> go<00:00:22.230> ahead<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.560> into<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.859> throw

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
to go ahead and get into that throw

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.640 
to go ahead and get into that throw
dribble<00:00:23.490> crossover<00:00:23.900> okay<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.470> is

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
dribble crossover okay so what this is

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.170 
dribble crossover okay so what this is
basically<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.820> change<00:00:27.090> of

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
basically it's just a change of

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.150 
basically it's just a change of
direction<00:00:27.330> crossover<00:00:28.140> okay<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> normal

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
direction crossover okay like a normal

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.470 
direction crossover okay like a normal
process<00:00:29.369> over<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:29.880> right<00:00:30.090> we're<00:00:30.269> trying<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
process over here right we're trying to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.569 
process over here right we're trying to
keep<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.720> low<00:00:30.929> under<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> knees<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.369> one

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
keep it low under the knees this one

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.650 
keep it low under the knees this one
since<00:00:32.759> we're<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:32.940> changing<00:00:33.239> directions

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
since we're just changing directions

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.450 
since we're just changing directions
normally<00:00:34.559> you're<00:00:34.680> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> use<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.219> like

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
normally you're going to use this like

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.860 
normally you're going to use this like
we're<00:00:35.640> breaking<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.000> Pratt's<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> full

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
we're breaking a Pratt's going to full

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.900 
we're breaking a Pratt's going to full
speed<00:00:37.170> where<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.440> can't<00:00:37.680> really<00:00:37.860> do<00:00:38.760> it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
speed where you can't really do it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.459 
speed where you can't really do it
crossover<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.230> want<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
crossover like that so you just want to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.010 
crossover like that so you just want to
change<00:00:40.649> directions<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.730> throws<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.870> I'm

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
change directions so the throws so I'm

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.880 
change directions so the throws so I'm
just<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.320> go<00:00:43.410> ahead<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.620> show<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.739> guys

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
just going to go ahead and show you guys

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.540 
just going to go ahead and show you guys
what<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.129> looks<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.370> slow<00:00:45.920> okay<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
what it looks like slow okay so as you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.400 
what it looks like slow okay so as you
guys<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.629> basically<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.140> trying

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
guys can see I'm basically just trying

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.750 
guys can see I'm basically just trying
to<00:00:49.500> cross<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> ball<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> kind<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.550> change

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
to cross the ball I kind of change

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.729 
to cross the ball I kind of change
directions<00:00:51.090> as<00:00:51.329> fast<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.469> let<00:00:52.559> me<00:00:52.620> go

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
directions as fast as I can so let me go

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:05.190 
directions as fast as I can so let me go
ahead<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.890> show<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.100> guys<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> other<00:00:53.550> side

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.200 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.450 

okay<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:06.470> reason<00:01:06.710> that<00:01:06.740> I<00:01:06.860> love<00:01:07.040> this<00:01:07.220> move

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
okay so the reason that I love this move

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.039 
okay so the reason that I love this move
is<00:01:07.700> because<00:01:07.939> when<00:01:08.090> you<00:01:08.180> throw<00:01:08.479> that<00:01:08.540> ball<00:01:08.720> out

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
is because when you throw that ball out

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.300 
is because when you throw that ball out
in<00:01:09.200> front<00:01:09.259> of<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:09.590> you're<00:01:09.979> going<00:01:10.009> to<00:01:10.159> go
