 and friends how are you welcome to this 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.000
 new video where I come to teach you 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.029
 how to download and place the samples 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.140
 for the virtual dj good these simple 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.170
 they can also use it for another 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.000
 thing but I recommend them a lot to see 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.640
 virtual dj and the first thing that we should 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.350
 do to download them is to go to 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.860
 next link that is leaving you in 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.140
 the description of the video 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.880
 ok there we will accept the terms you 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.880
 We will give download or download 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.960
 ok I do not get what accepting 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.280
 because I'm already logged in ok 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.740
 then we have a file in mind 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.870
 how am I going to extract it 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.310
 and well there it begins to extract and while 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.520
 so I'm going to pause the video 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.960
 and after having extracted the file we 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.970
 there will be a folder like the one you see 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.150
 here and where are we going to see the samples that 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.710
 we have in different sections and good 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.140
 then what we should do is open the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.310
 virtual dj that I will also leave it on 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.050

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.080

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.750
 and on a label and well there it starts 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.100
