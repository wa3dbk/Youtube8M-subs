where I took this kilowatt meter say
off-the-shelf<00:00:09.170> $20<00:00:09.740> parameter<00:00:10.370> from<00:00:10.640> Home

off-the-shelf $20 parameter from Home
Depot<00:00:11.210> and<00:00:11.740> I<00:00:12.740> upgraded<00:00:13.250> it<00:00:13.430> to<00:00:13.760> include<00:00:14.270> a

Depot and I upgraded it to include a
wireless<00:00:15.800> XP<00:00:16.279> modem<00:00:16.580> this<00:00:16.730> is<00:00:16.850> a<00:00:16.880> ZigBee

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
wireless XP modem this is a ZigBee

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.890 
wireless XP modem this is a ZigBee
wireless<00:00:18.860> transceiver<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:19.910> that<00:00:20.570> project

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
wireless transceiver and that project

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.000 
wireless transceiver and that project
works<00:00:21.050> pretty<00:00:21.260> well<00:00:21.380> but<00:00:21.710> one<00:00:21.890> of<00:00:21.920> the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
works pretty well but one of the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.700 
works pretty well but one of the
questions<00:00:22.460> people<00:00:22.610> keep<00:00:22.940> asking<00:00:23.150> is<00:00:23.539> well<00:00:24.200> by

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
questions people keep asking is well by

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.290 
questions people keep asking is well by
default<00:00:25.100> you<00:00:25.369> know<00:00:25.460> you<00:00:25.520> show<00:00:25.789> that<00:00:25.820> you<00:00:26.150> need

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
default you know you show that you need

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.640 
default you know you show that you need

to have a computer on the computer
receives<00:00:28.369> of<00:00:28.580> that<00:00:28.670> data<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.030> sends<00:00:29.600> it<00:00:29.660> to

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
know isn't that kind of silly to have a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.009 
know isn't that kind of silly to have a
power<00:00:34.640> meter<00:00:34.940> that's<00:00:35.120> on<00:00:35.359> all<00:00:35.539> the<00:00:35.629> time<00:00:35.809> like

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
power meter that's on all the time like

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:37.360 
power meter that's on all the time like
would<00:00:36.170> be<00:00:36.350> good<00:00:36.499> if<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.710> was<00:00:36.769> a<00:00:36.890> little<00:00:37.100> power

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
would be good if it was a little power

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.340 
would be good if it was a little power
system<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.480> I'm<00:00:38.659> going<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:38.870> show<00:00:38.929> how<00:00:39.109> I

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
system so I'm going to show how I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.559 
system so I'm going to show how I
actually<00:00:39.589> do<00:00:40.159> this<00:00:40.219> at<00:00:40.429> home<00:00:40.640> because<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:41.359> got

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:41.569 
actually do this at home because I got

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:44.559 
actually do this at home because I got
this<00:00:42.129> $40.00<00:00:43.129> Asus<00:00:43.699> wireless<00:00:44.149> router<00:00:44.390> and

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:44.569 
this $40.00 Asus wireless router and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:47.200 
this $40.00 Asus wireless router and
this<00:00:44.659> is<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:44.809> wireless<00:00:45.530> router<00:00:45.679> we<00:00:45.979> use<00:00:46.190> in<00:00:47.120> the

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
this is a wireless router we use in the

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.959 
this is a wireless router we use in the
apartment<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:47.839> I've<00:00:48.829> upgraded<00:00:49.039> it<00:00:49.460> by<00:00:49.670> adding

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
apartment and I've upgraded it by adding

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.869 
apartment and I've upgraded it by adding
a<00:00:50.499> x3<00:00:51.499> modem<00:00:51.800> just<00:00:52.039> like<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.309> one<00:00:52.460> in<00:00:52.699> the

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
a x3 modem just like the one in the

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.329 
a x3 modem just like the one in the
kilowatt<00:00:53.299> and<00:00:53.539> this<00:00:54.469> one<00:00:54.679> has<00:00:54.829> a<00:00:54.859> nice<00:00:55.039> big

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
kilowatt and this one has a nice big

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.729 
kilowatt and this one has a nice big
antenna<00:00:55.819> so<00:00:56.179> it<00:00:56.299> can<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:57.139> know<00:00:57.170> receive

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
antenna so it can you know receive

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.110 
antenna so it can you know receive
transmissions<00:00:58.399> from<00:00:58.549> all<00:00:58.609> over<00:00:58.639> the<00:00:58.909> place

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
transmissions from all over the place

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.139 
transmissions from all over the place
and<00:00:59.469> these<00:01:00.469> indicator<00:01:00.920> LEDs<00:01:01.370> show<00:01:01.789> when<00:01:01.969> it's

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
and these indicator LEDs show when it's

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.539 
and these indicator LEDs show when it's
on<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.539> receiving<00:01:02.929> data<00:01:02.959> and<00:01:03.519> basically<00:01:04.519> I

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
on and receiving data and basically I

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.399 
on and receiving data and basically I
just<00:01:04.850> upgraded<00:01:05.780> this<00:01:05.869> router<00:01:06.590> with<00:01:06.979> open<00:01:07.640> wrt

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
just upgraded this router with open wrt

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.899 
just upgraded this router with open wrt
according<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:09.619> my<00:01:10.219> Guillaume's<00:01:10.460> excellent

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
according to my Guillaume's excellent

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.179 
according to my Guillaume's excellent
instructions<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.630> then<00:01:12.409> just<00:01:12.770> soldered<00:01:13.100> a

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
instructions and then just soldered a

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.889 
instructions and then just soldered a
lil<00:01:13.369> header<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:13.969> it<00:01:14.060> goes<00:01:14.240> straight<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.780> the

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
lil header and it goes straight to the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.620 
lil header and it goes straight to the
XP<00:01:15.259> this<00:01:15.920> top<00:01:16.130> serial<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.090> it's<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.359> serial

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
XP this top serial and it's a serial

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.510 
XP this top serial and it's a serial
port<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.229> it<00:01:18.289> was<00:01:18.439> pretty<00:01:18.890> easy<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.219> get<00:01:19.399> it

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
port so it was pretty easy to get it

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.819 
port so it was pretty easy to get it
running<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:20.000> then<00:01:20.539> I<00:01:20.630> just<00:01:20.840> run<00:01:21.049> Python<00:01:21.320> on

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
running and then I just run Python on

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.520 
running and then I just run Python on
the<00:01:22.280> router<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.609> so<00:01:23.000> it's<00:01:23.689> acting<00:01:24.109> as<00:01:24.259> an

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
the router and so it's acting as an

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.980 
the router and so it's acting as an
access<00:01:24.859> point<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.399> at<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.609> same<00:01:25.850> time<00:01:26.210> it's

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
access point and at the same time it's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.130 
access point and at the same time it's
also<00:01:27.289> grabbing<00:01:27.920> this<00:01:28.250> ZigBee<00:01:28.880> data<00:01:29.140> parsing

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
also grabbing this ZigBee data parsing

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.660 
also grabbing this ZigBee data parsing
it<00:01:30.289> and<00:01:30.530> then<00:01:30.649> sending<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.100> over<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.369> Wi-Fi

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
it and then sending it over the Wi-Fi

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.669 
it and then sending it over the Wi-Fi
connection<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.329> my<00:01:32.539> Twitter<00:01:32.719> account<00:01:32.810> so

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
connection to my Twitter account so

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.039 
connection to my Twitter account so
people<00:01:33.950> are<00:01:34.039> going<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.369> ask<00:01:34.750> doesn't<00:01:35.750> does

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
people are going to ask doesn't does

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.649 
people are going to ask doesn't does
this<00:01:36.170> interfere<00:01:36.590> with<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:37.039> other<00:01:37.520> wife<00:01:38.390> with

this interfere with the other wife with
the<00:01:38.719> Wi-Fi<00:01:39.020> signal

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
the Wi-Fi signal

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.719 
the Wi-Fi signal
um<00:01:39.679> no<00:01:40.219> there<00:01:40.609> you<00:01:41.359> know<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:42.520> 2.4<00:01:43.520> gigahertz

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
um no there you know the 2.4 gigahertz

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.330 
um no there you know the 2.4 gigahertz
band<00:01:44.119> it's<00:01:44.359> actually<00:01:44.570> pretty<00:01:44.719> wide<00:01:44.899> and

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
band it's actually pretty wide and

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.099 
band it's actually pretty wide and
there's<00:01:46.340> plenty<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.670> space<00:01:46.939> for<00:01:46.999> ZigBee<00:01:47.899> and

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
there's plenty of space for ZigBee and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.529 
there's plenty of space for ZigBee and
Wi-Fi<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.759> know<00:01:49.850> there's<00:01:49.999> tons<00:01:50.149> of<00:01:50.329> stuff

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
Wi-Fi and you know there's tons of stuff

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.060 
Wi-Fi and you know there's tons of stuff
that<00:01:50.570> talks<00:01:50.869> up<00:01:51.020> 2.4<00:01:51.469> gigahertz<00:01:51.679> but<00:01:51.979> this

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
that talks up 2.4 gigahertz but this

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.849 
that talks up 2.4 gigahertz but this
definitely<00:01:52.310> works<00:01:52.490> just<00:01:53.299> fine<00:01:53.539> also<00:01:53.899> both<00:01:54.740> of

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
definitely works just fine also both of

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.380 
definitely works just fine also both of
these<00:01:54.920> are<00:01:55.070> pretty<00:01:55.280> smart<00:01:55.609> protocols<00:01:56.240> and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
these are pretty smart protocols and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.590 
these are pretty smart protocols and
they<00:01:56.479> hop<00:01:56.659> around<00:01:56.929> a<00:01:57.109> little<00:01:57.200> bit

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
they hop around a little bit

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.690 
they hop around a little bit
if<00:01:57.720> they<00:01:57.869> were<00:01:57.930> interfering<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.220> there's

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
if they were interfering and there's

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.149 
if they were interfering and there's
lots<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.909> retransmissions<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.979> certainly<00:02:01.979> had

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
lots of retransmissions so certainly had

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.090 
lots of retransmissions so certainly had
no<00:02:02.340> problems<00:02:02.700> before<00:02:03.619> you<00:02:04.619> know<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.799> it's<00:02:04.920> kind

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
no problems before you know it it's kind

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.800 
no problems before you know it it's kind
of<00:02:05.130> funny<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.340> there's<00:02:05.549> two<00:02:05.820> 2.4<00:02:06.630> gigahertz

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
of funny that there's two 2.4 gigahertz

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.740 
of funny that there's two 2.4 gigahertz
antennas<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.440> here<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:08.060> yeah<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> mean<00:02:09.330> it's

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
antennas on here but yeah I mean it's

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.210 
antennas on here but yeah I mean it's
perfectly<00:02:10.110> fine<00:02:10.319> as<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.560> ZigBee<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.130> is

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
perfectly fine as the ZigBee and this is

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.300 
perfectly fine as the ZigBee and this is
Wi-Fi<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.850> if<00:02:12.420> someone<00:02:12.840> wants<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> see<00:02:13.530> this

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
Wi-Fi and if someone wants to see this

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.640 
Wi-Fi and if someone wants to see this
live<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:14.730> Twitter<00:02:15.330> where<00:02:15.600> do<00:02:15.690> they<00:02:15.780> go<00:02:15.900> they<00:02:16.410> go

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
they want to get all the information for

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.380 
they want to get all the information for
this<00:02:22.050> project<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.920> project<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.730> based<00:02:24.090> off

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
this project this project is based off

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.000 
this project this project is based off
of<00:02:24.420> mighty<00:02:24.930> ohms<00:02:25.140> instructions<00:02:25.739> so<00:02:25.950> you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
of mighty ohms instructions so you

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.070 
of mighty ohms instructions so you
should<00:02:26.310> go<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.850> think<00:02:27.150> my<00:02:27.450> new<00:02:27.510> home<00:02:27.660> calm

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
should go to I think my new home calm

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.590 
should go to I think my new home calm
and<00:02:28.410> look<00:02:28.650> at<00:02:28.800> his<00:02:29.030> Wi-Fi<00:02:30.030> radio<00:02:30.390> and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
and look at his Wi-Fi radio and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
and look at his Wi-Fi radio and
basically<00:02:30.900> follow<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.590> instructions

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
basically follow all the instructions

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.100 
basically follow all the instructions
and<00:02:32.310> then<00:02:32.610> before<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.420> get<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> radio

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
and then before you get to the radio

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.920 
and then before you get to the radio
part<00:02:34.730> install<00:02:35.730> Python<00:02:36.150> instead<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.810> then

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
part install Python instead and then

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.759 
part install Python instead and then
actually<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.560> code<00:02:37.769> just<00:02:38.100> runs<00:02:38.459> as<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:39.500> on<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
actually the code just runs as is on the

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.170 
actually the code just runs as is on the
router<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.310> same<00:02:41.489> code<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.819> runs<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
router the same code that runs on the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.660 
router the same code that runs on the
windows<00:02:42.480> or<00:02:42.510> Linux<00:02:42.870> from<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.110> computer

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
windows or Linux from that computer

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.640 
windows or Linux from that computer
it<00:02:44.670> just<00:02:44.910> basically<00:02:45.480> no<00:02:45.750> edits<00:02:46.110> goes<00:02:46.350> straight

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
it just basically no edits goes straight

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.890 
it just basically no edits goes straight
to<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.489> sort<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.700> Linux<00:02:47.970> computer<00:02:48.330> yeah<00:02:48.720> and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
to this sort of Linux computer yeah and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.789 
to this sort of Linux computer yeah and
if<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.049> don't<00:02:49.200> want<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.380> build<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.620> project

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
if you don't want to build this project

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.590 
if you don't want to build this project
you<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:50.489> still<00:02:50.640> get<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.850> router<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.450> turn

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
you can still get this router and turn

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.530 
you can still get this router and turn
it<00:02:51.720> into<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:52.080> Wi-Fi<00:02:52.680> radio<00:02:53.190> which<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.299> really

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
it into a Wi-Fi radio which is a really

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.000 
it into a Wi-Fi radio which is a really
cool<00:02:54.660> project<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.049> money<00:02:55.290> ohm<00:02:55.470> did<00:02:55.680> too

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
cool project that money ohm did too

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.010 
cool project that money ohm did too
okay<00:02:56.250> well<00:02:56.580> great<00:02:57.799> say<00:02:58.799> goodbye
