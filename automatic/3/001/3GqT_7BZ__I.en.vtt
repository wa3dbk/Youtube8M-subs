the look of those lines and those pores

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.630 
the look of those lines and those pores

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
lotion and this is good for anyone who

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.650 
lotion and this is good for anyone who
does<00:02:20.300> have<00:02:20.510> oily<00:02:20.930> skin<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.730> use<00:02:23.240> this<00:02:23.480> because

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
does have oily skin I use this because

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.400 
does have oily skin I use this because
it's<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.770> moisturizer<00:02:25.370> but<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.420> also<00:02:26.660> controls

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
it's a moisturizer but it also controls

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.080 
it's a moisturizer but it also controls
oil<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.970> lot<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.540> times<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:30.140> royally<00:02:30.590> because

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
oil a lot of times we royally because

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.240 
oil a lot of times we royally because
our<00:02:32.090> skin<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.420> dehydrated<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.770> your<00:02:33.950> skin

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
our skin is dehydrated so your skin

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.070 
our skin is dehydrated so your skin
produces<00:02:35.050> more<00:02:36.050> oils<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:37.220> hydrate<00:02:38.150> itself<00:02:38.540> but

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
produces more oils to hydrate itself but

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.860 
produces more oils to hydrate itself but
then<00:02:39.350> it's<00:02:39.620> over<00:02:39.830> producing<00:02:40.760> ones<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.450> that's

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
then it's over producing ones and that's

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.420 
then it's over producing ones and that's
what<00:02:42.110> leaves<00:02:42.290> us<00:02:42.440> with<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.620> boys<00:02:42.830> can<00:02:43.190> which

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
what leaves us with the boys can which

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.780 
what leaves us with the boys can which
then<00:02:43.750> plug<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.780> pores<00:02:45.320> causing<00:02:45.890> breakouts<00:02:46.280> so

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
then plug the pores causing breakouts so

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.690 
then plug the pores causing breakouts so
using<00:02:47.120> all<00:02:47.480> control<00:02:47.840> lotion<00:02:48.410> you're<00:02:49.250> still

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
using all control lotion you're still

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.610 
using all control lotion you're still
giving<00:02:50.120> your<00:02:50.480> skin<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.840> moisture<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:51.230> needs

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
giving your skin the moisture that needs

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.009 
giving your skin the moisture that needs

where<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.769> need<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.519> I<00:02:55.550> usually<00:02:56.269> just<00:02:56.300> use

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
where you need it so I usually just use

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.270
