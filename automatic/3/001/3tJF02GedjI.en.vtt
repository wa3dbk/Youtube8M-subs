00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
running play we suspect that the defense

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.099 
running play we suspect that the defense
is<00:02:31.459> in<00:02:31.790> man-to-man<00:02:32.030> now<00:02:32.480> we<00:02:32.540> can<00:02:32.810> call<00:02:32.959> the

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
is in man-to-man now we can call the

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.960 
is in man-to-man now we can call the
quick<00:02:33.290> toss<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:34.069> get<00:02:34.250> us<00:02:34.370> out<00:02:34.549> to<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> right

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
quick toss and get us out to the right

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.910 
quick toss and get us out to the right
or<00:02:35.180> if<00:02:35.569> we<00:02:35.750> want<00:02:36.049> we<00:02:36.260> can<00:02:36.379> call<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.650> counter

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
or if we want we can call the counter

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.670 
or if we want we can call the counter
weak<00:02:37.069> but<00:02:37.400> if<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.390> motion<00:02:38.720> across<00:02:38.870> can<00:02:39.230> Walter

weak but if we motion across can Walter
as<00:02:39.859> we<00:02:40.040> did<00:02:40.250> earlier<00:02:40.459> we<00:02:41.150> can<00:02:41.299> give<00:02:41.480> the

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
as we did earlier we can give the

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.629 
as we did earlier we can give the
offense<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.319> same<00:02:42.590> look<00:02:42.889> that<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:43.459> had

offense the same look that it just had

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.940 
offense the same look that it just had
and<00:02:43.939> keep<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.269> defense<00:02:44.599> off<00:02:44.810> guard<00:02:45.109> here<00:02:45.530> his

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
and keep the defense off guard here his

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.470 
and keep the defense off guard here his
man<00:02:46.219> defender<00:02:46.609> follows<00:02:46.969> him<00:02:47.120> across<00:02:47.329> the

formation leaving the edge wide open and
we<00:02:50.269> just<00:02:50.720> miss<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.019> block<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.409> leads<00:02:51.950> us<00:02:52.220> still

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
we just miss a block that leads us still

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.069 
we just miss a block that leads us still
to<00:02:52.849> a<00:02:52.909> first<00:02:53.150> down<00:02:53.329> but<00:02:53.389> we<00:02:53.750> could<00:02:53.989> have

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
to a first down but we could have

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.289 
to a first down but we could have
possibly<00:02:54.290> went<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.859> house<00:02:55.010> there<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:56.120> that

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
possibly went to the house there so that

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.849 
possibly went to the house there so that
is<00:02:56.510> why<00:02:56.659> we<00:02:56.810> want<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.079> use<00:02:57.169> motion<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.739> make

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
is why we want to use motion to make

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.649 
is why we want to use motion to make
everything<00:02:58.159> look<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.609> same<00:02:58.879> time<00:02:59.389> and<00:02:59.569> time

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659

we're going to street Johnson to take

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:23.979 
we're going to street Johnson to take
the<00:03:22.760> safety<00:03:23.000> wave<00:03:23.239> over<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.599> top<00:03:23.780> and

the safety wave over the top and

the<00:03:27.260> fake<00:03:27.500> is<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.739> success<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.280> Walter<00:03:28.819> catches

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
the fake is a success and Walter catches

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.289 
the fake is a success and Walter catches
the<00:03:29.329> pass<00:03:29.479> as<00:03:30.519> we<00:03:31.519> check<00:03:31.729> the<00:03:31.849> fake<00:03:32.000> here<00:03:32.180> we

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
the pass as we check the fake here we

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.849 
the pass as we check the fake here we
can<00:03:32.449> see<00:03:32.599> that<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:32.930> very<00:03:33.199> similar<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.769> the

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
can see that it is very similar to the

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.559 
can see that it is very similar to the
halfback<00:03:34.069> that<00:03:34.519> week<00:03:34.819> run<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.329> we<00:03:35.419> use

halfback that week run that we use

earlier on this Drive many players will
try<00:03:38.419> to<00:03:38.479> play<00:03:38.629> action<00:03:38.900> from<00:03:39.199> formations<00:03:39.769> they

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
try to play action from formations they

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.710 
try to play action from formations they
haven't<00:03:40.190> even<00:03:40.250> run<00:03:40.489> yet<00:03:40.699> in<00:03:40.849> the<00:03:41.000> game<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.540> be

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
haven't even run yet in the game and be

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.180 
haven't even run yet in the game and be
upset<00:03:41.870> when<00:03:42.169> they<00:03:42.229> don't<00:03:42.349> work<00:03:42.560> here<00:03:42.919> we<00:03:43.040> can

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
upset when they don't work here we can

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.530 
upset when they don't work here we can
see<00:03:43.370> if<00:03:43.489> we<00:03:43.519> had<00:03:43.669> tried<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.970> play<00:03:44.120> action<00:03:44.299> fake

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
see if we had tried to play action fake

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.479 
see if we had tried to play action fake
from<00:03:44.750> this<00:03:44.900> run<00:03:45.139> that<00:03:45.290> we<00:03:45.379> haven't<00:03:45.680> tried<00:03:45.829> it

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
from this run that we haven't tried it

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.189 
from this run that we haven't tried it
would<00:03:46.669> make<00:03:46.819> sense<00:03:47.000> if<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.269> defense<00:03:47.599> didn't

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
would make sense if the defense didn't

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.770 
would make sense if the defense didn't
go<00:03:48.409> for<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.650> fade<00:03:49.329> here<00:03:50.329> we're<00:03:50.449> going<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.599> come

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
we're not 100% sure what the defense is

we're not 100% sure what the defense is
in<00:03:54.620> we<00:03:54.979> take<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> guess<00:03:55.579> that<00:03:55.609> it's<00:03:55.909> man-to-man

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269

we<00:03:56.599> try<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.019> audibles<00:03:57.440> with<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.650> quick<00:03:57.889> toss

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
we try and audibles with a quick toss

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.250 
we try and audibles with a quick toss
and<00:03:58.489> see<00:03:58.699> if<00:03:58.760> we<00:03:58.879> can<00:03:59.000> vacate<00:03:59.479> that<00:03:59.510> side<00:03:59.989> by

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
and see if we can vacate that side by

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.629 
and see if we can vacate that side by
motioning<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.739> Walter<00:04:01.010> across<00:04:01.280> again

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
motioning the Walter across again
