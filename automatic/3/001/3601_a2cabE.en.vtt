I<00:00:03.810> want<00:00:04.810> to<00:00:04.900> talk<00:00:05.050> a<00:00:05.080> little<00:00:05.200> bit<00:00:05.410> today<00:00:05.859> about

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:05.950 
I want to talk a little bit today about

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.240 
I want to talk a little bit today about
the<00:00:06.550> use<00:00:07.029> of<00:00:07.060> propecia<00:00:07.660> and<00:00:07.870> hair<00:00:08.020> loss<00:00:08.250> it

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
the use of propecia and hair loss it

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.920 
the use of propecia and hair loss it
seems<00:00:09.460> in<00:00:09.580> the<00:00:09.639> last<00:00:09.850> year<00:00:10.150> so<00:00:10.420> there's<00:00:10.690> been<00:00:10.900> a

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:10.930 
seems in the last year so there's been a

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.650 
seems in the last year so there's been a
lot<00:00:11.410> of<00:00:11.549> controversy<00:00:12.549> about<00:00:12.940> whether<00:00:13.389> or<00:00:13.600> not

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
lot of controversy about whether or not

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.529 
lot of controversy about whether or not
propecia<00:00:14.170> is<00:00:14.520> actually<00:00:15.520> good<00:00:15.730> to<00:00:15.879> use<00:00:16.119> because

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
propecia is actually good to use because

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.290 
propecia is actually good to use because
it<00:00:17.460> potentially<00:00:18.460> could<00:00:18.610> cause<00:00:18.820> some<00:00:19.089> serious

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
it potentially could cause some serious

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.230 
it potentially could cause some serious
long-term<00:00:20.019> side<00:00:20.529> effects<00:00:21.060> which<00:00:22.060> isn't

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
long-term side effects which isn't

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.849 
long-term side effects which isn't
necessarily<00:00:22.720> true<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.289> I<00:00:23.349> wanted<00:00:23.560> to<00:00:23.619> kind<00:00:23.800> of

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
necessarily true and I wanted to kind of

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.919 
necessarily true and I wanted to kind of
clarify<00:00:24.099> this<00:00:24.570> these<00:00:25.570> bits<00:00:25.810> of

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
clarify this these bits of

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.249 
clarify this these bits of
misinformation<00:00:26.289> that<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:27.550> may<00:00:27.699> have<00:00:27.820> heard

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
misinformation that you may have heard

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.390 
misinformation that you may have heard
statistically<00:00:29.259> if<00:00:29.560> you're<00:00:29.859> under<00:00:30.099> fifty

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
statistically if you're under fifty

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.010 
statistically if you're under fifty
years<00:00:30.550> of<00:00:30.699> age<00:00:30.820> between<00:00:31.240> twenty<00:00:31.720> and<00:00:31.749> fifty

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
years of age between twenty and fifty

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.830 
years of age between twenty and fifty
about<00:00:32.950> 90%<00:00:33.579> of<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.700> time<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:34.180> will<00:00:34.360> it<00:00:34.720> will

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
about 90% of the time it will it will

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.970 
about 90% of the time it will it will
stop<00:00:35.170> you<00:00:35.320> from<00:00:35.350> losing<00:00:35.829> more<00:00:35.920> hair

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
stop you from losing more hair

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.410 
stop you from losing more hair
essentially<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.840> opportunity<00:00:38.649> for<00:00:39.420> regrowth

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
essentially the opportunity for regrowth

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.750 
essentially the opportunity for regrowth
or<00:00:40.449> thickening<00:00:40.989> of<00:00:41.140> hair<00:00:41.379> is<00:00:41.530> about<00:00:41.800> 60<00:00:42.280> to<00:00:42.399> 70

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
or thickening of hair is about 60 to 70

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.510 
or thickening of hair is about 60 to 70
percent<00:00:42.910> so<00:00:43.899> there's<00:00:44.590> a<00:00:44.649> big<00:00:44.890> upside<00:00:45.280> there

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
percent so there's a big upside there

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.549 
percent so there's a big upside there
and<00:00:45.699> as<00:00:45.789> far<00:00:45.940> as<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.329> downside<00:00:46.840> what<00:00:47.379> about

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
and as far as the downside what about

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.060 
and as far as the downside what about
side<00:00:47.800> effects<00:00:48.100> well<00:00:48.280> studies<00:00:49.059> were<00:00:49.180> done<00:00:49.359> on

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
side effects well studies were done on

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.029 
side effects well studies were done on
18,000<00:00:51.269> patients<00:00:52.269> so<00:00:52.449> huge<00:00:53.019> numbers<00:00:53.469> here<00:00:53.500> so

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
18,000 patients so huge numbers here so

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.880 
18,000 patients so huge numbers here so
the<00:00:54.340> statistics<00:00:55.000> are<00:00:55.120> valid<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:56.379> side<00:00:56.590> effect

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
the statistics are valid the side effect

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.310 
the statistics are valid the side effect
rate<00:00:57.129> was<00:00:57.309> about<00:00:57.579> 5<00:00:58.149> percent<00:00:58.629> or<00:00:58.809> less<00:00:59.079> so

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
rate was about 5 percent or less so

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.569 
rate was about 5 percent or less so
that's<00:00:59.500> pretty<00:00:59.769> generous<00:00:59.859> it's<00:01:00.340> probably

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
that's pretty generous it's probably

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.259 
that's pretty generous it's probably
about<00:01:00.640> half<00:01:00.940> of<00:01:01.059> that

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
about half of that

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.979 
about half of that
the<00:01:02.050> most<00:01:02.260> notable<00:01:02.710> side<00:01:03.010> effect<00:01:03.390> was<00:01:04.390> sexual

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
the most notable side effect was sexual

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.420 
the most notable side effect was sexual
dysfunction<00:01:05.530> so<00:01:05.710> guys<00:01:05.890> complained<00:01:06.340> of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
dysfunction so guys complained of

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.920 
dysfunction so guys complained of
decreased<00:01:06.820> libido<00:01:07.120> trouble<00:01:07.750> getting

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
decreased libido trouble getting

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.260 
decreased libido trouble getting
erections<00:01:08.140> that<00:01:08.410> sort<00:01:08.740> of<00:01:08.830> thing<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:10.240> the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
erections that sort of thing and the the

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.050 
erections that sort of thing and the the
monograph<00:01:11.200> from<00:01:11.440> Merck<00:01:12.220> says<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.730> these<00:01:12.910> are

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
monograph from Merck says that these are

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.400 
monograph from Merck says that these are
reversible<00:01:13.330> side<00:01:13.780> effects<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.230> in<00:01:14.320> my

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
reversible side effects and in my

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.410 
reversible side effects and in my
experience<00:01:14.530> prescribing<00:01:15.370> propecia<00:01:15.880> for<00:01:16.210> less

experience prescribing propecia for less
14<00:01:17.410> years<00:01:17.680> is<00:01:17.950> that's<00:01:18.430> true

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
14 years is that's true

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.720 
14 years is that's true
simply<00:01:19.750> put<00:01:19.960> all<00:01:20.200> propecia<00:01:20.710> does<00:01:21.010> is<00:01:21.520> it

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
simply put all propecia does is it

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.830 
simply put all propecia does is it
lowers<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.120> hormone<00:01:22.630> called

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
lowers a hormone called

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.950 
lowers a hormone called
dihydrotestosterone<00:01:23.560> or<00:01:24.370> DHT<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:25.630> doesn't

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
dihydrotestosterone or DHT it doesn't

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.840 
dihydrotestosterone or DHT it doesn't
bother<00:01:26.050> testosterone<00:01:26.860> levels<00:01:27.130> at<00:01:27.280> all<00:01:27.400> if<00:01:27.640> you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
bother testosterone levels at all if you

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.420 
bother testosterone levels at all if you
lower<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.210> DHT<00:01:28.810> levels<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.410> a<00:01:30.100> person

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
lower the DHT levels and a person

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.490 
lower the DHT levels and a person
experiences<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.300> side<00:01:31.570> effects<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.200> then

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
experiences the side effects and then

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.560 
experiences the side effects and then
you<00:01:32.620> take<00:01:32.800> away<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.190> medicine<00:01:33.640> that<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.270> DHT

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
you take away the medicine that the DHT

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.570 
you take away the medicine that the DHT
levels<00:01:34.750> will<00:01:35.230> go<00:01:35.350> back<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.560> normal<00:01:35.920> there<00:01:36.430> is

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
levels will go back to normal there is

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.910 
levels will go back to normal there is
no<00:01:36.730> permanent<00:01:37.060> drop<00:01:37.540> in<00:01:37.780> DHT<00:01:38.260> so<00:01:38.470> DHT<00:01:38.890> levels

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
no permanent drop in DHT so DHT levels

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
no permanent drop in DHT so DHT levels
go<00:01:39.280> back<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.580> normal

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
go back to normal

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.750 
go back to normal
that<00:01:40.660> person<00:01:40.990> should<00:01:41.020> go<00:01:41.380> should<00:01:42.040> resume<00:01:42.400> and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
that person should go should resume and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.910 
that person should go should resume and

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
and achieve their normal sexual function

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.330 
and achieve their normal sexual function
again<00:01:45.190> after<00:01:45.550> this<00:01:45.730> cycle<00:01:46.360> goes<00:01:46.780> through

again after this cycle goes through

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.450 
again after this cycle goes through
there<00:01:48.340> have<00:01:48.580> been<00:01:48.730> patients<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.420> have<00:01:49.690> lost

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
there have been patients that have lost

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.460 
there have been patients that have lost
sexual<00:01:51.460> function<00:01:51.880> after<00:01:52.600> taking<00:01:53.020> propecia

sexual function after taking propecia

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.930 
sexual function after taking propecia
and<00:01:53.620> then<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.040> didn't<00:01:54.310> come<00:01:54.460> back<00:01:54.670> after

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
and then it didn't come back after

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.300 
and then it didn't come back after
discontinuing<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:56.020> these<00:01:56.950> are<00:01:57.100> likely

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
discontinuing that these are likely
