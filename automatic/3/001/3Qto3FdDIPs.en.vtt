white<00:03:14.580> version<00:03:14.880> because<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.960> just<00:03:16.080> look<00:03:16.290> at<00:03:16.410> it

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
there's a card under is foot I just

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.040

enjoy<00:05:26.710> that<00:05:26.880> now<00:05:27.880> that<00:05:28.030> black<00:05:28.240> ghost

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
enjoy that now that black ghost

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.930 
enjoy that now that black ghost
I<00:05:29.080> don't<00:05:29.350> enjoy<00:05:29.500> much<00:05:29.770> as<00:05:29.950> the<00:05:30.040> white<00:05:30.280> but

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
I don't enjoy much as the white but

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.220 
I don't enjoy much as the white but
that's<00:05:31.150> just<00:05:31.270> because<00:05:31.420> I<00:05:31.600> don't<00:05:31.840> really<00:05:31.990> think

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
that's just because I don't really think

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.200 
that's just because I don't really think
that<00:05:32.350> they<00:05:32.500> should<00:05:32.680> have<00:05:32.710> done<00:05:32.890> a<00:05:32.920> white<00:05:33.220> so<00:05:34.180> a

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
that they should have done a white so a

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.600 
that they should have done a white so a
thing<00:05:34.660> behind<00:05:34.870> it<00:05:35.080> and<00:05:35.290> this<00:05:35.920> one<00:05:36.130> hasn't<00:05:36.370> been

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
thing behind it and this one hasn't been

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.090 
thing behind it and this one hasn't been
working<00:05:37.210> very<00:05:37.690> well<00:05:38.020> for<00:05:38.200> me<00:05:38.530> because<00:05:38.980> I've

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
working very well for me because I've

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.800 
working very well for me because I've
had<00:05:39.190> this<00:05:39.280> for<00:05:39.460> like<00:05:39.580> three<00:05:40.180> years<00:05:40.420> this<00:05:40.570> one

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
had this for like three years this one

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.020 
had this for like three years this one
and<00:05:41.050> it's<00:05:41.620> kind<00:05:41.860> of<00:05:41.920> a<00:05:42.040> bumping<00:05:42.610> now<00:05:42.760> and

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
and it's kind of a bumping now and

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.550 
and it's kind of a bumping now and
obviously<00:05:43.810> I<00:05:43.900> can't<00:05:44.080> even<00:05:44.170> riffle<00:05:44.530> shuffle

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
obviously I can't even riffle shuffle

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.530 
obviously I can't even riffle shuffle
this<00:05:44.890> one<00:05:45.100> but<00:05:45.580> this<00:05:45.730> one<00:05:45.790> on<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.180> other<00:05:46.210> hand

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
this one but this one on the other hand

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.900 
this one but this one on the other hand
comes<00:05:47.080> in<00:05:47.170> a<00:05:47.260> really<00:05:47.590> nice<00:05:47.680> box<00:05:47.740> looks<00:05:48.550> great

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
comes in a really nice box looks great

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.360 
comes in a really nice box looks great
and<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.450> cards<00:05:49.900> still<00:05:50.170> handle<00:05:50.560> great<00:05:50.740> and

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
and the cards still handle great and

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.800 
and the cards still handle great and
that's<00:05:51.550> why<00:05:51.700> I<00:05:51.730> choose<00:05:52.030> number<00:05:52.360> one<00:05:52.630> because

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
that's why I choose number one because

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.900 
that's why I choose number one because
of<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.080> design<00:05:53.410> the<00:05:53.920> look<00:05:54.190> and<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.490> feel<00:05:54.640> of

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
of the design the look and the feel of

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.850 
of the design the look and the feel of
this<00:05:55.150> deck<00:05:55.420> and<00:05:55.600> because<00:05:56.170> of<00:05:56.200> the<00:05:56.350> price<00:05:56.560> it's

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
this deck and because of the price it's

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.950 
this deck and because of the price it's
not<00:05:57.010> too<00:05:57.220> much<00:05:57.400> but<00:05:57.670> it's<00:05:58.030> just<00:05:58.240> right<00:05:58.540> so

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
not too much but it's just right so

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.840 
not too much but it's just right so
that's<00:05:59.140> why<00:05:59.260> I'm<00:05:59.470> gonna<00:05:59.620> choose<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.400> ghosts

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
that's why I'm gonna choose the ghosts

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.360 
that's why I'm gonna choose the ghosts
as<00:06:01.240> my<00:06:01.480> number<00:06:01.780> one<00:06:01.930> if<00:06:02.590> you<00:06:02.710> have<00:06:02.860> any<00:06:03.010> disks

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
I can't do much about that because we

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.630 
I can't do much about that because we

you do not like my channel there's one

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.900 
you do not like my channel there's one
very<00:06:17.560> simple<00:06:17.890> step<00:06:18.160> and<00:06:18.370> that<00:06:18.430> is<00:06:18.490> to<00:06:18.580> just

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
very simple step and that is to just

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.110 
very simple step and that is to just
unsubscribe<00:06:19.770> your<00:06:20.770> one<00:06:20.950> subscriber<00:06:21.460> I<00:06:21.760> don't
