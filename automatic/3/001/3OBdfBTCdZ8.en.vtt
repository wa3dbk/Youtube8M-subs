 city ​​12 right after capturing a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.570

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.870
 champion 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.420
 first of all of course those 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.700
 they do not know how to unlock 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.700
 respective and that they will look at the 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.080
 chapter of wuxi that if I'll leave that 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.080

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.770
 or more and events will be unlocked 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.700
 Wifi

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.540
 you can go for it, good I'm going to catch 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.860
 some or maybe balls 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.860
 concretely I will take 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.810
 twenty 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.460
 and well we go directly by 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.579
 down here 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.589
 where do we come from the other time 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.680
 They were all the censures of the are 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.920
 medals that sparkled and going down 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.320
 here you need to remember, but there was a 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.740
 rare thing that I said oysters toussaint 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.740
 mt 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.860
 I was around here I do not remember very well 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.420
 I do not remember very well where 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.259
 I placed 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.259
 Somewhere 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.340
 it was here we're going to dodge rebels with 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.340
 bag 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.299
 suddenly 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.190
 we have only one of the dream it is worth what 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.670
 you will be on the reality 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.930
 we have to go here and that's it 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.820
 yes and it will come from nowhere flying wait the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.840
 last of all 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.850
 okay, let's do the departure 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.890
 and we are going to try to capture 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.530
 but before this we can not move away 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.380
 first place of the team 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.069
 to try to put a paralysis and 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.109
 good 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.159
 is going to make it last and you see in 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:20.249
 lucky it's not good to use ammunition that 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:23.480
 that's great as well for paralyzing you 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.480
 will guide change to fire 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.180
 and he knew that from means of cuts and cuts and 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.489
 more cuts 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.519
 As he removes the cut against 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.519
 typical and removes more than half that is 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.540
 very alarming the truth I hope you do not put it 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.540
 another critical hit 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.950
 I have removed a lot 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.310
 let's change to ear 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.950
 to give it to try to hit it good we 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.150
 bust compare normal 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.150
 and we will use 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.950
 high line 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.200
 we will use the channel but most of all for 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.200
 to revive 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.620
 to my sheep because it may be worth a 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.640
 blow that can 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.640
 how to say 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.870
 and can do things 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.480
 let's try to see if the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.650
 premonition and if we are going to do the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.630
 volt wave 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.720
 use last trick but failed 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:40.100
 last so that it never arrives 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.100
 for electric bolt 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.060
 then initiate hits and bursts 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.790
 but I do not worry about anything now 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.910
 we draw water that does not affect these 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.910
 attacks and let's try balls 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.610
 if not then we revive those who are active 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.680
 a little more but good input the 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.110
 first I do not know what happened to this game 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.960
 but good to me and I do not care all 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.790
 legendary equal and good to whom 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.690
 we have to make the first ex 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.680
 see it and it's the pokemon 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.680
 naturex 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.810
 is this pokemon that I do not remember 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.110
 but now that he 's estate here 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.780
 You have to be here, you know, it's 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.780
 here 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.500
 is here, that is, it has to be 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.500
 here 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:57.360
 ayayay this moment 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:00.230
 oh my god this time company company 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.060
 nothing to do 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.060
 where is my company doing 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:12.770
 ok no no no was good no matter what 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.940
 because I've lost time for nothing and 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.940
 let's go 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.419
 yes the tile 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.670
 more than anything because if you leave it in the 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.630
 pretty city 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.340
 Uruguay 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:37.790
 but I 'm not because here in nonsense 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.090
 but I would prefer iraqiya 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.330
 I think that need dies can 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.330
 be 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:51.660
 If it's good here, let's stay for 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:54.280
 here a specific time to see 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.500
 our happy 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:02.330
 we will see them and such attacks 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.330
 do here we have it 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:08.539
 and data 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.939
 it's a faith with mischievous nature so 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.490
 I have left so much with the favorable attack 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:16.159
 and the defense is favorable 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.159
 this can be taken advantage of since 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:21.169
 we can make a physical attack but 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.479
 good 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.909
 it's a little bit strong as you can 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.590
 see do this movement its pulsation 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:31.629
 having exhausted all the others 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.629
 released by the pokemon seriously 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.630
 then you will not use it in your 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.630
 life this attack but good 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.650

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.650

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:07.420

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.610
 we will go to porter king and rock and then 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.490
