 they have written to me a lot asking me for the 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.390
 Well here is the recipe and I hope that 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.440
 you like look let's start with the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.420
 bread the bread must be toasted very 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.940
 important in most people I see 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.979
 that make here balls with the slice of 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.560
 bread and I think that at the time of 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.250
 to serve is very great for us what 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.729
 we do is break it into 2 or 3 cubes 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.159
 centimeters and so it is much easier to the 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.500
 time to serve and also let it 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.470
 combine the ingredients easier 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.539
 you will try then we will make the honey 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.319
 which is very important here I have already 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.369
 one made a piloncillo honey 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.310
 wonderful then we put the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.350
 piloncillo in a saucepan can be 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.869
 granulated or it can be the piece of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.869
 piloncillo let's put 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.690
 cinnamon 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.319
 a little star anise nails and 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.900
 orange peel then you are going to 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.319
 let cook approximately 5 minutes 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.480
 and see what excites have wonderful honey 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.270
 got and the truth that it is very rich 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.550
 in fact my grandmother has jars of this 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.830
 honey in the fridge you put it on the cheese 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.709
 the fruit puts a spoonful of nothing else 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.590
 like a dessert presse is very rich 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.350
 option then honey is already ready and 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.209
 thick good now let's move on to the 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.560
 ingredients is called capirotada because 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.790
 it's a mix of everything 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.480
 then we put the toasted bread to put 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.239
 Toast directly in the oven without 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.160
 butter without oil is not necessary 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.620
 nothing else puts it to toast and when 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.870
 well crispy milestone then if you take it out 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.239
 but do not let it get too dark 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.269
 because you're still going to continue to bake 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.190
 then leave it alone 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.080
 tostadito that you hear tostadito other 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.330

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.620

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.170
 center and the south it is customary to use 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.540
