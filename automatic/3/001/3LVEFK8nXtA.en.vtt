00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.170
 more than a hundred rabbits and guinea pigs are sitting in the shelter 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.170
 their owners have been dumped 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.810

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.930
 this special the name animals handle 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.760
 because more and more rabbits and guinea pigs are out on the street in the woods 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.600

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.860
 so be muted by a perch 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.470
 people start to bunny too quickly in the pet store 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.150
 performs 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.520
 if you don't fall in love with such sweet animals 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.210
 but there is a lot involved 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.370
 you have to take care of them daily 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.720
 they are ten to fifteen years old m you have to be well cared for for a long time and 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.330
 when you go on vacation you have to 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.770

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.560

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.590
 and that while we are not even 8 alpinvest and someone in the area 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.210

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.600
 who dump an animal 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.689
 he has nothing with this 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.450
 my boots and 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.360
 delicious 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.540
 this just finds that says its 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.550
 there just shouldn't really have to think 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.310

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.020

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.619
 anyone who wants a bunny or guinea pig can soon have childcare 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.959

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.939

 is that person suitable for my rabbit? 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.009
 so if you want a rabbit 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.029
 then we also know for sure and then you can also be the sign of yourself 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:24.729
 it will be okay 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.969
 animal protection hopes that all people who are still searching for an animal 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.309
 come to the daycare and not go to the pet store it is a bit of luck 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:35.239
