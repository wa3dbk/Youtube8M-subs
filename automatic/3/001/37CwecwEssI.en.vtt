 they gave a very good very good a good 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.530
 final exactly I like to see how the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.660
 to the champion in this case saints that there 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.370
 lost 30 in that game I mean I do not know 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.930
 how rank does not what happens is that also 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.520
 that is, whatever goes holy goes away 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.650
 to say but is that they also throw many 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.240
 desire from the beginning marked a 50 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.880
 it was not a brutally difficult marker 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.640
 to come back and then in the first time 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.200
 there they went to Ivan I was sure for sure 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.270
 yes before the first one finished 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.280
 time be the last minutes no point 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.350
 that the last five was not in 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.310

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.630
 40 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:13.890
 that second time would have been better 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:16.190
 at sea ​​the selection also had more 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.190
 ahead 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.140
 Johnson set a new record frame but 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.940

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.739
 clear up to where we arrived 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.930
 Well, the truth is that for me that was 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.950
 I really liked that rescue but the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.590
 truth is that I was made a tournament 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.450
 very interesting was not a final because it is 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.970
 a final that sounded strange to you what 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.710

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.450
 well half medium but 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.770

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.110
 some of the great ones in america 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.570

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.280
 I rescued the final , it made me very 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.020
 exciting this last game to me 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.280

 elimination chamber here in the doubles 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.750
 two visions of this event could have 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.490

 see what happened the robbery happened because 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.300
 Many are telling me that this prologue 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.200
 ok robbery robbery was manipulated we made in 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.760
 this time I was fighting in the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.520
 full weight championship of the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.980

 the fight was going pretty nobel mario vargas 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.600
 the fight is quite even but of 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.670
 suddenly both crystal crazy was started 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.160

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.680

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.870
 in the championship and what is important is what 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.130

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.600
 one flaw and that happened as the second 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:45.100
