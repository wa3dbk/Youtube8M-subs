00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
apart from other aftermarket gopro

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.250 
apart from other aftermarket gopro
accessory<00:00:17.789> companies<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.660> from<00:00:18.900> what<00:00:19.050> I've

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
accessory companies and from what I've

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.250 
accessory companies and from what I've
seen<00:00:19.320> their<00:00:20.250> mounts<00:00:20.789> are<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.300> same<00:00:21.689> but<00:00:22.109> they

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
seen their mounts are the same but they

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.189 
seen their mounts are the same but they
do<00:00:22.320> seem<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.949> be<00:00:23.189> more<00:00:23.430> supportive<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:24.359> people

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
do seem to be more supportive of people

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.500 
do seem to be more supportive of people
so<00:00:25.350> they<00:00:26.039> do<00:00:26.099> push<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.550> fact<00:00:26.880> they<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> 1

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
so they do push the fact they have a 1

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.740 
so they do push the fact they have a 1
year<00:00:27.840> warranty<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.920> then<00:00:29.369> also<00:00:29.699> they're<00:00:30.420> very

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
year warranty and then also they're very

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.299 
year warranty and then also they're very
upfront<00:00:30.929> about<00:00:31.289> contacting<00:00:31.949> them<00:00:32.099> if<00:00:32.250> you're

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
upfront about contacting them if you're

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
upfront about contacting them if you're
not<00:00:32.430> one<00:00:32.610> percent<00:00:32.940> satisfied<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.540> anything

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
not one percent satisfied with anything

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.600 
not one percent satisfied with anything
with<00:00:34.410> their<00:00:34.559> products<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.250> seems<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.579> be

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
with their products so it seems to be

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.200 
with their products so it seems to be
that<00:00:35.700> maybe<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.690> support<00:00:37.290> side<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.309> kind

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that maybe the support side is what kind

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.920 
that maybe the support side is what kind
of<00:00:39.270> they're<00:00:39.420> trying<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.660> set<00:00:39.780> themselves

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
of they're trying to set themselves

of they're trying to set themselves
apart<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:41.010> because<00:00:41.489> these<00:00:41.730> aftermarket

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
mount and the first thing we're going to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.340 
mount and the first thing we're going to
kind<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.239> ask<00:00:54.420> ourselves<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
kind of have to ask ourselves and the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.720 
kind of have to ask ourselves and the
goal<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.829> review<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.399> figure<00:00:56.640> out

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
goal of this review is to figure out

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.810 
goal of this review is to figure out
whether<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.390> better<00:00:58.020> or<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.579> than<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
whether it's better or not than a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.439 
whether it's better or not than a
genuine<00:01:00.780> GoPro<00:01:01.789> handlebar<00:01:02.789> mount<00:01:02.969> first<00:01:03.180> off

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
genuine GoPro handlebar mount first off

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.960 
genuine GoPro handlebar mount first off
it<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.960> cheaper<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:06.229> then<00:01:07.400> secondly<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.640> does

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it is cheaper and then secondly it does

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.750 
it is cheaper and then secondly it does
have<00:01:09.330> some<00:01:09.600> different<00:01:10.140> features<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.250> new

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
have some different features so the new

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.690 
have some different features so the new
GoPro<00:01:12.450> handle<00:01:13.200> bar<00:01:13.380> mounts<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.460> probably

rubber inserts for this little spot down

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.450 
rubber inserts for this little spot down
here<00:01:24.240> where<00:01:24.750> one<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.590> larger<00:01:26.100> diameter

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
things and then one is for very small

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
things and then one is for very small
dammit<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.560> things<00:01:28.799> such<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.670> skip<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
dammit of things such as the skip the

tips of ski poles and things like that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.999 
tips of ski poles and things like that
but<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.930> does<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.229> some<00:01:34.350> drawbacks<00:01:34.500> because

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
but it does have some drawbacks because

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.560 
but it does have some drawbacks because
those<00:01:35.159> are<00:01:35.280> two<00:01:35.520> pieces<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.970> rubber<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> it's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
those are two pieces of rubber and it's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.810 
those are two pieces of rubber and it's
very<00:01:36.900> very<00:01:37.140> easy<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.890> lose<00:01:38.100> them<00:01:38.310> because<00:01:38.640> they

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
very very easy to lose them because they

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.870 
very very easy to lose them because they
are<00:01:39.170> separate<00:01:40.170> from<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.650> mount<00:01:40.950> Nordic

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
flashes accessories get over that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.690 
flashes accessories get over that
because<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.490> foam<00:01:45.320> pre<00:01:46.320> glued<00:01:47.250> onto

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
because they have foam pre glued onto

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.270 
because they have foam pre glued onto
the<00:01:48.090> inside<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.290> hell<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.710> mount<00:01:49.950> meaning

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the inside of the hell or mount meaning

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520 
the inside of the hell or mount meaning
that<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:51.090> always<00:01:51.570> there<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.930> grip<00:01:52.380> is

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
that it's always there and grip is

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.679 
that it's always there and grip is
always<00:01:53.100> better<00:01:53.610> than<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.970> would<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.540> was

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
always better than it would be if it was

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.450 
always better than it would be if it was
just<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.079> bear<00:01:55.409> plastic<00:01:56.040> which<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.399> you

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
just that bear plastic which is what you

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.609 
just that bear plastic which is what you
get<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> GoPro<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.659> don't<00:01:57.990> keep

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
get with the GoPro if you don't keep

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.569 
get with the GoPro if you don't keep
those<00:01:58.920> rubber<00:01:59.219> pieces<00:01:59.750> installed<00:02:01.009> then<00:02:02.009> you

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
those rubber pieces installed then you

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.899 
those rubber pieces installed then you
get<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.920> extension<00:02:04.920> arms<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> three-way

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
get to extension arms so a three-way

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.150 
get to extension arms so a three-way
pivot<00:02:06.240> arm<00:02:06.479> system<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.590> extension<00:02:08.009> arm

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
pivot arm system here to extension arm

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.809 
pivot arm system here to extension arm
and<00:02:08.390> one<00:02:09.390> other<00:02:09.979> short<00:02:10.979> bolts<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.520> one<00:02:11.670> long

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
and one other short bolts of one long

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.860 
and one other short bolts of one long
bolt<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.270> one

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
bolt and one

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.220 
bolt and one
bolt<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.400> then<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.670> functions<00:02:15.299> just<00:02:15.720> like<00:02:15.959> a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
bolt and then it functions just like a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.449 
bolt and then it functions just like a
standard<00:02:17.269> GoPro<00:02:18.269> handlebar<00:02:19.080> mount<00:02:19.379> so<00:02:20.280> that

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
standard GoPro handlebar mount so that

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.800 
standard GoPro handlebar mount so that
in<00:02:20.580> conclusion<00:02:20.940> because<00:02:21.269> this<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.629> going<00:02:21.750> to

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
in conclusion because this is going to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.610 
in conclusion because this is going to
be<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.930> really<00:02:22.170> short<00:02:22.409> video<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:22.950> seems<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.760> be<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
be a really short video it seems to be a

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.869 
be a really short video it seems to be a

again<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.360> has<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.690> preglued<00:02:28.349> in<00:02:28.620> foam

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
again it has that preglued in foam

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.309 
again it has that preglued in foam
