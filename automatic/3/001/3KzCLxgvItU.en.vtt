00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.500 
methods so the first method we're
actually<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.929> be<00:00:31.170> talking<00:00:31.410> about<00:00:31.769> is

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
actually going to be talking about is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.479 
actually going to be talking about is
probably<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.840> way<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.320> 95%<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.280> time

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.369 
probably the way I do it 95% of the time
and<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.230> with<00:00:37.230> an<00:00:37.680> airbrush<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.379> this

cover<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.079> circumstances<00:02:04.860> where<00:02:05.100> they

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
cover it's in circumstances where they

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.649 
cover it's in circumstances where they
really<00:02:05.490> need<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.119> smudge<00:02:06.360> proof

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
really need to be kind of smudge proof

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.350 
really need to be kind of smudge proof
in<00:02:06.869> budge<00:02:07.049> proof<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.060> works<00:02:09.270> really

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
in budge proof and so this works really

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.990 
in budge proof and so this works really
great<00:02:09.660> especially<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.349> you're<00:02:10.530> going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.860> be

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
great especially if you're going to be

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.280 
great especially if you're going to be
doing<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.209> tattoo<00:02:12.420> cover<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> bride

doing a tattoo cover for a bride
or<00:02:14.379> some<00:02:14.709> kind<00:02:14.829> of<00:02:14.980> video<00:02:15.370> shoot<00:02:15.760> those<00:02:16.150> kinds

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
or some kind of video shoot those kinds

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.530 
or some kind of video shoot those kinds
of<00:02:16.510> things<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:18.030> we're<00:02:19.030> just<00:02:19.060> going<00:02:19.299> to<00:02:19.359> start

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
of things so we're just going to start

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.429 
of things so we're just going to start
with<00:02:19.629> a<00:02:20.430> couple<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.489> drops<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.879> color<00:02:22.439> in

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
with a couple of drops of that color in

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.610 
with a couple of drops of that color in
our<00:02:23.620> gun

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.790 

you

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.840 

we're<00:02:31.800> going<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.010> turn<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.340> compressor

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
we're going to turn it that compressor

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.220 
we're going to turn it that compressor
I'm<00:02:33.030> going<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.270> apologize<00:02:33.420> right<00:02:33.840> now<00:02:33.900> it's

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
tattoo and kind of trace over each

00:02:50.940 --> 00:03:05.420 
tattoo and kind of trace over each
individual<00:02:51.660> line

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.720 

you

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
and you can see I've kind of worked to

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.250 
and you can see I've kind of worked to
basically<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.640> full-coverage<00:03:16.600> with<00:03:17.080> that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
basically a full-coverage with that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.540 
basically a full-coverage with that
orange<00:03:17.500> atone<00:03:17.890> you<00:03:18.070> want<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.280> make<00:03:18.400> sure

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
orange atone you want to make sure

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.190 
orange atone you want to make sure
there's<00:03:18.760> really<00:03:18.940> not<00:03:19.180> too<00:03:19.450> much<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.930> black

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
there's really not too much of the black

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.110 
there's really not too much of the black
still<00:03:20.890> showing<00:03:21.130> through<00:03:21.610> there's<00:03:21.940> still<00:03:22.090> a

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
still showing through there's still a

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.670 
still showing through there's still a
little<00:03:22.300> bit<00:03:22.540> here<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.930> might<00:03:23.230> just<00:03:23.410> apply<00:03:23.650> a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
little bit here I might just apply a

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.410 
little bit here I might just apply a
little<00:03:23.770> bit<00:03:23.950> more<00:03:24.190> there<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.460> a<00:03:25.090> little<00:03:25.300> bit

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
little bit more there and a little bit

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.870 
little bit more there and a little bit
more<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:26.140> this<00:03:26.890> top<00:03:27.130> region<00:03:27.400> where<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.700> can

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
more in this top region where I can

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.460 
more in this top region where I can
still<00:03:28.060> see<00:03:28.270> a<00:03:28.300> little<00:03:28.510> bit<00:03:28.630> of<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.870> tattoo<00:03:29.230> and

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
still see a little bit of the tattoo and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.520 
still see a little bit of the tattoo and
there<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.550> have<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:31.270> finished<00:03:31.810> color

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
there you have the finished color

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.230 
there you have the finished color
correction<00:03:34.050> just<00:03:35.050> like<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:37.030> then<00:03:37.120> we're

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
correction just like so so then we're

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.520 
correction just like so so then we're
just<00:03:37.360> going<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.510> clean<00:03:37.660> out<00:03:37.840> our<00:03:37.870> gun<00:03:38.170> with<00:03:38.470> a

little bit of that alcohol agon spray it
into<00:03:42.100> a<00:03:42.220> paper<00:03:42.400> towel<00:03:44.940> already<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.210> mixed<00:03:46.720> up

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
into a paper towel already so I mixed up

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.780 
into a paper towel already so I mixed up
a<00:03:47.370> magic<00:03:48.370> foundation<00:03:49.150> shade<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.840> used<00:03:50.230> about

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
a magic foundation shade I used about

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.380 
a magic foundation shade I used about
four<00:03:51.790> drops<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:53.250> pure<00:03:54.250> beige<00:03:54.520> number<00:03:55.150> zero

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
four drops of pure beige number zero

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.450 
four drops of pure beige number zero
zero<00:03:55.600> five<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:55.870> then<00:03:56.410> about<00:03:56.650> ten<00:03:56.920> dots<00:03:57.190> of

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460

color correction right to where we had

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.180 
color correction right to where we had
it<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:30.660> can<00:04:30.810> still<00:04:31.020> see<00:04:31.230> a<00:04:31.260> little<00:04:31.740> bit<00:04:31.950> so

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
it you can still see a little bit so

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.110 
it you can still see a little bit so
we're<00:04:32.430> going<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.610> do<00:04:32.669> is<00:04:32.760> we're<00:04:32.880> going<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.030> do

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
we're going to do is we're going to do

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.400 
we're going to do is we're going to do
another<00:04:33.360> layer<00:04:33.570> but<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:33.930> time<00:04:34.139> I'm<00:04:34.230> going<00:04:34.350> to

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
another layer but this time I'm going to

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.310 
another layer but this time I'm going to
hold<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.680> gun<00:04:34.860> further<00:04:35.160> away<00:04:35.930> so<00:04:36.930> it

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
hold the gun further away so it

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.930 
hold the gun further away so it
disperses<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:38.070> little<00:04:38.250> bit<00:04:38.340> less<00:04:38.490> color<00:04:38.730> and

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
disperses a little bit less color and

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.540 
disperses a little bit less color and
it's<00:04:39.060> more<00:04:39.419> blended<00:04:39.990> over<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.230> larger<00:04:40.590> area<00:04:40.620> use

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
it's more blended over a larger area use

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:52.480 
it's more blended over a larger area use
that<00:04:41.730> kind<00:04:41.970> of<00:04:42.000> fade<00:04:42.270> everything<00:04:42.870> else

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.179 

and<00:04:53.490> there<00:04:53.639> you<00:04:53.729> can<00:04:53.909> see<00:04:54.150> that<00:04:54.419> did<00:04:54.860> that<00:04:55.860> just

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.189 
and there you can see that did that just

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:57.950 
and there you can see that did that just
about<00:04:56.460> did<00:04:56.939> it<00:04:57.090> as<00:04:57.270> far<00:04:57.479> as<00:04:57.569> the<00:04:57.659> Asheville

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.670 
coverage goes so what I like to do to
set<00:05:00.479> these<00:05:00.659> you<00:05:00.900> always<00:05:01.020> do<00:05:01.229> need<00:05:01.409> a<00:05:01.439> powder

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680

with the door colors oftentimes you'll

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.679 
with the door colors oftentimes you'll

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
most tattoos will tend to have some

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.909 
most tattoos will tend to have some
texture<00:05:51.029> that<00:05:51.449> you<00:05:52.110> obviously<00:05:52.259> can't<00:05:52.680> cover

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
texture that you obviously can't cover

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.689 
texture that you obviously can't cover
up<00:05:53.249> as<00:05:53.749> well<00:05:54.749> so<00:05:55.110> be<00:05:55.919> really<00:05:56.310> mindful<00:05:56.580> that

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
up as well so be really mindful that

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.369 
up as well so be really mindful that
sometimes<00:05:57.389> especially<00:05:57.870> for<00:05:58.050> like<00:05:58.199> this

00:05:58.369 --> 00:05:58.379 
sometimes especially for like this

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.679 
sometimes especially for like this
tattoo<00:05:58.740> which<00:05:58.949> was<00:05:59.129> very<00:05:59.430> fine<00:05:59.729> lines<00:06:00.120> and

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:00.689 
tattoo which was very fine lines and

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:02.360 
tattoo which was very fine lines and
then<00:06:00.839> no<00:06:01.050> other<00:06:01.199> shading<00:06:01.620> around<00:06:01.860> it<00:06:02.039> it'll

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
then no other shading around it it'll

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.899 
then no other shading around it it'll
tend<00:06:02.550> to<00:06:02.639> be<00:06:02.729> very<00:06:03.770> lines<00:06:04.770> so<00:06:05.219> you<00:06:05.250> can<00:06:05.520> still

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
tend to be very lines so you can still

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:08.929 
tend to be very lines so you can still
see<00:06:06.149> some<00:06:06.180> of<00:06:06.449> the<00:06:06.599> texture<00:06:07.050> but<00:06:07.770> that<00:06:08.009> way<00:06:08.430> all

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:08.939 
see some of the texture but that way all

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:11.899 
see some of the texture but that way all
of<00:06:09.000> the<00:06:09.629> the<00:06:10.169> color<00:06:10.409> is<00:06:10.740> uniform<00:06:11.099> you<00:06:11.580> just<00:06:11.789> get

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909 
of the the color is uniform you just get

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.600 
of the the color is uniform you just get
this<00:06:11.969> really<00:06:12.149> nice<00:06:12.479> uniform<00:06:13.219> tone<00:06:14.219> and<00:06:14.550> the

nice thing about these directors is they

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.469 
nice thing about these directors is they
