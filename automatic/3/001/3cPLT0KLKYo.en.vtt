00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.920
 with which the youtube people are 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.350
 welcome there your studies in this 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.150
 video tutorial or video we will see the 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.330
 download of animated templates for 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.119
 power point 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.560
 the discharge will be accommodated in 47 the 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.520
 links I will leave in the description 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.930
 of the video are two packs and forgive 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.750
 the noises 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.490
 are two packs that are housed in 47 go to 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.430
 can go directly from the 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.880
 description of the video simply go to 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.880
 Add 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.070
 they will add your account as you can see 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.239
 they are going to create an account in 4 chÃ¡vez 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.750
 so they can download the files 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.579
 Once you have created your account simply 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.550
 they will proceed to download those that are already 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.409
 they take into account well then simply 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.100
 they go to the discharge and they load the 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:05.220
 the files weigh between 200 megs each 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.260
 one what partitions because simply 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.960
 to download 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.080
 an entire one is more complicated since it 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.560
 delay more the download in two our 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.800
 foundation to be able to download good I'll 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.570
 to show you some some templates 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.100
 for that I'm going to go to the warehouse that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.900
 I have the files and here is how 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.450
 can see here are with this name 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.420
 we will be able to find the files and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.580
 here are the 53 templates power font 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.910
 well on multiple topics many topics that 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.530
 they will be able to find here about all 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.970
 Over the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.800
 on the topics that are covered 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.860
 at present 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.370
 and what it is when they are going to present a 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.380
 slide there is anatomy science 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.070
 marketing organization communication 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.070
 building 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:06.870
 internet networks many more things are 53 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:11.270
 well more things I'm really going to 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.270
 show one so they can see it 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.770
 the animations that they bring I will open in 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.640
 the 2013 version I'm opening in the 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.640
 2013 version 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.980
 so you will know it has to be 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.690
 since the 2010 version I tested in the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.690
 2010 version I tested in the version 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.850
 2013 as I am doing now in the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.550
 2007 version will not capture them in 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.890
 actually the previous versions do not 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.440
 can open this type of slide 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.200
 only those that have a diagram more 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.910
 images in design nothing but those that 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.080
 have these kind of animations I do not know 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.630
 can open since the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.250
 we are fins for those 2007 versions and 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.020
 2003 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.850
 but in any case update of the 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.560
 version 2003 2010 or 2013 from the tony 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.360
 you can download the PowerPoint 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.850
 little devils 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.320
 once opened let's see this inside 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.300
 of each presentation they bring a lot of 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.220
 slideshow 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.130
 and we are going to see the animation of this one in 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.350
 special by clicking on the 55's 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.630
 definitive 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.790
 as you can see the animation starts and 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.920
 start the title these titles are 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.990
 can edit below 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.060
 the title is changed because it is why 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.000
 you want except the animations the 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.560
 animations can not be changed since 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.599
 they come predetermined in each day 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.209
 Positive titles can be edited 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:41.459
 As you can see we are going to open another one 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.459
 there that we have to see a d 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.390
 Let's see 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.370
 is for example 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.719
 here we have this animation 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.150
 of the child that is moving there 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.130
 very simple animations but that without 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.840
 However with these animations it gives a lot 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.410
 to speak now when presenting 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.410
 to an audience 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.109
 those who want this kind of a positive 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.359
 for the 2007 versions actually if 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.080
 is that you want without animation only the 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.500
 templates, then you let me know because I have 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.030
 the templates for 2007 and 2003 without 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.780
 animations but with this kind of 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.610
 start with the same type or the 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.560
 same design I have but for 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.870
 previous versions without animations 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.479
 although without simply moving the 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.169
 images added in the presentations 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.999
 80 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.629
 these templates are for the versions 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:51.270
 as I say to the 2010 and 2013 go them 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.970
 give 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.440
 well there they have a host of templates 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.060
 they download it as I said in the 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.710
