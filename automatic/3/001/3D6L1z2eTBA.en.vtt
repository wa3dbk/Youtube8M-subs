learns your behavior it knows what time

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.999 
learns your behavior it knows what time
you<00:01:56.569> start<00:01:56.899> printing<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.500> knows<00:01:57.679> what<00:01:57.859> time

you start printing it knows what time

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.209 
you start printing it knows what time

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
you stop printing and as a result it

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.760 
you stop printing and as a result it
powers<00:02:01.219> itself<00:02:01.700> into<00:02:02.179> sleep<00:02:02.630> mode<00:02:02.659> and<00:02:03.379> turns

powers itself into sleep mode and turns

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.859 
powers itself into sleep mode and turns
itself<00:02:04.009> back<00:02:04.219> on<00:02:04.280> in<00:02:04.729> advance<00:02:05.179> of<00:02:05.420> your

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
thing about the color cube is it gives

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.339 
thing about the color cube is it gives
us<00:02:31.190> an<00:02:31.280> opportunity<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:32.060> present<00:02:32.930> to

technique I customized pricing plan that

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.379 
technique I customized pricing plan that
actually<00:02:36.349> beats<00:02:36.739> their<00:02:36.980> me<00:02:37.190> after<00:02:38.000> reviewing
