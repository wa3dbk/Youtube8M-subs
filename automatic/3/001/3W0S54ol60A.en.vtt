00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:12.700
 Yes there is a difference in maps here Mountaineering Map and Topographic Map 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:16.900
 I would like to talk about what is different 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:21.130
 This is it It is so general that well even Toka bookstore 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.900
 Mountaineering map Yamato plateau map which we have in mountain climbing article store 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.900
 It is said that Akirabunsha has issued 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.759
 This content is now brought in the tanner's 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.930
 When you open the front face , single-seated well-meaning function 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.930
 It is a map back side 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:48.260
 A little 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:48.260
 It is shaped like fine detailed map and high-frequency map of the effect of the area is on 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.650
 So I say that going to have Wow 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.270
 Actually this wide area 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.940
 Or to go to that I say all walks of First without it is to one day Day Hiking 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.560
 If you are different in climbing 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:12.560
 It's just a bit, I'd like you to expand it a bit now 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.470
 For example, the nature class of Nishi Tanzawa 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.920
 from here 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:23.340
 If you are going to climb a mountain called Sugendaru, here is the summit through such a route 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.200
 this part 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:32.149
 Since in such a way that says come back walking 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.500
 When I think only with the I want another look at a little firm in detail here is a little fine map 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.690
 It would be more convenient to have 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.110
 So say what kind of map is good 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.940
 Behind this 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.080
 Masu but good is here NAOI 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:52.800
 Geographical geography 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.800
 It is topographical map of 1/2000 of publication 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:02.410
 This is a map that covers Japan, not just mountains, as it is issued by the National Land Bank . 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.750
 is 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:10.830
 You can buy a map topographic map of where you want to go 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.830
 By the way now 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.920
 This is a spread state 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.630
 Let's actually go 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.120
 I came when I used it 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.560
 It can be said in 7 that it is easy to see 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.950
 The difference between the previous 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.950
 Dearimasu folded It is a part of Hajikko of topographic child of sound 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:40.489
 Although I think that there has been an earlier climbing Children's Day this red frame 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.460
 Part of this red frame 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.090
 But 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:52.060
 It is the range of this topographical map 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:58.240
 Here was to talk with the 1-8 mountain cheese of the 5th minute earlier, but in one of the 5th minute is here 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:00.670
 1/5000 Because it is simply 2 times more finely 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.580
 I am 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.480
 this 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:10.310
 Rises area has become clearly understandable 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:14.900
 3 strength of Hinokihoramaru from west Tanzawa nature classroom that I mentioned earlier 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:22.790
 It is only a little more expanded and easier to see 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:27.330
 However, the topography of this Geographical Survey Institute is for the purpose of grasping the topography to the last 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.470
 As it is made, it is like this mountain climbing map 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.470
 Here is a campsite
