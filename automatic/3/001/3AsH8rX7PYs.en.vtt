of you are aware the Titan was

of you are aware the Titan was

gaming a graphics card available as well

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.990 
gaming a graphics card available as well
as<00:00:56.210> typically<00:00:57.210> used<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.680> high-end

quadro<00:01:02.370> type<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.820> performance<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.719> also<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
quadro type of performance but also a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.969 
quadro type of performance but also a
gamers<00:01:04.589> then<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> Titan<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> good<00:01:06.450> choice

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
gamers then the Titan was a good choice

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.740 
gamers then the Titan was a good choice
but<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.460> addition<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.479> also<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
but in addition to that it was also a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.940 
but in addition to that it was also a
little<00:01:09.990> bit<00:01:10.110> faster<00:01:10.650> than<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.950> gtx<00:01:11.460> 780<00:01:12.950> then

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
little bit faster than the gtx 780 then

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
little bit faster than the gtx 780 then
what<00:01:14.189> happened<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.760> AMD<00:01:15.119> released<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.869> r9

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
what happened is AMD released the r9

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.679 
what happened is AMD released the r9
290x<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:18.030> video<00:01:18.330> released<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.049> gtx<00:01:19.530> 780ti

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
290x the video released the gtx 780ti

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.999 
290x the video released the gtx 780ti
both<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.900> these<00:01:22.080> were<00:01:23.090> significantly<00:01:24.090> faster

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
both of these were significantly faster

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.289 
both of these were significantly faster
than<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> Titan<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:26.759> maybe<00:01:27.119> not

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
than the Titan or maybe not

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.690 
than the Titan or maybe not
significantly<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.590> certainly<00:01:28.950> faster<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
significantly but certainly faster and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.690 
significantly but certainly faster and
they<00:01:29.909> were<00:01:29.970> cheaper<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.380> let's<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.340> honest

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
they were cheaper and so let's be honest

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
they were cheaper and so let's be honest
from<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> gaming<00:01:33.390> perspective<00:01:34.229> they<00:01:34.530> were

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
from the gaming perspective they were

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.399 
from the gaming perspective they were
better<00:01:35.520> cards<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> most<00:01:36.750> part<00:01:36.990> there<00:01:37.320> was

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
better cards for the most part there was

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.280 
better cards for the most part there was
smarter<00:01:37.829> purchases<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.750> video<00:01:40.020> didn't

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
smarter purchases so the video didn't

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.069 
smarter purchases so the video didn't
want<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.740> they<00:01:41.070> didn't<00:01:41.400> want<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:42.079> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
want that they didn't want that the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.740 
want that they didn't want that the
flagship<00:01:44.009> Titan<00:01:44.549> hand<00:01:44.820> inferior<00:01:45.540> performance

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
flagship Titan hand inferior performance

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.179 
flagship Titan hand inferior performance
to<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.740> gtx<00:01:47.369> 780<00:01:47.939> Ti<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.659> rumor<00:01:49.560> has<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
to the gtx 780 Ti so rumor has it that

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.160 
to the gtx 780 Ti so rumor has it that
they're<00:01:50.460> going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.759> releasing<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.840> Black

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
they're going to be releasing the Black

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.399 
they're going to be releasing the Black
Edition<00:01:52.520> which<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.759> pretty<00:01:54.299> much<00:01:54.420> exactly<00:01:54.840> how

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
Edition which is pretty much exactly how

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.800 
Edition which is pretty much exactly how
you<00:01:55.590> would<00:01:55.860> expect<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.240> gtx<00:01:57.979> 780ti<00:01:59.810> but

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you would expect it's the gtx 780ti but

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.649 
you would expect it's the gtx 780ti but
with<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> better<00:02:01.759> double<00:02:02.759> precision<00:02:03.090> compute

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
with a better double precision compute

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.969 
with a better double precision compute
performance<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.909> more<00:02:06.659> ram<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.229> has<00:02:07.530> double

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
performance and more ram it has double

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.300 
performance and more ram it has double
the<00:02:08.009> amount<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.310> ram<00:02:08.550> that's<00:02:08.849> six<00:02:09.239> gigabytes

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
the amount of ram that's six gigabytes

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.730 
the amount of ram that's six gigabytes
there's<00:02:11.310> no<00:02:11.670> mention<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.270> clock<00:02:12.599> speeds<00:02:12.930> yep

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
there's no mention on clock speeds yep

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.920 
there's no mention on clock speeds yep
that<00:02:13.920> means<00:02:14.130> we're<00:02:14.310> going<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.460> be<00:02:14.550> getting

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
790 we're going to be looking at two

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.080 
790 we're going to be looking at two
cores<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:42.900> that's<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.560> two<00:02:45.020> gk110<00:02:46.550> now<00:02:47.550> once

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
cores so that's a two gk110 now once

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.600 
cores so that's a two gk110 now once
again<00:02:48.300> we<00:02:48.840> don't<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.290> exact<00:02:49.800> confirmations

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
again we don't have exact confirmations

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.610 
again we don't have exact confirmations
you<00:02:51.150> may<00:02:51.300> remember<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.990> while<00:02:52.230> back<00:02:52.260> that

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
you may remember just a while back that

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.900 
you may remember just a while back that
I<00:02:52.950> was<00:02:53.220> doing<00:02:53.340> very<00:02:53.460> similar<00:02:54.030> rumors<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:55.910> back

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
I was doing very similar rumors and back

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.940 
I was doing very similar rumors and back
then<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.210> mentioned<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.750> was<00:02:57.870> going<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.050> have<00:02:58.200> 49

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
then I mentioned it was going to have 49

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.650 
then I mentioned it was going to have 49
and<00:02:59.220> 92<00:02:59.880> cuda<00:03:00.300> cores<00:03:01.160> which<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.990> 4905<00:03:04.790> 2496<00:03:05.790> x

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
and 92 cuda cores which is a 4905 2496 x

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.730 
and 92 cuda cores which is a 4905 2496 x
2<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.880> we're<00:03:08.880> going<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.030> be<00:03:09.150> having<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.510> 320<00:03:10.320> bit

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
2 and we're going to be having a 320 bit

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.430 
2 and we're going to be having a 320 bit
bus<00:03:11.280> which<00:03:12.210> means<00:03:12.450> we<00:03:12.570> could<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.810> getting<00:03:12.960> 5

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
bus which means we could be getting 5

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.090 
bus which means we could be getting 5
gigabytes<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:14.100> ram<00:03:14.430> per<00:03:15.270> each<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.350> gk110

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
gigabytes of ram per each of the gk110

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.790 
gigabytes of ram per each of the gk110
so<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.210> means<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.630> 10<00:03:19.050> gigabytes<00:03:19.860> total

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
so that means that 10 gigabytes total

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.560 
so that means that 10 gigabytes total
now<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:23.220> means<00:03:23.460> that<00:03:23.670> likely<00:03:24.300> we're<00:03:24.450> not

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
now that means that likely we're not

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.030 
now that means that likely we're not
going<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.870> seeing<00:03:25.140> as<00:03:25.410> far<00:03:25.650> as<00:03:25.740> what<00:03:25.920> we

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
going to be seeing as far as what we

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.440 
going to be seeing as far as what we
understand<00:03:26.520> we're<00:03:26.730> not<00:03:26.910> going<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.150> be<00:03:27.210> seeing

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
understand we're not going to be seeing

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.380 
understand we're not going to be seeing
full<00:03:28.290> gk<00:03:28.890> cause<00:03:29.220> most<00:03:29.640> likely<00:03:30.000> because<00:03:30.240> of

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
full gk cause most likely because of

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.470 
full gk cause most likely because of
heat<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:32.060> obviously<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.150> needs<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.390> be

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
heat and so on obviously it needs to be

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.810 
heat and so on obviously it needs to be
kept<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.960> reasonably<00:03:34.470> cool<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:35.310> cooling

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
kept a reasonably cool the cooling

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.820 
kept a reasonably cool the cooling
solution<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.690> be<00:03:37.070> not<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.960> elaborate<00:03:39.960> power

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
solution is to be not to elaborate power

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.080 
solution is to be not to elaborate power
requirements<00:03:41.550> are<00:03:41.640> going<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.850> be<00:03:41.910> another

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
requirements are going to be another

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.300 
requirements are going to be another
thing<00:03:42.360> as<00:03:42.480> well<00:03:42.710> unknown<00:03:43.710> what<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.100> clock

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
thing as well unknown what the clock

speeds<00:03:44.790> are<00:03:44.880> going<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.090> be<00:03:45.180> like<00:03:45.390> hopefully

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
speeds are going to be like hopefully

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.240 
speeds are going to be like hopefully
they<00:03:46.200> don't<00:03:46.320> take<00:03:46.590> too<00:03:46.740> much<00:03:46.860> of<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.070> hit

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
they don't take too much of a hit

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.400 
they don't take too much of a hit
obviously<00:03:47.970> one<00:03:48.180> way<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.450> cut<00:03:48.810> back<00:03:49.050> power

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
obviously one way to cut back power

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.950 
obviously one way to cut back power
consumption<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:51.090> reduce<00:03:51.240> the<00:03:51.660> core

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
the case with this but I guess the only

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.650 
the case with this but I guess the only
thing<00:03:58.470> we<00:03:58.710> can<00:03:58.830> do<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.010> wait<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.390> I'd<00:04:00.390> like<00:04:00.600> to

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
thing we can do is wait and I'd like to

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.320 
thing we can do is wait and I'd like to
reiterate<00:04:01.080> i'm<00:04:01.800> not<00:04:02.430> saying<00:04:02.940> this<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.300> a

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
reiterate i'm not saying this is a

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.760 
reiterate i'm not saying this is a
hundred<00:04:03.600> percent<00:04:03.660> true<00:04:04.080> but<00:04:06.140> well<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.560> site

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
hundred percent true but well the site

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.500 
hundred percent true but well the site
is<00:04:07.920> reporting<00:04:08.520> it<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:09.090> seems<00:04:09.390> that

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
is reporting it and it seems that

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.360 
is reporting it and it seems that
they've<00:04:09.750> got<00:04:09.930> some<00:04:10.190> information<00:04:11.190> regarding

they've got some information regarding

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.300 
they've got some information regarding
it<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.330> figure<00:04:13.200> it's<00:04:13.380> better<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.800> report<00:04:14.130> it

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
it so figure it's better to report it

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.690 
it so figure it's better to report it
than<00:04:14.459> not<00:04:14.640> report<00:04:15.240> it<00:04:15.360> right<00:04:16.130> anyway<00:04:17.130> i'm

how<00:04:36.570> can<00:04:36.750> I<00:04:36.810> put<00:04:37.020> this<00:04:37.310> that<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.610> figure<00:04:39.000> in

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
how can I put this that that figure in

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.810 
how can I put this that that figure in
the<00:04:39.240> distance<00:04:39.690> it's<00:04:39.900> always<00:04:40.170> several<00:04:40.820> hundred

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
the distance it's always several hundred

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.640 
the distance it's always several hundred
steps<00:04:42.150> ahead<00:04:42.390> of<00:04:42.540> you<00:04:42.780> but<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.140> can't<00:04:43.440> quite

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
steps ahead of you but you can't quite

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.700 
steps ahead of you but you can't quite
make<00:04:43.860> out<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.250> shape<00:04:44.280> in<00:04:44.760> other<00:04:44.970> words<00:04:45.710> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
make out the shape in other words the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.950 
make out the shape in other words the
video<00:04:46.980> have<00:04:47.160> stated<00:04:47.490> pretty<00:04:48.060> much<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.810> we're

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
video have stated pretty much that we're

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.780 
video have stated pretty much that we're
going<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.170> be<00:04:49.230> seeing<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.680> lower<00:04:49.950> performance

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
going to be seeing the lower performance

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.480 
going to be seeing the lower performance
parts<00:04:51.210> first<00:04:51.570> so<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.620> could<00:04:52.890> end<00:04:53.040> up<00:04:53.250> by

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
parts first so you could end up by

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.450 
parts first so you could end up by
buying<00:04:53.820> for<00:04:54.240> example<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.690> GTX<00:04:55.110> 790<00:04:55.800> let's

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
buying for example the GTX 790 let's

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.050 
buying for example the GTX 790 let's
sane<00:04:56.960> March<00:04:57.960> or<00:04:58.140> April<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:59.430> can<00:04:59.700> the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
sane March or April and the can the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.970 
sane March or April and the can the
Maxwell<00:05:00.570> delivah<00:05:01.020> give<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.500> one<00:05:01.620> that's<00:05:01.830> as

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
Maxwell delivah give the one that's as

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.210 
Maxwell delivah give the one that's as
fast<00:05:02.280> if<00:05:02.670> not<00:05:02.730> faster<00:05:03.080> then<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.260> 790<00:05:04.830> may<00:05:05.040> not

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
fast if not faster then the 790 may not

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.700 
fast if not faster then the 790 may not
appear<00:05:05.550> until<00:05:05.790> Christmas<00:05:06.450> or<00:05:06.570> later<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.500> so

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
appear until Christmas or later and so

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.290 
appear until Christmas or later and so
some<00:05:07.920> people<00:05:08.220> might<00:05:08.370> say<00:05:08.430> hey<00:05:08.790> you<00:05:08.850> know<00:05:08.970> what

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
some people might say hey you know what

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.350 
some people might say hey you know what
I'm<00:05:09.420> just<00:05:09.450> going<00:05:09.600> to<00:05:09.720> buy<00:05:09.930> this<00:05:09.990> make<00:05:10.890> do<00:05:11.360> you

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
I'm just going to buy this make do you

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.540 
I'm just going to buy this make do you
know<00:05:12.450> enjoy<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:12.900> card<00:05:13.350> and<00:05:13.860> then<00:05:14.100> buy<00:05:14.250> another

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
know enjoy the card and then buy another

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.670 
know enjoy the card and then buy another
one<00:05:14.760> and<00:05:15.000> later<00:05:15.330> once<00:05:15.930> again<00:05:16.080> we<00:05:16.380> don't<00:05:16.500> have

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
one and later once again we don't have

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.500 
one and later once again we don't have
prices<00:05:17.100> for<00:05:17.280> this<00:05:17.370> but<00:05:17.550> we're<00:05:17.730> probably<00:05:18.120> going

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
prices for this but we're probably going

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.660 
prices for this but we're probably going
to<00:05:18.600> be<00:05:18.660> looking<00:05:18.960> at<00:05:19.140> the<00:05:19.260> 1k<00:05:19.860> like<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.220> fails<00:05:20.520> a

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
to be looking at the 1k like a fails a

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.050 
to be looking at the 1k like a fails a
box<00:05:22.100> anyway<00:05:23.100> hopefully<00:05:23.460> we've<00:05:23.670> enjoyed<00:05:23.910> the

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
box anyway hopefully we've enjoyed the

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.970 
box anyway hopefully we've enjoyed the
video<00:05:24.270> as<00:05:24.510> i<00:05:24.570> said<00:05:24.750> i<00:05:25.140> can't<00:05:25.530> give<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:25.740> solid
