00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.410
 gt4 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.080

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.580
 Online mode Online mode time was the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.500

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.440

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.459

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.470
 A hug for you, it came down here.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.049
 fight on the fox channel and then 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.360
 plus 20 such another very large game of 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.360
