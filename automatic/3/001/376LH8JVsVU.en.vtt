a good term to use these days in the
starcraft<00:02:06.289> world<00:02:07.269> anyway<00:02:08.269> so<00:02:08.810> yes<00:02:09.530> things<00:02:10.129> are

not<00:02:10.429> going<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.670> go<00:02:10.759> well<00:02:10.789> for<00:02:10.970> bogus<00:02:11.420> here<00:02:11.629> at

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
not going to go well for bogus here at

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.509 
not going to go well for bogus here at
all<00:02:12.760> early<00:02:13.760> pool<00:02:14.030> from<00:02:14.769> from<00:02:15.769> action<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.370> going

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
all early pool from from action is going

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.790 
all early pool from from action is going
to<00:02:16.580> get<00:02:16.730> those<00:02:16.970> organs<00:02:17.360> out<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:18.230> could<00:02:18.500> fill

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
to get those organs out it could fill

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.350 
to get those organs out it could fill
still<00:02:19.220> theoretically<00:02:19.730> defend<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.209> but

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
still theoretically defend it but

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.180 
still theoretically defend it but
