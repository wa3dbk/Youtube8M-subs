00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
the aid of snug so we've got between two

the aid of snug so we've got between two
and<00:00:46.310> three<00:00:46.400> thousand<00:00:47.030> sunder<00:00:47.210> Neath<00:00:47.360> there

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
and three thousand sunder Neath there

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.820 
and three thousand sunder Neath there
will<00:00:48.620> verify<00:00:48.830> that<00:00:50.320> by<00:00:51.320> doing<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.680> the
