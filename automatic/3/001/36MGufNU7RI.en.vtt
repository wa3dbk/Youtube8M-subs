and I am kami Crawford this is a picture
of<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.679> Sun<00:00:13.889> Rainier<00:00:14.190> about<00:00:14.460> ten<00:00:14.790> years<00:00:15.030> ago

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
of a Sun Rainier about ten years ago

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.320 
of a Sun Rainier about ten years ago
quite<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> bit<00:00:16.529> younger<00:00:16.850> so<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.060> some<00:00:18.180> general

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
quite a bit younger so just some general

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.080 
quite a bit younger so just some general
information<00:00:18.779> about<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:20.369> trail<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:20.880> went

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
information about the trail that we went

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.810 
information about the trail that we went
on<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> Wunderland<00:00:21.859> so<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:22.980> about<00:00:23.100> 93<00:00:23.580> miles

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
on the Wunderland so it's about 93 miles

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.580 
on the Wunderland so it's about 93 miles
around<00:00:24.240> Mount<00:00:24.779> Rainier<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.199> can<00:00:25.320> see<00:00:25.439> it's

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
around Mount Rainier you can see it's

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.160 
around Mount Rainier you can see it's
the<00:00:25.650> red<00:00:25.830> line<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.430> goes<00:00:26.730> completely

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
the red line that that goes completely

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.500 
the red line that that goes completely
around<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.619> mountain<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.160> there's<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.240> gain

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
around the mountain and there's a gain

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.749 
around the mountain and there's a gain
of<00:00:30.539> loss<00:00:30.869> about<00:00:31.230> 22,000<00:00:32.189> feet<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.669> that's

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
of loss about 22,000 feet and that's

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.709 
of loss about 22,000 feet and that's
actually<00:00:33.000> pretty<00:00:33.300> significant<00:00:35.540> summit<00:00:36.540> climb

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
actually pretty significant summit climb

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.889 
actually pretty significant summit climb
of<00:00:36.840> Rainier<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.440> about<00:00:37.590> 9,000<00:00:38.489> feet<00:00:38.719> from<00:00:39.719> base

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
of Rainier is about 9,000 feet from base

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.590 
of Rainier is about 9,000 feet from base
camp<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.500> summit<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.790> about<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
camp to the summit so this is about the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.990 
camp to the summit so this is about the
the<00:00:42.989> elevation<00:00:43.739> gain<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.160> loss<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.550> about<00:00:44.789> two

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the elevation gain and loss is about two

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.420 
the elevation gain and loss is about two
and<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.149> half<00:00:45.180> summit<00:00:45.809> climbs<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> lot<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and a half summit climbs so a lot of

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.560 
and a half summit climbs so a lot of
people<00:00:47.550> don't<00:00:47.730> realize<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.390> that's

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
people don't realize that that's

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.869 
people don't realize that that's
actually<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.260> pretty<00:00:49.829> big<00:00:50.039> deal<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.520> far<00:00:50.760> as

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
actually a pretty big deal as far as

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.990 
actually a pretty big deal as far as
elevation<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> here's<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:54.180> profile<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:56.000> just

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
elevation so here's a profile of just

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
elevation so here's a profile of just
the<00:00:57.149> trail<00:00:57.510> itself<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.469> kind<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.710> see

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the trail itself and you can kind of see

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.110 
the trail itself and you can kind of see
that<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.609> goes<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.120> down<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.390> lot<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> lot

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
that it goes up and down a lot so a lot

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.530 
that it goes up and down a lot so a lot
of<00:01:03.180> big<00:01:03.570> Hills<00:01:04.790> basically<00:01:05.790> what<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.270> man<00:01:06.510> is

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
of big Hills basically what this man is

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.990 
of big Hills basically what this man is
every<00:01:06.869> day<00:01:07.049> you're<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.310> down<00:01:08.670> some

to 250 people a year complete the entire
trail<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.579> as<00:01:29.970> far<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:30.329> our<00:01:30.450> family<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:31.020> six

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
trail so as far as our family of six

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.390 
trail so as far as our family of six
this<00:01:31.470> means<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.070> three

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
this means that we have about three

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.929 
this means that we have about three
percent<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.150> number<00:01:33.829> this<00:01:34.829> summer<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
percent of this number this summer and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.350 
percent of this number this summer and
it<00:01:36.390> takes<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> average<00:01:37.490> person<00:01:38.490> about<00:01:38.579> 1014

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
it takes the average person about 1014

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.230 
it takes the average person about 1014
days<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.869> did<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.229> 12<00:01:40.560> days<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:42.119> the

of wildflowers these are some crazy

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.759 
of wildflowers these are some crazy
mushroom<00:03:36.970> type<00:03:37.269> flowers<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:38.170> we<00:03:38.260> saw<00:03:38.470> on<00:03:38.650> the

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769

mushroom type flowers that we saw on the
trail<00:03:39.040> here<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:41.010> one<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.600> we<00:03:43.600> didn't

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
trail here and one of the we didn't

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.140 
trail here and one of the we didn't
realize<00:03:44.200> but<00:03:44.530> hundreds<00:03:45.130> of<00:03:45.310> bridges<00:03:45.549> that<00:03:45.790> we

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
realize but hundreds of bridges that we

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:55.040 
realize but hundreds of bridges that we
were<00:03:46.299> gonna<00:03:46.450> cross<00:03:46.720> through<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.470> whole<00:03:47.680> days

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.960 

yeah<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.840> entire<00:03:59.440> the<00:04:00.340> entire<00:04:00.580> trail

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
yeah so the entire the entire trail

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.180 
yeah so the entire the entire trail
consists<00:04:01.480> of<00:04:01.540> walking<00:04:01.960> around<00:04:02.290> melting

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
consists of walking around melting

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.790 
consists of walking around melting
glaciers<00:04:03.550> so<00:04:03.760> there's<00:04:03.910> there's<00:04:04.330> actually

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
glaciers so there's there's actually

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.140 
glaciers so there's there's actually
probably<00:04:05.800> hundreds<00:04:06.280> maybe<00:04:06.850> one<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.090> two

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
probably hundreds maybe one to two

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.520 
probably hundreds maybe one to two
hundred<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.570> these<00:04:07.630> bridges<00:04:08.110> that<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.290> walk

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
hundred of these bridges that you walk

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.610 
hundred of these bridges that you walk
across<00:04:08.650> different<00:04:09.250> streams<00:04:10.410> here's<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.500> view

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
across different streams here's a view

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.680 
across different streams here's a view
of<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.800> actual<00:04:12.070> mountain<00:04:12.460> we<00:04:13.330> didn't<00:04:13.570> know

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
of the actual mountain we didn't know

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.150 
of the actual mountain we didn't know
how<00:04:13.900> rare<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.440> view<00:04:14.650> of<00:04:14.740> the<00:04:14.830> mountain<00:04:15.070> was

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
how rare the view of the mountain was

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.330
