00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
stitches in the upper stitches I'd like

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.789 
stitches in the upper stitches I'd like
to<00:01:26.860> pick<00:01:27.040> up<00:01:27.100> two<00:01:27.579> stitches<00:01:28.000> in<00:01:28.390> this<00:01:28.689> area<00:01:29.140> we

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
to pick up two stitches in this area we

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.219 
to pick up two stitches in this area we
could<00:01:29.950> spend<00:01:30.219> a<00:01:30.399> lot<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.670> time<00:01:31.030> saying<00:01:31.840> where

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
could spend a lot of time saying where

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.350 
could spend a lot of time saying where
to<00:01:32.530> pick<00:01:32.740> them<00:01:32.890> up<00:01:32.920> but<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.700> doesn't<00:01:34.000> really

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
to pick them up but it doesn't really

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.660 
to pick them up but it doesn't really
matter<00:01:34.659> just<00:01:35.079> simply<00:01:35.530> picking<00:01:36.369> up<00:01:36.490> and

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
matter just simply picking up and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.670 
matter just simply picking up and
knitting<00:01:36.700> two<00:01:37.180> stitches<00:01:37.210> in<00:01:37.869> this<00:01:38.079> area<00:01:38.469> will

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
knitting two stitches in this area will

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.179 
knitting two stitches in this area will
help<00:01:38.950> close<00:01:39.310> that<00:01:39.729> gap<00:01:40.060> up<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.710> decide

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
help close that gap up so to decide

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.420 
help close that gap up so to decide
where<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.520> go<00:01:42.700> I<00:01:42.850> just<00:01:43.359> put<00:01:43.840> my<00:01:44.049> needle<00:01:44.710> in<00:01:45.159> and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
where to go I just put my needle in and

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.349 
where to go I just put my needle in and
see<00:01:45.789> if<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.240> get<00:01:46.299> a<00:01:46.750> nice<00:01:47.340> stable<00:01:48.340> little<00:01:48.939> area

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
see if I get a nice stable little area

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.270 
see if I get a nice stable little area
and<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.960> seems<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.409> work<00:01:50.530> just<00:01:50.560> fine

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
and that seems to work just fine

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.029 
and that seems to work just fine
so<00:01:51.909> I'll<00:01:52.030> wrap<00:01:52.270> my<00:01:52.299> yarn<00:01:52.479> around<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.409> draw<00:01:53.770> a

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
so I'll wrap my yarn around and draw a

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.740 
so I'll wrap my yarn around and draw a
loop<00:01:54.280> through<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:54.850> that's<00:01:55.000> pick<00:01:55.359> up<00:01:55.539> and<00:01:55.719> knit

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
loop through so that's pick up and knit

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.029 
loop through so that's pick up and knit
so<00:01:56.200> there's<00:01:56.409> one<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:59.229> looks<00:01:59.530> like<00:01:59.770> maybe

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
so there's one and this looks like maybe

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.050 
so there's one and this looks like maybe
a<00:02:00.159> good<00:02:00.820> area<00:02:01.390> right<00:02:02.020> here<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:02.770> again<00:02:03.100> doesn't

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
a good area right here and again doesn't

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.459 
a good area right here and again doesn't
really<00:02:04.210> matter<00:02:04.450> you<00:02:04.600> can<00:02:04.780> see<00:02:04.990> here<00:02:05.200> are<00:02:05.320> some

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
really matter you can see here are some

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.440 
really matter you can see here are some
of<00:02:05.590> my<00:02:05.619> strands<00:02:06.549> from<00:02:06.729> my<00:02:06.939> knitting<00:02:07.299> and

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
of my strands from my knitting and

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.410 
of my strands from my knitting and
that's<00:02:07.689> okay<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.320> will<00:02:09.130> just<00:02:09.520> then<00:02:09.910> wrap<00:02:10.240> my

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.570 
that's okay I will just then wrap my
yarn<00:02:10.450> around<00:02:10.780> draw<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.260> loop<00:02:11.470> through<00:02:11.740> so<00:02:12.400> now<00:02:12.430> I

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580

Loup<00:02:26.439> I'm<00:02:27.040> going<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.549> rearrange<00:02:28.540> my<00:02:28.930> needles

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
Loup I'm going to rearrange my needles

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.380 
Loup I'm going to rearrange my needles
and<00:02:31.030> now<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.780> will<00:02:32.109> start<00:02:32.349> knitting<00:02:32.799> the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
and now I will start knitting the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.679 
and now I will start knitting the
stitches<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.420> are<00:02:35.400> above<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.909> heel<00:02:37.150> opening

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
stitches that are above the heel opening

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.229 
stitches that are above the heel opening
if<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.680> have<00:02:38.920> double<00:02:39.459> points<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.849> may<00:02:40.000> want

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
if you have double points you may want

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.339 
if you have double points you may want
to<00:02:40.329> divide<00:02:40.810> this<00:02:41.290> needle<00:02:42.010> maybe<00:02:42.280> into<00:02:42.579> two

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
to divide this needle maybe into two

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.250 
to divide this needle maybe into two
these<00:02:44.349> stitches<00:02:44.530> into<00:02:44.829> two<00:02:45.040> needles<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:47.170> now

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
these stitches into two needles so now

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.710 
these stitches into two needles so now
I'm<00:02:47.409> going<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.769> do<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.340> same<00:02:48.819> thing<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.659> I

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
I'm going to do the same thing that I

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.410 
I'm going to do the same thing that I
did<00:02:49.989> before<00:02:50.980> I'm<00:02:51.489> going<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.819> go<00:02:51.939> ahead<00:02:52.060> and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
and I will continue knitting all the way

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.960 
and I will continue knitting all the way
across<00:03:07.620> these<00:03:08.620> stitches<00:03:09.159> that<00:03:09.489> were<00:03:09.639> above

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
across these stitches that were above

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.280 
across these stitches that were above
the<00:03:10.030> opening<00:03:13.530> I'll<00:03:14.530> knit<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:15.040> last<00:03:15.220> stitch

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
the opening I'll knit the last stitch

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.080 
the opening I'll knit the last stitch
these<00:03:17.290> stitches<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.859> were<00:03:18.069> above<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.579> heel

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
opening and I'm going to do the same

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.360 
opening and I'm going to do the same
thing<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.299> I<00:03:22.329> did<00:03:22.689> on<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.079> other<00:03:23.109> side<00:03:23.650> where

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
thing that I did on the other side where

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.690 
thing that I did on the other side where
I<00:03:24.400> had<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.819> gap<00:03:25.750> or<00:03:26.049> a<00:03:26.349> ditch<00:03:26.709> I'm<00:03:27.159> going<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.609> go

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
I had a gap or a ditch I'm going to go

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.190 
I had a gap or a ditch I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:27.819> and<00:03:28.120> pick<00:03:28.329> up<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.720> knit<00:03:28.750> two<00:03:29.139> stitches

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
ahead and pick up and knit two stitches

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.819 
ahead and pick up and knit two stitches
in<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:30.129> area<00:03:30.639> so<00:03:31.329> again<00:03:31.510> I'm<00:03:31.989> just<00:03:32.049> going<00:03:32.769> to

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
in this area so again I'm just going to

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.520 
in this area so again I'm just going to
put<00:03:33.310> my<00:03:33.549> needle<00:03:33.609> in<00:03:34.329> where<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:34.780> think<00:03:35.260> looks

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
put my needle in where I think looks

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.689 
put my needle in where I think looks
like<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:35.799> nice<00:03:36.099> secure<00:03:36.760> spot<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:38.430> wrap<00:03:39.430> my<00:03:39.669> yarn

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
like a nice secure spot and wrap my yarn

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.689 
like a nice secure spot and wrap my yarn
around<00:03:40.329> and<00:03:40.690> draw<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.739> loop<00:03:42.040> through<00:03:42.310> so

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
around and draw a loop through so

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.110 
around and draw a loop through so
there's<00:03:42.879> one<00:03:43.239> pickup<00:03:43.690> in<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.079> and<00:03:44.879> here<00:03:45.879> looks

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
there's one pickup in it and here looks

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.569 
there's one pickup in it and here looks
like<00:03:46.209> another<00:03:46.569> good<00:03:46.810> spot<00:03:47.049> you<00:03:47.560> can<00:03:47.709> see<00:03:48.010> I've

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
like another good spot you can see I've

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.009 
like another good spot you can see I've
caught<00:03:48.819> a<00:03:48.849> couple<00:03:49.060> strands<00:03:49.569> and<00:03:49.840> that's

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
caught a couple strands and that's

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.649 
caught a couple strands and that's
totally<00:03:50.319> fine<00:03:50.639> these<00:03:51.639> are<00:03:51.819> not<00:03:51.970> live<00:03:52.269> stitches

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
totally fine these are not live stitches

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.110 
totally fine these are not live stitches
so<00:03:53.079> if<00:03:53.169> you<00:03:53.290> draw<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.739> loop<00:03:53.949> through<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.340> don't

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
so if you draw a loop through and don't

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.280 
so if you draw a loop through and don't
like<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.449> way<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.659> looks<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:55.989> can<00:03:56.139> just

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
like the way it looks you can just

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.890 
like the way it looks you can just
simply<00:03:56.440> take<00:03:56.829> it<00:03:56.979> out<00:03:57.099> and<00:03:57.280> try<00:03:57.519> again<00:03:57.669> so<00:03:58.659> now

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
simply take it out and try again so now

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.170 
simply take it out and try again so now
I<00:03:58.930> have<00:03:59.349> all<00:03:59.590> of<00:03:59.620> my<00:03:59.919> stitches<00:04:00.340> picked<00:04:00.549> up<00:04:00.819> and

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
I have all of my stitches picked up and

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.219 
I have all of my stitches picked up and
now<00:04:02.019> I<00:04:02.319> am<00:04:02.590> ready<00:04:02.949> to<00:04:03.370> begin<00:04:03.840> knitting<00:04:04.840> all<00:04:05.169> the

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
now I am ready to begin knitting all the

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.939 
now I am ready to begin knitting all the
way<00:04:05.919> around<00:04:06.599> now<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.659> formula<00:04:08.169> that<00:04:08.409> I<00:04:08.620> like

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
way around now the formula that I like

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.929 
way around now the formula that I like
to<00:04:09.189> use<00:04:09.430> for<00:04:09.909> my<00:04:09.970> heel<00:04:10.419> is<00:04:10.629> I<00:04:11.439> will<00:04:11.949> decrease<00:04:12.639> on

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
to use for my heel is I will decrease on

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:20.399 
to use for my heel is I will decrease on
each<00:04:13.840> end<00:04:14.699> or<00:04:15.699> each<00:04:15.970> side<00:04:16.599> of<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:18.549> heel<00:04:19.409> above

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
each end or each side of the heel above

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.920 
each end or each side of the heel above
and<00:04:20.620> below<00:04:20.859> so<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.220> decrease<00:04:21.880> on<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.419> right<00:04:22.599> and

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
and below so a decrease on the right and

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.830 
and below so a decrease on the right and
the<00:04:22.990> left<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.530> then<00:04:24.130> again<00:04:24.430> here<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.240> again

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
the left and then again here and again

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.779 
the left and then again here and again
here<00:04:26.050> so<00:04:26.949> my<00:04:27.250> formula<00:04:27.610> for<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:29.759> like<00:04:30.759> to

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
here so my formula for that is I like to

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.790 
here so my formula for that is I like to
knit<00:04:31.090> one<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.659> then

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
knit one and then

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.550 
knit one and then
SSK<00:04:35.099> my<00:04:36.099> needles<00:04:36.490> straight<00:04:36.789> here<00:04:37.470> tighten<00:04:38.470> up

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
SSK my needles straight here tighten up

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.409 
SSK my needles straight here tighten up
that<00:04:38.740> little<00:04:39.009> blue<00:04:39.159> sky<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.669> if<00:04:39.759> you<00:04:39.879> can<00:04:40.090> knit

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
that little blue sky and if you can knit

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.450 
that little blue sky and if you can knit
this<00:04:40.569> very<00:04:40.930> securely<00:04:41.530> here<00:04:41.949> so<00:04:42.129> it<00:04:42.190> will<00:04:42.280> keep

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
this very securely here so it will keep

this<00:05:35.800> first<00:05:36.039> round<00:05:36.280> you<00:05:36.430> might<00:05:36.520> want<00:05:36.699> to<00:05:36.819> give

this first round you might want to give

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.990 
this first round you might want to give
it<00:05:37.449> a<00:05:37.509> nice<00:05:37.690> good<00:05:37.900> tug<00:05:38.229> so<00:05:38.500> you<00:05:38.560> keep<00:05:38.860> that<00:05:39.130> nice

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.460 
it a nice good tug so you keep that nice
and<00:05:40.330> secure<00:05:41.199> and<00:05:41.880> then<00:05:42.880> do<00:05:43.090> an<00:05:43.360> SSK

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.450 

and<00:05:48.680> then<00:05:49.490> I<00:05:49.790> will<00:05:50.360> knit<00:05:51.050> all<00:05:51.350> the<00:05:51.410> way<00:05:51.770> to<00:05:51.980> the

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
and then I will knit all the way to the

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.490 
and then I will knit all the way to the
end<00:05:52.730> of<00:05:53.090> this<00:05:53.270> side<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:53.990> last<00:05:54.230> three

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
end of this side to the last three

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.650 
end of this side to the last three
stitches<00:05:54.530> knit<00:05:55.400> two<00:05:55.640> together<00:05:55.820> and<00:05:56.150> knit<00:05:56.330> one

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
stitches knit two together and knit one

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.740 
stitches knit two together and knit one
so<00:05:57.350> that<00:05:57.620> would<00:05:57.800> be<00:05:58.040> a<00:05:58.310> decrease<00:05:58.820> round<00:05:59.450> and

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
so that would be a decrease round and

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.020 
so that would be a decrease round and
when<00:06:00.440> I<00:06:00.470> am<00:06:00.680> making<00:06:00.860> an<00:06:01.160> afterthought<00:06:01.730> he'll

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
when I am making an afterthought he'll

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.460 
when I am making an afterthought he'll
because<00:06:02.360> I<00:06:02.480> have<00:06:02.600> picked<00:06:02.870> up<00:06:03.080> those<00:06:03.230> extra

because I have picked up those extra

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.940 
because I have picked up those extra
stitches<00:06:04.220> in<00:06:04.460> this<00:06:04.910> ditch<00:06:05.300> or<00:06:05.600> Gap<00:06:06.200> area<00:06:06.500> I

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
stitches in this ditch or Gap area I

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.450 
stitches in this ditch or Gap area I
usually<00:06:07.910> like<00:06:08.120> to<00:06:08.150> do<00:06:08.420> to<00:06:08.900> decrease<00:06:09.350> rounds<00:06:10.280> in

usually like to do to decrease rounds in
a<00:06:10.640> row<00:06:10.670> and<00:06:11.180> then<00:06:12.080> from<00:06:12.650> that<00:06:12.800> point<00:06:13.070> on<00:06:13.310> I<00:06:13.550> will

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
a row and then from that point on I will

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.630 
a row and then from that point on I will
alternate<00:06:14.630> a<00:06:14.870> decrease<00:06:15.710> round<00:06:15.860> which<00:06:16.430> I'm

alternate a decrease round which I'm
actually<00:06:16.970> taking<00:06:17.510> away<00:06:17.630> one<00:06:18.140> two<00:06:18.770> three<00:06:19.550> and

four stitches and around and then I'll

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.950

one of my favorite things to do with an

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
afterthought heal is to stripe it so I

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.909 
afterthought heal is to stripe it so I
have<00:06:53.419> used<00:06:53.690> just<00:06:53.810> a<00:06:54.020> minimal<00:06:54.380> amount<00:06:54.620> of<00:06:54.710> yarn

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919
