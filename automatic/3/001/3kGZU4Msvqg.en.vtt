we<00:00:09.240> there's<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.260> four<00:00:10.559> speed<00:00:10.860> shifting<00:00:11.519> pattern

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
we there's a four speed shifting pattern

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.780 
we there's a four speed shifting pattern
it's<00:00:12.000> there's<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.360> decal<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.549> side<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
it's there's a decal on the side of the

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.660 
it's there's a decal on the side of the
car<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.240> shows<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.900> then

dunkle over that red mark speed because

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.040 
dunkle over that red mark speed because
these<00:00:43.220> engines<00:00:43.640> are<00:00:43.760> scarce<00:00:44.090> to<00:00:44.269> come<00:00:44.449> by<00:00:44.629> and

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
so you want to take care of it I don't

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.079 
so you want to take care of it I don't
drive<00:00:53.180> this<00:00:53.390> one<00:00:53.570> over<00:00:53.839> 40<00:00:54.760> Ford<00:00:55.760> even<00:00:56.030> though

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
third right now third gear let's see

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.200 
third right now third gear let's see
there's<00:01:37.210> 25<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:38.620> know<00:01:39.430> it's<00:01:39.580> kind<00:01:39.760> of<00:01:39.820> Wiggly

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
there's 25 I know it's kind of Wiggly

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.860

but<00:01:40.420> I'm<00:01:40.510> holding<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.810> camera<00:01:41.050> take<00:01:41.560> it

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
but I'm holding the camera take it

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.150 
but I'm holding the camera take it
okay<00:01:43.500> fourth<00:01:44.130> gear<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.790> go<00:01:44.940> forward<00:01:46.160> shifts

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
okay fourth gear you go forward shifts

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.830 
okay fourth gear you go forward shifts
rule<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.700> don't<00:01:47.850> want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> get<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.390> hurry

shifting maze that they're not they're

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.140 
shifting maze that they're not they're
not<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.930> gearbox<00:01:52.230> that<00:01:52.710> was<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> fast<00:01:53.670> shifter

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
not a gearbox that was a fast shifter

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.670 
not a gearbox that was a fast shifter
you<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.390> take<00:01:54.810> your<00:01:54.930> time<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.200> they<00:01:55.440> shift

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you just take your time and they shift

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.670 
you just take your time and they shift
fine<00:01:56.450> same<00:01:57.450> way<00:01:57.600> when<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.900> downshift<00:01:58.140> you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
fine same way when you downshift you

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.140 
fine same way when you downshift you
want<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.010> it<00:01:59.130> slowly<00:01:59.430> they<00:01:59.700> wilt<00:01:59.910> down

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150
