birthday here in Japan it was 3,000 yen
it<00:00:07.109> comes<00:00:07.259> with<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:07.470> nice<00:00:07.710> case<00:00:08.480> and<00:00:09.480> let's

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
it comes with this nice case and let's

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.209 
it comes with this nice case and let's
look<00:00:09.840> along<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.080> inside<00:00:10.559> what's<00:00:10.980> on<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
look along the inside what's on the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.100 
look along the inside what's on the
inside<00:00:11.340> here<00:00:11.880> there<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:12.480> basically<00:00:12.809> two

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
inside here there are basically two

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.530 
inside here there are basically two
parts<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.530> come<00:00:13.650> inside<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:14.070> case<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:15.059> IR

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
parts that come inside this case the IR

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.840 
parts that come inside this case the IR
controller<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.710> airplane<00:00:17.100> notice<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
controller and the airplane notice the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.260 
controller and the airplane notice the
size<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.240> plane<00:00:18.449> against<00:00:18.720> my<00:00:18.900> hand<00:00:20.090> it's<00:00:21.090> not

actual fly time of this thing is maybe
about<00:01:20.880> 30<00:01:21.150> seconds<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> plug<00:01:22.740> into<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> top

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
about 30 seconds you plug into the top

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.270 
about 30 seconds you plug into the top
of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.909> IR<00:01:24.299> controller<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:26.009> these<00:01:26.159> little

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
of the IR controller see these little

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.980 
of the IR controller see these little
flashing<00:01:26.759> light<00:01:26.939> down<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.360> that'll<00:01:27.960> keep

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
now that we're charged up let's give it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.900 
now that we're charged up let's give it
a<00:02:06.720> try

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
a try

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.850 
a try
the<00:02:08.910> thing<00:02:09.119> works<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.540> infrared<00:02:09.960> controls<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the thing works on infrared controls and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.400 
the thing works on infrared controls and
so<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.660> helps<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.170> small

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so it kind of helps to be in a small

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.370 
so it kind of helps to be in a small
room<00:02:13.680> turning<00:02:14.460> up<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.880> throttle<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.900> to

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
room turning up the throttle on it to

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.440 
room turning up the throttle on it to
see<00:02:16.590> top<00:02:17.250> throttle<00:02:17.670> action<00:02:17.970> moves<00:02:18.120> around<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
see top throttle action moves around the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.440 
see top throttle action moves around the
desk<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:20.430> get<00:02:20.580> actually<00:02:20.880> rudder<00:02:21.060> control

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
desk and to get actually rudder control

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.210 
desk and to get actually rudder control
and<00:02:21.750> one<00:02:21.900> goes<00:02:22.110> left<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.440> right<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.800> course<00:02:23.070> as

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
and one goes left and right of course as

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.640 
and one goes left and right of course as
you<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:23.970> see<00:02:24.150> hitting<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.930> left<00:02:25.140> button<00:02:25.500> on

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
you can see hitting the left button on

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.590 
you can see hitting the left button on
the<00:02:25.860> rudder<00:02:26.010> will<00:02:26.520> make<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.910> ready<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.300> go<00:02:27.390> left

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
the rudder will make it ready to go left

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.230 
the rudder will make it ready to go left
it<00:02:28.530> would<00:02:28.590> go<00:02:28.710> right<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.160> it's<00:02:29.550> not<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> desk<00:02:29.970> in

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
it would go right but it's not a desk in

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.840 
it would go right but it's not a desk in
it<00:02:30.330> right<00:02:31.020> but<00:02:31.860> anyway<00:02:32.010> let's<00:02:32.430> see<00:02:32.550> how<00:02:32.670> this

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850
