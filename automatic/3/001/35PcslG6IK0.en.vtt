because<00:04:30.169> we<00:04:30.650> hope<00:04:30.860> remember<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.340> name<00:04:31.520> of

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
because we hope remember the name of

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.570 
because we hope remember the name of
Poseidon<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:32.509> fairly<00:04:33.470> good<00:04:33.650> idea<00:04:34.039> to<00:04:34.310> put<00:04:34.490> in

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
Poseidon a fairly good idea to put in

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.159 
Poseidon a fairly good idea to put in
how<00:04:34.759> many<00:04:34.820> seconds<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.600> soon<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:35.810> canal

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
how many seconds and soon that canal

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.860 
how many seconds and soon that canal
runs<00:04:36.410> out<00:04:36.650> so<00:04:37.009> if<00:04:37.880> a<00:04:37.970> whole<00:04:38.120> bird<00:04:38.210> -<00:04:38.539> I'm<00:04:38.690> gonna

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
runs out so if a whole bird - I'm gonna

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.710 
runs out so if a whole bird - I'm gonna
fill<00:04:39.050> would<00:04:39.169> say<00:04:39.350> it's<00:04:39.620> in<00:04:39.770> these<00:04:39.889> seconds

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
fill would say it's in these seconds

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.520 
fill would say it's in these seconds
just<00:04:41.720> be<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.080> good<00:04:42.740> idea

ability<00:06:43.960> I<00:06:43.990> suggest<00:06:44.410> you<00:06:44.590> get<00:06:44.770> it<00:06:45.010> it's<00:06:45.700> close

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
ability I suggest you get it it's close

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.570 
ability I suggest you get it it's close
to<00:06:46.180> Hedgehog<00:06:46.750> in<00:06:47.080> power<00:06:47.410> because<00:06:47.740> it's<00:06:48.130> isn't

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
to Hedgehog in power because it's isn't

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.450 
to Hedgehog in power because it's isn't
it's<00:06:48.910> a<00:06:49.090> range<00:06:49.330> ability<00:06:50.320> and<00:06:50.890> it<00:06:51.040> affects<00:06:51.250> an

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
it's a range ability and it affects an

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.900 
it's a range ability and it affects an
area<00:06:51.880> of<00:06:52.000> people<00:06:53.160> yeah<00:06:54.160> but<00:06:54.220> one<00:06:54.460> goes<00:06:54.610> in<00:06:54.760> one

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910 
area of people yeah but one goes in one

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.730 
area of people yeah but one goes in one
direction<00:06:55.060> and<00:06:55.630> one<00:06:55.780> goes<00:06:56.050> all<00:06:56.380> different

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
direction and one goes all different

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.500 
direction and one goes all different
directions<00:06:56.800> but<00:06:57.430> I<00:06:57.520> just<00:06:57.640> say<00:06:57.790> beside<00:06:58.180> there's

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
directions but I just say beside there's

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.700 
directions but I just say beside there's
more<00:06:58.660> potential<00:06:58.960> because<00:06:59.380> you<00:06:59.500> can<00:06:59.590> hit

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
more potential because you can hit

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.200 
more potential because you can hit
someone<00:06:59.920> and<00:07:00.070> once<00:07:00.340> if<00:07:00.520> you<00:07:00.550> hit<00:07:00.850> some<00:07:01.030> back

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
someone and once if you hit some back

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.300 
someone and once if you hit some back
incident<00:07:01.750> wave<00:07:01.870> maybe<00:07:02.710> if<00:07:02.890> there's<00:07:03.100> like<00:07:03.220> a

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
incident wave maybe if there's like a

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.730 
incident wave maybe if there's like a
simple<00:07:03.640> not<00:07:03.790> back<00:07:04.060> yet<00:07:04.300> like<00:07:04.450> Rhino<00:07:04.810> you<00:07:05.530> can

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
simple not back yet like Rhino you can

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.650 
simple not back yet like Rhino you can
use<00:07:05.890> Rhino<00:07:06.190> to<00:07:06.370> knock<00:07:06.610> them<00:07:06.880> back<00:07:07.090> into<00:07:07.420> the

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
use Rhino to knock them back into the

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.330 
use Rhino to knock them back into the
wave<00:07:07.810> or<00:07:08.460> just<00:07:09.460> some<00:07:09.610> cool<00:07:10.210> little<00:07:10.390> ideas<00:07:10.870> I

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
wave or just some cool little ideas I

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.340 
wave or just some cool little ideas I
would<00:07:12.340> be<00:07:12.490> really<00:07:12.730> cool<00:07:12.930> any<00:07:13.930> worse<00:07:14.200> I<00:07:14.290> know

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.350 
would be really cool any worse I know

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.080 
would be really cool any worse I know
right<00:07:14.530> sup<00:07:14.830> mission<00:07:15.250> look<00:07:15.400> this<00:07:15.580> is<00:07:15.730> rope<00:07:15.910> and

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090 
right sup mission look this is rope and

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.200 
right sup mission look this is rope and
serious<00:07:16.360> next<00:07:16.570> time<00:07:16.690> see<00:07:17.140> you
