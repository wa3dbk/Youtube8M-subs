00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hi everyone I'm rocks and in this 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.530
 video I'm going to show you a concept for 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.200
 survival maps 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.090
 where we can have recordings 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.000
 customized so what we have 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.810
 what to do is place a drop on 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.230
 pointing up after on the dow 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.010
 per we place the custom crafter 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.090
 what we want to do 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:31.840
 in this case I'm going to create a sponge with 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.320
 this container and then I use my 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.320
 Magic book 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.830
 and how can you see there in the chat says 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.900
 sponge craft earth so all my 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.900
 book and my sponge 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.720
 and if I want to do it again 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.720
 I can also do it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.120
 as an example here I have a normal book 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.870
 that has to be right up 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.360
 the normal book will not do anything and without 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.690
 However, the magic book 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.480
 It is what characterizes us 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.360
 sponge so this is about the 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.760
 concept for survival maps and 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.700
 let's see how it's done 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.750
 so here we have the whole network ton 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.000
 that makes this concept possible and how 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.010
 we can see here we have a clock 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.190
 covers which is encouraged because here 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.980
 I have the command to modify the time 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.550
 of paper transfer to 80 which 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.370
 it slows it down and makes it more viable 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.530
 for for survival maps for not 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.380
 have both lag and this block of 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.979
 commands above 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.710
 is the one that is testing if there is any 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.670
 book in the world that is named 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.590
 magical book if that's how 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.799
 can see there are activated 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.739
 although the other time there we are then 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.069
 once activated this sends your 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.090
 signal 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:18.799
 and activates this other one that uses the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.950
 execute command that makes the entity 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.610
 of the book run a test command by 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.010
 Blog 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.840
 that is just 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.470
 the draper here with the items that 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.090
 we specify 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:44.959
 this is the container for the sponge 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:49.260
 there it is and here below we have a 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.510
 block that replaces this block of 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.690
 commands by this same block of 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.510
 commands only just so that at 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.420
 replace it turn off this buyer and it 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.290
 update the system 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.790
 so 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.329
 and what 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.840
 since the item executed the test per block 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.980
 and detected that if the hopper is with the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.359
 items we want 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.030
 I say the drop er with the items that 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.740
 we want then this is activated 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.430
 buyer 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.329
 and what it does is 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.909
 run again the same item a blog 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.459
 day time that changes changes the 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.600
 information of the pro per block 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.760
 have below 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.830
 do not change it 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.690
 the item that we want in this case is 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.110
 the sponge 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.950
 just just a sponge and in slot 4 that 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.900
 it's in the center and just like it's here 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.840
 this block of commands replace 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.360
 it replaces this one with another block 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.260
 of commands with same same command for 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.890
 that are prescribed and finally here we have 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.569
 the message of terror that says sponge 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.579
 am character 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.859
 so let's put it to the test of 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.790
 new position can be in any 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:14.329
 dropper of our world simply 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:18.350
 we must place this mechanism in the 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:21.049
 expansion and it will work forever and 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.410
 this magical book is renamed in the 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:30.720
 Sambil so we put it back 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:33.520
 and we see how they are going to stay there they are 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.430
 and we have our sponge 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.740
 and now for 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.790
 to finish seeing that all work 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.790
 the drones of the world 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.729
 we put our books 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:56.110
 and there is our sponge so 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:59.289
 we can add a lot more very much 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.619
 more character customized to our 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.330
 world with this concept if you are assured 

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:07.270
 if you think of some creation or 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.939
 interesting that you may not be able to 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.399
 do normally in minecraft and 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:15.580
 They would like to do it in survival 

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:19.240
 put in the comments 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.039
 and we can make a schematic that 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.369
 let's put in the production of our 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.369
 world 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.710
 same with this mechanics of putting our 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.630
 magic book we can 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.180
 we can create all the things that 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.090
 we want so I hope you have them 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.070
 liked this concept and they want it 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.910
 use sometime in maps of 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.910
 survival 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.510
 See you in the next videos
