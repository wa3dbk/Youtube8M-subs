00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 attention this video contains spoilers 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.940
 on the plot of dark souls then 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.130
 could ruin some terrible ones 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.170
 surprises that this video game is capable of 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.090
 to also offer you all the rights 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.759
 of music and the brand belong 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.710
 from software and namco bandai 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:21.660
 Thanks and be careful out there because 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.449
 really really a dark casino souls is 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.170
 come out of a piece but let's see what it is 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.080
 is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.820
 it can't be that hard I have to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.510
 only to ward off attacking at the moment 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.700
 quite right 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.780
 typical gaming system other than 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.890
 difficulty that monster also was 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.960
 easy to beat I'm riding 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.640
 welcome my friend 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.829
 play two bells I could go on 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.410
 in history and this is the only one 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.239
 indication that you will have in the course of everything 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.270
 I think the game will kill 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:03.840
 this guy later we play some 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:06.330
 holy bells have attacked me 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.520
 in 5 from all sides and why they had 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.229
 a score goes so high I just wanted to 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.799
 avoid those fire bombs and that 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.830
 damn precipice ok ok i'm 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.869
 going somewhere but that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.869
 place is huge it looks wonderful 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.120
 OMG 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.409
 but how the fuck i make the bridge is too much 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.659
 tight like the perfect devil ho 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.830
 also eliminated the demon bull now not 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:44.659
 it remains for me to begin to understand from what 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.119
 part is this game or hi you don't 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.500
 I had seen I was too busy a 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.950
 look at the sun 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.170
 and so wonderful just like a 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.630
 great father for whom feelings do not 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.520
 can be described you will 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.520
 watch it all day 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.820
 take this white stone so you can 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.539
 summon other players within the 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.390
 your server 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.790
 I meant world of course if you have it 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.720
 patience and multiplayer goes 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.720
 unlocked 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.830
 this church is full of enemies 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.550
 seems difficult idea I will invite a friend 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.410
 the game does not work that way 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.520

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:39.810

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:44.730
 help never hurts should it arrive 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:50.220

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.760
