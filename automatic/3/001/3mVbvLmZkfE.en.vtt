00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello so we end up in this 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.750
 video so this will be for a kind of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.360
 little sequel to the video I did 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.160
 for a simple ring so it will be in 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.139
 the same color except it's this 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.590
 once it would be earrings 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.570
 just as simple as the ring and that's it 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.810
 in the same tones to go with so 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.830
 it's shameful to make an ornament 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.930
 so I immediately started prompt 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.980
 to present to you what I will use 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:34.739
 so from the need no light series of 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:41.610
 red color as well as soft fimo 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:46.950
 white number zero in cookie cutter so 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.820
 here it will be round shaped and it's a 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.920
 kinder surprise and second a little 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.530
 smaller and I would also need 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.690
 of a toothpick so we all started 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.830
 by taking a red tip 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.840
 nothingness and white so here we go 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.930
 we will take approximately the same 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.150
 thing so we'll knead them a little 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.360
 little so that they are easy to 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.360
 to work 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.270
 and then we will mix them to 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.270
 indeed get marbled 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.600
 so here's once you've seen what 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.290
 you know what you're going to say 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:32.280
 that way we'll come and take 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:40.790
 rolls and flatten it so that's after 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.790
 I take my biggest piece and 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.320
 here I am doing a second time 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:21.599
 yeah and spend a second 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.109
 here 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.159
 Then I come with my little one 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.159
 piece and I come 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.269
 I will show you what we get 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.769
 here 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:32.340
 so I left one side a little bit 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:32.340
 bigger than the other 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:55.660
 I come with a small utensil for 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.440
 whether it is good to be only inside 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.440
 be it well 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:29.950
 that's what it gives and then with a 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:34.370
 small cord 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:38.830
 I'm going to make a hole on the side 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.830
 the finest yeah 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:06:01.210
 hop I do it on both sides here 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:05.580
 like this and I do the same thing with 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.580
 the other and then I put them in the oven 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.180
 There you go 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:28.490
 here they are out of the oven 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:28.490
 now we take the little donkey or 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:35.599
 comes and pc 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.700
 and that's what it gives 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.160
 here I hope that this little tutorial 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.610

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.690

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.050
