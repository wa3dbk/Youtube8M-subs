00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.840
 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.550
 thank you for joining us for 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.590
 this new show that will you 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.450
 put the mouth water we go 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.970
 talk this week about recipes from 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.710
 cuisine related to Lent and Easter 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.810
 so good it's true it's not necessarily 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.220
 nice of you try while you 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.970
 may be very careful about your 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.040
 food 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.900
 but hey it's for the good cause and 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.760
 then there we are almost at the end 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.829
 of Lent so it's time to think 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.750
 to the dishes you will prepare for 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.000
 receive your family at easter 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.010
 but first of all a little reminder 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.749
 on the symbolism of the young that the church 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.539
 recommend throughout its forty 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:46.999
 days it's a way to remember the 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.289
 40 years of wandering Hebrews before 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:50.539
 to reach the promised land 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.670
 as well as the 40 days that Christ has 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.269
 spent in the desert to repel the 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.850
 temptations 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.190
 the young is a physical challenge first 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.229
 but it's mostly a spiritual challenge 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.659
 since we deprive ourselves of food for 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.900
 to be hungry for God and when the 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.940
 Lent was instituted in the 4th century 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.840
 Christians have necessarily had to adapt their 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.550
 diet 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.040
 because the rules were very 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.759
 strict a single meal in the evening without 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.860
 meat neither 20 and more surprisingly 100th 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.750
 the egg is actually the symbol of 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.460
 the resurrection with the yellow to 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.439
 the interior that represents life 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.899
 nascent and as the true resurrection 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.640
 is that of Christ well we 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.049
 consume again as from 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.939
 Easter 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.140
 a whole series of recipes without 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.259
 they were born 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.030
 this is the case for example scalded 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.310
 these are very common cupcakes 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.950
 from the thirteenth century manufactured only 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.570
 with water or milk and flour 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.329
 we are hot and in the water 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.049
 boiling hence their name because of 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.539
 their frugality 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.469
 we serve them everywhere in France 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.369
 mainly during the first 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.950
 Sunday of Lent 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.780
 during the brandon party by 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.219
 elsewhere the populations most 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.780
 poor had at heart not to 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.240
 let loose the little food 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.609
 that she had particular milk oil 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.619
 and the eggs and they invented by 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.210
 example the bugnes also called 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.580
 bathed in Lent 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.410
 they are since the 16th century a 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.750
 specialty of the Lyon region 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.700
 we cook them is first to sell 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.500
 stocks on the occasion of mardi gras 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.160
 this famous day where all 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.320
 eccentricities are allowed 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.690
 before restrictions and bugnes 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.850
 have also become a symbol of the mid 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.830
 it is true that hens 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.780
 do not do because m to her continues to 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.730
 to spawn and as the eggs do not get 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.410
 kept no more than twenty days there 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.380
 became important to mark a 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.420
 pause in this spiritual process and 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.430
 in all the south-east of France the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.020
 bugnes was blithely consumed at mid 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.780
 Lent before resuming a 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.520
 leaner diet and then when 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.260
 Easter happens is enough time 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.370
 celebrations to celebrate the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.380
 resurrection of Jesus 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.990
 and as there were always young people 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.790
 have eaten in the pantries 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.460
 the omelette was a typical dish to 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.290
 declare but as we said in the 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.510
 roussillon for example we had 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.190
 the habit of eating ribote 2 of 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.530
 easter before sunrise 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.600
 it was an omelette with bacon on 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.760
 also made egg pie in 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.490
 berry or hard boiled jelly 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.200
 and ham in the morvan not that 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.630
 it is also the lamb that symbolizes 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.270
 obviously the sacrifice of jesus lamb 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.640
 of god we serve everywhere leg of good 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.890
 sure and in the aveyron for example from the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.260
 lamb crust it 's lamb h 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.600
 and roasted in the oven that is laid in a 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.380
 sheet of brick with the egg and after the 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.740
 main course 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.810
 there is the dessert of course at Easter in 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.810
 the vaucluse cooked their arms that where 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.390
 cakes in the shape of a ring and in 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.450
 alsace there is the paschal lamb which is a 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.160
 molded cake in the shape of animal good this is not 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.260
 are just a few examples but we see 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.480
 well how much our regional recipes and 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.140
 family are steeped in the times 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.270
 liturgical 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.470
 good go a game concluded quickly because 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.900
 that all that made me hungry 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.420
 and as we say when the appetite is going 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.430
 will I adapt even by saying when the 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.830
 why how and where everything is going 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.050
 thank you all for sharing this moment 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.860
 with us and now at your stove 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.860
