00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.750

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.150
 first showed interview with a journalist 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.340
 who traveled to 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.429
 the blazing east of Ukraine kiev 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.719
 TV men are not there for 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.420
 ideological reasons ruslan 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.460
 Kotsaba went to Lugansk honestly 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.619
 told what he saw there after that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.650
 end in Kiev would almost have been subjected 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.660
 anathema allegedly betrayed Ukraine by the fact that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.150
 and went to the separatists 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.369
 besides guilty and those that did not find 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.560
 There Russian mercenaries or Chechen 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.780
 battalions but most terrible blamed 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.180
 Ukrainian army in the shelling of civilians 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.829
 residents rarely and nowadays on 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.329
 Ukrainian television is true and we 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.210
 tied up with a Ukrainian reporter 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.550
 TV channel 112 Ruslan Kotsboy Ruslan 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.360
 hello here now 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.360
 your interview is half an hour upon return 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.190
 from the east of Ukraine literally blew up 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.890
 information space like 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.530
 Ukrainian and Russian that you are there 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.040
 such saw in Lugansk hello I 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.540
 First of all, they are not oriented to today 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.619
 really made sure how many people 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.770
 before watched this video and even i like 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.750
 would have looked at that comments on their 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.630
 quantity and quality of comments 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.159
 how much people care and if 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.880
 honestly in lugansk 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.860
 I was a period of so-called calm then 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.170
 there is truce and I just then 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.460
 had the attention had the opportunity 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.189
 focus on recording videos about life 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.040
 no news there say when there 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.979
 shoots runs away but such is the picture video 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.990
 namely live and when I could for already 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.950
 quietly come to the family who say 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.950
 lost 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.820
 the breadwinner where the widow has two daughters and say 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.060
 so with them so delicately about it all 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.910
 talk about life tragedy and and 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.400
 would be a state tragedy now but 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.390
 why do you think your interview caused 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.430
 yet the responses as far as I understand your 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.739
 colleagues accused you of almost 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.340
 betrayal because the output went 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.110
 to the east of Ukraine and worked there as 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.150
 Ukrainian journalist honestly covered 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.150
 developments 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.700
 I understand that you have no problems 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.590
 and credited 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:40.459
 authorities of the self-proclaimed republic 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:44.480
 lnr well firstly i think that no problem 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.880
 it still took me 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.989
 sureties and local television station 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.760
 which is also trying to work by the way 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.950
 Informant English standard that is 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.750
 she falls and one other side but 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.549
 why did such responses have caused 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.079
 and how is yours to your colleagues how are you 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.970
 relate because your colleagues are hardly 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:07.049
 you were not accused of betraying why and 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:10.549
 I think that if you really go 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.450
 meet the standards 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:17.100
 enable 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.799
 two two sides speak out and i if 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.769
 filmed say 2 weeks before that 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.690
 Idar battalion but famous battalion 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:29.329
 Aydar 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.920
 it's from the ministry of defense I couldn't not 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.560
 try to go to take another 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.390
 the side that is the Lugansk militia 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.019
 battlegrounds on the other side 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.410
 front 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.720
 who are these militias here they say almost 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.690
 not Chechen battalions fighting there 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.519
 Ukrainian army in the first Chechens I 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.090
 I have not seen there and I try to be like 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.290
 honest reporters so i'm not talking 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.130
 I did not see rumors Chechens 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.090
 chirva relay his interview about let 's say 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.600
 disproportionate use of force to 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.390
 inaccurate weapons weapons from such a blind 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.510
 as i called 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.740
 that is, there are all these rocket hail 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.950
 mortars and also firstly I think so 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.250
 yesterday well in professional 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.669
 war I think that when it's blind 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.030
 weapons use accordingly 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.340
 too much loss 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.070
 among the civilian population and what 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.169
 terrible among peace journalists and 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.750
 journalists so how would the profession be peaceful 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.290
 even if it is a military journalist military 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.890
 the reporter 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.550
 and it is very hard for me what exactly Russian 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.480
 Colleagues 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.030
 died why all the same your ukrainian 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.980
 No colleagues in Lugansk not in Donetsk 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.650
 that's just you were and your film crew 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.260
 groups 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.110
 i ca n't they talk but still it 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.000
 showed all the same that Ukrainian 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.270
 television needs a little more 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.919
 sink to world standards it was 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.450
 I have no pro not just amazing to me 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:09.040
 it was regrettable because when 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:12.070
 the journalist comes and all with his own eyes 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.810
 will see and if he is a journalist he will be over 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.850
 my honest name yes we have 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.890
 accordingly must speak the truth 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.780
 thank you so much for coming out with us 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.640
 connection it was the opinion of the Ukrainian 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.640
 Reporter Ruslan Kotsaby
