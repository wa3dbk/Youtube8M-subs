this is interesting after being on the
dyno<00:02:10.860> my<00:02:12.620> car<00:02:13.700> kind<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.790> fell<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.210> its<00:02:15.360> face<00:02:15.890> so

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
dyno my car kind of fell on its face so

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.270 
dyno my car kind of fell on its face so
looking<00:02:18.600> at<00:02:18.720> my<00:02:18.750> ignition<00:02:19.230> map<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.730> blue

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
looking at my ignition map the blue

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.770 
looking at my ignition map the blue
highlighted<00:02:23.280> row<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.940> 6,500<00:02:24.900> rpm<00:02:25.320> 1<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.780> just

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
highlighted row is 6,500 rpm 1 I just

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.480 
highlighted row is 6,500 rpm 1 I just
looked<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.290> up<00:02:28.350> but<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.560> can't<00:02:28.800> remember<00:02:28.920> 20

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
looked it up but I can't remember 20

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.950 
looked it up but I can't remember 20
pounds<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:29.940> boost<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.560> 131<00:02:32.360> 37<00:02:33.360> range<00:02:33.630> I

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.570 
pounds of boost is in the 131 37 range I
think<00:02:33.990> look<00:02:34.980> at<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.100> timing<00:02:36.080> 11.2<00:02:37.580> dropping

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
think look at the timing 11.2 dropping

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.750 
think look at the timing 11.2 dropping
down<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.760> 9<00:02:39.150> point<00:02:39.690> 4<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.580> the

I'll<00:02:57.540> be<00:02:57.720> honest<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.320> never<00:02:58.950> really<00:02:59.490> looked<00:02:59.670> at

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
I'll be honest I never really looked at

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.700 
I'll be honest I never really looked at
it<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.920> I'm<00:03:02.100> gonna<00:03:02.280> go<00:03:03.120> from<00:03:03.420> about<00:03:03.660> 15<00:03:04.440> degrees

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
it so I'm gonna go from about 15 degrees

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.380 
it so I'm gonna go from about 15 degrees
and<00:03:05.690> go<00:03:06.690> across<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.860> board<00:03:08.070> because<00:03:08.580> as<00:03:09.060> we

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
and go across the board because as we

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.140 
and go across the board because as we
all<00:03:09.420> know<00:03:09.570> this<00:03:09.990> area<00:03:10.200> down<00:03:10.560> here<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.790> car<00:03:12.000> is

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
all know this area down here the car is

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.540 
all know this area down here the car is
never<00:03:12.510> going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> see<00:03:13.170> all<00:03:13.590> this<00:03:14.280> is

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
never going to see all this is

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.380 
never going to see all this is
irrelevant<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:17.130> meat<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.670> what

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
irrelevant this is the meat of what

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.810 
irrelevant this is the meat of what
you're<00:03:18.630> dealing<00:03:19.230> with

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
you're dealing with

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.850 
you're dealing with
so<00:03:20.820> anyway<00:03:21.150> I'm<00:03:21.270> thinking<00:03:21.900> about<00:03:21.989> 15<00:03:22.650> degrees

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
so anyway I'm thinking about 15 degrees

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.620 
so anyway I'm thinking about 15 degrees
from<00:03:23.820> here<00:03:24.180> all<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.450> way<00:03:25.050> across<00:03:26.270> I'd<00:03:27.270> like<00:03:27.510> to

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
from here all the way across I'd like to

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.100 
from here all the way across I'd like to
go<00:03:27.780> now<00:03:28.080> I've<00:03:28.410> read<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.280> little<00:03:29.520> bit<00:03:29.730> 17<00:03:30.480> but

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
go now I've read a little bit 17 but

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.000 
go now I've read a little bit 17 but
seems<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.100> be<00:03:32.489> kind<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.630> normal<00:03:34.440> area<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:34.920> an

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
seems to be kind of a normal area for an

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.620 
seems to be kind of a normal area for an
RB<00:03:35.250> 25<00:03:35.989> this<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.170> 30<00:03:37.650> which<00:03:38.300> you<00:03:39.300> know<00:03:39.420> it's

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
RB 25 this is a 30 which you know it's

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.800 
RB 25 this is a 30 which you know it's
it's<00:03:39.989> still<00:03:40.260> going<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.410> be<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.709> ballpark

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
it's still going to be in the ballpark

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.290 
it's still going to be in the ballpark
but<00:03:42.810> anyway<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.880> thought<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:45.060> was<00:03:45.150> pretty

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
but anyway I I thought that was pretty

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.600 
but anyway I I thought that was pretty
interesting<00:03:45.870> I'm<00:03:46.019> going<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.260> add<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.400> my

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
interesting I'm going to add that to my

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.500 
interesting I'm going to add that to my
dyno<00:03:48.110> video<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.980> I'm<00:03:50.100> not<00:03:50.340> happy<00:03:50.880> with<00:03:51.060> but

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
dyno video that I'm not happy with but

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.490 
dyno video that I'm not happy with but
looking<00:03:52.350> at<00:03:52.470> my<00:03:52.590> timing<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:54.290> think<00:03:55.290> this

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
looking at my timing I think this

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.509 
looking at my timing I think this
explains<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.250> lot<00:03:56.459> why<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.360> car<00:03:57.630> feels<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:59.220> good

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
explains a lot why the car feels so good

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.990 
explains a lot why the car feels so good
you<00:03:59.790> know<00:03:59.940> 20<00:04:00.360> degrees<00:04:00.750> 19<00:04:01.650> 18<00:04:02.190> degrees<00:04:02.550> the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
you know 20 degrees 19 18 degrees the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.130 
you know 20 degrees 19 18 degrees the
car<00:04:03.239> feels<00:04:03.600> so<00:04:03.959> good<00:04:04.230> but<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.459> higher<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:06.810> rev

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
car feels so good but the higher you rev

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.680 
car feels so good but the higher you rev
it<00:04:07.350> it<00:04:09.110> obviously<00:04:10.110> is<00:04:11.040> not<00:04:11.850> feeling<00:04:12.209> as<00:04:12.480> good

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
it it obviously is not feeling as good

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.570 
it it obviously is not feeling as good
as<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.959> could<00:04:13.140> is<00:04:13.860> it

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
as it could is it

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.970 
as it could is it
I'm<00:04:16.510> gonna<00:04:16.600> just<00:04:16.930> that<00:04:19.440> that's<00:04:20.440> that's<00:04:20.770> a

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
I'm gonna just that that's that's a

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.910 
I'm gonna just that that's that's a
world<00:04:21.280> of<00:04:21.550> horsepower<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.560> believe<00:04:23.560> right

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
world of horsepower I believe right

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.640 
world of horsepower I believe right
there<00:04:25.800> so<00:04:26.800> if<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:26.950> could<00:04:28.020> kind<00:04:29.020> of<00:04:29.110> timing<00:04:29.530> are

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
there so if you could kind of timing are

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.440 
there so if you could kind of timing are

that's<00:04:35.080> kind<00:04:35.290> of<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.470> neighborhood<00:04:35.890> of<00:04:36.100> spite

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
that's kind of the neighborhood of spite

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.120 
that's kind of the neighborhood of spite
or<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:38.470> most<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:39.550> know<00:04:39.640> 22<00:04:40.180> 22<00:04:40.750> is<00:04:41.110> kind<00:04:42.040> of
