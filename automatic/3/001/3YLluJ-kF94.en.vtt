i actually got really scared of bleach

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.160 
i actually got really scared of bleach
because<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> reason<00:00:48.570> why<00:00:48.809> my<00:00:48.989> hair

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
because that was the reason why my hair

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.840 
because that was the reason why my hair
was<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.500> damage<00:00:49.860> because<00:00:50.190> i've<00:00:50.340> used<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.760> lot

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
was that damage because i've used a lot

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.060 
was that damage because i've used a lot
of<00:00:51.000> bleach<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.390> my<00:00:51.539> hair<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.989> i<00:00:52.020> decided<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.739> i

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
of bleach on my hair so i decided that i

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.670 
of bleach on my hair so i decided that i
should<00:00:53.280> go<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.059> my<00:00:54.180> normal<00:00:54.440> natural<00:00:55.440> hair

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
should go back to my normal natural hair

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
should go back to my normal natural hair
color<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.190> didn't<00:00:56.460> really<00:00:56.579> wanted<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.149> do

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
color and I didn't really wanted to do

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.349 
color and I didn't really wanted to do
that<00:00:57.360> because<00:00:57.690> i<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.410> blonde<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.370> i

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
that because i really like blonde and i

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.119 
that because i really like blonde and i
like<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.750> crazy<00:01:01.020> colors<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.100> my

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
like the crazy colors going on in my

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.910 
like the crazy colors going on in my
hair<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.399> that's<00:01:02.879> why<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> didn't<00:01:03.390> want<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> go

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
hair so that's why I didn't want to go

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.550 
hair so that's why I didn't want to go
full<00:01:04.920> back<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.580> brown<00:01:06.510> toy<00:01:06.840> dog<00:01:07.110> was<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> great

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
full back to brown toy dog was a great

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.260 
full back to brown toy dog was a great
idea<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:08.479> dye<00:01:09.479> my<00:01:09.510> roots<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:11.010> brown<00:01:11.580> color<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
idea to dye my roots a brown color and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.380 
idea to dye my roots a brown color and
then<00:01:12.689> faded<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> put<00:01:14.790> purple

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
then faded out like that and put purple

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.330 
then faded out like that and put purple
and<00:01:15.810> pink<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.560> that's<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.830> did<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and pink on it so that's what I did and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.520 
and pink on it so that's what I did and
I<00:01:18.150> think<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.390> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.689> failed<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> other

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
I think I kind of failed on the other

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560 
I think I kind of failed on the other
hand<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.460> did<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> great<00:01:20.880> job<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
hand I think I did a great job with the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.240 
hand I think I did a great job with the
route<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.470> looks<00:01:22.680> pretty<00:01:22.950> nice

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
route because it looks pretty nice

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.160 
route because it looks pretty nice
because<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.759> actually<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.420> through<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.630> perfect

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
because I actually go through a perfect

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.350 
because I actually go through a perfect
color<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.680> fits<00:01:26.070> my<00:01:26.250> roots<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:26.700> i<00:01:27.060> think<00:01:27.270> i

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
color that fits my roots but i think i

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
color that fits my roots but i think i
should<00:01:27.600> put<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> purple<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.680> top<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.159> as

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
should put the purple on top of it as

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.700 
should put the purple on top of it as
well<00:01:29.549> instead<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.630> putting<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.110> from<00:01:31.439> up

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
well instead of just putting it from up

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.679 
well instead of just putting it from up
here<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.210> bit<00:01:33.299> messy
