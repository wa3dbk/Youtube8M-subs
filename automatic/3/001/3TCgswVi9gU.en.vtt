it's got all black buttons except for
this<00:01:59.939> case<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.299> thought<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.540> looks<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.930> like

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
this case I thought it looks like like

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
this case I thought it looks like like
without<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.579> didn't<00:02:02.579> want<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> take<00:02:02.909> away

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
without that didn't want to take away

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.319 
without that didn't want to take away

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
from the original controller so then
