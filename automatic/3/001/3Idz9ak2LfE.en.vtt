so<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.060> going<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.240> be<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.359> review<00:00:06.660> in<00:00:06.779> the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
so this is going to be a review in the

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.910 
so this is going to be a review in the
black<00:00:07.109> mamba<00:00:08.510> gloves<00:00:09.510> these<00:00:10.049> are<00:00:10.110> black<00:00:10.530> mamba

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
black mamba gloves these are black mamba

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.310 
black mamba gloves these are black mamba
in<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.190> true<00:00:11.459> strength<00:00:11.880> nitrile<00:00:12.450> gloves<00:00:12.719> and

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
in this true strength nitrile gloves and

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.499 
in this true strength nitrile gloves and
then<00:00:14.219> over<00:00:14.429> here<00:00:14.460> I'm<00:00:14.730> comparing<00:00:15.059> them<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
then over here I'm comparing them to the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.450 
then over here I'm comparing them to the
500<00:00:16.110> disposable<00:00:16.740> gloves<00:00:17.009> with<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
500 disposable gloves with the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
500 disposable gloves with the
high-density<00:00:18.390> polyethylene<00:00:20.689> these<00:00:21.689> clothes

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
high-density polyethylene these clothes

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.780 
high-density polyethylene these clothes
are<00:00:22.110> ridiculously<00:00:22.619> thin<00:00:22.770> as<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:23.399> see

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
are ridiculously thin as you can see

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.170 
are ridiculously thin as you can see
this<00:00:24.570> box<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.079> a<00:00:25.110> little<00:00:25.470> bit<00:00:25.590> lower<00:00:25.800> than<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
this box is a little bit lower than the

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.460 
this box is a little bit lower than the
Black<00:00:27.180> Mamba<00:00:27.450> and<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.779> Black<00:00:27.960> Mamba<00:00:28.169> there's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
Black Mamba and the Black Mamba there's

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.080 
Black Mamba and the Black Mamba there's
a<00:00:28.529> hundred<00:00:28.980> gloves<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.099> was<00:00:32.250> about<00:00:32.430> 500

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
a hundred gloves and this was about 500

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.380 
a hundred gloves and this was about 500
gloves<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.060> difference

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
gloves and so you can see the difference

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.330 
gloves and so you can see the difference
in<00:00:36.540> thickness

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
in thickness

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.140 
in thickness
but<00:00:38.340> only<00:00:38.550> 100<00:00:39.060> fit<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.510> 500<00:00:40.260> fit<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.530> here

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
but only 100 fit in here 500 fit in here

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.300 
but only 100 fit in here 500 fit in here
these<00:00:42.150> melt<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.870> high<00:00:43.140> temperatures<00:00:43.770> but

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
these melt in high temperatures but

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.560 
these melt in high temperatures but
we're<00:00:44.520> here<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> grill<00:00:46.250> got<00:00:47.250> 350<00:00:48.210> degrees

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
we're here in the grill got 350 degrees

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.410 
we're here in the grill got 350 degrees
and<00:00:48.900> if<00:00:48.990> I<00:00:49.110> touch<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:50.390> with<00:00:51.390> these<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:54.150> tips

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
and if I touch that with these the tips

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.150 
and if I touch that with these the tips
start<00:00:54.660> melting<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.290> it<00:00:55.410> burns<00:00:55.650> me<00:00:55.860> as<00:00:55.980> it

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
start melting and then it burns me as it

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.640 
start melting and then it burns me as it
melts<00:00:56.489> versus<00:00:57.480> these<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.930> these<00:00:58.110> have

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
melts versus these that these have

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.040 
melts versus these that these have
they're<00:00:59.400> thicker<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.910> almost<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.510> Eva<00:01:00.840> as

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
they're thicker that almost as Eva as

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.670 
they're thicker that almost as Eva as
easy<00:01:01.880> also<00:01:02.880> I'm<00:01:03.660> holding<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.559> one

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
easy also I'm holding it this with one

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.719 
easy also I'm holding it this with one
hand<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.159> see<00:01:05.850> how<00:01:06.000> much<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.329> stretches<00:01:07.729> like

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
hand so see how much it stretches like

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.980 
hand so see how much it stretches like
them<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:12.020> no<00:01:13.020> stretching

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
them and if I do that here no stretching

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.710 
them and if I do that here no stretching
but<00:01:15.990> actually<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.030> stretch<00:01:18.360> when<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
but actually and you stretch when you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.630 
but actually and you stretch when you
try<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> put<00:01:19.170> them<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.440> and<00:01:19.620> kind<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.280> rips<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
try to put them on and kind of rips a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.950 
try to put them on and kind of rips a
little<00:01:20.880> bit<00:01:21.000> between<00:01:21.270> these<00:01:21.540> two<00:01:21.720> fingers

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
little bit between these two fingers

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960 
little bit between these two fingers
kind<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> reflect<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.520> space<00:01:23.760> right<00:01:23.909> here

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
kind of reflect this space right here

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.410 
kind of reflect this space right here
rips

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.000 

so<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:29.480> put<00:01:29.690> it<00:01:29.810> on<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.410> as<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.590> can<00:01:30.800> see<00:01:30.980> I
