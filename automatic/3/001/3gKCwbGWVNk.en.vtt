00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
actually go underwater you actually have

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.939 
actually go underwater you actually have
an<00:00:35.180> if<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:35.510> start<00:00:35.780> with<00:00:35.900> this<00:00:36.080> but<00:00:36.350> when<00:00:36.800> you

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
an if you start with this but when you

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
are in this level 80 zone you have an

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.780 
are in this level 80 zone you have an
aquatic<00:00:39.620> Edgar<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:40.400> you<00:00:40.489> can<00:00:40.640> breathe

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
aquatic Edgar so you can breathe

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.369 
aquatic Edgar so you can breathe
underwater<00:00:40.970> you<00:00:41.629> might<00:00:41.809> not<00:00:41.989> always<00:00:42.199> have

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
underwater you might not always have

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.380 
underwater you might not always have
that<00:00:42.650> I<00:00:42.710> don't<00:00:42.860> know<00:00:43.070> but<00:00:43.879> when<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:44.059> once

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
that I don't know but when you once

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.869 
that I don't know but when you once
you're<00:00:44.540> underwater<00:00:44.930> which<00:00:45.589> will<00:00:45.949> maybe<00:00:46.430> it

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
you're underwater which will maybe it

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.490 
you're underwater which will maybe it
will<00:00:47.000> probably<00:00:47.299> PvP<00:00:47.989> on<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.170> water<00:00:48.379> I'm

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
will probably PvP on the water I'm

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.530 
will probably PvP on the water I'm
guessing<00:00:48.890> here<00:00:49.100> just<00:00:49.729> mob<00:00:49.940> maybe<00:00:50.210> even<00:00:50.420> a

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
guessing here just mob maybe even a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.020 
guessing here just mob maybe even a
dungeon<00:00:50.960> that<00:00:51.170> would<00:00:51.260> be<00:00:51.379> freaking<00:00:52.010> nice<00:00:52.190> but

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
dungeon that would be freaking nice but

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.929 
dungeon that would be freaking nice but
either<00:00:53.330> way<00:00:53.510> your<00:00:54.049> spell's<00:00:54.350> all<00:00:54.680> change<00:00:55.070> it's

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:55.939

either way your spell's all change it's
basically<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.420> used<00:00:56.629> your<00:00:56.900> Trident<00:00:57.439> and<00:00:57.619> it's

00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:58.369 
basically it used your Trident and it's

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:02.460 
basically it used your Trident and it's
like<00:00:58.549> a<00:00:58.580> trident<00:00:59.269> ii<00:00:59.540> I<00:00:59.809> know<00:01:00.019> Tito<00:01:00.799> and<00:01:01.159> I'm
