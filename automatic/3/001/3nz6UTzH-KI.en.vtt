00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.230
 Hello everyone, you are watching a video on the website 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.110
 fights and we are in the photo exhibition 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.420
 photokina in the cologne and in her hands olympus 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.940
 pen if elisha who was already with that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.289
 about two weeks ago, but we only have 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.369
 Now there is an opportunity to feel 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.369
 by his own hands 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.970
 at the heart of the novelty 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.090
 but in general we will not show something inside but 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.670
 there it is actually 16 megapixel 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.050
 sensor stimulus and size not cry 4 3 and 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.150
 together with three axial system 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.300
 Stabilization of the firm Olympus and 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:51.830
 all this is borrowed from a model from another 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.230
 rulers about m d m 10 here is this matrix 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.840
 gives you the opportunity to shoot where the plan 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.800
 stylishness from 200 to 25 thousand 100 units 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.870
 and this shell 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.160
 and if you know how to shoot cm10 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.040
 responsibly such results you 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.250
 You can wait from lcm and string it. 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.740
 This is the youngest camera in the line 4 olympus 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.840
 but by hierarchy that's why but it's cool 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.090
 despite the fact that it is a junior camera 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.430
 she turned out pretty plump then 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.259
 there is not only a swiveling display because 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.289
 his designs he adds nothing 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.149
 a little thickness behind there is such 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.460
 special thing for the thumb 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.470
 to feel so tina understand if 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.630
 plus where he is and get used to 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.090
 front there is not a big influx of artistic director 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.550
 to add convenience too 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.160
 controls there is a shutter release button 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.440
 one wheel drive control afterwards 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.429
 there is still a disc modes of standard 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.440
 hot shoe 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.149
 accessory port with built-in 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.130
 no external flash included 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.770
 external for data processing is responsible 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.259
 processor croup 7 and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.399
 with such a processor in a small camera 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.580
 can shoot a series 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.789
 Guess how many no 5 no 36 frames 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.160
 second, as many as eight for the youngest 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.080
 cameras in the lineup is not realistic when many 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.270
 this buffer we they could do m 5 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.569
 or 7 frames they made 20 frames in 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.250
 roll 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.349
 after all, too, for the youngest camera is very 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.060
 a lot of car park if you have a fast 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.040
 you can shoot a memory card 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.930
 infinitely and if with 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.879
 shoot all the same with tracking coming down 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.409
 quote then the speed drops to three with 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.989
 half frames per second and the most 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.459
 one 4000 short shutter speed for aiming 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.329
 the sharpness is also used proprietary 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.780
 Olympic s80 single autofocus system 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.640
 point and but she is really very nimble 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.109
 olympus panasonic among and in general 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.510
 mirrorless system not 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:39.040
 leaders in this even without 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.860
 phase sensors they really are 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.150
 very fast Well it depends on the else 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.400
 collective from so there will be some 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.990
 Super fast lens with large 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.500
 a group of lenses, then everything will be a little bit 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.790
 slower display here 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.930
 three inch 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.850
 with a resolution of 720 480 pixels it is sensory 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.350
 naturally you can flip fotochki and 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.150
 I choose the focus point and all 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.489
 the rest but it is also turning 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.340
 turning it pretty interesting 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.680
 here it deviates such down and here 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.230
 like this up but he also knows how 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.090
 do 108 degrees but usually the cameras 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.930
 108 degrees display get hurt up 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.959
 if you release the chalk down and do this 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.459
 here's the thing and you can see yourself 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.290
 besides this there is a standard 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.060
 five-way joystick which 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.370
 at the same time also a control disk and 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.959
 separate button for recording video recording 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.360
 video is limited to 30 frames per second 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.519
 with progressive scan given 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.170
 that there is an electronic system 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.720
 stabilization i'm at work with any 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.390
 objective axis 3 from well as it is possible 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.110
 very cool even without a tripod without 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.569
 monopole if you shoot video from your hands but no 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.739
 no headphone input is not for 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.670
 outwardly microphone therefore all the same 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.620
 pretty professional use it 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.840
 difficult though no one bothers to take the same 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.939
 zoom and use close recorder 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.079
 still there is a wifi module 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.590
 reset fotochki 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.810
 use 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.489
 your smart sky gifted finder 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.739
 In general, all this you already know by 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.989
 other cameras you watched the preview video 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.440
 younger than mirrorless olympus e. 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.550
 or 7 on the site frame cams photokina 2014 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.550
 stay with us bye
