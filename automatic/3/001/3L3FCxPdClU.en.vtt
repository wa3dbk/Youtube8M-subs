00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.170 

so<00:03:21.500> now<00:03:21.710> I'm<00:03:21.830> adding<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.340> my<00:03:22.490> vegetable<00:03:23.030> broth

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180

so now I'm adding in my vegetable broth
if<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.660> have<00:03:23.780> vegetable<00:03:24.230> stock<00:03:24.440> then<00:03:24.680> that

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
if you have vegetable stock then that

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.450 
if you have vegetable stock then that
will<00:03:24.950> work<00:03:25.100> just<00:03:25.370> as<00:03:25.520> fine<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:28.070> now<00:03:28.220> I'm<00:03:28.310> just

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
will work just as fine so now I'm just

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.660 
will work just as fine so now I'm just
getting<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:29.000> quick<00:03:29.360> little<00:03:29.660> stir<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:31.450> now

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670

I'm<00:03:34.670> going<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.030> bring<00:03:35.300> this<00:03:35.420> up<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:35.960> simmer

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
I'm going to bring this up to a simmer

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.180 
I'm going to bring this up to a simmer
so<00:03:37.360> now<00:03:38.360> that<00:03:38.420> we<00:03:38.720> have<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:39.080> nice<00:03:39.410> simmer<00:03:39.800> going

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
it is time for us to blend so now at

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.810 
it is time for us to blend so now at
this<00:03:44.600> point<00:03:44.870> I'm<00:03:45.050> just<00:03:45.320> labeling<00:03:45.830> in<00:03:46.190> my

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
this point I'm just labeling in my

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.150 
this point I'm just labeling in my
mixture<00:03:47.270> and<00:03:47.690> I'm<00:03:47.990> just<00:03:48.260> going<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.620> blend<00:03:48.950> this

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.060 

so<00:03:56.180> I'm<00:03:56.600> checking<00:03:56.870> my<00:03:57.140> mixture<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.800> I<00:03:57.860> see

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
so I'm checking my mixture and I see

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.800 
so I'm checking my mixture and I see
that<00:03:58.220> it's<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.400> little<00:03:58.520> bit<00:03:58.760> too<00:03:58.970> thick<00:03:59.270> so<00:03:59.510> now

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
that it's a little bit too thick so now

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.110 
that it's a little bit too thick so now
I'm<00:03:59.990> going<00:04:00.380> to<00:04:00.530> add<00:04:00.740> as<00:04:01.010> much<00:04:01.220> water<00:04:01.460> as<00:04:01.580> I<00:04:01.790> need

like and I'm using cow's milk because it

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.980 
like and I'm using cow's milk because it
has<00:05:36.650> a<00:05:36.890> lot<00:05:37.310> more<00:05:37.340> fat<00:05:37.820> content<00:05:38.090> to<00:05:38.540> it<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:38.930> I

has a lot more fat content to it and I

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.960 
has a lot more fat content to it and I
thought<00:05:39.170> they<00:05:39.350> would<00:05:39.590> give<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:40.340> soup<00:05:40.640> a<00:05:40.790> nice

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.600 
thought they would give the soup a nice
creaminess<00:05:41.660> to<00:05:41.840> it<00:05:42.080> and<00:05:42.560> also<00:05:43.130> will<00:05:43.370> tone<00:05:43.580> down

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
creaminess to it and also will tone down

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.960
