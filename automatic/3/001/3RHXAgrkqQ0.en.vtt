a universal wedge that you'll bolt up

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.870 
a universal wedge that you'll bolt up
underneath<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:22.110> where<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.530> pin<00:01:22.979> box<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.430> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
underneath here where the pin box is so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.060 
underneath here where the pin box is so
when<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.119> goes<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.509> your<00:01:24.720> fifth<00:01:24.990> wheel<00:01:25.259> hitch

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
when it goes in your fifth wheel hitch

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.950 
when it goes in your fifth wheel hitch
on<00:01:26.369> your<00:01:26.520> truck<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.270> pivot<00:01:27.780> this

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
on your truck it will not pivot this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
on your truck it will not pivot this
will<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.290> pivot<00:01:28.650> out<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> kingpin<00:01:29.310> anymore

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
will not pivot out the kingpin anymore

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
will not pivot out the kingpin anymore
it's<00:01:30.060> gonna<00:01:30.180> pivot<00:01:30.450> back<00:01:30.720> here<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.829> that's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it's gonna pivot back here so that's

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.350 
it's gonna pivot back here so that's
where<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.280> going<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.549> your<00:01:32.759> 22<00:01:33.150> inches

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
so from the center of your kingpin back

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.160 
so from the center of your kingpin back
to<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> center<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.479> turret<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.020> gonna

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to the center of this turret it's gonna

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.440 
to the center of this turret it's gonna
be<00:01:37.259> 22<00:01:37.710> inches<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:38.790> pivot<00:01:39.119> point<00:01:39.329> has

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
be 22 inches so your pivot point has

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.780 
be 22 inches so your pivot point has
changed<00:01:39.869> towards<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> rear<00:01:40.860> which<00:01:41.460> gives<00:01:41.700> you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
changed towards the rear which gives you

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.719 
changed towards the rear which gives you
better<00:01:41.820> clearance<00:01:43.009> also<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.310> nice<00:01:44.460> feature

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
better clearance also the nice feature

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.010 
better clearance also the nice feature
is<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.149> won't<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> get<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.930> your

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
is you won't have to get out of your

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
mount a fifth wheel slider it will just

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.990 
mount a fifth wheel slider it will just
do<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.939> automatically<00:01:51.509> when<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.810> go<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> turn

and<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.180> also<00:01:54.329> helped<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> trailer<00:01:55.170> track

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and it also helped the trailer track

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.289 
and it also helped the trailer track
more<00:01:55.860> closely<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.490> your<00:01:56.670> truck<00:01:56.909> for<00:01:57.090> better
