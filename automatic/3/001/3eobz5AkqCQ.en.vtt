00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 all great hello my name is Lena and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.950
 you watch the channel perfect housewives 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.490
 the topic of today's video is empty jars 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.930
 I have gathered some amount 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.779
 empty jars 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.449
 There are not many of them so I decided 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.150
 combine empty jars of household chemicals 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.779
 and cosmetics the first half of the video I 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.660
 I will tell about household chemicals in the second 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.280
 half about cosmetics 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 so who is not interested in household chemicals 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.320
 you can fast forward and so the first 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960
 where do I want to start this here 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.469
 I use this tool already 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.360
 long been called a clean bath 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:52.680
 means this good copes with 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.110
 Its task is excellent but literally 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.440
 recently after after me 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.329
 I ended this tool in the store well 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.070
 how would not find him and I was offered 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:09.270
 buy ordinary here such rooms too 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.540
 with a sprayer you know tried it 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.729
 and she was pleasantly surprised in principle 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.369
 no different here from this 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:23.700
 Means and it costs to whom yes this is in 2 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.890
 times cheaper than this 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.990
 Probably I’ll probably move on to 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.960
 such a means is she not here yet 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.659
 complete here such somewhere its but i just 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.570
 I decided to show what I wanted first 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.520
 Of course, you will praise it here. 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.850
 I do not know what is called here luxus 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.799
 professional or unfortunately 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 I don't know English, I taught at school 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.610
 french second remedy and this is from 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.250
 firm heel dishwashing detergent 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.820
 Immediately I say she did not like me so much 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.610
 how in the first place it is very difficult this one 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.200
 dispenser here it is hard its very difficult 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.719
 on 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.200
 city click on the sponge and then it 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.050
 foaming very bad for example two 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.610
 plates I had three or four times 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.640
 squeeze this foam over here 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.150
 This here is to normally wash the dishes to 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.670
 of this i showed you how i save 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.790
 spotlight exactly here in this one here dispenser 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.830
 he is much better foam than here 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.140
 I tried to pour in the usual means 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.060
 they did not know she did not like it all 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.870
 still most likely it's because of this 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.709
 dispenser because it is squeezed out 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.200
 hard and foam somehow not quite good 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.590
 and one more thing is this 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.840
 cleaning cream from mr muscle in general 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.510
 I also didn’t like it very much 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:53.299
 Of course he cleans he is not very good to me 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.110
 more like ordinary dry powders 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:59.090
 here is the same to the rooms and something else 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.910
 I did not like this cream 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.290
 I used to be a long time ago 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:09.739
 used such a cleansing cream 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:13.250
 from lodge here that really was very 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.040
 I liked the good, but why am I his 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.989
 for a long time nowhere met therefore here 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.180
 tried decided to try to take it 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.819
 from mr. mask and mind did not like 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.010
 so, too, will not take more 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.940
 I have a little left over here 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.010
 for some reason, it is such means that 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.680
 i don't like them i run out 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.170
 much longer it was all household 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.989
 chemistry now i'm going to cosmetics yet 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.900
 I want to immediately say that most likely 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.480
 creams which i have exactly 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.299
 which i don't like i most likely 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.519
 I will not show as I have these 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.590
 the stigma just doesn't end i either 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.560
 just stop using them either 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.359
 just give miami or just a term 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.590
 Shelf life ends I just 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.260
 just throwing a lot 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.390
 nothing fits and only here 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.400
 probably which I have ended it 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.050
 Here is such a stunning lifting for 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.120
 faces 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.629
 it's called face lifting here 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.480
 bass anti-aging gold thread 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.989
 this is chinese cosmetics i something in 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.320
 lately on chinese cosmetics 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:27.120
 sat down I like the effects especially 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.760
 masks and this is the means to me very much 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.490
 I liked this dispenser here and you know 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.100
 he is a little pearl after 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.400
 put it on the face he creates such 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.729
 slight subtle mask effect 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.400
 nice he I quickly ended something 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.620
 I know I did not expect it at all I still 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.250
 I will buy more want something else 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.750
 to try 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.030
 It is from this series Boris then I want 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.470
 show you here's another 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.930
 balm conditioner 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.970
 from the firm online too after i 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.370
 I tried nail polish 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.850
 I decided to try this one too 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.440
 other products from the firm and veloin and so 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.690
 hair balsam 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.210
 reinforcement recovery against 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.849
 hitting she do not know as it is not very 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.950
 liked a good effect from this one 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.780
 from this balsam conditioner i'm not 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.080
 notice and 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.849
 hair as you filed and fall out and 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.460
 combing like that I would not for her not 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.260
 he said that it was quite good easy for me 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.940
 it seems just as if I did not 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.590
 therefore I used more and 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.940
 I will not choose anything to try 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.639
 2 and I want to show you this mask 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.020
 miracle mask 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.990
 stunning mask she is not very 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.270
 liked this mask goes like for 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.400
 if any emergency 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.070
 you need to go somewhere and now apply 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.900
 to this 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.270
 face mask lie down there somehow 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:57.190
 support her for 20 minutes face with 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.550
 stunning wrinkles completely somewhere 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:03.310
 shallow and deep disappear 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.350
 in general, I really liked it here 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.230
 that is not no matter how strange here nor there 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.560
 the name is nothing at all I do not know here 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.330
 also 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.240
 and in the store you said that she 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.860
 Chinese when I opened her mask 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.510
 from there of course this went not quite 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:22.150
 nice smell like you know 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.370
 even though I have never tried anyone 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.950
 rotten malus of for some reason it seemed to me 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.100
 what exactly are they and the guys here but she is so 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.260
 gelatinous 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.630
 she its very easy to tear me him 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.000
 used even about four times here 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.310
 here and some kind of liquid remained after 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.130
 applying again put her in this 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.280
 the box is closed on this thing tightly 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.260
 and used it again in general she 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.530
 I went as not disposable as soon as 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:54.040
 used it four times 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:56.230
 it's time to replace the line well in this 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.440
 I went to the store where I bought it I 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:02.920
 for some reason it was not them they said that 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:07.780
 there will be gennady so i still buy it worth 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:11.080
 it is cheap for our 200 tenge for four 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.600
