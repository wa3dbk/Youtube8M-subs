the map it took us nine minutes and 13

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:26.390 
the map it took us nine minutes and 13
seconds<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.139> complete<00:05:25.469> which<00:05:25.979> doesn't<00:05:26.370> give

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
seconds to complete which doesn't give

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.249 
seconds to complete which doesn't give
us<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.580> whole<00:05:26.789> lot<00:05:26.819> of<00:05:26.939> free<00:05:27.150> time<00:05:27.180> but<00:05:27.569> again<00:05:27.840> we

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
us a whole lot of free time but again we

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.559 
us a whole lot of free time but again we
made<00:05:28.469> several<00:05:28.770> mistakes<00:05:28.979> if<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:30.360> timer

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 
made several mistakes if the timer

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.119 
made several mistakes if the timer
starts<00:05:30.990> when<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.259> first<00:05:31.469> assassin<00:05:31.979> is

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
engaged in combat it took us seven

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.830 
engaged in combat it took us seven
minutes<00:05:34.590> and<00:05:34.710> 37<00:05:35.340> seconds<00:05:35.729> but<00:05:36.419> I<00:05:36.449> suspect

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
minutes and 37 seconds but I suspect

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.110 
minutes and 37 seconds but I suspect
that<00:05:37.409> the<00:05:37.620> timer<00:05:37.830> starts<00:05:38.279> at<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.699> time<00:05:38.879> of<00:05:39.029> the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
that the timer starts at the time of the

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.119 
that the timer starts at the time of the
first<00:05:39.360> assassin<00:05:39.810> is<00:05:39.930> killed<00:05:40.229> and<00:05:40.409> from<00:05:41.009> that

first assassin is killed and from that
point<00:05:41.189> to<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.699> end<00:05:41.849> it<00:05:42.180> only<00:05:42.389> took<00:05:42.599> us<00:05:42.659> seven

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
point to the end it only took us seven

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.230 
point to the end it only took us seven
minutes<00:05:43.529> and<00:05:43.650> 24<00:05:44.159> seconds<00:05:44.580> though<00:05:45.090> these

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
minutes and 24 seconds though these

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.480
