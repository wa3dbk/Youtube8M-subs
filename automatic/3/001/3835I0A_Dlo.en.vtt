breaking the fourth wall as we know is a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.189 
breaking the fourth wall as we know is a
common<00:00:16.680> fact<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.460> Pokemon<00:00:17.910> evolved<00:00:18.150> some<00:00:18.930> do

common fact that Pokemon evolved some do

common fact that Pokemon evolved some do
and<00:00:19.380> some<00:00:19.470> don't<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.340> there<00:00:20.789> are<00:00:20.910> many<00:00:21.119> ways

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and some don't and there are many ways

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
of a Pokemon evolving here we have a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.460 
of a Pokemon evolving here we have a
traditional<00:00:26.400> way<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.849> they<00:00:27.000> evolve<00:00:27.470> first

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
traditional way that they evolve first

traditional way that they evolve first
here<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.519> habit<00:00:30.210> which<00:00:30.630> then<00:00:31.349> involves

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
here we have habit which then involves

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.920 
here we have habit which then involves
into<00:00:32.099> skip<00:00:32.369> bloom<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:33.090> involves<00:00:33.719> into

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
into skip bloom and then involves into

into skip bloom and then involves into

there's<00:00:41.190> many<00:00:41.340> ways<00:00:42.170> but<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.649> don't<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:44.010> one

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870

a<00:00:49.260> fourth<00:00:50.210> evolution<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.860> have

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
a fourth evolution now I know there have

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920 
a fourth evolution now I know there have
been<00:00:53.010> some<00:00:53.309> stepping<00:00:53.670> stones<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.539> much

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
been some stepping stones to this much

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.819 
been some stepping stones to this much
like<00:00:55.170> politoed<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:56.430> pole<00:00:57.079> poly<00:00:58.079> roll<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
like politoed with pole poly roll and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.840 
like politoed with pole poly roll and
then<00:00:59.010> kings<00:00:59.910> rock<00:01:00.739> but<00:01:01.739> i'm<00:01:02.010> wondering<00:01:02.460> if

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
then kings rock but i'm wondering if

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.590 
then kings rock but i'm wondering if
nintendo<00:01:03.510> well<00:01:03.719> we're<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> legit<00:01:05.600> pokemon

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
nintendo well we're do a legit pokemon

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
line that lets say jump off evolves into

line that lets say jump off evolves into
a<00:01:09.540> different<00:01:09.930> pokemon<00:01:10.640> but<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> same<00:01:12.210> time

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
a different pokemon but at the same time

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.770 
a different pokemon but at the same time
it's<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.860> hard<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.450> nintendo<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.659> do

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it's kind of hard for nintendo to do

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.710 
it's kind of hard for nintendo to do
this<00:01:15.960> or<00:01:16.619> gamefreak<00:01:17.070> i<00:01:17.189> should<00:01:17.369> say<00:01:17.720> because

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
this or gamefreak i should say because

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.350 
this or gamefreak i should say because
when<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> pokemon<00:01:19.920> gets<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.369> its<00:01:20.610> third<00:01:21.030> point

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
when a pokemon gets to its third point

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.140 
when a pokemon gets to its third point
it's<00:01:21.990> lost<00:01:22.380> stage<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.720> evidently<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.729> at<00:01:26.729> its

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it's lost stage it evidently is at its

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.690 
it's lost stage it evidently is at its
stats<00:01:27.659> capacity<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.040> pretty<00:01:29.460> much<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
stats capacity it is pretty much the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120 
stats capacity it is pretty much the
strongest<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:31.020> there's<00:01:31.710> not<00:01:31.860> much

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
strongest it can be there's not much

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.859 
strongest it can be there's not much
growth<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.759> course<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.390> some<00:01:33.570> weaker

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
growth of course we have some weaker

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.670 
growth of course we have some weaker
Pokemon<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.740> could<00:01:35.490> maybe<00:01:36.000> stronger<00:01:36.500> but<00:01:37.500> at

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
Pokemon that could maybe stronger but at

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.810 
Pokemon that could maybe stronger but at
the<00:01:37.799> same<00:01:37.920> time<00:01:38.100> they're<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.400> meant<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.790> be

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the same time they're not meant to be

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.120 
the same time they're not meant to be
stronger<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.450> I'm<00:01:39.960> wondering<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.560> Nintendo

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
stronger and I'm wondering if Nintendo

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.420 
stronger and I'm wondering if Nintendo
would<00:01:41.430> ever<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.979> it's<00:01:43.979> an<00:01:44.220> interesting

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
would ever do that it's an interesting

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.929 
would ever do that it's an interesting
theory<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:46.229> expect<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.369> happen<00:01:47.399> I

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
theory I do not expect this to happen I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.480 
theory I do not expect this to happen I
would<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> happen<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.220> don't

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
would like this to happen but I don't

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.550 
would like this to happen but I don't
want<00:01:50.610> every<00:01:50.880> single<00:01:51.060> Pokemon<00:01:51.689> possibly

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
want every single Pokemon possibly

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.639 
want every single Pokemon possibly
evolving<00:01:53.369> into<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> fourth<00:01:53.909> stage<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.479> want<00:01:55.200> very

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
evolving into a fourth stage I want very

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.459 
evolving into a fourth stage I want very
select<00:01:56.460> Pokemon<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.689> able<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
select Pokemon to be able to do this and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.060 
select Pokemon to be able to do this and
I<00:01:59.040> think<00:01:59.180> game<00:02:00.180> free<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.680> they

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
I think game free can do this if they

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.990 
I think game free can do this if they
get<00:02:02.360> one<00:02:03.360> Pokemon<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.820> after<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> certain

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
get one Pokemon that after a certain

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.479 
get one Pokemon that after a certain
point<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.840> at<00:02:06.960> its<00:02:07.079> third<00:02:07.350> stage<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:08.310> at

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
point it's at its third stage it's at

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.999 
point it's at its third stage it's at
what<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.910> think<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:09.539> be<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.989> end<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.860> its

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
what we think will be the end of its

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.520 
what we think will be the end of its
evolutionary<00:02:11.750> line

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
evolutionary line

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.010 
evolutionary line
but<00:02:13.680> if<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.310> stats<00:02:14.640> are<00:02:14.880> at<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> certain<00:02:15.540> point

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
but if it stats are at a certain point

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.440 
but if it stats are at a certain point
and<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:19.110> could<00:02:19.319> just<00:02:19.650> evolved<00:02:20.400> into<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> fourth

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and it could just evolved into a fourth

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.559 
and it could just evolved into a fourth
stage<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.050> i<00:02:22.470> wouldnt<00:02:23.459> doubt<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.300> fourth

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
stage and i wouldnt doubt if the fourth

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.630 
stage and i wouldnt doubt if the fourth
stage<00:02:24.870> wouldn't<00:02:25.410> happen<00:02:25.980> at<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> very<00:02:26.580> high

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
stage wouldn't happen at a very high

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.890 
stage wouldn't happen at a very high

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
i might bring it out there because as we

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.130

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
so why not break some of our rules or

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.740 
so why not break some of our rules or
taboos<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.730> think<00:02:45.680> could<00:02:46.680> be<00:02:47.489> broken<00:02:47.880> so

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
