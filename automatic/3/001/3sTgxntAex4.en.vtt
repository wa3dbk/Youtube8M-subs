00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.650 
description and I was wondering if there
would<00:00:19.260> be<00:00:19.320> even<00:00:20.130> which<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.580> spawning<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.539> a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
would be even which is spawning in a

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.990 
would be even which is spawning in a
witch<00:00:21.869> farm<00:00:22.230> if<00:00:22.439> there's<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.279> guardian<00:00:23.789> farm

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000

right next to this because the Guardians

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.310 
right next to this because the Guardians
in<00:00:25.920> theory<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.820> should<00:00:26.880> take<00:00:27.420> up<00:00:27.599> almost<00:00:27.930> all

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
in theory you should take up almost all

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.759 
in theory you should take up almost all
of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> mob<00:00:28.980> cap<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.300> always<00:00:31.230> wondering<00:00:31.619> if

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
of the mob cap so I always wondering if

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.229 
of the mob cap so I always wondering if
it's<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.219> good<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.550> build<00:00:32.820> these<00:00:33.000> two

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
it's really good to build these two

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.060 
it's really good to build these two
farms<00:00:33.570> right<00:00:33.780> next<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.230> each<00:00:34.320> other<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.860> did

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
farms right next to each other so I did

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.660 
farms right next to each other so I did
a<00:00:35.100> live<00:00:35.399> stream<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.440> Twitter<00:00:37.440> TV<00:00:37.829> /<00:00:38.070> st<00:00:38.460> petty

if you don't want to miss any live
streams<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.140> I'm<00:00:43.290> doing<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:43.710> follow<00:00:43.920> me<00:00:44.040> on

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.100 
streams that I'm doing then follow me on
twitch<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.579> Twitter<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.390> will<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.840> them

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
twitch and Twitter and you will see them

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.330 
twitch and Twitter and you will see them
coming<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.840> yeah<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.379> built<00:00:49.950> these

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
coming up and yeah then I built these

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.450 
coming up and yeah then I built these
two<00:00:50.730> thumbs<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.360> hence<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:52.230> did<00:00:52.410> some<00:00:52.680> nice

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
two thumbs up hence we did some nice

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.029 
two thumbs up hence we did some nice
stuff<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:54.239> them<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.980> should

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
stuff with them so I think that I should

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.150 
stuff with them so I think that I should
hop<00:00:56.460> now<00:00:56.670> into<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.989> words<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.770> did<00:00:58.949> in

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
hop now into the words that we did in

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.590 
hop now into the words that we did in
live<00:00:59.850> stream<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> i<00:01:02.370> built<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.760> two<00:01:02.969> farms<00:01:03.449> over

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
live stream so i built up two farms over

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.179 
live stream so i built up two farms over
here<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
here and as you can see this is the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
here and as you can see this is the
guardian<00:01:05.640> found<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.150> i<00:01:06.180> made<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> tutorial<00:01:06.689> of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
guardian found that i made a tutorial of

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.929 
guardian found that i made a tutorial of
the<00:01:07.290> Guardians<00:01:07.650> address<00:01:07.950> pawning<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.700> this

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the Guardians address pawning in this

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.660 
the Guardians address pawning in this
big<00:01:09.390> box<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:09.930> flowing<00:01:10.860> down<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.580> into

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
big box here flowing down going into

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.210 
big box here flowing down going into
this<00:01:12.030> water<00:01:12.390> stream<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.860> getting

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
this water stream and then getting

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.429 
this water stream and then getting
pushed<00:01:14.549> into<00:01:14.820> lava<00:01:15.210> where<00:01:15.630> they<00:01:15.840> would<00:01:16.080> die

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
pushed into lava where they would die

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.480 
pushed into lava where they would die
and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.000> drops<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.810> will<00:01:19.080> be

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
and then the drops of them will be

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.710 
and then the drops of them will be
traveling<00:01:20.490> through<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.820> stopper<00:01:21.210> train<00:01:21.420> into

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
traveling through the stopper train into

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.960 
traveling through the stopper train into
the<00:01:21.750> item<00:01:22.110> elevator<00:01:22.470> where<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.490> see<00:01:23.820> them

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the item elevator where we can see them

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.480 
the item elevator where we can see them
coming<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.630> already<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:26.130> case<00:01:26.430> over<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.360> are

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
coming up already the case over here are

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.819 
coming up already the case over here are
not<00:01:29.490> prepared<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.119> any<00:01:30.270> special<00:01:30.659> way<00:01:30.900> like

not prepared in any special way like

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.319 
not prepared in any special way like
making<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.250> big<00:01:32.430> perimeter<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.210> I

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
making a big perimeter all of this I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.609 
making a big perimeter all of this I
didn't<00:01:33.659> want<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.290> wasn't

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
didn't want to do that it wasn't

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.469 
didn't want to do that it wasn't
suggesting<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> stream<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.060> used<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
suggesting the stream that I used the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.840 
suggesting the stream that I used the
one<00:01:36.689> command<00:01:37.140> block<00:01:37.380> perimeter<00:01:37.619> thing<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.820> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
one command block perimeter thing but I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
one command block perimeter thing but I
wanted<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.450> s<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.439> would<00:01:40.619> build

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
wanted to have it s if you would build

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.350 
wanted to have it s if you would build
this<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.130> Survivor<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.150> really

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
this in Survivor so we can really

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.569 
this in Survivor so we can really
compare<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.990> rates<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.430> in

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
compare the rates to what we get in

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.910 
compare the rates to what we get in
Survivor<00:01:45.079> so<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.680> is

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
Survivor so what you can see here is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.730 
Survivor so what you can see here is
that<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.340> case<00:01:47.780> just<00:01:48.780> lit<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.380> torches

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that on the case just lit with torches

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.789 
that on the case just lit with torches
to<00:01:50.340> make<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.759> spawn<00:01:51.119> proof<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.530> really

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
to make it spawn proof so this is really

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.690 
to make it spawn proof so this is really
like<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> survivor<00:01:53.700> word<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:55.369> then<00:01:56.369> over<00:01:56.670> here

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
like a survivor word and then over here

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.139 
like a survivor word and then over here
we<00:01:56.969> also<00:01:57.299> got<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.110> witch<00:01:58.259> farm<00:01:58.710> which<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.549> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
we also got the witch farm which is a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.230 
we also got the witch farm which is a
three<00:02:00.840> level<00:02:01.079> design<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.189> figured<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:02.969> in

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
three level design that I figured out in

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.359 
three level design that I figured out in
the<00:02:03.390> stream<00:02:03.719> myself<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.350> had<00:02:04.740> some<00:02:04.979> issues<00:02:05.340> with

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
the stream myself I had some issues with

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.809 
the stream myself I had some issues with
that<00:02:05.790> one<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.719> beginning<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.280> then<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.520> got

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
that one in the beginning but then I got

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.119 
that one in the beginning but then I got
it<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.300> work<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.869> think<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.739> one<00:02:11.099> of

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
it to work I think that this is one of

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.740 
it to work I think that this is one of
the<00:02:11.370> standard<00:02:11.700> designs<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.390> for

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the standard designs that is for

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.110 
the standard designs that is for
a<00:02:12.810> two<00:02:12.960> level<00:02:13.590> which<00:02:14.070> one<00:02:14.250> was<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.580> two<00:02:14.760> hop<00:02:14.940> us

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
a two level which one was the two hop us

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.710 
a two level which one was the two hop us
here<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.890> trip<00:02:17.070> why<00:02:17.220> am<00:02:17.400> i<00:02:17.720> pushing

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
here and then the trip why am i pushing

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.710 
here and then the trip why am i pushing
out<00:02:18.960> this<00:02:19.170> piston<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.770> free<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.550> clock<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.060> if

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
out this piston to free the clock and if

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.230 
out this piston to free the clock and if
I<00:02:21.900> go<00:02:22.320> back<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.560> game<00:02:22.890> mode<00:02:23.070> one<00:02:23.400> we<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.970> see

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
I go back to game mode one we can see

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.000 
I go back to game mode one we can see
that<00:02:24.480> working<00:02:24.750> when<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.050> step<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.500> into<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
that working when I step in it into the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.340 
that working when I step in it into the
tripwire<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:27.000> blocks<00:02:27.390> will<00:02:27.720> start<00:02:28.080> moving

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
tripwire the blocks will start moving

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
tripwire the blocks will start moving
and<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.380> how<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.620> make<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.980> woods

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
and that is how we make the woods

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.920 
and that is how we make the woods
respond<00:02:32.760> maybe<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.209> stand<00:02:33.420> over<00:02:33.630> here<00:02:33.780> we

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
respond maybe if I stand over here we

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.980 
respond maybe if I stand over here we
can<00:02:34.140> catch<00:02:34.440> some<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:35.040> camera<00:02:35.580> spawning<00:02:36.120> button

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
can catch some on camera spawning button

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.140 
can catch some on camera spawning button
general<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.560> rate<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:38.250> farm<00:02:38.580> we're

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
general the rate of this farm we're

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.760 
general the rate of this farm we're
quite<00:02:39.480> awesome<00:02:39.959> if<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:40.200> take<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.560> look<00:02:40.740> here

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
quite awesome if we take a look here

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
quite awesome if we take a look here
we've<00:02:41.250> got<00:02:41.280> our<00:02:41.700> chests<00:02:43.040> where<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.220> sort<00:02:44.490> stuff

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
we've got our chests where we sort stuff

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.510 
we've got our chests where we sort stuff
so<00:02:45.120> we've<00:02:45.450> got<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.230> proximal<00:02:46.620> shots<00:02:46.860> crystals

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
so we've got the proximal shots crystals

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.380 
so we've got the proximal shots crystals
fish<00:02:48.300> then<00:02:49.489> insect<00:02:50.489> because<00:02:50.880> we<00:02:51.000> also<00:02:51.150> get

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
fish then insect because we also get

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.920 
fish then insect because we also get
that<00:02:51.600> from<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.470> Guardian<00:02:52.830> farm<00:02:53.480> then<00:02:54.480> red

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
that from the Guardian farm then red

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.479 
that from the Guardian farm then red
stone<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.470> quite<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.800> lot<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.100> off<00:02:56.280> from

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
stone that is quite a lot it's off from

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.229 
stone that is quite a lot it's off from
the<00:02:56.640> witch<00:02:56.760> farm<00:02:57.090> glowstone<00:02:58.050> dust<00:02:58.110> can<00:02:58.680> powder

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
the witch farm glowstone dust can powder

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.530 
the witch farm glowstone dust can powder
spider<00:03:00.239> eyes<00:03:00.650> sugar<00:03:01.700> sticks<00:03:02.700> that's<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.360> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
spider eyes sugar sticks that's just a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.660 
spider eyes sugar sticks that's just a
few<00:03:03.900> because<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:05.040> will<00:03:05.160> see<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.520> a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
few because you will see in just a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.949 
few because you will see in just a
second<00:03:05.880> Devon<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.150> also<00:03:06.300> got<00:03:06.510> cooked<00:03:06.750> fish

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
second Devon we also got cooked fish

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.430 
second Devon we also got cooked fish
here<00:03:07.500> because<00:03:08.130> i<00:03:08.370> think<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:09.020> if<00:03:10.020> you<00:03:10.050> have

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
here because i think that if you have

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.900 
here because i think that if you have
these<00:03:10.650> two<00:03:10.890> files<00:03:11.070> right<00:03:11.370> next<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.700> each<00:03:11.760> other

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
these two files right next to each other

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.360 
these two files right next to each other
or<00:03:12.239> they<00:03:12.600> were<00:03:12.870> sandwiches<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.980> could<00:03:14.100> easily

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
or they were sandwiches you could easily

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.240 
or they were sandwiches you could easily
make<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.060> out<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.630> furnace<00:03:16.020> out<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.590> where

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
make a out of furnace out of this where

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.930 
make a out of furnace out of this where
the<00:03:17.700> fish<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.600> sticks<00:03:19.080> will<00:03:19.799> get<00:03:20.040> smelted

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
the fish and the sticks will get smelted

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.590 
the fish and the sticks will get smelted
and<00:03:21.769> all<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:23.250> fish<00:03:23.820> will<00:03:24.030> get<00:03:24.180> cooked

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
and all the fish will get cooked

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.630 
and all the fish will get cooked
automatically<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.530> then<00:03:25.739> gets<00:03:26.160> put<00:03:26.459> into

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
automatically and then gets put into

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.630 
automatically and then gets put into
another<00:03:27.060> chest<00:03:27.530> just<00:03:28.530> with<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:29.040> sticks<00:03:29.400> as

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
another chest just with the sticks as

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.390 
another chest just with the sticks as
the<00:03:30.090> fuel<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:31.970> then<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.890> built<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.010> up<00:03:35.100> and

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
the fuel and and then I built it up and

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.800 
the fuel and and then I built it up and
I<00:03:35.580> was<00:03:35.760> surprised<00:03:36.150> how<00:03:36.360> good<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.690> right

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
I was surprised how good the right

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.020 
I was surprised how good the right
aren't<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.320> think<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.489> recruit

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
aren't I think that this is a recruit

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.180 
aren't I think that this is a recruit
thing<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.420> have<00:03:39.600> for<00:03:39.780> your<00:03:40.230> survival<00:03:40.590> void<00:03:40.950> and

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
thing to have for your survival void and

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.300 
thing to have for your survival void and
then<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.180> was<00:03:42.360> thinking<00:03:42.720> hell<00:03:43.290> if<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.769> have<00:03:43.980> a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
then I was thinking hell if you have a

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.190 
then I was thinking hell if you have a
lot<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.730> pros<00:03:45.120> marine<00:03:45.390> charts<00:03:45.720> like<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:46.019> have

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
lot of pros marine charts like I have

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.990 
lot of pros marine charts like I have
over<00:03:46.410> here<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:46.920> is<00:03:47.040> already<00:03:47.400> filling<00:03:47.640> up<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
over here this is already filling up the

these<00:03:55.650> buttons<00:03:56.040> here<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.430> target<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.060> farms

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
these buttons here to target the farms

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.740 
these buttons here to target the farms
even<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:57.989> if<00:03:58.890> we<00:03:59.040> take<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.250> look<00:03:59.340> at<00:03:59.549> this<00:03:59.750> you

even and if we take a look at this you
will<00:04:00.930> see<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.799> water<00:04:02.040> will<00:04:02.579> be<00:04:02.820> emptied

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
will see that the water will be emptied

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.949 
will see that the water will be emptied
out<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.989> tank<00:04:04.380> just<00:04:05.130> by<00:04:05.430> these<00:04:06.239> dispensers

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
out of the tank just by these dispensers

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.710 
out of the tank just by these dispensers
that<00:04:06.989> are<00:04:07.290> placed<00:04:07.560> upstairs<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.640> turn<00:04:09.150> off<00:04:09.420> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
that are placed upstairs to turn off the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.530 
that are placed upstairs to turn off the
Guardian<00:04:10.110> farm<00:04:10.380> completely<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:12.090> opens

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
Guardian farm completely and that opens

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.720 
Guardian farm completely and that opens
up<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.870> lot<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:13.140> possibilities<00:04:13.530> for<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:14.489> area

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
up a lot of possibilities for this area

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.110 
up a lot of possibilities for this area
as<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.239> base<00:04:16.340> because<00:04:17.340> then<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.729> could<00:04:17.940> have

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
as a base because then you could have

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.500 
as a base because then you could have
also<00:04:18.450> out<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.019> map<00:04:19.530> farms<00:04:19.979> like<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.489> normal<00:04:21.209> map

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
also out of map farms like a normal map

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.880 
also out of map farms like a normal map
farm<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.020> don't<00:04:22.200> have<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.440> build<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:22.770> the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
farm you don't have to build it in the

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.710 
farm you don't have to build it in the
sky<00:04:23.070> because<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.460> already<00:04:23.640> lit<00:04:24.060> up<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.240> area

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
sky because you already lit up the area

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.900 
sky because you already lit up the area
around<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:25.530> can<00:04:25.620> just<00:04:25.980> have<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.400> toga<00:04:26.700> boom

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
around so you can just have a toga boom

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.610 
around so you can just have a toga boom
op<00:04:27.090> farm<00:04:27.360> somewhere<00:04:27.600> around<00:04:27.900> here<00:04:28.140> for

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
op farm somewhere around here for

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.770 
op farm somewhere around here for
example<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.250> then<00:04:29.820> choose<00:04:30.150> which<00:04:30.450> farm

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
example and then choose which farm

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.570 
example and then choose which farm
should<00:04:31.020> be<00:04:31.170> running<00:04:31.380> at<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.770> certain<00:04:32.070> time<00:04:32.280> with

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
should be running at a certain time with

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.560 
should be running at a certain time with
shouldn't<00:04:32.970> then<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:33.960> could<00:04:34.140> also<00:04:34.290> have<00:04:34.620> like

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
shouldn't then you could also have like

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.140 
shouldn't then you could also have like
Iran<00:04:36.570> gone<00:04:36.720> on<00:04:36.810> farms<00:04:37.140> here<00:04:37.790> because<00:04:38.790> they<00:04:39.030> are

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
Iran gone on farms here because they are

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.750 
Iran gone on farms here because they are
working<00:04:39.360> quite<00:04:39.660> easily<00:04:39.900> then<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:41.310> could<00:04:41.520> have

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
working quite easily then you could have

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.000 
working quite easily then you could have
a<00:04:41.970> goat<00:04:42.330> farm<00:04:42.690> dress<00:04:42.930> were<00:04:43.140> spotted<00:04:43.650> because

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
a goat farm dress were spotted because

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.320 
a goat farm dress were spotted because
the<00:04:44.190> pigment<00:04:44.550> that<00:04:44.580> last<00:04:44.790> morning<00:04:45.030> in<00:04:45.210> the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
the pigment that last morning in the

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.690 
the pigment that last morning in the
porters<00:04:45.780> are<00:04:45.930> not<00:04:46.320> affecting<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.010> mob<00:04:47.190> cap<00:04:47.490> so

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
porters are not affecting the mob cap so

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.280 
porters are not affecting the mob cap so
that<00:04:47.730> could<00:04:48.120> be<00:04:48.150> running<00:04:48.600> here<00:04:48.720> all<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.050> times

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
that could be running here all the times

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.680 
that could be running here all the times
also<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.830> also<00:04:49.860> get<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.340> mob<00:04:50.520> drops<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:51.270> iron

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
also you also get the mob drops the iron

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
also you also get the mob drops the iron
and<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.930> gold<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:53.960> then<00:04:54.960> you<00:04:55.200> could<00:04:55.470> also

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
and the gold and then you could also

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.980 
and the gold and then you could also
build<00:04:55.980> up<00:04:56.250> files<00:04:56.610> with<00:04:56.910> a<00:04:56.940> villager<00:04:57.450> so<00:04:57.750> a

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
build up files with a villager so a

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.250 
build up files with a villager so a
automatic<00:04:58.650> carrot<00:04:59.040> bread<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.150> potato<00:05:00.810> farm

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
automatic carrot bread and potato farm

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.300 
automatic carrot bread and potato farm
which<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:02.930> quite<00:05:03.930> a<00:05:03.990> lot<00:05:04.290> of<00:05:04.320> automated<00:05:04.980> farms

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
which is quite a lot of automated farms

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.220 
which is quite a lot of automated farms
that<00:05:05.490> are<00:05:05.550> just<00:05:05.880> running<00:05:06.090> without<00:05:06.420> you<00:05:06.870> doing

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
that are just running without you doing

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.400 
that are just running without you doing
anything<00:05:07.350> and<00:05:07.890> as<00:05:08.340> you<00:05:08.460> can<00:05:08.610> see<00:05:08.640> now<00:05:09.410> there

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
anything and as you can see now there

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.530 
anything and as you can see now there
are<00:05:10.530> more<00:05:10.560> witches<00:05:11.010> spawning<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.180> witch

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
are more witches spawning in the witch

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.220 
are more witches spawning in the witch
farm<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.550> i<00:05:14.550> think<00:05:15.450> was<00:05:15.690> this<00:05:16.020> little

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
farm and i think was this little

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.950 
farm and i think was this little
improvement<00:05:17.010> to<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.340> Guardian<00:05:17.880> farm<00:05:18.210> it<00:05:18.419> is

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
improvement to the Guardian farm it is

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.740 
improvement to the Guardian farm it is
really<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.830> good<00:05:20.280> thing<00:05:20.340> to<00:05:20.970> build<00:05:21.240> these<00:05:21.450> two

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
really a good thing to build these two

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.270 
really a good thing to build these two
farms<00:05:22.080> right<00:05:22.260> next<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.650> each<00:05:22.680> other<00:05:22.830> if<00:05:23.100> you

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
farms right next to each other if you

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.750 
farms right next to each other if you
have<00:05:23.430> distract<00:05:24.060> trust<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:25.100> I<00:05:26.100> think<00:05:26.640> that

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
have distract trust and I think that

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.600 
have distract trust and I think that
this<00:05:26.880> is<00:05:26.940> a<00:05:27.060> quite<00:05:27.419> nice<00:05:27.630> place<00:05:27.960> for<00:05:28.610> building

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
this is a quite nice place for building

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.770 
this is a quite nice place for building
up<00:05:29.790> your<00:05:30.120> base<00:05:30.270> also<00:05:31.260> I<00:05:31.500> made<00:05:32.130> this<00:05:32.400> toggle<00:05:33.180> but

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
up your base also I made this toggle but

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.420 
up your base also I made this toggle but
right<00:05:34.080> now<00:05:34.230> it's<00:05:34.410> just<00:05:34.560> for<00:05:34.800> day<00:05:34.890> because<00:05:35.220> we

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
right now it's just for day because we

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.730 
right now it's just for day because we
are<00:05:35.550> using<00:05:35.730> daylight<00:05:36.240> to<00:05:36.450> turn<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.780> off<00:05:36.870> now

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
are using daylight to turn it off now

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.380 
are using daylight to turn it off now
you<00:05:37.950> could<00:05:38.130> maybe<00:05:38.430> do<00:05:38.730> something<00:05:39.000> else<00:05:39.270> I

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
you could maybe do something else I

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.630 
you could maybe do something else I
tried<00:05:39.690> lava<00:05:39.960> but<00:05:40.229> lava<00:05:40.470> was<00:05:41.040> burning<00:05:41.490> them

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
tried lava but lava was burning them

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.659
