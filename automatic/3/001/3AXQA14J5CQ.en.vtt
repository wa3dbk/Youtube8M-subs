00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:07.720
 hello how are you welcome to this video 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:11.230
 tutorial on how to clean the housing 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.179
 a nintendo entertainment system nes in 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.330
 this time what you are going to buy this is 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.369
 a little bit 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.950
 the truth is that the casing is in very 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.680
 good compared to others 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.660
 I had to see even the winter 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.410
 from the first to be interested 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.240
 but this one is the one I'm going to 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.700
 be final 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.760
 this time I want to show you how 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.050
 remove the spots that cross either 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.760
 by sticking the lime glue case or 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.270
 just to give it a clean 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.820
 general 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.100
 and remove this some impurities 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.050
 The first thing we are going to do is this 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.460
 show them what tools are needed 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.700
 and with what products you have to do it 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.460
 first they have to have at hand 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.470
 several screwdrivers 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.810
 in this case they are the cross ship owners 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.360
 it makes us see in good sight 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.020
 which we are going to use to remove the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.549
 the screws that they have behind 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.909
 I'm here putting the shipowners 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.270
 specials like this that is for him 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.060
 electric crosses because sometimes 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.850
 it may be required no I do not think is the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.570
 thermometer simply to show you 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.850
 the tool 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.070
 we are going to require 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.070
 with a used toothbrush 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.950
 cotton swabs cotton swabs I do not know 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:48.380
 how they tell you where they are 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 cleaning products in this case can 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.350
 be weeks 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.920
 here the ban is appearing but it is not 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.440
 this one I do not recommend it unless it's 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.409
 completely necessary and only 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.009
 apply it to the housing not 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.580
 all this will not be applied to any 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.450
 electrical part of the machine to not 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.709
 keep it 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.480
 we also need several towels to 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.459
 can this go dry 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.290
 and I think that's all for the moment 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.250
 I'm going to take a short break to 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.310
 disarm it and in a moment more showing 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.580
 How is it going 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.580
 again at this time and disarm the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.140
 screws in the case of this machine 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.060
 seems to have disarmed and nothing else had 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.819
 four of the six screws that so 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.880
 that attracts me that they were those of the 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.230
 corners those in middle were not 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.630
 take a bolt let me show you how 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.510
 how you proceed to remove it remove with 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.790
 a hand 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.250
 and this is the interior 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.930
 of the month we are going to remove that part 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.659
 now we have this other side 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.530
 and if you notice this is where you ride 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.420
 all the dust you have to remove in 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.430
 in case of 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.020
 that they want to disarm it completely 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.980
 They would also have to remove these 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.980
 screws that are here 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.190
 and this other 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.720
 so they can disarm by 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.720
 complete what is 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:37.010
 the access door and these elements of 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.409
 I'm not going to take everything out of the plastic 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.409
 I will proceed to disarm it by parts 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.650
 and we are going to make change 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.080
 to disarm English first we have to 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.950
 remove is 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.420
 this metal case that they bring in which 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.170
 you have to remove the following 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.730
 screws we reach to see is this 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.600
 here is here in the corner here 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.870
 I should have others do not have it 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.500
 here back there are two other screws nothing 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:16.140
 the more you have one you notice that it has been very 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.140
 vandalized this is they fear they are est 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.540
 here you can find the parts I'm going to 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.500
 go through it again so you can so that 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:31.450
 can see it and the process we see the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.420
 moment and one step that I forgot 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.710
 mention to is that before 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:41.210
 proceed to do any disarmament 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:44.900
 of this weight should press the button 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:48.410
 of power to purge the charge of 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:54.260
 current since all nets tend 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:56.720
 to save this a static charge like this 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.780
 that I recommend you do it for 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.190
 security if they do not run the risk that 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.190
 give yourself a discharge 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.950
 since the screws 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.970
 and the weapons and these are the piece 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:17.810
 This milk is not dirty but at the same time 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.060
 it's pretty clean compared to 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.860
 others that I have touched 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.780
 also 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.650
 screws that you have to disarm in this 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.169
 case 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.779
 you can disarm from here 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.770
 of gender I think we have to disarm this 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:42.430
 screw allow 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:45.780
 a good time to remove this piece 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.780
 they have to remove this screw 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.560
 here 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:58.930
 good we see the time of gmail 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.980
 very well and I'm back again and 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:05.710
 this time carlos completely 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.000
 first of all, here is a small 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.729
 recommendation 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:16.180
 these are the ports of the controls 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.180
 if you look closely at these pegs 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.740
 it is fixed in the size 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.990
 it is because of the position in which 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:30.340
 find how this is more 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:32.740
 the one in command 1 and that's the 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.670
 demand 2 the length tends to be more 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.500
 long 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.730
 these pieces are going to give a 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.730
 idea to turn it around 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.760
 turning yes 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:50.020
 holding it 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.980
 with this view here are the 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.680
 feet 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:57.030
 this is the one that connects the reset button 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.030
 and on 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.139
 and here the controls are connected I'm not going to 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.030
 leave more than anything in fact to the young 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:08.620
 in a housing 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:11.760
 and all this I'm going to clean 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.760
 It is dust with 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.790
 with compressed air so that it does not cause 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.730
 problems and a recommendation when 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:24.710
 they are disarming any tools 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:27.020
 put the screws in 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.720
 a place where I can identify them 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.190
 here I am already very identified 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.170
 depending on the place 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.770
 I do not know if it is so must see that here 

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.770
 there is a separation 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.419
 good 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.759
 and I think I 'm going to leave here 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:45.490
 this video I will do another one in the 

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:48.840
 second part where properly and we're going 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:51.840
 to see how to clean then see you 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.840
 Thank you
