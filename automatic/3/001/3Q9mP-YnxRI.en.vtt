00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.570
 hello today on the agenda 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.269
 review pretty controversial game hitman 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.489
 absolution as soon as the first showed 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.290
 gameplay videos of the new hitman as in 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.300
 the Internet immediately began to boil 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.790
 especially criticized the added 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.739
 maybe hide behind cover lasagna 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.540
 on the walls and the feelings of the assassin which 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.940
 allowed to see opponents through 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.489
 the wall and their further actions allegedly 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.860
 hitman has gone down to plagiarism since all 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.140
 These chips were in other popular games 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.579
 namely in the splinter cell conviction and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.160
 batman arkham asylum 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.320
 Well, is it all bad? 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.870
 Now we will discuss it for me personally 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.910
 hitman absolution was a long-awaited game 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.339
 although of the entire series I went through everything 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.530
 several games namely the first part on 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.979
 moment of exit and hitman blood money 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.320
 warmest kindest memories 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.000
 leave exactly the first part really on 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.759
 that moment was no better for me 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.369
 computer game character than 47 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.950
 the whole hitman of the series was great different 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.170
 from other stealth shooter 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.450
 dressing up and just colossal 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.729
 freedom of action in other Lera main 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.740
 heroes and hid from opponents and here 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.140
 you could change clothes and mix with 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.840
 crowd walking literally in front of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.450
 the enemy after the release of blood money 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.369
 I interactive started to do interactive 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.920
 other games but not a word about hitmen 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.549
 every year there were some rumors and 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.000
 gossip 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.789
 but until 2011, specifically nobody nothing 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.009
 did not say after the announcement of the gameplay to all 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.729
 it became clear that hitman is no longer so 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.860
 like before 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.799
 for some reason the developers decided to make 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.500
 sort of restarting the series they are something 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.630
 took that hitman that was before 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.140
 no longer needed by players and decided it 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.649
 remake but why think this question 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.420
 Already need to ask the developers themselves 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.000
 new gameplay innovations in 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.160
 most of them are very good for example 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.170
 led the possibility of hand-to-hand combat with 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.270
 using home decoration 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.610
 for example, you can wet the statuette and give 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.250
 her on the head guard or brick 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.410
 also dressing up no longer mask on 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.900
 hundred percent like it used to be she 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.180
 gives only temporary effect if not 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.250
 hiding then the guards sooner or later 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.130
 suspect in forty-seventh spy 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.230
 the introduction of a shelter system and the possibility 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.569
 climb the ledge and and walls only 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.090
 diversified gameplay don't understand why 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.120
 so much kipish because of this was now 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.310
 really new little all something friend 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.040
 friend plagiarism is important to 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.440
 copied chips used wisely and in 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.319
 Hitmane just in case, here's a 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.959
 Chip with intuition of course superfluous as by 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.530
 I'm in the game and so everything is intuitive 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.700
 and all you can interact with 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.569
 highlighted by a hint on which 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.569
 push button 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.299
 how were the other games of the player series 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.489
 spent about 90 percent of all gameplay 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.010
 to scout out and 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.650
 think up a murder invasion plan and 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.260
 evacuation right there instinct shows everything 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.079
 on the go that you can click activate and 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.109
 where to go ie this renting simplifies 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.670
 location studies are still a minus 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.700
 that the game has become linear 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.579
 up the line it's let's say so wide like and 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.140
 before we can every guard 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.120
 eliminate can bypass stun 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.190
 push a bunch of options 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.040
 but still we are in almost every 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.200
 locations move along the line forward such 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.359
 there are no missions like in past games 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.880
 given for example fazenda of some kind 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.709
 drug lord and you can circumvent her with 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.430
 all sides and get there like a soul 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.549
 wish 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.739
 there is no place for you everywhere by the handle 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.620
 fail and tell you here 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:05.040
 act worse or become from this game 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.989
 I do not think but also did not become better 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.209
 one i think is a minus is that 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.480
 developers have tried to please and 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.250
 who likes to shoot critical errors 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.070
 47 can not fix perry passing 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.079
 toy point can get machine 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.100
 put everyone on location and calm 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.680
 switch to another 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.370
 only the rating will suffer from this 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.770
 a rating in the game did worked 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.139
 system of achievements and awards that is to 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.900
 each location can eliminate the target or 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.540
 pass and the official way that is 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.030
 ways for which give achievements and 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.800
 rating points also give rating points 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.470
 for every action you do 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.169
 passing the mission killed someone extra 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.900
 minus rating found you minus 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.820
 rating and so on and if on location 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.840
 make a massacre then no rating you 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.139
 do not earn 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.540
 Immediately there is a question why is it necessary? 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.340
 to compete with friends for example 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.770
 also achievement must motivate 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.590
 player to replay games 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.729
 and but unfortunately this system worked 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.370
 only with fans 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.650
 I like pereprohodit just hitman 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.440
 or the same location was just in 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.930
 forehead is not because the game is tedious or bad 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.030
 because she is very long enough 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.389
 in order to play with the head 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.699
 having passed just once the game is also very 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.169
 changed in terms of hitman plot 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.449
 wrote a new image 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.820
 now not a soulless killer but before 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.370
 how to kill can still chat for a purpose 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.740
 The game generally shows the hitman in the new 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.780
 in the light that he is also a man and that he has 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.550
 there is a feeling and principle here they are not 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.560
 obedient killing machine 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.280
 and may well pursue their goals 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.560
 the plot coordinator 47 Diana 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.080
 betrayed the agency and fled with some 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.750
 the forty-seventh girl is given an assignment 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.090
 remove diana and find a girl in the process 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.220
 fulfill the task our killer for the first time 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.650
 shows that he does not care what 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.570
 will be with Diana and this girl along the way 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.580
 passing the whole game we will 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.190
 investigate why everyone needs this 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.440
 the girl about the plot in the game we learn from 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.870
 numerous cut scenes as well as from 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.940
 dialogues guards also from these 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.740
 dialogue, we learn a lot of interesting and 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.500
 locations and can later 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.270
 use this knowledge to pass 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.520
 Generally the replicas of the guard are very fulfilled. 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.970
 commercially they can anneal very 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.979
 not even bad jokes for the graphics in the game 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.970
 meets the new personal game engine 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:31.020
 Studios and its interactive blyse r2 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.560
 designed specifically for the new 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.480
 slyly 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.610
 he maintain all current 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.250
 technology at the moment and real 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.450
 gives just a great picture while 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.060
 not very demanding 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.730
 In general, all the characters in the game are very good 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.400
 traced detailed locations 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.260
 varied and bored won't give in 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.450
 In general, I want to say that I'm not sorry 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.280
 time spent on this game but 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.770
 I think the gameplay change 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.350
 superfluous and I had to spend on it 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.389
 forces better they would have done the good old 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.090
 hitman but with more thoughtful and 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:05.520
 complex locations and task for example 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.320
 like in the first hitman and or bloodline on 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.750
 Now and its interakty 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.150
 develop only hitman deal others 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:15.330
 games they banned square enix 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:17.610
 due to supposedly poor sales last so 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.470
 that we are waiting for the new slyly hope that 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.900
 developers on learn from their mistakes 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:26.150
 and make a worthy and continue 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.150
 well, that's all good luck
