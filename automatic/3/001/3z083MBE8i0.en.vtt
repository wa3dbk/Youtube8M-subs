chris broussard told us a little earlier

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.340 
chris broussard told us a little earlier
in<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.740> show<00:00:01.949> that<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.370> Rockets<00:00:02.790> are<00:00:03.049> open<00:00:04.049> to

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
in the show that the Rockets are open to

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.260 
in the show that the Rockets are open to
trading<00:00:04.620> him<00:00:04.799> not<00:00:04.950> necessarily<00:00:05.609> shopping<00:00:06.120> him

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
trading him not necessarily shopping him

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.660 
trading him not necessarily shopping him
but<00:00:06.450> open<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.930> trading<00:00:07.589> him<00:00:07.740> what<00:00:07.890> what<00:00:08.580> did

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
but open to trading him what what did

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.620 
but open to trading him what what did
you<00:00:08.730> think<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:09.000> when<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.120> heard<00:00:09.240> that

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
you think of when you heard that

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.049 
you think of when you heard that
well<00:00:09.900> Tracy<00:00:10.500> McGrady<00:00:10.860> could<00:00:11.519> end<00:00:11.700> up<00:00:11.790> going

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
well Tracy McGrady could end up going

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.700 
well Tracy McGrady could end up going
down<00:00:12.090> when<00:00:12.540> his<00:00:12.630> career<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:12.960> all<00:00:13.080> over<00:00:13.290> as<00:00:13.530> one

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
down when his career is all over as one

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.959 
down when his career is all over as one
of<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> most<00:00:13.920> talented<00:00:14.429> players<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.880> ever

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
of the most talented players to ever

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.310 
of the most talented players to ever
play<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.240> his<00:00:15.360> league<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.839> will<00:00:15.990> not<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.289> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
play in his league that will not have a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.380 
play in his league that will not have a
legacy<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:17.039> comes<00:00:17.250> anywhere<00:00:17.369> close<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.000> what

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
legacy that comes anywhere close to what

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.700 
legacy that comes anywhere close to what
it<00:00:18.510> should<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.750> been<00:00:18.869> an<00:00:19.199> injuries<00:00:19.560> have

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it should have been an injuries have

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.500 
it should have been an injuries have
been<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> big<00:00:20.160> part<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.580> also<00:00:20.730> his<00:00:21.000> temperament

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
been a big part but also his temperament

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.359 
been a big part but also his temperament
I<00:00:21.689> think<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> way<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.590> he<00:00:22.830> attacks<00:00:23.160> is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
I think in the way that he attacks is

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.429 
I think in the way that he attacks is
his<00:00:23.550> consistency<00:00:24.269> with<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.689> intensity<00:00:25.199> is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
his consistency with this intensity is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.929 
his consistency with this intensity is
something<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.340> has<00:00:26.580> always<00:00:26.730> been

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
something that has always been

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.400 
something that has always been
questioned<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.539> think<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:27.900> well<00:00:28.080> there's<00:00:28.289> no

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
questioned I think as well there's no

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.620 
questioned I think as well there's no
doubt<00:00:28.650> about<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.130> guy's<00:00:29.279> talent<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:30.570> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
doubt about the guy's talent and now to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.810 
doubt about the guy's talent and now to
talk<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.140> trading<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.099> guy<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.640> it's

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
talk about trading this guy that it's

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.490 
talk about trading this guy that it's
pretty<00:00:33.030> surprising<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.780> think<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.140> shows<00:00:34.350> you

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
pretty surprising I think that shows you

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.950 
pretty surprising I think that shows you
the<00:00:34.530> level<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.160> frustration<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.750> this

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the level of frustration that this

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.619 
the level of frustration that this
organization<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.950> probably<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> fanbase<00:00:39.390> as

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
organization and probably the fanbase as

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.209 
organization and probably the fanbase as
well<00:00:39.840> has<00:00:40.290> had<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> fact<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.100> he<00:00:41.190> just

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
well has had with the fact that he just

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.850 
well has had with the fact that he just
cannot<00:00:41.820> stay<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.420> court<00:00:42.690> long<00:00:42.960> enough<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
cannot stay on the court long enough to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.619 
cannot stay on the court long enough to
give<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.219> team<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> legitimate<00:00:45.090> run<00:00:45.329> at<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
give this team a legitimate run at a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.540 
give this team a legitimate run at a
high<00:00:45.989> seed<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> postseason<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
high seed in the postseason and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.010 
high seed in the postseason and
potentially<00:00:48.059> take<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.390> team<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.719> far<00:00:48.750> as

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
potentially take this team as far as

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.660 
potentially take this team as far as
even<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> Western<00:00:49.440> Conference<00:00:49.770> Finals<00:00:50.280> one

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
even the Western Conference Finals one

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.549 
even the Western Conference Finals one
thing<00:00:50.820> about<00:00:51.059> playing<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.480> NBA<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.320> this

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
thing about playing in the NBA and this

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.580 
thing about playing in the NBA and this
is<00:00:52.710> for<00:00:52.920> sure<00:00:53.660> only<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> handful<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.289> guys

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
is for sure only a handful of guys

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.459 
is for sure only a handful of guys
aren't<00:00:56.399> able<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.360> traded<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.989> season

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
aren't able to be traded this season

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.580 
aren't able to be traded this season
unless<00:00:59.010> your<00:00:59.219> name<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.430> Kobe<00:01:00.000> LeBron<00:01:00.590> Dewayne

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
unless your name is Kobe LeBron Dewayne

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.460 
unless your name is Kobe LeBron Dewayne
Chris<00:01:02.309> Paul<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> point<00:01:03.809> other<00:01:04.320> than

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
Chris Paul you get the point other than

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.609 
Chris Paul you get the point other than
that<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.369> fair<00:01:05.729> game<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.600> McGrady<00:01:06.990> when

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that it's fair game so for McGrady when

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.130 
that it's fair game so for McGrady when
he's<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:08.100> healthy<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:09.299> springs<00:01:09.869> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
he's not healthy that springs that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.500 
he's not healthy that springs that
domino<00:01:10.799> yes<00:01:11.159> he<00:01:11.310> has<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> big<00:01:11.729> contract<00:01:12.299> over

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
domino yes he has a big contract over

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.570 
domino yes he has a big contract over
the<00:01:12.600> next<00:01:12.810> couple<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.229> seasons<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.860> think<00:01:14.460> it

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the next couple of seasons I think it

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.300 
the next couple of seasons I think it
will<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.850> much<00:01:15.150> harder<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.600> unload<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
will be much harder to unload that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.219 
will be much harder to unload that
because<00:01:17.310> teams<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.330> see<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.810> guy

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
because teams see what we see a guy

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.710 
because teams see what we see a guy
that's<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.590> mercurial<00:01:20.430> talent<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.360> he<00:01:21.479> can't

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
that's a mercurial talent but he can't

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.120 
that's a mercurial talent but he can't
stay<00:01:21.990> healthy<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.560> you're<00:01:22.710> gonna<00:01:22.860> bring

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
stay healthy and if you're gonna bring

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.090 
stay healthy and if you're gonna bring
him<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:24.119> team<00:01:24.390> he's<00:01:25.170> such<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> dynamic

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
him to your team he's such a dynamic

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.580 
him to your team he's such a dynamic
player<00:01:26.340> he<00:01:26.700> needs<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.090> ball<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.630> much<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.470> he

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
player he needs the ball so much when he

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.010 
player he needs the ball so much when he
when<00:01:29.040> he's<00:01:29.220> out<00:01:29.400> everyone<00:01:29.970> suffers<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.840> also

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
when he's out everyone suffers it's also

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.450 
when he's out everyone suffers it's also
it's<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.560> tough<00:01:31.770> call<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.189> Houston

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it's a tough call for the Houston

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
it's a tough call for the Houston
Rockets<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.329> was<00:01:33.450> most<00:01:33.810> surprising

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
Rockets I think it was most surprising

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.080 
Rockets I think it was most surprising
to<00:01:34.500> me<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.920> least<00:01:35.040> when<00:01:35.340> when<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.640> heard<00:01:35.820> Chris

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
to me at least when when I heard Chris

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.780 
to me at least when when I heard Chris
say<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.770> comes<00:01:38.070> fairly

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
say that was that this comes fairly

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.460 
say that was that this comes fairly
early<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> season<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> right<00:01:40.049> after<00:01:40.380> an

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
early in the season and right after an

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
early in the season and right after an
off<00:01:40.590> season<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.100> which<00:01:41.280> they<00:01:41.460> went<00:01:41.670> after<00:01:41.790> Ron

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
off season in which they went after Ron

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.179 
off season in which they went after Ron

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
Artest apparently to build a

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.490 
Artest apparently to build a
championship<00:01:44.850> core<00:01:45.689> kind<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.170> team<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
championship core kind of team and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.870 
championship core kind of team and
they're<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:46.799> they're<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.220> building<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
they're not they're not building for the

they're not they're not building for the
future<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.360> were<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.630> were<00:01:48.689> making<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.200> run

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
future they were they were making a run

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.620 
future they were they were making a run
at<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.680> right<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> idea<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:50.970> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
at it right now so the idea that you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.090 
at it right now so the idea that you
would<00:01:51.780> trade<00:01:51.990> Tracy<00:01:52.290> McGrady<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> middle

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
would trade Tracy McGrady in the middle

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.410 
would trade Tracy McGrady in the middle
of<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.220> season<00:01:53.549> was<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> little<00:01:54.180> bit<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
of the season was a little bit of a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.760 
of the season was a little bit of a
surprise<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.720> me<00:01:54.899> well<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.619> gotta<00:01:55.740> remember

Skye<00:01:56.100> also<00:01:56.280> had<00:01:56.399> three<00:01:56.549> games<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.090> row<00:01:57.119> where

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
Skye also had three games in a row where

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.090 
Skye also had three games in a row where
he<00:01:57.540> had<00:01:57.659> single<00:01:58.020> digits<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.380> scoring<00:01:58.770> when<00:01:59.040> he

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
he had single digits in scoring when he

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.440 
he had single digits in scoring when he
was<00:01:59.280> healthy<00:01:59.460> right<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:00.149> there's

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
was healthy right so I think there's

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
was healthy right so I think there's
they<00:02:00.600> think<00:02:00.810> there's<00:02:00.930> something<00:02:01.259> wrong<00:02:01.710> even

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
they think there's something wrong even

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.420 
they think there's something wrong even
mentally<00:02:02.430> with<00:02:02.549> his<00:02:02.700> approach<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.210> game
