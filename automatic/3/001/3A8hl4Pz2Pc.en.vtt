grinds<00:02:06.020> when<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.380> fill<00:02:06.620> it<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:06.950> top<00:02:07.179> level

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
grinds when you fill it to the top level

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.500 
grinds when you fill it to the top level
so<00:02:08.869> at<00:02:09.019> least<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.349> know<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.739> bit<00:02:10.330> now<00:02:11.330> we'll

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
so at least I know that bit now we'll

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.240 
so at least I know that bit now we'll
come<00:02:11.690> back<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.050> here<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.409> for<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.800> six<00:02:13.040> the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
come back to here the for the six the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.729 
come back to here the for the six the
eight<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.550> ten<00:02:13.790> how<00:02:14.090> many<00:02:14.300> cups<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.659> coffee

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
eight to ten how many cups of coffee

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.170 
eight to ten how many cups of coffee
well<00:02:15.739> is<00:02:16.580> confusing<00:02:17.180> because<00:02:17.569> if<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.810> take<00:02:18.110> my

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
well is confusing because if I take my

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.160 
well is confusing because if I take my
kitchen<00:02:20.180> measuring<00:02:20.990> jug

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
kitchen measuring jug

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.589 
kitchen measuring jug
I fill<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.620> up<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.920> two<00:02:23.099> cups<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.180> pour<00:02:24.480> it

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
I fill it up to two cups and I pour it

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.110 
I fill it up to two cups and I pour it
in<00:02:24.720> there<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:25.680> actually<00:02:25.800> comes<00:02:26.190> up<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.550> about<00:02:26.580> 3

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
in there it actually comes up to about 3

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.839 
in there it actually comes up to about 3
and<00:02:27.239> 3/4<00:02:27.750> cups<00:02:27.989> so<00:02:28.739> these<00:02:28.890> don't<00:02:29.099> correspond

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
and 3/4 cups so these don't correspond

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.660 
and 3/4 cups so these don't correspond
to<00:02:30.150> what<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.569> might<00:02:30.840> think<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.860> being<00:02:32.130> an

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
to what you might think of as being an

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.920 
to what you might think of as being an
actual<00:02:33.090> cup<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:35.550> next<00:02:35.790> question<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.420> and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
actual cup the next question is and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.780 
actual cup the next question is and
let's<00:02:37.110> assume<00:02:37.260> now<00:02:37.709> that<00:02:37.770> somewhere<00:02:38.550> you

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
let's assume now that somewhere you

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.729 
let's assume now that somewhere you
found<00:02:39.120> maybe<00:02:39.569> on<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.840> coffee<00:02:40.050> detective<00:02:40.530> side

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
found maybe on the coffee detective side

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.160 
found maybe on the coffee detective side
or<00:02:40.980> from<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> neighbor<00:02:41.670> or<00:02:41.970> whatever<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.930> find

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
or from a neighbor or whatever you find

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.110 
or from a neighbor or whatever you find
out<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.620> actually<00:02:43.830> what<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.400> should<00:02:44.610> do<00:02:44.819> is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
out that actually what you should do is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.809 
out that actually what you should do is
have<00:02:45.810> one<00:02:46.200> coffee<00:02:46.530> scoop<00:02:47.150> per<00:02:48.150> cup<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.750> coffee

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
have one coffee scoop per cup of coffee

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.610 
have one coffee scoop per cup of coffee
so<00:02:50.819> on<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.030> face<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.480> looking<00:02:51.959> at<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.319> if

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
so on the face of it looking at this if

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.380 
so on the face of it looking at this if
you're<00:02:52.800> going<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.069> make<00:02:53.250> age<00:02:53.459> you'd<00:02:53.849> put<00:02:54.060> 8<00:02:54.239> of

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
you're going to make age you'd put 8 of

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.670 
you're going to make age you'd put 8 of
these<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.750> but<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.019> course<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.380> wouldn't

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
these in but of course you wouldn't

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.910 
these in but of course you wouldn't
because<00:02:56.810> these<00:02:57.810> markings<00:02:58.290> don't<00:02:58.590> actually

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
because these markings don't actually

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.809 
because these markings don't actually
correspond<00:02:59.580> to<00:03:00.110> what<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.140> cup<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.730> certainly<00:03:02.730> in

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
correspond to what a cup is certainly in

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.630 
correspond to what a cup is certainly in
the<00:03:02.910> kitchen<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:03.920> what<00:03:04.920> kind<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.190> cup<00:03:05.370> do<00:03:05.549> you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
the kitchen and what kind of cup do you

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.990 
the kitchen and what kind of cup do you
want<00:03:05.880> do<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.450> want<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:07.019> little<00:03:07.440> cup<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.620> coffee

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
want do you want a little cup of coffee

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.610 
want do you want a little cup of coffee
do<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.090> want<00:03:09.299> like<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.569> regular<00:03:09.840> mug<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.410> coffee

do you want like a regular mug of coffee
or<00:03:11.610> do<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.910> want<00:03:12.120> cereal<00:03:12.660> sized<00:03:12.959> mug<00:03:13.920> of

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.430 
or do you want cereal sized mug of
coffee<00:03:14.299> because<00:03:15.299> depending<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:15.900> what<00:03:16.110> kind

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
coffee because depending on what kind

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.500 
coffee because depending on what kind
you<00:03:16.769> know<00:03:17.130> what<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.060> amount<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.360> coffee

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
you know what the amount of coffee

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.729 
you know what the amount of coffee
you're<00:03:18.810> going<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.019> make<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.410> going<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.620> depend

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
you're going to make is going to depend

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.650 
you're going to make is going to depend
on<00:03:19.950> how<00:03:20.069> much<00:03:20.190> water<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.670> put<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.180> here<00:03:21.450> and

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
on how much water you put in here and

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.380 
on how much water you put in here and
how<00:03:22.319> many<00:03:22.530> coffee<00:03:22.799> grinds<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.400> add<00:03:23.549> well

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
how many coffee grinds you add well

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.349 
how many coffee grinds you add well
that's<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.810> very<00:03:24.959> greedy<00:03:25.790> that's<00:03:26.790> not<00:03:27.060> enough

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
that's the very greedy that's not enough

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.150 
that's the very greedy that's not enough
and<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.989> think<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.260> lot<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.470> us<00:03:28.650> when<00:03:28.829> we<00:03:28.950> get<00:03:29.070> up

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
and I think a lot of us when we get up

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.370 
and I think a lot of us when we get up
in<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.370> morning<00:03:29.700> like<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:30.090> cup<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.630> coffee<00:03:30.750> now

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
in the morning like a cup of coffee now

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.530 
in the morning like a cup of coffee now
the<00:03:32.220> rule<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.900> one<00:03:33.920> level<00:03:34.920> coffee<00:03:35.850> scoop<00:03:36.299> of

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the rule of one level coffee scoop of

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.289 
the rule of one level coffee scoop of
grinds<00:03:37.170> per<00:03:37.440> cup<00:03:37.769> is<00:03:38.100> based<00:03:38.820> on<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.120> premise

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
grinds per cup is based on the premise

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.370 
grinds per cup is based on the premise
that<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.690> cup<00:03:39.959> contains<00:03:40.500> six<00:03:40.890> fluid<00:03:41.280> ounces<00:03:42.380> but

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
that a cup contains six fluid ounces but

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.849 
that a cup contains six fluid ounces but
it<00:03:43.440> doesn't<00:03:44.480> that's<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.780> one<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.560> contains

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
it doesn't that's the one that contains

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.789 
it doesn't that's the one that contains
six<00:03:47.250> fluid<00:03:47.579> ounces<00:03:48.109> that's<00:03:49.109> about<00:03:49.530> eight

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
six fluid ounces that's about eight

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.880 
six fluid ounces that's about eight
fluid<00:03:50.070> ounces<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.810> that's<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.350> little<00:03:52.680> over

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
fluid ounces and that's a little over

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.449 
fluid ounces and that's a little over
ten<00:03:53.070> fluid<00:03:53.489> ounces<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:55.620> things<00:03:56.250> can<00:03:56.370> get

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
ten fluid ounces so things can get

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.039 
ten fluid ounces so things can get
complicated<00:03:56.640> because<00:03:57.239> if<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.600> just<00:03:57.780> try<00:03:57.989> and

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
complicated because if you just try and

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.780 
complicated because if you just try and
follow<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.500> manual<00:03:58.859> which<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.040> no<00:03:59.340> real<00:03:59.579> help

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.319 
follow the manual which is no real help

or follow some abstract instruction you

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.789

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
fluid ounces not six so instead of doing

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.580 
fluid ounces not six so instead of doing
a<00:04:15.269> level<00:04:15.989> scoop<00:04:17.299> do<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.329> heap<00:04:18.720> scoop<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.380> gives

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
a level scoop do a heap scoop it gives

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.620 
a level scoop do a heap scoop it gives
you<00:04:19.709> just<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:20.039> X<00:04:20.250> bit<00:04:20.609> extra<00:04:20.940> that<00:04:21.269> takes<00:04:21.479> you

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
you just that X bit extra that takes you

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.120 
you just that X bit extra that takes you
out<00:04:21.660> from<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.079> six<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.650> eighth

out from the six to the eighth

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.029 
out from the six to the eighth
so<00:04:24.060> if<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.360> go<00:04:24.419> make<00:04:24.780> if<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.530> gonna<00:04:25.650> drink<00:04:25.889> my

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
two hours which is probably excessive

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.450 
two hours which is probably excessive
but<00:04:34.320> possible

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
but possible

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.380

I'm suggesting is that you ignore these

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.640 
I'm suggesting is that you ignore these
markings<00:04:46.100> altogether<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.780> can't<00:04:48.780> go<00:04:49.110> by

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
markings altogether and you can't go by

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.730 
markings altogether and you can't go by
these<00:04:49.860> markings<00:04:50.370> either<00:04:50.760> unless<00:04:51.410> you<00:04:52.410> go<00:04:52.590> on

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
these markings either unless you go on

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.440 
these markings either unless you go on
the<00:04:52.860> side<00:04:53.100> here<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.610> mean<00:04:53.790> in<00:04:53.880> fact<00:04:54.120> if<00:04:54.300> you're

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
the side here I mean in fact if you're

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.430 
the side here I mean in fact if you're
using<00:04:54.660> this<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.980> is<00:04:56.220> in<00:04:56.400> fact<00:04:56.720> one<00:04:57.720> cup<00:04:57.990> here

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
using this that is in fact one cup here

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.940 
using this that is in fact one cup here
is<00:04:59.120> eight<00:05:00.120> fluid<00:05:00.540> ounces<00:05:00.720> so<00:05:01.260> that's<00:05:01.440> actually

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
is eight fluid ounces so that's actually

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.130 
is eight fluid ounces so that's actually
a<00:05:01.980> pretty<00:05:02.190> good<00:05:02.310> match<00:05:02.670> if<00:05:03.570> that's<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.960> case

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
a pretty good match if that's the case

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.770 
a pretty good match if that's the case
what<00:05:04.500> I'm<00:05:04.620> going<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.800> do<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:06.180> fill<00:05:06.390> the<00:05:06.570> water
