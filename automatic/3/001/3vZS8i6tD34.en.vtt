 Hello dear friends with you vulture and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.429
 Today I will tell you how to open 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.200
 minecraft server over local network 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.269
 using the hamachi program in general for 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.030
 beginning we need the hamachi link itself 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.430
 the download will be in the description when you 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.920
 go push the button you will 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.880
 sounding all that out think of yourself 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:29.359
 nickname and you will be offered a new network click 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:35.040
 create a new network creates such a password 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:38.210
 such password and password need to be confirmed 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 that is 123 123 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.829
 generally create everything okay and that's the type 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.469
 such a 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.300
 created and we see that one person then 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.590
 we have it in general we are already here with 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.969
 rydar created grime at all then 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.920
 connect to you man he should 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.530
 be green and be sure to have you 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.310
 must be loved not wi-fi namely 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.950
 and namely the wired connection because 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:18.330
 that through Wi-Fi, well, as if the port is not 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:20.640
 read through right through in general then 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.290
 will have to learn through the wire 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.270
 through alpha and no job at all 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.729
 I will also want why they are obtained 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.110
 why it does not work and then I understood everything 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.340
 what I have in general 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.070
 wi-fi everything connects your friend 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.979
 tell him this ip i have a mouse 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.200
 lags 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.460
 copy ip 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:48.060
 throw for example not skype threw go 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.119
 Maynkravt itself open 4 turn on all 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.920
 what do you want there are tuning 4 what 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.990
 this is open to see our sport now 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:08.280
 write two. 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:12.120
 and write this port port us 5454 624 624 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.280
 in general, then ip server sports 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.540
 this time you have to just go in 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.549
 where do you go for this card go 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.760
 again open the world to the net and just 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:27.030
 we speak then ip remains cut in 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.620
 In general, I told you everything 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.420
 gray opens through local 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.400
 connection 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.200
 I repeat again I do not need wi-fi need 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.840
 wired connection without 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.090
 his server will simply not work in 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.720
 Well, I told you everything 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.660
