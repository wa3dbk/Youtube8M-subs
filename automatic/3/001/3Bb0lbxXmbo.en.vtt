clear braces that we what we speak of
some<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.350> advantages<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.189> fact<00:00:08.460> of

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
some of the advantages is the fact of

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.759 
some of the advantages is the fact of
that<00:00:08.849> because<00:00:09.510> they<00:00:09.780> are<00:00:09.809> clear<00:00:10.170> braces<00:00:10.620> they

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
that because they are clear braces they

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.620 
that because they are clear braces they
are<00:00:10.830> also<00:00:11.010> removable<00:00:11.670> meaning<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.269> they<00:00:12.450> can

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
are also removable meaning that they can

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.570 
are also removable meaning that they can
be<00:00:12.660> taken<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.530> out<00:00:13.679> at<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.130> patients

convenience<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.990> advantageous<00:00:16.289> because

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
convenience this is advantageous because

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.670 
convenience this is advantageous because

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
a lot more complicated it's much more

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.970

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
lends that to itself and the fact that

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.120 
lends that to itself and the fact that
it<00:00:30.630> they<00:00:30.750> can<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:30.929> removed<00:00:31.230> while<00:00:31.800> you're

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
a convenience standpoint they can be

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.850 
a convenience standpoint they can be
taken<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.750> kind<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> patients

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
will but it's important to understand

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.090 
will but it's important to understand
too<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:51.149> can't<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.539> offed<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.680> too<00:00:52.829> long

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
routine that being a disadvantage is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.859

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
some of the other advantages is

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.730 
some of the other advantages is
obviously<00:01:18.600> because<00:01:18.930> they're<00:01:19.080> clear

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
obviously because they're clear

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.550

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.789 
you're wearing the clear braces it's
very<00:01:26.880> hard<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.630> patients<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.170> actually<00:01:28.350> see

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
very hard for patients to actually see

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.200

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
more cosmetic they're also more

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.920 
more cosmetic they're also more
convenient<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.420> take<00:01:39.720> them<00:01:39.840> in
