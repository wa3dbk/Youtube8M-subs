00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.600
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.460
 your home welcome to j's reviews 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.900
 it is true that the recipe is already 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.400
 enough time in the market not 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.019
 However, we have done with one and 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.230
 let's tell all the details that 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.189
 you must know about the blackberry terminal 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.840
 I want is by removing the 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.399
 sambenito that we always have when 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.560
 we thought about the typical barry screen 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.910
 tiny qwerty keyboard in this case 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.070
 nothing to see we find a 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.720
 4.2-inch touch screen terminal 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.899
 and the truth with a construction 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.550
 really good measures dimensions 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.420
 weight are the following 13 centimeters 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.820
 High 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.200
 65 centimeters wide and we 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.380
 we found with a thickness of 9 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.090
 millimeters all with a weight of 137 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.650
 grams let's not forget that it is 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.720
 built in plastic of which 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.579
 we highlight the back in a 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.070
 gummy finish that the truth you feel 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.660
 very well at hand the heart the muscle 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.620
 which is responsible for moving this z10 of 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.090
 blackberry the truth that is 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.829
 powerful enough for the day to 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.870
 day in this case we find a 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.030
 Qualcomm processor is a dual core that 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.159
 runs 1.5 gigahertz accompanied by 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.380
 standard in ram memory as are the 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.590
 2 gigas storage section 16 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.450
 gigas available for all of us 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.890
 we also forget that we have 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.970
 available a slot for our 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.800
 microsd cards 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.229
 The battery is a removable battery 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.820
 1800 milliamps and we arrived at the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.650
 more important details that have this 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.060
 z10 and that is a device 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.299
 smartphone really good 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 we have many 4.0 we have nfc chip and not 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.630
 let's forget a very detail 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.710
 important and is that you are prepared to 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.510
 the 4g network 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.310
 a twist of a nut a change of course 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.990
 you can call it whatever you want because 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.549
 blackberry 10 is totally different what 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.990
 that you are used to and removing it 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.850
 of the head the typical interface that 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.830
 had any signature device 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.600
 Canadian since in this case everything 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.280
 it works by gestures all 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.020
 transitions that the truth that work 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.479
 in a very natural way in which 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.340
 we should highlight the blackberry concentrate 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.810
 notifications really very but that 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.450
 very complete 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.159
 on the screen this 4.2 devices 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.899
 inches the truth that is not the screen 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.399
 biggest market but if it is 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.350
 of a blackberry the truth that you 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.030
 It will look big enough in this 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.270
 case of a resolution that does not reach 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.790
 be full hd stays at 768 p is 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.450
 HD resolution and gives us a density 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.099
 of pixels per inch of 356 something that 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.750
 It's not bad if we respect again 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.400
 a little the ratio of dimensions that 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.870
 they have the screen the Canadian firm 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.459
 of blackberry the truth that has never 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.500
 highlighted by having a section 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.580
 outstanding multimedia and in this case 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.340
 we are also with one step 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.200
 forward a sufficient rear camera 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.200
 the truth that meets 8 note 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.120
 megapixels logically with hdr function 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.100
 and one of the inclusions like mode 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.120
 time shift quite useful for the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.950
 front 2 megapixels to 720p good 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.150
 this has been all the data all the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.069
 All specifications 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.230
 technical characteristics that have the 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.510
 z10 of blackberry as it is a device 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.069
 quite interesting very focused on 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.410
 workplace but make no mistake 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.480
 because we can also get him quite 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.220
 game to play to navigate now as 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.019
 always if you want to know more you want 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.620
 know how well it works the camera 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.810
 such luce 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.250
 deep screen we see ourselves very 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.250
 but that very soon see you later
