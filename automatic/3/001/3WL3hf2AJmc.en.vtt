guessing this is like a three foot one
foot<00:01:54.149> cable<00:01:54.899> I'm<00:01:55.110> not<00:01:55.259> really<00:01:55.470> sure<00:01:55.590> but<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
foot cable I'm not really sure but I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.700 
foot cable I'm not really sure but I
shouldn't<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.479> any<00:01:57.630> problem<00:01:58.049> charging<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
shouldn't have any problem charging that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.130 
shouldn't have any problem charging that
so<00:01:58.979> let's<00:01:59.640> get<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> case<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.659> right<00:02:00.869> here

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
so let's get to the case it's right here

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.109 
so let's get to the case it's right here
looks<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.890> nice<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.579> already<00:02:02.729> tell

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
looks really nice I can already tell

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.719 
looks really nice I can already tell
that<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.450> buttons<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:03.960> hard<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.560> not<00:02:05.219> soft

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that the buttons are hard and not soft

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.600 
that the buttons are hard and not soft
like<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> lot<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.719> other<00:02:06.869> cases<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.489> put

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
like a lot of other cases do it to put

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.820 
like a lot of other cases do it to put
the<00:02:08.700> box<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.479> side<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> little<00:02:09.989> bit<00:02:10.259> there's

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the box to the side a little bit there's

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.640 
the box to the side a little bit there's
the<00:02:11.069> case<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> instructor

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
the case you have the instructor

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.979 
the case you have the instructor
inside<00:02:13.340> I'm<00:02:13.579> pretty<00:02:13.879> sure<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.299> is<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.540> sticker

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
inside I'm pretty sure this is a sticker

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.020 
inside I'm pretty sure this is a sticker
and<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.799> could<00:02:15.950> take<00:02:16.099> it<00:02:16.159> off<00:02:16.400> if<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.760> really
