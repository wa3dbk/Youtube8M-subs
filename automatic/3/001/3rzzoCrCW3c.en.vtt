both<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.410> channels<00:02:10.120> in<00:02:11.120> McCarthy<00:02:11.690> and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
both the channels in McCarthy and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.080 
both the channels in McCarthy and
hodgetwins<00:02:11.989> I<00:02:12.620> take<00:02:13.010> little<00:02:13.640> things<00:02:13.940> of

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
hodgetwins I take little things of

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.790 
hodgetwins I take little things of
pieces<00:02:14.450> from<00:02:14.690> each<00:02:14.840> channel<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:15.470> not

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
pieces from each channel and not

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.160 
pieces from each channel and not
everything<00:02:16.129> is<00:02:16.400> true<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.540> hard<00:02:17.750> times<00:02:18.080> they

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.640 
all the time deadlifts and squats all
right<00:02:25.099> so<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:26.180> lives<00:02:26.420> is<00:02:26.599> one<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.230> my<00:02:27.319> best

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650
