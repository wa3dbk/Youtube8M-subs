and his reason being he feels that that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.620 
and his reason being he feels that that
that<00:00:32.579> stringent<00:00:32.910> drug<00:00:33.180> testing<00:00:33.750> will<00:00:34.010> MP<00:00:35.010> his

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
performance preparation and so he

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.450 
performance preparation and so he

well there's certain type of drugs like

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.400 
well there's certain type of drugs like
EPO<00:02:52.220> other<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.700> know<00:02:55.610> basically<00:02:57.260> type<00:02:58.260> of

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
EPO other you know basically type of

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.860 
EPO other you know basically type of
drugs<00:02:58.680> did<00:02:58.880> enhance<00:02:59.880> your<00:03:00.060> red<00:03:00.299> blood<00:03:00.330> cells

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
drugs did enhance your red blood cells

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.410 
drugs did enhance your red blood cells
get<00:03:01.350> oxygen<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.069> those<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.819> those<00:03:02.850> red<00:03:03.239> blood

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
get oxygen to those to those red blood

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.990 
get oxygen to those to those red blood
cells<00:03:03.750> faster<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:05.250> it's<00:03:05.370> basically<00:03:05.580> you're

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
cells faster so it's basically you're

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.420 
cells faster so it's basically you're
