think<00:06:08.360> that's<00:06:08.480> gone<00:06:08.720> down<00:06:08.750> there<00:06:09.080> and<00:06:09.200> really

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
think that's gone down there and really

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.800 
think that's gone down there and really
pushed<00:06:09.710> on<00:06:09.920> it<00:06:09.950> I<00:06:10.310> think<00:06:11.090> this<00:06:11.240> year<00:06:11.510> is<00:06:11.540> going

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
pushed on it I think this year is going

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.930
