00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello everyone and everyone welcome to a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.120
 new road video with halibut today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.250
 I'm going to do this new edition 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.889
 of videos that I thought could you 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.349
 be interesting and consists in doing 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.199
 a review on cult products 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.810
 products that have liked a lot 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.949
 people or who like them a lot or who sell them 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.920
 a lot that are sold in large 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.529
 quantities and I thought that good that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.029
 I could interest you my opinion the truth 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.890
 is that it does not have to coincide with the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.869
 you absolutely do not have to 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.870
 match with nobody's because good 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.820
 there are as many opinions as there are people and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.590
 I thought it was good that you would like to know 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.829
 my opinion of some products maybe 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.719
 this is not so true but good 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.600
 first product that I am going to present to you 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.570
 is the clark and sonic cleaning system 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.309
 the concept is quite complex but 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.350
 good is as if a brush 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.600
 electric tooth but for all the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.850
 face 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.890
 this is the good version they already have 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.019
 some years now new ones have come out 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.019
 versions and this button is given 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.509
 and performs a vibration are used 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.580
 circular motions on the face and 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.159
 duration of facial cleansing is 30 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.200
 seconds I usually use it with 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.659
 cream cleaners I've used it with 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.700
 gel cleaners and the truth is that I 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.280
 like how it works with balsam yes 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.690
 with cleaning creams and I love the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.080
 truth is that it is a brush that 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.659
 it seems fantastic it 's true that not all 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.190
 the skins can use it 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.130
 logically speaking of facial care 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.590
 what is not going well with another I can 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.090
 destroy the skin but good to me this 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.000
 product I loved I like it 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.950
 very much use it I use it almost all 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.659
 the days I do not use it every day 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.240
 but I use it so good almost all 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.179
 the days especially if I've been in 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.009
 the street so that pollution would 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.380
 stick to the skin I really like to do 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.080
 a good cleaning and a good massage and 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.240
 then use the clark and sonic to 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.429
 remove all the impure impurities 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.200
 sorry and I think it works very very 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.270
 well in the next product that I'm going 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.759
 to present are the brushes of 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.840
 real techniques makeup this brand 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.140
 is developed 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.569
 by samantha chapman who is a youtuber 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.129
 very famous from uk the truth is 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.590
 which are the brushes that are very well 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.590
 the design seems fantastic to me 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.470
 it seems that they have aesthetically it is very 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.599
 well and then they are brushes that are 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.970
 made of artificial hair 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.739
 Synthetic I think it's very good 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.170
 to use with cream products or 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.989
 to use with liquid products from 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.299
 I bought the skin in the USA before 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.610
 that came out in Spain so you can 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.069
 imagine the triumph that makes 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.260
 I have and I find a great product 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.750
 it's true that there are I believe that a 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.090
 little cheaper and for the price that 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.170
 they have is very good and I have been 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.780
 liked the truth I liked 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.239
 quite not all the cuts I like 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.040
 there are cuts that I like more than others 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.900
 I like this cut very much for 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.180
 contour with cream products or 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.560
 even for powdered products and 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.690
 also to apply the base of 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.019
 makeup well diffused by the face 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.209
 but if there are cuts that I like more and 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.889
 cuts that I like well and finally 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.819
 I want to talk of lipsticks 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.620
 brand 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.290
 well this max are a product of worship 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.900
 very long time and it's true 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.030
 that mac has textures and has shades that 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.639
 are unique that we will not find in 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.200
 no other brand or any other 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:28.120
 establishment however yes that is 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.040
 true that there are tones that we can 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.530
 find perfectly or well by 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.079
 disparagement or already leaving us to a 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.629
 much higher range to a luxury lipstick 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.819
 as for example the dior lipsticks or 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.829
 to go sun logo although the truth is that 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.409
 I like them a lot however it 's true 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:48.609
 that there are unique tones and unique textures 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:52.329
 I for example I have ruby good here 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:55.120
 mac that is a matte red lipstick I think 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:58.090
 that is a fantastic red is very classic 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.709
 it's a very very classic tone that good 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.250
 truth is that if you want to invest in a 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.560
 Matte red seems to me a very good option 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.400
 but it is true that every time the marks 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.349
 of average ranges are a little lower 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.209
 they are investigating more are taking out 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.699
 lipsticks with a lot more textures 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.400
 interesting with much more tones in 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.359
 tendency and maybe the lipsticks of 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.870
 marianos 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.259
 preferred and well I do not say that the 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.469
 I will stop buying but it is true that I will go 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:31.689
 only for those cult tones very 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:34.030
 specials that are very difficult to 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.680
 get in other brands I hope that you 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.930
