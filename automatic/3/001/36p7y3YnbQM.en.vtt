rule<00:02:42.570> at<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.810> game<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:46.020> backgrounds<00:02:46.500> are

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
rule at this game the backgrounds are

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.590 
rule at this game the backgrounds are
still<00:02:46.800> ever-changing<00:02:47.280> but<00:02:47.910> some<00:02:48.150> errors<00:02:48.420> will

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
still ever-changing but some errors will

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.000 
still ever-changing but some errors will
drive<00:02:48.780> me<00:02:48.930> nuts

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.620 

the<00:02:53.010> game<00:02:53.190> starts<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.610> really<00:02:53.820> get<00:02:54.120> hard<00:02:54.420> at

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
the game starts to really get hard at

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.450 
the game starts to really get hard at
stage<00:02:54.900> 2<00:02:55.200> -<00:02:55.440> where<00:02:56.040> you're<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.250> mountains

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
stage 2 - where you're in the mountains

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.200 
stage 2 - where you're in the mountains
and<00:02:56.820> there's<00:02:57.120> snow<00:02:57.270> constantly<00:02:57.900> falling

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
and there's snow constantly falling

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.550 
and there's snow constantly falling
what's<00:03:00.210> really<00:03:00.540> annoying<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:01.050> this<00:03:01.200> part<00:03:01.500> of

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
what's really annoying in this part of

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.650 
what's really annoying in this part of
the<00:03:01.620> game<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.760> wind<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.150> blowing<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
the game is that the wind is blowing the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.930 
the game is that the wind is blowing the
snow<00:03:03.840> at<00:03:04.380> left<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.830> right<00:03:04.980> diagonal<00:03:05.340> angles

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
snow at left and right diagonal angles

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.140 
snow at left and right diagonal angles
that<00:03:06.390> will<00:03:06.510> either<00:03:06.660> push<00:03:07.020> or<00:03:07.230> pull<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.590> away

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
that will either push or pull you away

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.430 
that will either push or pull you away
this<00:03:09.150> can<00:03:09.330> really<00:03:09.690> suck<00:03:10.020> when<00:03:10.200> you're<00:03:10.290> trying

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
this can really suck when you're trying

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.260 
this can really suck when you're trying
to<00:03:10.560> make<00:03:10.770> leaps<00:03:10.980> over<00:03:11.160> cliffs<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.120> wind

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
to make leaps over cliffs and the wind

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.790 
to make leaps over cliffs and the wind
pushes<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:12.690> towards<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.170> enemies<00:03:13.590> and

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
pushes you towards the enemies and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.980 
pushes you towards the enemies and
likely<00:03:14.430> end<00:03:14.610> up<00:03:14.760> getting<00:03:15.060> hit<00:03:15.300> every<00:03:15.690> time

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
likely end up getting hit every time

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.630 
likely end up getting hit every time
which<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.620> just<00:03:16.920> not<00:03:17.130> right<00:03:18.830> as<00:03:19.830> stage<00:03:20.160> 3<00:03:20.430> one

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
which is just not right as stage 3 one

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.790 
which is just not right as stage 3 one
things<00:03:21.060> start<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.360> get<00:03:21.540> really<00:03:21.600> hectic<00:03:22.200> and

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
things start to get really hectic and

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.710 
things start to get really hectic and
basically<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.250> whole<00:03:23.280> damn<00:03:23.640> stage<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.330> black

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
basically the whole damn stage is black

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.270 
basically the whole damn stage is black
as<00:03:24.900> hell<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.680> only<00:03:25.830> way<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:25.980> can<00:03:26.160> see

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
as hell and the only way you can see

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.770 
as hell and the only way you can see
your<00:03:26.430> footing<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:26.970> when<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.390> lightning

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
your footing is when the lightning

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.600 
your footing is when the lightning
flashes<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:30.020> find<00:03:31.020> it<00:03:31.140> at<00:03:31.260> stage<00:03:31.500> 3<00:03:31.800> -<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.340> where

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
flashes I find it at stage 3 - is where

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.430 
flashes I find it at stage 3 - is where
you'll<00:03:32.730> die<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.000> most<00:03:33.420> one<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.110> even<00:03:34.260> the

you'll die the most one that even the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.170 
you'll die the most one that even the
last<00:03:34.620> stage<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.160> game<00:03:35.400> because<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
last stage in the game because of the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.420 
last stage in the game because of the
enemies<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:37.050> ledges<00:03:37.470> just<00:03:37.920> about<00:03:38.100> everything

spikes and I'm like damn cuz they make
this<00:03:55.020> game<00:03:55.230> any<00:03:55.380> harder<00:03:55.710> than<00:03:55.740> it<00:03:55.950> already<00:03:55.980> is

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
this game any harder than it already is

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.090 
this game any harder than it already is
well<00:03:58.300> they<00:03:58.690> did<00:03:58.990> and<00:03:59.380> this<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.680> where<00:03:59.980> the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
well they did and this is where the

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.840 
well they did and this is where the
enemies<00:04:00.610> come<00:04:00.940> in<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:02.860> birds<00:04:03.220> make<00:04:03.820> a

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
enemies come in the birds make a

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.910 
enemies come in the birds make a
comeback<00:04:04.390> in<00:04:04.570> this<00:04:04.690> game<00:04:04.960> and<00:04:05.290> are<00:04:05.530> just<00:04:05.800> as

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
comeback in this game and are just as

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.100 
comeback in this game and are just as
annoying<00:04:06.250> as<00:04:06.520> in<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:06.880> first<00:04:07.060> game<00:04:07.240> but<00:04:07.990> the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
annoying as in the first game but the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.570 
annoying as in the first game but the
only<00:04:08.230> difference<00:04:08.500> is<00:04:08.890> that<00:04:08.920> they<00:04:09.220> only<00:04:09.280> do<00:04:09.550> one

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
only difference is that they only do one

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.840 
only difference is that they only do one
damage<00:04:10.180> instead<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:10.720> three<00:04:11.020> to<00:04:11.290> your<00:04:11.410> health

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
damage instead of three to your health

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.820 
damage instead of three to your health
in<00:04:12.850> some<00:04:13.090> stages<00:04:13.390> they<00:04:13.750> appear<00:04:13.990> as<00:04:14.110> bad<00:04:14.350> there

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
in some stages they appear as bad there

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.039 
in some stages they appear as bad there
really<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.190> no<00:04:15.310> other<00:04:15.490> difference

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
really is no other difference

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.640 
really is no other difference
unfortunately<00:04:17.049> they're<00:04:17.230> not<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.500> only

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
unfortunately they're not the only

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.050 
unfortunately they're not the only
annoying<00:04:18.070> enemies<00:04:18.400> you<00:04:18.519> have<00:04:18.640> to<00:04:18.730> deal<00:04:18.910> with
