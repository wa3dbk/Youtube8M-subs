00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 why is snow white what does it have to do with it 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.730
 plasma supervision how long is one 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.930
 light year and why the devil turns 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.030
 itself the display of smartphones 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.050
 automatically within the meaning welcome 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.050
 to the first run 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.050
 the first question comes from campari he 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.090
 or she wanted to know why 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.070
 snow is actually white first of all 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.689
 Maybe you think that almost 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.340
 should be considered as water 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.840
 just when defining the water too 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.340
 but snow is very tiny 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.259
 Crystals that look like little mirrors 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.640
 behavior and as we all know 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.380
 reflects the ability to light 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.239
 reflect and indeed the complete 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.829
 Light spectrum so all different 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.360
 light frequencies the whole 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.160
 Light spectrum of the sun results together 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.140
 white light and snow as I said 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.969
 the entire light is thrown back yet 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.219
 he knows we come to the next question 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.480
 the German has last asked what for 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.010
 light is ever 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.989
 this is not one 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.699
 time unit as the name would suggest 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.769
 but could be one unit long 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.749
 namely the light in one 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.550
 can cover a maximum of the first year 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:59.409
 in ordinary lengths division is 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.550
 the one stretch of 95 billion 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.499
 kilometers 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.780
 But there are not only light years 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.500
 also gives light seconds of minutes 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.870
 and days 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.000
 an example would be, for example, the distance earth 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.090
 sun this is about 149 kilometers 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.370
 or 83 light minutes the light needed 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.240
 So 83 minutes from the sun to 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.000
 earth to arrive 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.350
 The next question comes from varomed him 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.420
 wanted to know how the automatic 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.950
 Turning the screen on smartphones 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.750
 and tablets works for this 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.210
 orientation becomes, of course, a sensor 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.550
 used or more sensors more accurate 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.480
 That said, you need it 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.400
 acceleration sensors can do this 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.990
 be different built a building 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.790
 For example, it consists of one weight 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.590
 that is attached to two springs 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.240
 by the gravity of the earth that becomes 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.190
 weight towards earth surface 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.960
 also movements are due to 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.550
 the inertia of mass thus recognized 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.470
 but of course is only for 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.850
 a plane of motion thought therefore 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.320
 just become three such 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.910
 acceleration sensors uses the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.870
 be arranged perpendicular to each other 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.550
 and accelerations in the 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.320
 three-dimensional space to be able to 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.120
 but there is one for some time 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.430
 better and combined solution for the 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.530
 orientation, namely the gyroscope or 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.300
 there is a circular instrument 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.100
 Of course not such a big device 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.840
 the smartphone a small smd chip 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.129
 is enough for this function already and 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.140
 It does not just do the job 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.760
 several acceleration sensors but 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.010
 additionally registered and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.209
 turns around its own axis and then 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.980
 are indeed already to the last question 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.720
 this sequence has henrik l 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.800
 asked what plasma is all about 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.569
 he certainly knows her 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.400
 aggregate states solid liquid and 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.170
 gaseous and plasma has been around for some time 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.440
 time the fourth aggregate state it 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.060
 gives 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.250
 he enters the gaseous state 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.959
 So you can say that now 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.799
 more bonds are dissolved than in the 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.030
 even before that 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.099
 more precisely, have yourself now 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.260
 electrons from the atoms dissolved which 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.879
 thus become positive what you are 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.129
 so mainly from negative 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.860
 electrons and positive ions, then 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.900
 charged atoms give electrons 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.340
 replace the typical of their atoms 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.890
 light appearance from the under 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.420
 other bypass one can let recognize 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.220
 But it's not just artificially pre-human 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.200
 fluorescent tubes and pasta television 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.810
 it also occurs in nature 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.400
 and that's not exactly 99 percent 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.349
 the visible luminous matter in the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.209
 universe is finally made of plasma 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.680
 so hopefully he has one now 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.239
 Little insight what I get on 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.190
 I'm just taking the new format 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.140
 several short questions from the comments 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.640
 and answer them together in one 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.769
 video so all questions respectively 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.209
 answer too short for a whole 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.980
 video are then come in here 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.420
 but I'm not easy format 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.549
 so it is part of my introduction 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.410
 specials yes you've heard me right 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.450
 actually make mappus peschl 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.650
 a week ago, the 10,000 was 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.840
 subscribers exceeded times 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.639
 meanwhile, there are already well over 11,000 and 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.950
 which is even more amazing that you 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.450
 all of these will be your audience in just 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.310
 three and a half months together 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.900
 So you have a whole at this point 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.280
 big thank you to you all 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.470
 this is a nice and active audience 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.150
 since he please keep that necessarily 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.590
 Please bypasses getting feedback and 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.280
 Excite me to continue 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.810
 can improve 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.700
 thank you also goes to some 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.349
 youtuber out to the success of mine 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.370
 have helped channel I find now 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.049
 just once addressed 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.400
 I also want to network 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.169
 that's really true lately 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.480
 has done a great job and me always 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.549
 as a mentor to the side so love is 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.169
 spectators the format race june comes 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.730
 every couple of months out when 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.169
 have collected enough leash questions 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.459
 that 's it for us this video now 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.840
 can you still the emergence of 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.430
 look at polar lights in which 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.989
 Incidentally, plasma also plays an important role 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.639
 play or you watch the video 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.199
 to the functions of batteries 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.459
 Now I wish you a nice one 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.239
 Christmas time and see you then 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.539
 again 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.539
 catch on
