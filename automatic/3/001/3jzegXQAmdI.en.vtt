 cover the container with aluminum foil and

 add a little olive oil 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.370
 so that they do not stick the potatoes is about 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.620
 spread it very well on all the paper 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.040

 and take them to the oven at 180 degrees 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.850
 for an hour or so and you 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.080
 I recommend that you do not turn them over so that 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.080
 do not stick
