00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
that gap you can use any wood to plug

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.870 
that gap you can use any wood to plug
that<00:02:04.179> gap<00:02:04.450> but<00:02:05.350> as<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.220> know<00:02:06.399> there's<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> nice

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
that gap but as you know there's a nice

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.820 
that gap but as you know there's a nice
sea<00:02:07.119> on<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.299> other<00:02:07.360> side<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.780> door<00:02:07.960> and

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
sea on the other side of the door and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.880 
sea on the other side of the door and
the<00:02:08.920> part<00:02:09.099> you<00:02:09.190> cut<00:02:09.399> off<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.989> you<00:02:11.110> just<00:02:11.170> chisel

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
the part you cut off if you just chisel

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.490 
the part you cut off if you just chisel
that<00:02:12.010> out<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:13.450> very<00:02:13.540> simple<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.230> set<00:02:14.380> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
that out it's very simple to set the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.190 
that out it's very simple to set the
piece<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.800> wood<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:16.180> been<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.420> particle<00:02:16.870> board

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
piece of wood it's been a particle board

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:27.300 
piece of wood it's been a particle board
you<00:02:17.349> basically<00:02:17.500> chisel<00:02:18.130> that<00:02:18.250> out<00:02:26.160> just<00:02:27.160> like

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
you basically chisel that out just like

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.930 
you basically chisel that out just like
that<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.630> you'll<00:02:28.750> blue<00:02:29.049> that<00:02:30.209> clamp<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.860> dry

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
that and you'll blue that clamp that dry

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.430 
that and you'll blue that clamp that dry
you<00:02:33.940> got<00:02:34.090> your<00:02:34.209> shell<00:02:34.420> once<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:34.959> do<00:02:35.079> that<00:02:35.110> it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
you got your shell once you do that it

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.059 
you got your shell once you do that it
dries<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:37.030> chisel<00:02:37.450> out<00:02:37.540> all<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.410> inside<00:02:38.769> here

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
dries and chisel out all the inside here

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.120 
dries and chisel out all the inside here
just<00:02:39.099> about<00:02:39.819> an<00:02:40.540> inch<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.049> half<00:02:41.079> as<00:02:41.920> what

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
just about an inch and a half as what

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.770 
just about an inch and a half as what
you<00:02:42.250> want<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.489> chisel<00:02:42.819> back<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:43.360> like<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.660> said

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
you want to chisel back it's like I said

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.080 
you want to chisel back it's like I said
it's<00:02:43.959> very<00:02:44.049> simple<00:02:44.459> when<00:02:45.459> that<00:02:45.640> creates<00:02:46.000> that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
it's very simple when that creates that

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:54.479 
it's very simple when that creates that
groove<00:02:46.540> it'll<00:02:47.530> eventually<00:02:48.120> go<00:02:53.370> just<00:02:54.370> like

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
groove it'll eventually go just like

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.550 
groove it'll eventually go just like
that

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
that

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.470 
that
so<00:02:56.560> that's<00:02:56.739> what<00:02:56.890> it's<00:02:57.010> great<00:02:57.880> you're<00:02:58.030> sure<00:02:58.269> so

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
so that's what it's great you're sure so

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.309 
so that's what it's great you're sure so
what<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:58.750> get<00:02:58.900> your<00:02:59.519> pleats<00:03:00.519> cut<00:03:01.170> these<00:03:02.170> are

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
what you get your pleats cut these are

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.979 
what you get your pleats cut these are
called<00:03:02.470> pleats<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.579> should<00:03:06.730> have<00:03:06.850> your

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
called pleats so you should have your

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.120 
called pleats so you should have your
horizontal<00:03:07.989> lines<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.739> should<00:03:08.799> know<00:03:09.010> where

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
horizontal lines you should know where

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.160 
horizontal lines you should know where
your<00:03:09.250> studs<00:03:09.519> are<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:10.480> should<00:03:10.690> have<00:03:10.810> your<00:03:10.959> two

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
your studs are you should have your two

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.330 
your studs are you should have your two
by<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:12.400> width<00:03:12.639> of<00:03:12.730> these<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.690> length<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.950> g1

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
by the width of these the length the g1

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.940 
by the width of these the length the g1
is<00:03:15.519> gonna<00:03:15.730> be<00:03:15.819> two<00:03:16.030> inches<00:03:16.239> shorter<00:03:16.859> than<00:03:17.859> the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
is gonna be two inches shorter than the

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.890 
is gonna be two inches shorter than the
length<00:03:18.100> of<00:03:18.250> your<00:03:18.370> shelf<00:03:18.670> that'll<00:03:19.000> let<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.209> fit

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
length of your shelf that'll let it fit

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.460 
length of your shelf that'll let it fit
nicely<00:03:19.930> into<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.530> be<00:03:21.340> inserted<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:21.940> shelf

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
nicely into that be inserted that shelf

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.509 
nicely into that be inserted that shelf
so<00:03:23.470> when<00:03:23.590> you're<00:03:23.739> attaching<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.280> for<00:03:24.459> the

bolts<00:04:10.030> I<00:04:10.150> should<00:04:10.329> say<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:11.769> can<00:04:11.920> use<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.099> ratchet

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
bolts I should say you can use a ratchet

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.330 
bolts I should say you can use a ratchet
or<00:04:12.819> you<00:04:13.090> can<00:04:13.239> use<00:04:13.359> a<00:04:13.390> driver<00:04:14.160> drill<00:04:15.160> them<00:04:15.250> to

or you can use a driver drill them to

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.689 
or you can use a driver drill them to
drive<00:04:15.549> them<00:04:15.790> in<00:04:15.970> but<00:04:16.810> basically<00:04:17.739> you'll<00:04:18.400> drive

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
drive them in but basically you'll drive

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.659 
drive them in but basically you'll drive
those<00:04:18.910> in<00:04:19.289> tightly<00:04:20.289> and<00:04:20.680> you'll<00:04:21.280> as<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:21.519> can

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
those in tightly and you'll as you can

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.570 
those in tightly and you'll as you can

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
see this is just incredibly strong all

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.189 
see this is just incredibly strong all
right<00:04:24.610> so<00:04:24.789> after<00:04:24.880> you<00:04:25.060> got<00:04:25.180> your<00:04:25.210> cleats<00:04:25.630> all
