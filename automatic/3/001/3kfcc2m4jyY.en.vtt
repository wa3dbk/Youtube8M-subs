00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 what is youtube mass also scorpions 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.100
 beckham statik warmly welcomes you 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.470
 to a video of a completely different kind here 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.760
 in the canal people the very old rabbits 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.280
 surely you still remember 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.719
 because I fooled my phone 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.040
 I have made now ne real cool 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.820
 I had an idea for one 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.070
 just call again 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.760
 swinging me thought okay me 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 but sometimes where 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.449
 The problem is now I thought it was mega 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.769
 mega gau has become really good but 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.850
 Unfortunately, the red light on when it has 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.720
 is indeed the whole on webcam 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.310
 quality but I think actually 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.109
 still pretty good so you have 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.460
 Everything itself can understand everything well 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.990
 it's not perfect, but me 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.160
 think that should be alright when 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.300
 you want more telephone connection you 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.829
 definitely want to see more easily 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.059
 let and i would say people the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.170
 are actually in a good mood 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.270
 So I would say 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.270
 have fun with the video 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.440
 yes taxco agrees if my name and indeed 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.090
 I do not have any questions 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:00.050
 but their practice deal with 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.430
 dna or you can we in the field 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.550

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.550

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.360
 I just wanted to ask how 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.580

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.280

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.420
 exactly 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.710
 because you just do not know if you do that 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.020
 she wanted to ask again 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.610

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.000
 markets 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.149
 maybe now if i'm talking in the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.319
 right experts yes you agree 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.660
 her colleagues have not come 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.270
 addressed 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.400
 exactly on the 12th I'm looking for 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.090
 I need a little help, so to speak 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.090
 a few Tipps 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.610
 my goal is mine to the aids too 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.230
 reach that dna and I reach 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.940
 I need somehow for that 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.330
 not expert opinion because I 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.549
 sometimes just can not do it 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.459
 So I have two training for you 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:39.910
 and once it has been in use and 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.319
 Bl and I can understand the terms now 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.340
 somehow not at all the dog 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.410
 she said that best 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.739
 can achieve my dna because they have in 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.739
 menu plan 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.670
 that stood so you can have them right 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.670
 anything could be meant 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:14.290
 that is the a sure i have there 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.320
 somehow something else would have the time 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:22.019
 30 somehow in the head how much do you know 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.019
 because he has my body triple double 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:31.359
 in every tenth senate the same 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.690
 right game mode noted the same or 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:40.239
 how do you best reach us ? 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.560
 on the other hand, I guess that if you like me 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.450
 it is always the same then yes 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.079
 They also give away a pretty easy way 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.079
 to reach 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.370
 oh yes yes in my family is just 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.530
 really a lot of sweating for example 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.450
 So we're sweating a lot 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.190
 and can you somehow investigate that? 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.510
 because they too protect with the hair 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:23.430
 It is already quite exhausting 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:26.130
 can not imagine what the classes 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.390
 made the banker to Syria in any 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.640

 But nuclear medicine is trying 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.190

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.870
 I help you, I really know 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.740

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.550
 what I asked if in real time know 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.720
 That's why I'm really burdened with it 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.720

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.470

 I sweat a lot professionally 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:27.720
