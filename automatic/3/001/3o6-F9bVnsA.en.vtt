so<00:01:17.900> we<00:01:18.110> applied<00:01:18.560> this<00:01:18.799> guidance<00:01:19.250> two<00:01:19.580> parts

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
so we applied this guidance two parts

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.820 
so we applied this guidance two parts
firstly<00:01:20.570> we<00:01:20.750> will<00:01:20.780> look<00:01:21.020> at<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.200> smooth<00:01:21.560> lap

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
firstly we will look at a smooth lap

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.760 
firstly we will look at a smooth lap
from<00:01:22.100> Bastian<00:01:22.900> analyze<00:01:23.900> it<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:24.260> then<00:01:24.440> we<00:01:24.619> will

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
from Bastian analyze it and then we will

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.090 
from Bastian analyze it and then we will
look<00:01:24.860> at<00:01:25.010> rates<00:01:25.280> craft<00:01:25.640> with<00:01:25.880> do's<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:26.390> don'ts

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
look at rates craft with do's and don'ts

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.710 
look at rates craft with do's and don'ts
before<00:01:28.100> we<00:01:28.220> start<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.610> couple<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:28.970> pointers<00:01:29.390> the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
before we start a couple of pointers the

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.469 
before we start a couple of pointers the
key<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.170> fast<00:01:30.530> lap<00:01:30.740> is<00:01:30.979> carrying<00:01:31.340> speed<00:01:31.729> once
