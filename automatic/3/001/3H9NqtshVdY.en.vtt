00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 you arranged x 1080 hd I hope you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.520
 go well we end up for a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.170
 little video story to announce you 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.300
 that the first update of the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.389
 transfers a safe place fifa 15 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.940
 the winter update that not all 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.230
 transfers that were made in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.050
 this update is just the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.279
 first part the link is in 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.779
 the bottom industry because there are some 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.160
 players I have not found yet 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.920
 people who are not his market 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.650
 especially some money players so 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.869
 one to podolski in his version in 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.520
 ending which is now low so the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.050
 player who was arsenal who signed the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.079
 side of inter Milan 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.660
 david villa in mls version in the club 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.320
 from new york city he was in australia 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.170
 so he's going back in mls on 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.090
 accomplishes complex kevin complicated seen ne 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.860
 do not know how it is pronounced but 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.620
 always is he that he is in good version 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.449
 also in dortmund now correa 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.739
 I saw his stats I knew 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.010
 really not about the game that is 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.500
 now in version atletico madrid 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.769
 it has stats of madness and it can bah 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.659
 not bad for liga bbva noboa 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.200
 which is now not in 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.060
 case each series that is in version 1 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.590
 finishing him too so I think it 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.259
 risk being the most expensive player of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.159
 this transfer update 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.930
 currently may be good yves 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.470
 bony here it is iced barclays 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.080
 first league 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.909
 wilfried bony in manchester city version 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.950
 which can be interesting in some 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.340
 hybrid with with yaya tourÃ© now 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.560
 since there is strong connection and dislike 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.299
 southampton is linked to activity in 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.220
 right in the game now it's 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.810
 spent in middle left back to his 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.650
 original post usually in the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.259
 numbers he is left 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.970
 he started the season right 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.700
 now it's in mg so that's when 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.790
 even not bad practice nast act 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.040
 schalk version a player who risk 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.170
 to be low cost it can be not bad 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.390
 not bad for courses of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.280
 cheap liga bunds and it stays a 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.399
 very very good defender in the game me 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.860
 does it be in black gold 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.760

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.820
 enter 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.290
 the el shaarawy and cerci risk being 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.750
 really very interesting too for 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.190
 hybrids huge stats I have not 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.830
 still tested this year on six occasions 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.270
 but the fact that he's back for 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.540
 the series to that may not be so 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.850
 wrong 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.380
 zarate qpr version is not much 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.270
 that changes in for him has by his club 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.400
 perez version valence sells saint-jean de 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.520
 benfica which is so low in its version 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.870
 valencia simply by it risk 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.480
 to be very interesting for small 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.040
 hybrid debate a link a link with messi 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.360

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.710
 because they are worthless to the club but 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.760
 you understood me that can make a 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.390
 middle runner really very 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.330
 interesting for liga bbva costa 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.700
 Genoese version is good generals has 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.680
