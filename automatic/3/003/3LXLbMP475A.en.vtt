00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 Here we are and welcome back to my channel 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.910
 resume with call of duty advanced 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.830
 warfare and resume with a video 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.679
 according to me very interesting because 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.260
 many of you have asked me that is 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.050
 what are the best classes for 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.609
 play in the call of duty multiplayer 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.070
 advanced warfare 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.519
 then I specifically created three 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.160
 classes that I use more and therefore 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.470
 I 'm going to use more in the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.230
 public matches based on the various 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.780
 situations then the three classes there 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.800
 advice to use to play 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.340
 we go immediately and love calls in 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.110
 assault soft hard assault and defense 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.640
 then let's go straight to the first one 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.710
 Soft assault is practically a weapon that 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.660
 let's go all the way to the attack 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.670
 but you want a little more 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.219
 quiet because we will obviously try 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.020
 not to go right into the one against 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.170
 one in the spaces and close together but of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.360
 play a little more distant then a little 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.939
 more in the distance, however, the classic 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.030
 assault that we like us that provides 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.159
 a ball 27 with and red dot football sight 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.110
 front and lightning handle 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.189
 so no silencer like 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.509
 specialty a light and low profile 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.479
 invisibility so that we are not seen 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.580
 from the series of enemies resistance and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.710
 obviously stealth propulsion to do 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.270
 so that they don't see us when 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.369
 we jump and when we use the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.280
 extra functions so this for a 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.350
 assault its own software a little more 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.659
 quiet if we have to go for a 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.560
 attack and therefore a true assault e 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.770
 just recommend you assault hard with as 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.200
 m1 front kick advanced lining 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.570
 which increases the range and of course i 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.460
 increased loaders if you want then 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.130
 replace the increased magazines with 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.009
 the lightning handle is the same 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.799
 regarding specialties and series 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.030
 of points are the same 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.520
 the soft assault changes practically 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.069
 only the weapon because sm 1 ci 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.750
 it allows to win almost all 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.440
 clashes 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.810
 close together while with the bal 27 gives us 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.300
 plus a long distance advantage 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.040
 even if in the short very good that 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.770
 the speech that has a very cadence 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.900
 high in the case in which instead 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.610
 we went to a game we see that 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.070
 it's getting bad that we meet 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.380
 very strong players and above all the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.890
 our team does not support us vi 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.320
 I recommend the defense class with val 27 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.480
 here the silencer takes over 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.450
 so that we don't always see on the map 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.730
 if the enemy does not use precisely 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.680
 the accessory to see us then 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.959
 silencer and front kick and ed 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.640
 lightning handle here change the 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.950
 specialty because while in the first 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.620
 remain light and low profile in the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.050
 second we will have the invisibility as at 32 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.709
 but above all cold blood because this is so 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.840
 not the enemies will not see us better not 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.989
 they will not even see our 9 then 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.660
 we will be much more campera you also change 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.739
 the specialty 3 because here I reduce or 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.989
 better I go to remove one's own 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.390
 an option that is resistance because if 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.239
 precisely we have to stay in defense not there 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.040
 need the talk of the bar neck and on 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.660
 saying when we're going to shoot but 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.000
 I leave the theft promotion but to do 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.989
 just so they don't see us on 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.580
 map if you want to replace the specialty 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.610
 invisibility with peripherals ie 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.900
 we kill an enemy and it doesn't let us see or 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.910
 better not see the enemies 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.070
 small skull where he was also killed 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.620
 that would be very good then 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.049
 I think these are the three classes 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.540
 best to play on call of duty 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.250
 advanced warfare let me know you that 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.950
 what do you think if you agree 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.720
 precisely with my considerations and if 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.570
 no then you need to know what you are 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.579
 recommended that because if the video is there 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.380
 liked to subscribe to my channel e
