00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
because then I can do stuff to it like

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.280 
because then I can do stuff to it like
change<00:00:11.429> body<00:00:11.670> parts<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.150> wheels<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.900> paint

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
change body parts and wheels and paint

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.110 
change body parts and wheels and paint
job<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.769> just<00:00:13.950> looks<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.219> lot<00:00:14.400> better<00:00:14.580> as<00:00:14.790> a

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
job and it just looks a lot better as a

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.910 
job and it just looks a lot better as a
premium<00:00:15.509> care<00:00:15.630> also<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.410> sounds<00:00:16.619> like<00:00:16.650> 10

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
premium care also this sounds like 10

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.260 
premium care also this sounds like 10
more<00:00:17.070> horsepower<00:00:17.130> then<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.060> know<00:00:18.119> as

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
more horsepower then you know as

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.410 
more horsepower then you know as
standard<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.100> yeah<00:00:20.100> anyway<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.240> what<00:00:21.330> it

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
standard so yeah anyway this is what it

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.450 
standard so yeah anyway this is what it
looks<00:00:21.539> like<00:00:21.570> once<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:21.930> tuned<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.189> I

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
looks like once it's tuned and it is I

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.790 
looks like once it's tuned and it is I
think<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.779> my<00:00:24.960> favorite<00:00:25.320> looking<00:00:25.560> care<00:00:25.710> in

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
burnt orange metallic that's what it's

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.580 
burnt orange metallic that's what it's
called<00:00:35.309> actually<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.930> I<00:00:36.930> chose<00:00:37.200> these<00:00:37.350> wheels

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
called actually and I chose these wheels

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.520 
called actually and I chose these wheels
because<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.399> way<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.610> they<00:00:38.730> go<00:00:39.000> in

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
because I like the way that they go in

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.660 
because I like the way that they go in
but<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> didn't<00:00:40.860> realize<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.460> don't

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
but I didn't realize that they don't

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.970 
but I didn't realize that they don't
actually<00:00:42.149> change<00:00:42.690> color<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
actually change color it's just the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.220 
actually change color it's just the
inside<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.329> rim<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.539> changes<00:00:46.020> color

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
inside of the rim that changes color

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.459 
inside of the rim that changes color
which<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:47.660> beautiful<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.840> think<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.110> car<00:00:49.289> looks

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
which is beautiful I think the car looks

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.560 
which is beautiful I think the car looks
absolutely<00:00:50.239> gorgeous

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and it is right now my favorite car in

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.779 
and it is right now my favorite car in
Gran<00:00:54.570> Turismo<00:00:54.690> 6<00:00:55.050> looks<00:00:55.890> wise<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.489> think<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
Gran Turismo 6 looks wise I think it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.540 
Gran Turismo 6 looks wise I think it
just<00:00:56.910> looks<00:00:57.090> absolutely<00:00:57.449> brilliant<00:00:58.550> now

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
just looks absolutely brilliant now

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.590 
just looks absolutely brilliant now
let's<00:00:59.820> run<00:00:59.940> through<00:01:00.059> setup

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
let's run through setup

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.680 
let's run through setup
it<00:01:01.289> has<00:01:01.410> 181<00:01:02.219> brake<00:01:02.340> horsepower<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.879> 694

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it has 181 brake horsepower and 694

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.230 
it has 181 brake horsepower and 694
kilos<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.760> drift<00:01:06.060> car

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
kilos not really you know drift car

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
kilos not really you know drift car
material<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.170> still<00:01:07.470> tried<00:01:07.770> because<00:01:08.070> you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
material but I still tried because you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.399 
material but I still tried because you
guys<00:01:08.400> asked<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.600> only<00:01:10.020> added<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
guys asked for it I only added the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.730 
guys asked for it I only added the
mid-range<00:01:10.740> tour<00:01:11.040> boat<00:01:11.189> because<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.740> it's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
mid-range tour boat because it is it's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.830 
mid-range tour boat because it is it's
actually<00:01:14.369> usually<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:15.119> more<00:01:15.360> horse<00:01:15.570> fair<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
actually usually one more horse fair and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.090 
actually usually one more horse fair and
I<00:01:15.869> know<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.500> horsepower<00:01:16.799> isn't

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
I know that one more horsepower isn't

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.999 
I know that one more horsepower isn't
that<00:01:17.729> much<00:01:18.200> but<00:01:19.200> when<00:01:19.590> you're<00:01:19.740> actually

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that much but when you're actually

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.440 
that much but when you're actually
driving<00:01:20.189> around<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> car<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.939> actually<00:01:20.970> makes

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
driving around the car it actually makes

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.820 
driving around the car it actually makes
a<00:01:21.570> difference<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.020> you'll<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.380> able<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.650> tell

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
a difference and you'll be able to tell

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.130 
a difference and you'll be able to tell
the<00:01:22.950> difference<00:01:22.979> anyway<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.850> now<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the difference anyway and now on the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.219 
the difference anyway and now on the
track<00:01:26.299> we're<00:01:27.299> gonna<00:01:27.420> say<00:01:27.659> about<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.990> it

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
track we're gonna say about this it

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
track we're gonna say about this it
obviously<00:01:28.770> doesn't<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.310> power<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
obviously doesn't have the power to be a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.929 
obviously doesn't have the power to be a
proper<00:01:31.020> drift<00:01:31.229> car<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.729> can

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
proper drift car so you know you can

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.060 
proper drift car so you know you can
rule<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:33.960> very<00:01:34.409> light<00:01:34.740> however

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
rule that out it is very light however

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.219 
rule that out it is very light however
so<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.579> power-to-weight<00:01:36.150> ratio<00:01:36.540> wasn't<00:01:36.900> too

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
so the power-to-weight ratio wasn't too

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.950 
so the power-to-weight ratio wasn't too
bad<00:01:38.210> but<00:01:39.210> when<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.390> think<00:01:39.509> around<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> track

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
bad but when you think around the track

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.969 
bad but when you think around the track
especially<00:01:40.140> because<00:01:40.439> there's<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:40.860> really

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
especially because there's really really

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.490 
especially because there's really really
skinny<00:01:41.340> wheels<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.350> come

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
skinny wheels and because I have come

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.789 
skinny wheels and because I have come
for<00:01:43.680> hard<00:01:43.860> tires<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:45.090> actually<00:01:45.799> slides

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
for hard tires on it it actually slides

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.719 
for hard tires on it it actually slides
alright<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.759> slides<00:01:48.229> pretty<00:01:49.229> good<00:01:49.490> if<00:01:50.490> you're

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
alright it slides pretty good if you're

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.399 
alright it slides pretty good if you're
going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> smaller<00:01:51.659> truck<00:01:51.990> smaller

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
going to get out a smaller truck smaller

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.999 
going to get out a smaller truck smaller
than<00:01:52.680> even<00:01:53.369> school<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.970> I'm<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.360> now

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
than even school but that I'm on now

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.440 
than even school but that I'm on now
you'll<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.280> absolutely<00:01:57.000> no<00:01:57.180> trouble

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
you'll have absolutely no trouble

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.330 
you'll have absolutely no trouble
drifting<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.320> brilliant

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
drifting it it is brilliant

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.940 
drifting it it is brilliant
but<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> bigger<00:02:00.479> corners<00:02:00.930> or<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
but on for the bigger corners or for the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.280 
but on for the bigger corners or for the
longer<00:02:02.310> corners<00:02:02.939> you're<00:02:03.600> actually<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
longer corners you're actually going to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.959 
longer corners you're actually going to
have<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.469> bit<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.740> trouble<00:02:04.860> trying<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:05.790> this

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
have a bit of trouble trying to get this

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.760 
have a bit of trouble trying to get this
drift<00:02:06.299> or<00:02:06.420> even<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.259> know<00:02:07.290> getting<00:02:07.649> it

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
drift or even you know getting it

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.839 
drift or even you know getting it
sideways<00:02:08.720> but<00:02:09.950> once<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.129> drive<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.550> around<00:02:11.730> a

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
sideways but once you drive it around a

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.250 
sideways but once you drive it around a
few<00:02:11.970> times<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.540> actually<00:02:12.720> get<00:02:12.930> used<00:02:13.170> to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
few times and you actually get used to

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.960 
few times and you actually get used to
it

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
it

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.840 
it
it's<00:02:14.150> very<00:02:15.020> easy<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.320> drive<00:02:15.590> again<00:02:16.580> as<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.790> said

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
it's very easy to drive again as I said

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.490 
it's very easy to drive again as I said
it<00:02:17.060> doesn't<00:02:17.210> have<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.900> huge<00:02:18.200> amount<00:02:18.440> of

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
it doesn't have that huge amount of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.460 
it doesn't have that huge amount of
power<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.100> can<00:02:19.520> have<00:02:19.970> with<00:02:20.240> with<00:02:21.230> drift

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
power that you can have with with drift

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.100 
power that you can have with with drift
cars<00:02:21.710> but<00:02:22.360> once<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.450> get<00:02:23.570> used<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.900> as<00:02:24.020> I

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
cars but once you get used to it as I

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.590 
cars but once you get used to it as I
said<00:02:24.320> it<00:02:24.500> just<00:02:24.650> drives<00:02:25.150> perfectly<00:02:26.150> fine<00:02:26.330> and

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
said it just drives perfectly fine and

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.770 
said it just drives perfectly fine and
it's<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:27.140> very<00:02:27.920> normal<00:02:28.850> drift<00:02:29.240> car<00:02:29.450> it's<00:02:29.630> a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
it's a a very normal drift car it's a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.900 
it's a a very normal drift car it's a
it's<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:30.020> character<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.530> would<00:02:30.650> definitely<00:02:31.610> use

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
it's a character I would definitely use

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.230 
it's a character I would definitely use
again<00:02:32.450> because<00:02:32.930> it's<00:02:33.170> it's<00:02:33.530> from<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.920> drive

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
again because it's it's from the drive

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.910 
again because it's it's from the drive
also<00:02:35.240> with<00:02:35.570> it<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.840> way<00:02:35.930> looks<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.710> big

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
also with it the way looks just a big

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.710 
also with it the way looks just a big
bonus<00:02:37.190> for<00:02:37.490> me<00:02:37.610> because<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:38.030> absolutely<00:02:38.360> love

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
bonus for me because I absolutely love

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.170 
bonus for me because I absolutely love
the<00:02:38.840> way<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.020> thing<00:02:39.200> looks<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:40.130> I'm<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:41.060> know

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
the way this thing looks so I'm you know

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.580 
the way this thing looks so I'm you know
seeing<00:02:41.450> this<00:02:41.630> out<00:02:41.780> on<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:41.960> track<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.410> seeing

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
seeing this out on the track and seeing

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.560 
seeing this out on the track and seeing
it<00:02:42.710> go<00:02:42.800> sideways<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.250> whatever<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.940> think<00:02:44.360> it

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
it go sideways and whatever I think it

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.450 
it go sideways and whatever I think it
just<00:02:44.720> makes<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.080> carriages<00:02:45.440> off<00:02:45.740> it's<00:02:46.310> just

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
just makes the carriages off it's just

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.460 
just makes the carriages off it's just
awesome<00:02:46.960> but<00:02:48.550> it's<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.940> it's<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.810> was<00:02:51.020> it<00:02:51.200> wasn't

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
awesome but it's a it's it was it wasn't

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.440 
awesome but it's a it's it was it wasn't
a<00:02:51.500> very<00:02:51.650> difficult<00:02:51.920> character<00:02:52.310> get<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.790> to

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
a very difficult character get to to

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.390 
a very difficult character get to to
drift<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.960> was<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.800> was<00:02:54.860> messing<00:02:55.190> around<00:02:55.220> with

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
drift I was a I was messing around with

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.980 
drift I was a I was messing around with
the<00:02:55.520> trends<00:02:55.790> with<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:55.940> suspension<00:02:56.420> quite<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.780> lot

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
the trends with a suspension quite a lot

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.590 
the trends with a suspension quite a lot
because<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:58.400> front<00:02:58.640> was<00:02:58.790> pulling<00:02:59.210> off<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.480> one

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
because the front was pulling off to one

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.210 
because the front was pulling off to one
side<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.870> little<00:03:00.260> bit<00:03:00.380> because<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:01.010> don't<00:03:01.160> know

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
side a little bit because I don't know

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.580 
side a little bit because I don't know
if<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:01.700> some<00:03:01.760> reason<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.090> front<00:03:02.300> had<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:03.110> bit

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
if for some reason the front had a bit

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.560 
if for some reason the front had a bit
more<00:03:03.740> grip<00:03:03.950> than<00:03:04.190> my<00:03:04.340> my<00:03:04.760> usual<00:03:04.940> drift<00:03:05.360> cars

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
more grip than my my usual drift cars

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.210 
more grip than my my usual drift cars
but<00:03:05.840> after<00:03:06.710> a<00:03:06.740> mess<00:03:06.890> around<00:03:06.980> with<00:03:07.130> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
but after a mess around with the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.010 
but after a mess around with the
suspension<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.730> got<00:03:08.300> it<00:03:08.420> pretty<00:03:08.840> much<00:03:08.960> just

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
suspension I got it pretty much just

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.470 
suspension I got it pretty much just
right<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.580> think<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.850> suspension<00:03:11.300> setup

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
right and I think the suspension setup

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.450 
right and I think the suspension setup
that<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.690> have<00:03:11.810> right<00:03:11.930> now<00:03:12.050> on<00:03:12.860> this<00:03:13.010> beetle<00:03:13.340> I

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
that I have right now on this beetle I

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.100 
that I have right now on this beetle I
think<00:03:13.670> is<00:03:13.760> just<00:03:13.910> perfect<00:03:14.540> it's<00:03:14.690> dead-on

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
think is just perfect it's dead-on

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.310 
think is just perfect it's dead-on
and<00:03:15.850> maybe<00:03:16.850> some<00:03:17.150> tweaks<00:03:17.450> if<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.840> guys<00:03:17.989> have

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
and maybe some tweaks if you guys have

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.050 
and maybe some tweaks if you guys have
any<00:03:18.860> of<00:03:18.980> your<00:03:19.160> tweaks<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.580> know<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:19.760> can<00:03:19.940> do

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
any of your tweaks you know you can do

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.000 
any of your tweaks you know you can do
to<00:03:20.600> your<00:03:20.720> cars<00:03:21.020> to<00:03:21.290> make<00:03:21.440> them<00:03:21.620> drift<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:21.920> way

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
to your cars to make them drift the way
