00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:08.420
 in today's lesson I will tell you about 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.070
 how to play the accordion and pistachio it 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.880
 will be the easiest option to play we 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.000
 we will only bass means different 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.260
 accordion their basses are arranged differently 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.470
 on the internet you can find information 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.700
 how are the basses and accordions at 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.039
 equal number of buttons i will call 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.190
 what bass and what chords we play and 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.450
 then you can adjust 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:52.860
 it means that the ditties will sound like 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:55.050
 so here 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 difficult melody now let's 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.210
 analyze by elements how we will we 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:09.260
 play with us will be used 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:12.000
 Donbassa this bass is up to you salt and rap 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.160
 will be used mayor major chords 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.870
 that is, a chord that stands next to 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.130
 bass respectively 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.130
 accord from yes and 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.170
 so we will use 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.640
 auxiliary chord he will 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.759
 be here that is here with us 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.009
 there will be a base and here's an auxiliary port 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.440
 which we will need 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:42.270
 so now I look at the sequence 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:46.320
 we play bass and the major chord afterwards 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.880
 We play auxiliary and chord with us 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:56.870
 it turns out now we do the same thing on 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:03.750
 already with bass salt and auxiliary 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:07.590
 now stress is back 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:22.530
 lower on the salt play and bass and chord 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:26.330
 together again this tune plays a 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.330
 twice and we get cleaning 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.840
 it means the text itself well and the intervals 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:45.269
 between ears is played 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:55.739
 extra melody that is this one 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:57.299
 element of his touch up by kissing 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:04.939
 necessarily that is just to sort out 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:06.090
 buttons he plays so bass yes chord and 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.790
 auxiliary 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.799
 the one that stands next to the bass that is 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:23.790
 not this one but this one 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:28.139
 next to him is the same salt and yes and again 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:35.250
 press the salt and along with the chord we 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:38.189
 it turns out this melody is also repeated 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.659
 that is , we play twice so much is a carcass 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:04:01.790
 double play to her chorus again playing 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:04:01.790
 slow chorus 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.350
 the game again as it should be 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:42.830
 the first element is not adaptable to the words 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:42.830
 2 we just play without words
