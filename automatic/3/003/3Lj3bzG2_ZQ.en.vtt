00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.410
 i need more friends 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.400
 Oh 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.360
 and hello again guys after a long 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.180
 stagnation we are back to you here 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.120
 finally there will be 11 release of this 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.340
 the most ingenious in the project of the photo rhythm we 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.350
 so hurry to remove this new issue 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.330
 release for you that you even forgot to stroke 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.739
 this new iphone and today i am you 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:54.050
 I tell you how to take pictures of lightning is 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.570
 wonderful natural phenomenon by the way 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.930
 which can kill you lightning also 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.980
 as the rainbow is very beautiful and 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.840
 unpredictable nature 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.449
 which enables many 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.700
 photographers show their skills 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.899
 photo art trying to catch 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.970
 lightning sparkling moment yes almost 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.240
 impossible therefore you need to manifest here 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.430
 trick and catch the zipper trap for 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.440
 shooting lightning you will need a camera 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.670
 on which you can manually configure 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.520
 aperture shutter 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.000
 and you can't do without a tripod 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.789
 because you have to take pictures on 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.560
 long exposure and do a lot 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.570
 frames and you need to consider that you 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.970
 physically can't click 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.920
 shutter and shoot the lightning as one 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.630
 lightning strike lasts no more than one 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.939
 seconds for this reason keep 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.430
 camera in your hands meaningless supposedly not 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.890
 has the ability to beat one the same 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.079
 point of the sky several times therefore 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.090
 camera needs to be installed and directed 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.680
 to the place where the lightning flashed 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.930
 also for shooting you will need 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.030
 starting cable and remote 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.009
 of management 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.680
 put the longest shutter speed which 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.799
 is on your camera from 15 to 30 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.090
 seconds aperture rate depending on 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.360
 time of day 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.399
 lighting distance to mole if lightning 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.790
 at medium distance then the diaphragm 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.280
 do 18a excerpt set at 30 if 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.150
 lightning at a very close distance then 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.370
 reduce shutter speed to 15 20 a aperture 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.230
 set to 11 when the settings are set 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.230
 then start taking pictures one by one 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.630
 other places where they appear 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.090
 occasionally lightning unfortunately in the afternoon 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.639
 remove the zipper is very difficult because 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.470
 long exposure you will not put and catch 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:39.040
 the moment of lightning will be very 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.810
 difficult therefore to remove lightning 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.200
 daytime and long 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.840
 shutter speed should be used and blackout 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.299
 filters act lightning starts 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.489
 high above the ground and ends at that 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.829
 same point only on earth in order to 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.129
 take a picture of a long beautiful in 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.560
 lightning needs to make the horizon low 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.470
 so the sky doesn't look boring 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.909
 grab a couple of tree silhouettes or 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.530
 the city can be a correspondent but the main thing is not 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.510
 overdo with a minor 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.939
 plan because the main object of shooting is 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.030
 lightning and some more tips 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:18.489
 just for you and for that to me of course 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.010
 Iâ€™ll need the help of my old and 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:25.980
 faithful companions of life Masha and Dasha-a 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.599
 so first 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.090
 although lightning is very beautiful but not 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.760
 forget also that she is dangerous therefore 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.829
 if you are at a distance less 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.930
 than 1 kilometer it is I think not worth it 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.689
 take risks and take pictures and and second 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.859
 thunder and lightning are usually accompanied 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:46.870
 rain so do not forget to protect 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.479
 your camera and shoot well 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.540
 protected from moisture together and finally 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:54.760
 third shoot raw 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.709
 as it is very difficult at night and when it rains 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.540
 set exposure and white balance 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.209
 well, that's all our release came to an end 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.709
