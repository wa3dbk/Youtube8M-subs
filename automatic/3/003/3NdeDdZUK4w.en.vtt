I<00:02:38.150> guess<00:02:39.150> I'm<00:02:39.330> contributing<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.930> human

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200

race<00:02:40.320> at<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:40.680> point<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.340> guess<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.450> order

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
race at this point so I guess in order

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.360 
race at this point so I guess in order
to<00:02:42.750> invest<00:02:43.110> into<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.470> human<00:02:43.710> race<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:43.920> it

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
to invest into the human race that it

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.970

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
requires you not to sleep and hopefully

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.530 
requires you not to sleep and hopefully
