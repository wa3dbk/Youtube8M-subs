00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
we're going to have a look at the

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.150 
we're going to have a look at the
autofocus<00:00:11.969> capabilities<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.960> this

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
autofocus capabilities of this

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.029 
autofocus capabilities of this
specifically<00:00:14.160> during<00:00:14.610> video<00:00:15.120> because<00:00:16.039> canons

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
specifically during video because canons

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.130 
specifically during video because canons
now<00:00:17.220> release<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.550> Canon<00:00:18.060> 70d<00:00:18.420> well<00:00:18.869> has<00:00:18.960> been

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
now release the Canon 70d well has been

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.200 
now release the Canon 70d well has been
out<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.439> about<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.619> year<00:00:19.920> now<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.970> has<00:00:21.180> a

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
out for about a year now but it has a

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.570 
out for about a year now but it has a
fantastic<00:00:21.539> dual<00:00:22.230> pixel<00:00:22.500> autofocus<00:00:22.949> system

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
fantastic dual pixel autofocus system

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.820 
fantastic dual pixel autofocus system
and<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.029> really<00:00:24.420> works<00:00:24.630> fantastic<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:25.769> I

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and it really works fantastic so what I

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.580 
and it really works fantastic so what I
want<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> next<00:00:27.330> few<00:00:27.539> weeks<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.990> test

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
want to do in the next few weeks is test

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.380 
want to do in the next few weeks is test
out<00:00:28.769> different<00:00:28.830> lenses<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:29.970> how<00:00:30.179> they

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
out different lenses to see how they

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.310 
out different lenses to see how they
perform<00:00:31.189> during<00:00:32.189> autofocus<00:00:32.940> during<00:00:33.360> video<00:00:33.540> so

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
perform during autofocus during video so

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.500 
perform during autofocus during video so
we'll<00:00:35.100> be<00:00:35.250> testing<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:35.969> first<00:00:36.180> I've

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
we'll be testing this one out first I've

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.700 
we'll be testing this one out first I've
got<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> couple<00:00:36.870> others<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.680> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
got a couple others and I'm going to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.250 
got a couple others and I'm going to
check<00:00:37.890> test<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.579> but<00:00:39.000> let's<00:00:39.510> take<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.020> look<00:00:40.170> at

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
check test out but let's take a look at

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.920 
check test out but let's take a look at
this<00:00:40.350> lens<00:00:40.590> here<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.219> let's<00:00:42.090> go<00:00:42.239> outside<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this lens here and let's go outside and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.500 
this lens here and let's go outside and
see<00:00:43.379> how<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> performs

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.850 

okay<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.810> the<00:00:48.960> first<00:00:49.170> test<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.470> I<00:00:49.590> want<00:00:49.740> to<00:00:49.800> do

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
okay so the first test that I want to do

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.520 
okay so the first test that I want to do
on<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.070> Sigma<00:00:50.430> 30-millimeter<00:00:50.820> 1.4<00:00:51.720> is<00:00:51.900> test

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
on this Sigma 30-millimeter 1.4 is test

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.580 
on this Sigma 30-millimeter 1.4 is test
out<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.950> face<00:00:53.220> tracking<00:00:54.090> feature<00:00:54.690> that's<00:00:55.380> on

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
out the face tracking feature that's on

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.710 
out the face tracking feature that's on
the<00:00:55.710> Canon<00:00:55.980> 70d<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:56.850> how<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.120> performs

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
the Canon 70d and see how that performs

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.650 
the Canon 70d and see how that performs
with<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> Sigma<00:00:58.620> 31.4<00:00:59.489> now<00:01:00.120> I'm<00:01:00.210> currently<00:01:00.420> at

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
with the Sigma 31.4 now I'm currently at

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.410 
with the Sigma 31.4 now I'm currently at
f4<00:01:01.140> point<00:01:01.350> 5<00:01:01.530> which<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.130> super<00:01:02.610> wide

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
f4 point 5 which is in this super wide

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
f4 point 5 which is in this super wide
aperture<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.320> staying<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.070> focus<00:01:05.400> shouldn't

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
aperture so staying in focus shouldn't

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.460 
aperture so staying in focus shouldn't
be<00:01:05.760> too<00:01:05.910> difficult<00:01:05.940> but<00:01:06.750> let's<00:01:06.960> test<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.320> how

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
be too difficult but let's test out how

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.160 
be too difficult but let's test out how
it<00:01:07.560> goes<00:01:07.710> I'm<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> move<00:01:08.670> back<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.940> forth

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
it goes I'm going to move back and forth

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.830 
it goes I'm going to move back and forth
to<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.670> just<00:01:11.670> how<00:01:11.760> much<00:01:12.090> how<00:01:12.479> well<00:01:12.690> it<00:01:12.810> can

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to see just how much how well it can

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.560 
to see just how much how well it can
keep<00:01:13.110> me<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.290> focus<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:15.180> looks<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.360> it's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
keep me in focus and it looks like it's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.750 
keep me in focus and it looks like it's
doing<00:01:15.690> a<00:01:15.840> pretty<00:01:15.990> good<00:01:16.080> job<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.550> is

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
doing a pretty good job it can is

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.510 
doing a pretty good job it can is
recognizing<00:01:18.450> my<00:01:18.570> face<00:01:18.780> which<00:01:19.440> is<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> good<00:01:20.100> good

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
recognizing my face which is a good good

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880 
recognizing my face which is a good good
thing<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:21.690> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.410> jump

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
thing now what I'm going to do is jump

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
thing now what I'm going to do is jump
out<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.340> frame<00:01:23.550> and<00:01:23.790> see<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.300> pick

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
out of the frame and see if we can pick

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.710 
out of the frame and see if we can pick
it<00:01:24.600> back<00:01:24.720> up<00:01:24.830> without<00:01:25.850> me<00:01:26.850> having<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.119> refocus

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
it back up without me having to refocus

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:37.070 
it back up without me having to refocus
it<00:01:27.899> or<00:01:28.050> or<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.520> works<00:01:35.810> ok<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.020> as

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
it or or just see if it works ok and as

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.600 
it or or just see if it works ok and as
you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.770> seems<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.430> did<00:01:38.580> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
you can see it seems like it did a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.450 
you can see it seems like it did a
really<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:39.630> good<00:01:39.899> job<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.440> more<00:01:41.160> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
really really good job that's more to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.070 
really really good job that's more to
the<00:01:41.729> Canon<00:01:42.180> 70d<00:01:42.479> s<00:01:43.850> credit<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.690> Sigma

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
the Canon 70d s credit but the Sigma

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.620 
the Canon 70d s credit but the Sigma
31.4<00:01:46.950> seems<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.520> auto<00:01:47.820> focusing<00:01:48.390> pretty

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
31.4 seems to be auto focusing pretty

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.580 
31.4 seems to be auto focusing pretty
well<00:01:48.979> and<00:01:50.569> working<00:01:51.569> well<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.050> Canon<00:01:52.289> 70d

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
well and working well with the Canon 70d

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.180 
well and working well with the Canon 70d
now<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.399> we're<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.060> change<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
now what we're going to do is change the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.779 
now what we're going to do is change the
aperture<00:01:56.190> down<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.360> F<00:01:57.750> 1.4<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.979> little<00:01:59.700> bit

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
aperture down to F 1.4 a little bit

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.719 
aperture down to F 1.4 a little bit
bright<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.350> see<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.890> autofocus<00:02:02.369> works

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
bright and see if the autofocus works

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.480 
bright and see if the autofocus works
well<00:02:02.940> at<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.450> aperture<00:02:04.110> obviously<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:04.890> this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
well at this aperture obviously the this

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.309 
well at this aperture obviously the this
is<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> really<00:02:05.940> shallow<00:02:06.090> depth<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.509> field<00:02:06.569> so<00:02:06.929> it

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
is a really shallow depth of field so it

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:08.889 
is a really shallow depth of field so it
would<00:02:07.440> be<00:02:07.530> even<00:02:07.649> difficult<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
would be even difficult for a

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.080 
would be even difficult for a
experienced<00:02:09.899> focus<00:02:10.229> puller<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.619> get<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.340> in

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
experienced focus puller to get this in

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.170 
experienced focus puller to get this in
focus<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:12.959> I'm<00:02:13.170> going<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.349> move<00:02:13.500> back<00:02:14.180> and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
focus but I'm going to move back and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.440 
focus but I'm going to move back and
forth<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.720> see<00:02:16.470> if<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.580> able<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.090> keep<00:02:18.270> me

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
forth and see if it is able to keep me

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.670 
forth and see if it is able to keep me
in<00:02:18.599> focus<00:02:20.569> but<00:02:21.569> like<00:02:21.750> as<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.170> can<00:02:22.290> see<00:02:22.470> right

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
in focus but like as you can see right

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.059 
in focus but like as you can see right
here<00:02:22.740> it's<00:02:23.280> barely<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:24.569> my<00:02:24.750> eyes<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.950> are

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
here it's barely just my eyes that are

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.990 
here it's barely just my eyes that are
in<00:02:26.160> focus<00:02:27.380> oops<00:02:28.380> lost<00:02:28.830> me<00:02:28.980> there<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:29.550> go<00:02:29.670> back

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
in focus oops lost me there we go back

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.699 
in focus oops lost me there we go back
in<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.270> think<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.480> went<00:02:30.630> too<00:02:30.750> too<00:02:31.170> close<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.560> it

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
in I think I went too too close to it

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.900 
in I think I went too too close to it
you<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:32.670> see<00:02:32.880> just<00:02:33.120> how<00:02:34.459> how<00:02:35.459> much<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.760> in

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
you can just see just how how much is in

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.760 
you can just see just how how much is in
focus<00:02:36.300> because<00:02:36.750> my<00:02:36.989> finger<00:02:37.290> right<00:02:37.440> there<00:02:37.650> is

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
focus because my finger right there is

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.250 
focus because my finger right there is
completely<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.310> focus<00:02:38.720> but<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.959> seems<00:02:40.170> to

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
completely out of focus but it seems to

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.690 
completely out of focus but it seems to
work<00:02:40.290> pretty<00:02:40.440> well<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:41.400> know<00:02:41.489> if<00:02:41.580> you're

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
work pretty well you know if you're

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.900 
work pretty well you know if you're
using<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:42.150> Steadicam<00:02:42.660> or<00:02:42.780> something<00:02:43.020> like<00:02:43.170> this

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
using a Steadicam or something like this

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.220 
using a Steadicam or something like this
having<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> auto<00:02:45.150> focus<00:02:45.510> feature<00:02:45.690> seems<00:02:46.050> to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
having the auto focus feature seems to

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.170 
having the auto focus feature seems to
work<00:02:46.500> really<00:02:46.530> well<00:02:46.830> for<00:02:46.950> video<00:02:47.310> not<00:02:47.970> really

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
work really well for video not really

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.059 
work really well for video not really
sure<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:48.480> I'd<00:02:48.569> want<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.840> be<00:02:48.930> shooting<00:02:49.080> at<00:02:49.319> F<00:02:49.440> 1.4

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
sure if I'd want to be shooting at F 1.4

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.400 
sure if I'd want to be shooting at F 1.4
in<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.220> Steadicam<00:02:50.700> but<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.900> features<00:02:52.230> there

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
in a Steadicam but the features there

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.690 
in a Steadicam but the features there
and<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.739> seems<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.040> be<00:02:53.130> working<00:02:53.280> pretty<00:02:53.610> well

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
and it seems to be working pretty well

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.390 
and it seems to be working pretty well
so<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.420> was<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.750> Sigma<00:02:55.110> 30<00:02:55.349> millimeter<00:02:55.920> F<00:02:56.159> 1

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
so that was the Sigma 30 millimeter F 1

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.819 
so that was the Sigma 30 millimeter F 1
point<00:02:56.640> for<00:02:56.939> what<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.239> fantastic<00:02:57.689> lens<00:02:58.110> look<00:02:58.620> it

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
point for what a fantastic lens look it

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.120 
point for what a fantastic lens look it
performed<00:02:59.310> much<00:02:59.519> better<00:02:59.549> than

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
performed much better than

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.230 
performed much better than
thought<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.400> would<00:03:01.260> its<00:03:02.260> aperture<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:03.040> f1<00:03:03.550> is<00:03:04.210> a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
thought it would its aperture of f1 is a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.960 
thought it would its aperture of f1 is a
very<00:03:04.780> very<00:03:05.080> fast<00:03:05.350> aperture<00:03:05.710> and<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.550> depth<00:03:06.820> of

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
very very fast aperture and the depth of

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.540 
very very fast aperture and the depth of
field<00:03:07.240> is<00:03:07.450> razor<00:03:07.960> thin<00:03:08.260> at<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.860> aperture<00:03:09.220> of

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
field is razor thin at that aperture of

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.100 
field is razor thin at that aperture of
course<00:03:10.000> if<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.240> step<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.600> down<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.930> something

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
course if you step it down to something

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.090 
course if you step it down to something
like<00:03:11.320> F<00:03:11.590> 3.2<00:03:12.400> or<00:03:12.870> f5<00:03:13.870> it's<00:03:14.170> going<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.410> get<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.770> lot

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
like F 3.2 or f5 it's going to get a lot

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.470 
like F 3.2 or f5 it's going to get a lot
better<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.700> lot<00:03:15.880> easier<00:03:16.240> for<00:03:16.390> the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
better and a lot easier for the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.480 
better and a lot easier for the
autofocus<00:03:16.870> but<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.530> course<00:03:17.740> we<00:03:17.980> want<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.310> use

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
autofocus but of course we want to use

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.550 
autofocus but of course we want to use
this<00:03:18.670> lens<00:03:18.940> at<00:03:19.180> its<00:03:19.450> maximum<00:03:20.170> aperture

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
this lens at its maximum aperture

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.860 
this lens at its maximum aperture
aperture<00:03:21.340> because<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.300> what<00:03:22.510> we've<00:03:22.660> got

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
aperture because that is what we've got

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.780 
aperture because that is what we've got
it<00:03:22.960> for<00:03:23.170> so<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.860> does<00:03:24.160> perform<00:03:24.370> pretty<00:03:24.670> well

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
it for so it does perform pretty well

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.430 
it for so it does perform pretty well
obviously<00:03:25.570> it's<00:03:25.690> not<00:03:25.810> going<00:03:25.990> to<00:03:26.050> be<00:03:26.140> as<00:03:26.260> good

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
obviously it's not going to be as good

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.500 
obviously it's not going to be as good
