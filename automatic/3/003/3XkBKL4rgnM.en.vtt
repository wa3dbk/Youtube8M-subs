00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.530 

hi<00:00:07.919> there<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.610> thought<00:00:08.969> it's<00:00:09.150> time<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.420> update

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
hi there I thought it's time to update

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.020 
hi there I thought it's time to update
you<00:00:10.019> with<00:00:10.410> some<00:00:10.920> improvements<00:00:11.400> have<00:00:11.519> made<00:00:11.700> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
you with some improvements have made to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.320 
you with some improvements have made to
this<00:00:12.780> round<00:00:13.590> pump<00:00:14.330> particularly

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
this round pump particularly

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.220 
this round pump particularly
improvements<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.789> valves<00:00:17.789> but<00:00:18.779> also<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
improvements to the valves but also the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.620 
improvements to the valves but also the
escape<00:00:19.560> mechanism<00:00:20.220> which<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.000> important<00:00:21.510> so

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
escape mechanism which is important so

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.670 
escape mechanism which is important so
I'm<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.840> talk<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.140> through<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.560> this

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
I'm going to talk you through with this

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.880 
I'm going to talk you through with this
diagram<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.460> then<00:00:24.119> show<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.450> the<00:00:24.570> real<00:00:24.780> thing

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
diagram and then show you the real thing

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.850 
diagram and then show you the real thing
so<00:00:26.430> firstly<00:00:27.360> the<00:00:27.660> valves<00:00:28.140> work<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> same

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
so firstly the valves work in the same

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.749 
so firstly the valves work in the same
way<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.940> what<00:00:30.150> I've<00:00:30.300> done<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.869> I've<00:00:31.350> used

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
way but what I've done is I've used

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.779 
way but what I've done is I've used
track<00:00:32.759> balls<00:00:33.059> from<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:33.660> style<00:00:34.050> computer<00:00:34.590> mice

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
track balls from all style computer mice

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:37.400 
track balls from all style computer mice
which<00:00:35.789> are<00:00:36.059> increasingly<00:00:36.780> hard<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.109> get<00:00:37.230> hold

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
which are increasingly hard to get hold

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.910 
which are increasingly hard to get hold
of<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.710> don't<00:00:37.890> throw<00:00:38.070> them<00:00:38.129> away<00:00:38.309> please<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
of so don't throw them away please and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.439 
of so don't throw them away please and
so<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.249> are<00:00:41.339> the<00:00:41.399> track<00:00:41.609> balls<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
so here are the track balls here and

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.660 
so here are the track balls here and
you've<00:00:42.629> got<00:00:42.659> two<00:00:43.109> valves<00:00:43.710> both<00:00:44.039> working<00:00:44.579> in

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
you've got two valves both working in

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.299 
you've got two valves both working in
opposite<00:00:45.059> directions<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:46.350> water<00:00:46.559> comes<00:00:46.920> in

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
opposite directions the water comes in

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.129 
opposite directions the water comes in
from<00:00:48.089> your<00:00:48.269> head<00:00:49.519> bypasses<00:00:50.519> the<00:00:51.139> pressure

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:52.139 
from your head bypasses the pressure

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:56.090 
from your head bypasses the pressure
vessel<00:00:52.409> and<00:00:52.889> flows<00:00:53.489> through<00:00:54.949> through<00:00:55.949> this

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
vessel and flows through through this

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.090 
vessel and flows through through this
valve<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.489> first<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:58.379> force<00:00:58.769> of<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
valve here first and the force of the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
valve here first and the force of the
flow<00:00:59.959> pushes<00:01:00.959> this<00:01:01.639> track<00:01:02.639> ball<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.809> create

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
flow pushes this track ball up to create

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.690 
flow pushes this track ball up to create
a<00:01:04.440> nice<00:01:04.769> seal<00:01:05.129> there<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:07.280> then<00:01:08.280> creates

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
a nice seal there and that then creates

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.200 
a nice seal there and that then creates
a<00:01:09.030> pressure<00:01:09.659> wave<00:01:09.960> which<00:01:10.770> then<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.880> only<00:01:12.090> way

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
a pressure wave which then the only way

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.230 
a pressure wave which then the only way
it<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.450> escape<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.980> and<00:01:14.190> so<00:01:15.060> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
it can escape is up here and so that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.110 
it can escape is up here and so that
then<00:01:15.450> opens<00:01:15.660> this<00:01:16.260> valve<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.940> water

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
then opens this valve and so the water

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.480 
then opens this valve and so the water
then<00:01:18.390> flows<00:01:18.660> through<00:01:19.160> squirting<00:01:20.160> into<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
then flows through squirting into the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.350 
then flows through squirting into the
pressure<00:01:20.760> vessel<00:01:21.150> increasing<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.050> pressure

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
pressure vessel increasing the pressure

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.570 
pressure vessel increasing the pressure
the<00:01:24.360> back<00:01:24.570> pressure<00:01:24.930> when<00:01:25.260> it<00:01:25.290> evens<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.860> then

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the back pressure when it evens up then

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.450 
the back pressure when it evens up then
forces<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.410> little<00:01:28.410> trackball<00:01:28.890> back<00:01:29.130> down

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
forces this little trackball back down

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.930 
forces this little trackball back down
again<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.890> weight<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.580> this

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
again and the weight on on this

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.570 
again and the weight on on this
trackball<00:01:33.510> then<00:01:33.840> drops<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.890> down<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
trackball then drops it down and the

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.900 
trackball then drops it down and the
whole<00:01:35.730> process<00:01:36.000> starts<00:01:36.630> again<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
whole process starts again so that's the

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.110 
whole process starts again so that's the
theory<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.960> now<00:01:40.470> I'm<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> show<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.120> the

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
theory and now I'm going to show you the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.240 
theory and now I'm going to show you the
actual<00:01:42.300> mechanism<00:01:43.260> it's<00:01:43.380> okay<00:01:43.800> here<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.220> are

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
actual mechanism it's okay here we are

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.250 
actual mechanism it's okay here we are
here's<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.820> pressure<00:01:45.120> vessel<00:01:45.390> which<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.930> just

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
here's the pressure vessel which is just

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.870 
here's the pressure vessel which is just
a<00:01:46.640> plastic<00:01:47.640> water<00:01:48.600> bottle<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.580> here's<00:01:50.580> some

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
a plastic water bottle and here's some

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.520 
a plastic water bottle and here's some
piping<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:53.370> two<00:01:53.610> valves<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.470> I

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
piping and this is the two valves so I

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.399 
piping and this is the two valves so I
just<00:01:55.680> can't<00:01:55.830> talk<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.280> through<00:01:56.550> these<00:01:57.409> okay

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
just can't talk you through these okay

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.740 
just can't talk you through these okay
so<00:01:58.830> it's<00:01:59.010> just<00:01:59.040> as<00:01:59.400> in<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> diagram<00:01:59.909> we've<00:02:00.540> got

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so it's just as in the diagram we've got

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.800 
so it's just as in the diagram we've got
two<00:02:01.020> track<00:02:01.320> balls<00:02:01.620> here<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.220> here<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.700> now

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
two track balls here and here and now

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.380 
two track balls here and here and now
they<00:02:03.810> make<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.350> nice<00:02:04.620> seat<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.090> bit<00:02:06.300> of

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
they make a nice seat in this bit of

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.839 
they make a nice seat in this bit of
piping<00:02:06.780> here<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.220> when<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> back

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
piping here and so that when the back

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.399 
piping here and so that when the back
pressure<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.659> makes<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:12.230> really<00:02:13.230> nice

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
pressure is on it makes a really nice

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.200 
pressure is on it makes a really nice
seal<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.129> they<00:02:14.730> sit<00:02:15.090> inside<00:02:15.650> these

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
seal and they sit inside these

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.900 
seal and they sit inside these
old<00:02:19.050> bits<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.770> valve<00:02:20.010> which<00:02:20.280> I'm<00:02:20.550> not<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
old bits of valve which I'm not the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.230 
old bits of valve which I'm not the
Middle's<00:02:21.180> out<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:22.220> those<00:02:23.220> old<00:02:23.610> valence<00:02:24.060> were

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
Middle's out of those old valence were

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.630 
Middle's out of those old valence were
okay<00:02:24.570> for<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.840> bit<00:02:24.990> but<00:02:25.200> they<00:02:25.320> wore<00:02:25.560> out<00:02:25.800> once

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
okay for a bit but they wore out once

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.390 
okay for a bit but they wore out once
the<00:02:27.350> sort<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.410> grit<00:02:28.620> started<00:02:29.070> coming<00:02:29.370> through

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
the sort of grit started coming through

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.860 
the sort of grit started coming through
in<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.760> wind<00:02:29.940> turn<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.300> sort<00:02:30.630> things<00:02:30.780> so

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
in the wind turn that sort things so

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.990 
in the wind turn that sort things so
they<00:02:30.960> didn't<00:02:31.200> really<00:02:31.230> last<00:02:31.560> very<00:02:31.980> long<00:02:32.130> okay

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
they didn't really last very long okay

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.630 
they didn't really last very long okay
so<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.360> assemble<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:33.990> one<00:02:34.320> this<00:02:35.250> this

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
so if I assemble this one this this

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.990 
so if I assemble this one this this
still<00:02:35.940> has<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> stop<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:38.130> bottom<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.760> stop

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
still has a stop in the bottom to stop

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.270 
still has a stop in the bottom to stop
the<00:02:39.120> track<00:02:39.360> ball<00:02:39.740> running<00:02:40.740> downs<00:02:41.070> not

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
the track ball running downs not

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.710 
the track ball running downs not
particularly<00:02:41.790> needed<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.240> do<00:02:42.420> need<00:02:42.600> this

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
particularly needed you do need this

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.680 
particularly needed you do need this
extra<00:02:43.290> width<00:02:44.100> here<00:02:44.490> so<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.940> track<00:02:45.150> balls<00:02:45.390> can

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
extra width here so the track balls can

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.160 
extra width here so the track balls can
move<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.110> down<00:02:46.230> freely<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.250> again<00:02:48.170> this

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
move up and down freely and again this

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.230 
move up and down freely and again this
track<00:02:49.500> ball<00:02:49.770> makes<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.190> beautiful<00:02:50.430> seal<00:02:50.970> in

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
track ball makes a beautiful seal in

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.430 
track ball makes a beautiful seal in
here<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:53.160> create<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.610> valve<00:02:53.990> so<00:02:54.990> we<00:02:55.200> put<00:02:55.410> that

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
here to create the valve so we put that

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.620 
here to create the valve so we put that
in<00:02:55.590> there<00:02:55.890> we<00:02:56.370> put<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.760> on<00:02:56.970> here

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
in there we put this on here

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.930 
in there we put this on here
in<00:02:58.530> fact<00:02:58.770> when<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:58.980> assemble<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.580> properly

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
in fact when I assemble this properly

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.850 
in fact when I assemble this properly
I'm<00:03:00.209> going<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.420> be<00:03:00.510> using<00:03:00.720> ducting<00:03:01.350> tape<00:03:01.590> to

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
I'm going to be using ducting tape to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.850 
I'm going to be using ducting tape to
make<00:03:01.980> sure<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.370> joints<00:03:02.760> are<00:03:02.880> better<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:04.020> then

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
make sure the joints are better and then

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.720 
make sure the joints are better and then
this<00:03:05.070> will<00:03:05.970> attach<00:03:06.300> onto<00:03:06.600> here<00:03:10.370> I'll<00:03:11.370> do<00:03:11.580> that

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
this will attach onto here I'll do that

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.580 
this will attach onto here I'll do that
now<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.570> bits<00:03:12.840> important<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.500> I'll

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
now and this bits important and I'll

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.199 
now and this bits important and I'll
talk<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:13.800> through<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.220> minute<00:03:14.459> this<00:03:15.000> is

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
talk you through it in a minute this is

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.810 
talk you through it in a minute this is
the<00:03:15.390> escape<00:03:16.340> mechanism<00:03:17.340> for<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.580> water

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
the escape mechanism for the water

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.140 
the escape mechanism for the water
what's<00:03:18.510> important<00:03:19.140> about<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.980> really<00:03:20.700> that

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
what's important about it is really that

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.780 
what's important about it is really that
you<00:03:22.019> want<00:03:22.290> your<00:03:22.440> water<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:23.100> be<00:03:23.220> able<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.489> escape

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
you want your water to be able to escape

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.350 
you want your water to be able to escape
as<00:03:24.150> easily<00:03:24.690> as<00:03:24.959> possible<00:03:25.470> once<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.890> gets<00:03:26.100> past

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
as easily as possible once it gets past

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.979 
as easily as possible once it gets past
this<00:03:27.360> valve<00:03:27.720> here<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.790> because<00:03:29.989> the

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
this valve here and that is because the

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.440 
this valve here and that is because the
quicker<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.470> escapes<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.700> quicker<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.180> flow

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
quicker it escapes the quicker the flow

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.660 
quicker it escapes the quicker the flow
builds<00:03:33.930> up<00:03:34.110> which<00:03:34.530> pushes<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.010> track<00:03:35.430> ball

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
builds up which pushes the track ball

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.900 
builds up which pushes the track ball
closed<00:03:36.470> creating<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.860> pressure<00:03:38.100> wave<00:03:38.430> to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
closed creating the pressure wave to

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.970 
closed creating the pressure wave to
push<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.239> other<00:03:39.269> track<00:03:39.630> ball<00:03:39.840> open<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:40.769> this

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
push the other track ball open so this

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.039 
push the other track ball open so this
is<00:03:41.100> what<00:03:41.250> I've<00:03:41.400> come<00:03:41.430> up<00:03:41.640> with<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:45.180> allow

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
is what I've come up with to to allow

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.720 
is what I've come up with to to allow
the<00:03:46.110> water<00:03:46.380> escape<00:03:46.769> this<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.130> just<00:03:47.340> made<00:03:47.519> from

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
the water escape this is just made from

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.970 
the water escape this is just made from
some<00:03:48.060> bits<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.630> PVC<00:03:49.260> pipe<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.830> had

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
some bits of PVC pipe that I had

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.000 
some bits of PVC pipe that I had
leftover<00:03:50.370> wired<00:03:51.360> together<00:03:51.600> now<00:03:52.500> I've<00:03:52.680> found

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
leftover wired together now I've found

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.759 
leftover wired together now I've found
that<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.700> track<00:03:53.970> ball<00:03:54.180> very<00:03:54.840> very<00:03:55.080> nearly<00:03:55.440> has

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
that the track ball very very nearly has

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.060 
that the track ball very very nearly has
enough<00:03:56.070> weight<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.910> push<00:04:00.090> itself<00:04:00.540> down<00:04:01.070> the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
enough weight to to push itself down the

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.400 
enough weight to to push itself down the
only<00:04:02.370> problem<00:04:02.880> being<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.630> mean<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.959> does<00:04:04.170> work

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
only problem being I mean it does work

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.000 
only problem being I mean it does work
for<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.739> few<00:04:05.010> cycles<00:04:06.320> but<00:04:07.320> because<00:04:07.799> this

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
for a few cycles but because this

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.650 
for a few cycles but because this
because<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.640> particular<00:04:08.940> fit<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.600> the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
because of the particular fit and the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.810 
because of the particular fit and the
slight<00:04:10.019> give<00:04:10.440> in<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.650> track<00:04:10.890> ball<00:04:11.130> it

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
slight give in the track ball it

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.870 
slight give in the track ball it
sometimes<00:04:12.360> gets<00:04:12.600> stuck<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:13.140> there<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:14.610> so

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
sometimes gets stuck in there and so

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.860 
sometimes gets stuck in there and so
I've<00:04:15.030> just<00:04:15.060> created<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:15.870> weight<00:04:16.340> -<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:18.750> make

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
I've just created this weight - to make

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.370 
I've just created this weight - to make
sure<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.169> opens<00:04:19.440> up<00:04:19.590> properly<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:21.630> can<00:04:21.840> you'll

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
sure it opens up properly you can you'll

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.680 
sure it opens up properly you can you'll
need<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.710> play<00:04:23.040> with<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.580> weights<00:04:24.090> once<00:04:24.540> you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
need to play with the weights once you

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.480 
need to play with the weights once you
get<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.900> all<00:04:25.020> set<00:04:25.320> up<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:25.770> need<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:26.039> add<00:04:26.250> and

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
get it all set up you need to add and

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.270 
get it all set up you need to add and
take<00:04:26.640> away

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
take away

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.280 
take away
but<00:04:27.910> what's<00:04:28.090> important<00:04:28.630> is<00:04:28.720> allowing<00:04:29.200> the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
but what's important is allowing the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.690 
but what's important is allowing the
water<00:04:29.440> to<00:04:29.620> escape<00:04:30.100> as<00:04:30.700> easily<00:04:31.150> as<00:04:31.240> possible

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
water to escape as easily as possible

through these side holes and also that

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.480 
through these side holes and also that
this<00:04:37.300> needs<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.050> run<00:04:38.320> up<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:38.650> down<00:04:38.710> fairly

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
this needs to run up and down fairly

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.390 
this needs to run up and down fairly
evenly<00:04:39.760> you<00:04:39.910> don't<00:04:40.090> want<00:04:40.300> it<00:04:40.450> too<00:04:40.660> wonky

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
evenly you don't want it too wonky

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.470 
evenly you don't want it too wonky
otherwise<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.580> will<00:04:42.640> tend<00:04:42.880> to<00:04:42.940> get<00:04:43.090> stuck

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
otherwise it will tend to get stuck

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.560 
otherwise it will tend to get stuck
anyway<00:04:44.350> that's<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.890> update<00:04:45.010> and<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.120> will<00:04:46.390> show

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
anyway that's the update and I will show

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.930 
anyway that's the update and I will show
you<00:04:46.600> it<00:04:46.810> working<00:04:47.310> so<00:04:48.310> here<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.670> is<00:04:48.820> all

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
you it working so here it is all

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.960 
you it working so here it is all
assembled<00:04:49.480> pressure<00:04:49.900> vessel<00:04:50.970> escape

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
assembled pressure vessel escape

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.530 
assembled pressure vessel escape
mechanism<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:54.250> two<00:04:54.460> valves<00:04:55.030> with<00:04:55.450> the

track both inside okay because your
ducting<00:04:59.260> tape<00:05:00.690> so<00:05:01.690> this<00:05:01.930> is<00:05:02.080> basically<00:05:02.530> what

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
ducting tape so this is basically what

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:16.080 
ducting tape so this is basically what
you're<00:05:03.220> seeing<00:05:13.680> beautiful<00:05:14.760> there<00:05:15.760> are<00:05:15.790> two

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
you're seeing beautiful there are two

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.700 
you're seeing beautiful there are two
variables<00:05:16.720> in<00:05:16.870> adjusting<00:05:17.350> this<00:05:17.440> Cape

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
variables in adjusting this Cape

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.460 
variables in adjusting this Cape
mechanism<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:19.060> weight<00:05:19.300> and<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:19.960> distance<00:05:20.080> it

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
mechanism the weight and the distance it

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.950 
mechanism the weight and the distance it
drops<00:05:20.710> by<00:05:21.060> once<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.240> pressure<00:05:22.480> wave<00:05:22.780> is

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
drops by once the pressure wave is

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.630 
drops by once the pressure wave is
exhausted<00:05:23.500> itself<00:05:23.830> filling<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.400> pressure

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.570 
pressure valve
at<00:05:28.930> this<00:05:29.140> point<00:05:29.440> is<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:30.040> weight<00:05:30.220> of<00:05:30.400> water

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
at this point is the weight of water

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.520 
at this point is the weight of water
from<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.090> head<00:05:31.330> that<00:05:31.660> keeps<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.200> escape

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
from the head that keeps the escape

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.890 
from the head that keeps the escape
valve<00:05:32.800> closed<00:05:33.190> so<00:05:34.150> there<00:05:34.330> needs<00:05:34.510> to<00:05:34.570> be<00:05:34.660> enough

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
valve closed so there needs to be enough

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.050 
valve closed so there needs to be enough
weight<00:05:35.110> against<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.590> valve<00:05:35.860> to<00:05:36.040> open<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.490> but

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
weight against the valve to open it but

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.909 
weight against the valve to open it but
not<00:05:37.210> so<00:05:37.450> much<00:05:37.630> to<00:05:37.990> stop<00:05:38.290> the<00:05:38.440> flow<00:05:38.650> of<00:05:38.680> water

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
not so much to stop the flow of water

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.760 
not so much to stop the flow of water
closing<00:05:39.460> it<00:05:39.580> again<00:05:40.080> here<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:41.260> weight<00:05:41.440> only

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
closing it again here the weight only

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.409 
closing it again here the weight only
needs<00:05:41.979> to<00:05:42.130> drop<00:05:42.310> by<00:05:42.520> about<00:05:42.610> five<00:05:43.090> millimeters

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
needs to drop by about five millimeters

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.780 
needs to drop by about five millimeters
to<00:05:43.840> break<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.169> seal<00:05:44.410> and<00:05:44.650> initiate<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:45.460> full

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
to break the seal and initiate the full

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.210 
to break the seal and initiate the full
valve<00:05:46.090> opening<00:05:46.570> but<00:05:47.350> you<00:05:47.470> don't<00:05:47.680> want<00:05:47.919> to<00:05:48.040> keep

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
valve opening but you don't want to keep

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.070 
valve opening but you don't want to keep
the<00:05:48.370> weight<00:05:48.550> on<00:05:48.760> the<00:05:48.940> track<00:05:49.150> ball<00:05:49.390> or<00:05:49.750> it<00:05:49.930> will

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
the weight on the track ball or it will

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.710 
the weight on the track ball or it will
slow<00:05:50.380> or<00:05:50.560> stop<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:50.890> valve<00:05:51.220> closing<00:05:51.729> again<00:05:51.970> so

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
slow or stop the valve closing again so

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.510 
slow or stop the valve closing again so
it's<00:05:52.900> good<00:05:53.080> to<00:05:53.110> have<00:05:53.350> some<00:05:53.650> way<00:05:53.830> to<00:05:53.860> finally

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
it's good to have some way to finally

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.180 
it's good to have some way to finally
adjust<00:05:54.850> how<00:05:55.090> far<00:05:55.419> the<00:05:55.570> weight<00:05:55.720> drops<00:05:56.190> I've

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
adjust how far the weight drops I've

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.800 
adjust how far the weight drops I've
used<00:05:57.490> a<00:05:57.610> threaded<00:05:57.970> bolt<00:05:58.210> to<00:05:58.390> carry<00:05:58.630> the

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
used a threaded bolt to carry the

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.600 
used a threaded bolt to carry the
weights<00:05:59.020> so<00:05:59.500> the<00:05:59.650> base<00:05:59.800> nut<00:06:00.100> makes<00:06:00.400> this

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
weights so the base nut makes this

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:34.860 
weights so the base nut makes this
adjustment<00:06:01.210> easy

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.930
