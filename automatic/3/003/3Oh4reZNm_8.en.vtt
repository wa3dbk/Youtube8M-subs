today is an update of my aquaponic

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.850 
today is an update of my aquaponic
system<00:00:04.810> with<00:00:05.740> the<00:00:05.950> completion<00:00:06.399> of<00:00:06.640> a<00:00:07.419> major

composed of plastic totes that would

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.230 
composed of plastic totes that would
normally<00:00:26.019> be<00:00:26.170> used<00:00:26.199> under<00:00:26.830> your<00:00:27.009> bed<00:00:27.250> for

registered at about 45 degrees but I've
managed<00:02:59.730> to<00:03:00.290> get<00:03:01.290> good<00:03:01.650> growth<00:03:01.980> on<00:03:02.250> my<00:03:02.460> plants

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
managed to get good growth on my plants

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.230 
managed to get good growth on my plants
they<00:03:04.740> are<00:03:04.770> starting<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.460> kind<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.820> take<00:03:06.030> off

they are starting to kind of take off

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.880 
they are starting to kind of take off
now<00:03:06.980> they<00:03:07.980> were<00:03:08.040> started<00:03:08.520> from<00:03:08.700> seed<00:03:09.000> about

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
now they were started from seed about

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.450 
now they were started from seed about
three<00:03:10.890> weeks<00:03:11.100> ago

I<00:03:17.430> still<00:03:18.300> do<00:03:18.570> not<00:03:18.600> have<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:19.110> great<00:03:19.500> deal<00:03:19.770> of

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
I still do not have a great deal of

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.620 
I still do not have a great deal of

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
nitrogen cycle completion although

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.690 
nitrogen cycle completion although
obviously<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.940> must<00:03:27.180> be<00:03:27.420> working<00:03:28.070> because<00:03:29.070> I'm

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
obviously it must be working because I'm

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.040 
obviously it must be working because I'm
getting<00:03:29.910> good<00:03:30.210> growth<00:03:30.740> on<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:31.980> plants<00:03:33.050> just

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
getting good growth on the plants just

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.930 
getting good growth on the plants just

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
were taken from essentially my nursery

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.310 
were taken from essentially my nursery
and<00:03:42.110> planted<00:03:43.110> into<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.880> deep<00:03:44.880> water

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
and planted into the deep water

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.350 
and planted into the deep water
aquaculture<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.970> would<00:03:48.630> swear<00:03:48.990> that<00:03:50.360> the

aquaculture and I would swear that the
tomatoes<00:03:51.900> have<00:03:51.930> nearly<00:03:52.530> doubled<00:03:52.800> in<00:03:53.100> size<00:03:53.630> the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
tomatoes have nearly doubled in size the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.730 
tomatoes have nearly doubled in size the
chard<00:03:55.200> has<00:03:55.740> nearly<00:03:56.430> doubled<00:03:56.550> in<00:03:56.970> size<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:58.370> the

down here cabbage has nearly doubled in
size<00:04:06.690> just<00:04:07.550> overnight<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:09.330> things<00:04:09.900> are

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
size just overnight so things are

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.670
