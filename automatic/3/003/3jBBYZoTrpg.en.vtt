00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
put a spinning rod in my hand I get like

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.959 
put a spinning rod in my hand I get like
line<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.689> that's<00:00:33.050> how<00:00:33.170> I<00:00:33.200> catch<00:00:33.500> those<00:00:33.710> fish

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969

specifically drop-shotting you know drop
shotting<00:00:36.440> for<00:00:36.740> me<00:00:36.860> has<00:00:37.490> become<00:00:37.670> one<00:00:38.030> of<00:00:38.060> my

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
shotting for me has become one of my

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.300 
shotting for me has become one of my
classic<00:00:38.780> techniques<00:00:39.290> when<00:00:39.890> things<00:00:40.160> are

classic techniques when things are
really<00:00:40.460> tough<00:00:40.760> well<00:00:41.480> there's<00:00:41.630> a<00:00:41.690> new<00:00:41.930> hook<00:00:42.170> out

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
really tough well there's a new hook out

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.130 
really tough well there's a new hook out
by<00:00:42.560> BMC<00:00:42.890> called<00:00:43.400> a<00:00:43.460> spin<00:00:43.760> shot<00:00:44.030> that's<00:00:44.720> kind<00:00:45.050> of

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
by BMC called a spin shot that's kind of

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.470 
by BMC called a spin shot that's kind of
going<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.410> solve<00:00:45.710> some<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:46.340> problems<00:00:46.880> with

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
going to solve some of the problems with

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.630 
going to solve some of the problems with
traditional<00:00:47.960> drop<00:00:48.200> shot<00:00:48.440> you<00:00:49.070> know<00:00:49.190> here<00:00:49.520> are

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
traditional drop shot you know here are

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.610 
traditional drop shot you know here are
two<00:00:49.790> of<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.000> big<00:00:50.150> ones<00:00:50.360> for<00:00:50.570> me<00:00:50.690> ones<00:00:51.290> line

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
two of the big ones for me ones line

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.840 
two of the big ones for me ones line
twists<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.160> know<00:00:52.280> one<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.579> biggest

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
twists you know one of the biggest

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.540 
twists you know one of the biggest
problems<00:00:53.360> is<00:00:53.810> I'd<00:00:53.960> always<00:00:54.110> tie<00:00:54.470> that<00:00:54.680> knot<00:00:54.739> try

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
problems is I'd always tie that knot try

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.700 
problems is I'd always tie that knot try
that<00:00:55.760> hook<00:00:55.940> in<00:00:56.120> line<00:00:56.300> I<00:00:56.329> dropped<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:56.870> down<00:00:57.079> fish

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
that hook in line I dropped it down fish

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.220 
that hook in line I dropped it down fish
in<00:00:57.860> 20<00:00:58.250> 30<00:00:58.460> foot<00:00:58.700> of<00:00:58.820> water<00:00:58.970> after<00:00:59.780> about<00:00:59.960> 10

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
in 20 30 foot of water after about 10

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.990 
in 20 30 foot of water after about 10
casts<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:00.829> can<00:01:00.980> see<00:01:01.160> your<00:01:01.280> line<00:01:01.489> start<00:01:01.940> to

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
casts you can see your line start to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.549 
casts you can see your line start to
twist<00:01:02.239> up<00:01:02.450> it's<00:01:02.840> always<00:01:02.989> been<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.320> problem

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
twist up it's always been a problem

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.319 
twist up it's always been a problem
another<00:01:04.399> problem<00:01:04.519> is<00:01:04.909> your<00:01:05.000> hook<00:01:05.149> up

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
another problem is your hook up

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.090 
another problem is your hook up
percentage<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:06.320> know<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.470> lot<00:01:06.649> of<00:01:06.680> times<00:01:06.920> you

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
percentage you know a lot of times you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.889 
percentage you know a lot of times you
get<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.430> bite<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:08.149> start<00:01:08.450> going<00:01:08.659> with<00:01:08.780> it

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
get that bite you start going with it

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.989 
get that bite you start going with it
you<00:01:08.990> reel<00:01:09.319> and<00:01:09.679> you<00:01:10.310> would<00:01:10.429> never<00:01:10.579> hook<00:01:10.850> up

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:10.999 
you reel and you would never hook up

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:12.550 
you reel and you would never hook up
what<00:01:11.539> would<00:01:11.659> happen<00:01:11.929> is<00:01:12.049> that<00:01:12.079> hope<00:01:12.350> would

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
what would happen is that hope would

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.679 
what would happen is that hope would
kind<00:01:12.770> of<00:01:12.799> be<00:01:12.920> off<00:01:13.069> center<00:01:13.369> would<00:01:13.639> ball<00:01:13.909> up<00:01:14.149> you

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
kind of be off center would ball up you

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.599 
kind of be off center would ball up you
would<00:01:14.840> never<00:01:15.049> get<00:01:15.259> a<00:01:15.289> hook<00:01:15.530> drop<00:01:16.069> driven<00:01:16.429> home

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
would never get a hook drop driven home

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:17.609 
would never get a hook drop driven home
and<00:01:16.789> efficient

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
and efficient

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.120 
and efficient
the<00:01:18.219> new<00:01:18.399> spin<00:01:18.789> shot<00:01:19.500> eliminates<00:01:20.500> both<00:01:20.859> these

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
the new spin shot eliminates both these

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.130 
the new spin shot eliminates both these
problems<00:01:21.549> if<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:21.759> look<00:01:21.939> at<00:01:22.119> it<00:01:22.299> it's<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.929> really

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
problems if you look at it it's a really

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.099 
problems if you look at it it's a really
radical<00:01:23.619> design<00:01:24.070> on<00:01:24.670> on<00:01:25.299> a<00:01:25.329> drop<00:01:25.630> shot<00:01:25.840> hook

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
radical design on on a drop shot hook

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.160 
radical design on on a drop shot hook
it's<00:01:26.920> got<00:01:27.280> an<00:01:27.579> integrated<00:01:27.969> or<00:01:28.569> a<00:01:28.600> built-in

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
it's got an integrated or a built-in

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.370 
it's got an integrated or a built-in
swivel<00:01:30.009> into<00:01:30.609> the<00:01:30.819> eyelet<00:01:31.359> of<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.509> hook<00:01:31.689> so

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
swivel into the eyelet of the hook so

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.809 
swivel into the eyelet of the hook so
basically<00:01:32.770> what<00:01:33.039> that's<00:01:33.250> gonna<00:01:33.399> let<00:01:33.579> you<00:01:33.670> do

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
basically what that's gonna let you do

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.510 
basically what that's gonna let you do
your<00:01:34.119> line<00:01:35.049> is<00:01:35.200> gonna<00:01:35.319> come<00:01:35.590> down<00:01:35.829> tie<00:01:36.219> into

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
your line is gonna come down tie into

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.399 
your line is gonna come down tie into
the<00:01:36.610> top<00:01:36.819> and<00:01:37.090> then<00:01:37.509> your<00:01:37.630> drop<00:01:37.869> leads<00:01:38.140> gonna

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
the top and then your drop leads gonna

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.620 
the top and then your drop leads gonna
tie<00:01:38.619> it<00:01:38.679> to<00:01:38.829> the<00:01:38.920> bottom<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.729> if<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.299> hold

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
tie it to the bottom and if you hold

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.240 
tie it to the bottom and if you hold
that<00:01:40.810> we're<00:01:41.380> going<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.590> see<00:01:41.709> what<00:01:41.859> happens

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
that we're going to see what happens

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.599 
that we're going to see what happens
that<00:01:43.030> hooks<00:01:43.329> gonna<00:01:43.569> be<00:01:43.750> able<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.959> go<00:01:44.609> 360

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
that hooks gonna be able to go 360

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.749 
that hooks gonna be able to go 360
degrees<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:47.079> it's<00:01:47.289> gonna<00:01:47.469> have<00:01:47.740> an<00:01:48.219> access
