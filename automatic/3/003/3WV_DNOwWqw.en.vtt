00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.040
 Apple has announced Carplay, new technology that we can expect in cars later this year. 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.240
 I'm Jake Fisher, I do the auto reviews of Consumer Reports. And I'm Glenn Derene, Electronics Reviewer. 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.480
 First, what is Carplay? Carplay is Apple's first attempt to create a User Interface 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:28.100
 to get in the car. It will work with iPhones and especially the 5, 5c and 5S. 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:36.000
 So where are we going to see it? Volvo has already announced it, Hyundai, Honda, Jaguar, 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Mercedes Benz and even Ferrari. Many other car manufacturers will cooperate. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 What is so interesting about this? 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 We test many cars and user input is usually not really good. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Car manufacturers know how to build engines but they are not very good at user-friendly software, 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.900
 and telephone manufacturers know a lot about it. We also test many telephones and I 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.850
 can tell you that Apple can make user-friendly products. But it's just the question 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.000
 whether they can also do it successfully in a car. And what happens to distractions, 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 does this new interface make us more or less distracted than we already are? The 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 certainly has the potential to make us less distracted, and I'll tell you why. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 a lot of people use their smartphones behind the wheel, you shouldn't do this. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 But this has the potential to build that smartphone functionality in your car with voice commands. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And what does this mean if you are an Android user? It is not yet completely clear, 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 We assume that you can still use functions such as Bluetooth and hands-free calling but you get it 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 not the full experience that iOS users are going to get. Ultimately you would for example 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 have to choose the operating system of your car just like you do with smartphones. Now that we are talking about an iPhone in your car, there is of course a demand for apps 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 What kind of apps will there be? You will certainly not be able to get all the apps that you also have on your iPhone. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 But probably apps like iTunes, your contacts, messages, Apple Maps. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Apple doesn't really have the best map program there is, do I necessarily have to use Apple maps? 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Apple maps is certainly not the best, it is not Google maps. But I don't expect that 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 that you can download any map app that you want. Not everyone can make an app just like that 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 for this device, so don't expect Angry Birds, no Candy Crush, no Cut the Rope, no Minecraft, no Fruit Ninja. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Ninja fruit.
