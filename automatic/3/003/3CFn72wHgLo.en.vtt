00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.190
 bollywood and his movies full of 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.049
 music dance colors shines women 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.389
 of the india we see in the movies 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.300

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.640
 great divine jewelry dresses 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.010
 beautiful and in that we are inspired to 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.349
 do this tutorial let's do a 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.420
 fabulous eye makeup we're going to 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.029
 concentrate on the eyes and for a 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.310
 Perfect finish to this makeup I will 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.620
 put some pieces of tape 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.690
 very carefully if necessary 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.180
 Take it off a bit with your hand in glue 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.370
 so you do not get hurt and put it on 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.800
 direction towards the end of your eyebrows 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.539
 let's start by creating a base in the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.260
 depth of our eyes with the 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.690
 twist eyeliner in brown fusion 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.059
 to make up our eyes we're going to 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.800
 guide always by the tape that we put 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.510
 at the end of the eyes so if 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.820
 we make up a little bit does not matter 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.969
 For just going to stay there that 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.420
 line that will create the ribbon finally 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.369
 and we will place on the tile and with 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.100
 careful not to stain elsewhere 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.049
 but as I'm doing as 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.119
 they are looking under the eyelashes 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.490
 lower almost until the end of 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.610
 the eyes and over in the depth of 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.380
 the eyes are also very marked 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.380
 share pain for so much 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.710
 I will run the color with a brush to 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.700
 give it a better shape for the step that 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.770
 it comes right afterwards from below 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.000
 from this next step that it comes to 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.190
 put a little bit of base in the rest of the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.350
 eyelid on the mobile eyelid where no 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.200
 we apply coffee pencil there we are going to put 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.649

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.920

 just above the pencil that we apply 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.990
 previously so with a brush I'll 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.910
