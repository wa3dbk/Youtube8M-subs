kind of mental the mini to stand on it

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.630 
kind of mental the mini to stand on it
cause<00:00:33.780> it'll<00:00:33.989> really<00:00:34.140> work<00:00:34.280> I'll<00:00:35.280> see<00:00:35.489> that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
cause it'll really work I'll see that

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.209 
cause it'll really work I'll see that
one's<00:00:35.820> been<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.600> cut<00:00:37.230> quite<00:00:37.680> quite<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
one's been going to cut quite quite a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.920 
one's been going to cut quite quite a
while<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> wars<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
while because all the wars in the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.950 
while because all the wars in the
governmental<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:41.309> I'll<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.270> cover<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.780> one

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
governmental so I'll just cover this one

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.220 
governmental so I'll just cover this one
up<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.340> we<00:00:44.340> can<00:00:44.579> rebuild<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.989> another

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
up and we can rebuild it at another

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.420 
up and we can rebuild it at another
location<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> i<00:00:48.989> think<00:00:49.800> we'll<00:00:49.980> build<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.250> one

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
location so i think we'll build this one

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.970 
location so i think we'll build this one
here<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.789> we'll<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> 3<00:00:51.629> by<00:00:51.780> 3<00:00:51.809> 1<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> did

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
here and we'll do a 3 by 3 1 like I did

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.600 
here and we'll do a 3 by 3 1 like I did
on<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.610> other<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.829> need<00:00:55.829> three<00:00:56.250> by<00:00:56.399> three

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
on the other one so need three by three

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.900 
on the other one so need three by three
hole<00:00:56.850> oops<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:58.079> then<00:00:58.430> basically<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.640> dig<00:00:59.789> it

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
hole oops and then basically to dig it

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.340 
hole oops and then basically to dig it
down<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.149> much<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.660> want<00:01:00.870> I'm<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.230> going

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
down as much as you want I'm just going

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.760 
down as much as you want I'm just going
to<00:01:01.440> get<00:01:01.590> down<00:01:01.829> by<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> it's

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
to get down by you that and so it's

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.740 
to get down by you that and so it's
pretty<00:01:08.040> simple<00:01:08.369> probably<00:01:09.150> some<00:01:09.330> ladders<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
pretty simple probably some ladders to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
pretty simple probably some ladders to
get<00:01:09.869> back<00:01:09.990> how<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.260> you're<00:01:10.350> doing<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.650> in

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
get back how if you're doing it in

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.190 
get back how if you're doing it in
survival<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.570> obviously<00:01:12.570> I'm<00:01:12.689> students<00:01:13.110> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
survival and obviously I'm students and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.719 
survival and obviously I'm students and
creative<00:01:13.530> notes<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:13.920> make<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.340> quick<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.549> you

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
creative notes for make it quick for you

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.380 
creative notes for make it quick for you
guys<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.560> am<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> put<00:01:16.950> water<00:01:17.130> all<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.299> at

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
guys I am going to put water all here at

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.219 
guys I am going to put water all here at
the<00:01:18.450> bottom<00:01:18.920> like<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.920> then<00:01:22.920> basically

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
the bottom like that and then basically

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.679 
the bottom like that and then basically
it's<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:26.189> when<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.640> set<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.299> TNT

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
it's like but when you set of TNT

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.649 
it's like but when you set of TNT
obviously<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.170> falls<00:01:28.380> down<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.420> gravel<00:01:30.420> falls

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
obviously it falls down and gravel falls

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.830 
obviously it falls down and gravel falls
down<00:01:30.960> obviously<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.450> put<00:01:33.630> gravel

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
down obviously and so if you put gravel

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.050 
down obviously and so if you put gravel
on<00:01:34.020> top<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.259> CNT<00:01:34.590> na<00:01:34.770> ignite<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> TNT<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.880> all

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
on top of CNT na ignite the TNT it's all

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.319 
on top of CNT na ignite the TNT it's all
going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.299> fall<00:01:36.509> down<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:37.700> think<00:01:38.700> why<00:01:39.000> need<00:01:39.240> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
going to fall down I think why need to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.190 
going to fall down I think why need to
do<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:43.700> torches<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:45.149> some<00:01:45.659> decoration

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
do here is torches know some decoration

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.840 
do here is torches know some decoration
some<00:01:47.479> put<00:01:48.479> some<00:01:48.590> torches<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:52.579> here<00:01:53.579> we<00:01:53.670> go

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
some put some torches in here here we go

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.610 
some put some torches in here here we go
and<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.759> pump<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.149> all<00:01:57.299> fixed

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
and then we can pump it's all fixed

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.790 
and then we can pump it's all fixed
so<00:01:59.550> let's<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.760> fill<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.410> this<00:02:01.410> one<00:02:01.650> I

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
so let's just fill it up this one I

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.870 
so let's just fill it up this one I
don't<00:02:01.980> think<00:02:02.220> it's<00:02:02.370> going<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.760> much

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
don't think it's going to do that much

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.770 
don't think it's going to do that much
doctors<00:02:03.300> not<00:02:03.510> really<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:03.950> long<00:02:04.950> down<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:06.180> I

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
doctors not really that long down but I

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.660 
doctors not really that long down but I
remember<00:02:07.470> me<00:02:07.590> our<00:02:07.800> friends<00:02:08.160> did<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.490> on<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
remember me our friends did this on a

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.700 
remember me our friends did this on a
server<00:02:08.970> once<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:09.780> dug<00:02:10.020> all<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.350> way<00:02:10.560> down

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
server once and we dug all the way down

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.070 
server once and we dug all the way down
to<00:02:10.740> bedrock<00:02:11.010> because<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.550> had<00:02:11.730> up<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.690> then<00:02:12.960> we

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
to bedrock because we had up and then we

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.960 
to bedrock because we had up and then we
just<00:02:13.230> spawn<00:02:13.590> trapped<00:02:13.950> some<00:02:14.190> guy<00:02:14.220> was<00:02:14.730> pretty

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
just spawn trapped some guy was pretty

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.230 
just spawn trapped some guy was pretty
funny<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:17.250> he<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:17.580> went<00:02:17.730> under<00:02:17.850> bedrock

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
funny and and he just went under bedrock

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.400 
funny and and he just went under bedrock
when<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.420> get<00:02:18.570> formed<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:18.990> because<00:02:19.170> he<00:02:19.290> was

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
when you get formed on because he was

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.310 
when you get formed on because he was
obviously<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.770> survival<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:22.170> might

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
obviously in survival and and you might

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.650 
obviously in survival and and you might
see<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.680> diamond<00:02:23.400> block<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:24.030> my<00:02:24.330> inventory

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
see this diamond block in my inventory

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.690 
see this diamond block in my inventory
now<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.230> no<00:02:25.380> way<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.680> make<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.100> trap<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> little

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
now I no way to make this trap a little

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.240 
now I no way to make this trap a little
bit<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.060> bit<00:02:27.330> more<00:02:27.540> like<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:28.710> compete<00:02:29.070> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
bit a bit more like in compete and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.410 
bit a bit more like in compete and
inconspicuous<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.780> think<00:02:31.050> that's<00:02:31.170> word<00:02:31.410> yeah

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
inconspicuous I think that's word yeah

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.040 
inconspicuous I think that's word yeah
if<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.840> do<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:35.150> people<00:02:36.150> go<00:02:36.270> oh<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.480> want<00:02:36.840> Matt

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
if you do that people go oh I want Matt

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.780 
if you do that people go oh I want Matt
and<00:02:37.290> they<00:02:37.530> won't<00:02:37.770> think<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.250> look<00:02:38.280> down<00:02:38.580> here

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
and they won't think to look down here

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.790 
and they won't think to look down here
because<00:02:39.000> if<00:02:39.120> you're<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.450> stone<00:02:40.080> floor<00:02:40.440> maybe

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
because if you're on stone floor maybe

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.950 
because if you're on stone floor maybe
just<00:02:40.980> make<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> stone<00:02:41.490> floor<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.780> put

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
just make a stone floor and then put

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.290 
just make a stone floor and then put
stone<00:02:43.140> crusher<00:02:43.380> place<00:02:43.590> then<00:02:43.800> it's<00:02:43.920> kind<00:02:44.100> of

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
stone crusher place then it's kind of

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.570 
stone crusher place then it's kind of
from<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.330> fire<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:45.930> kind<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.260> hard<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.010> see<00:02:47.370> if

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
from a fire it's kind of hard to see if

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.950 
from a fire it's kind of hard to see if
you're<00:02:47.730> concentrating<00:02:48.030> on<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.330> diamond<00:02:48.750> block

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
you're concentrating on a diamond block

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.760 
you're concentrating on a diamond block
so<00:02:49.950> oh<00:02:50.570> well<00:02:51.570> no<00:02:51.870> I'll<00:02:52.110> mind<00:02:52.500> they<00:02:52.680> are<00:02:52.860> and

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
so oh well no I'll mind they are and

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.640 
so oh well no I'll mind they are and
then<00:02:55.770> just<00:02:56.070> kind<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.340> explodes<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:57.030> that's

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
then just kind of explodes but that's

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.310 
then just kind of explodes but that's
yeah<00:02:58.820> maybe<00:02:59.820> we<00:03:00.090> should<00:03:00.120> have<00:03:00.420> put<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.900> water

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
yeah maybe we should have put the water

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.190 
yeah maybe we should have put the water
a<00:03:01.500> bit<00:03:01.800> further<00:03:02.040> down<00:03:02.190> but<00:03:02.790> oh<00:03:03.060> well<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.930> didn't
