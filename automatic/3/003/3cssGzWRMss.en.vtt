00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
couple holes inside there but I fed it

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.620 
couple holes inside there but I fed it
through<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.970> that<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.090> can<00:04:36.210> get<00:04:36.330> up<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.449> our

connectors go ahead and plug them in

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.460 
connectors go ahead and plug them in
just<00:05:23.280> like<00:05:23.370> we<00:05:23.460> had<00:05:23.639> done<00:05:23.789> previously<00:05:24.470> then
