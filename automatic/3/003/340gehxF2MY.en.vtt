the<00:00:11.759> home<00:00:11.940> run<00:00:12.179> swing<00:00:13.910> just<00:00:14.910> kind<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.210> looking

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
the home run swing just kind of looking

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.120 
the home run swing just kind of looking
at<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> mechanics<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.350> he<00:00:16.560> uses<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
at the mechanics that he uses in the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.790 
at the mechanics that he uses in the
epstein<00:00:17.960> principles<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.109> come<00:00:19.350> into<00:00:19.529> his

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
epstein principles that come into his

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
epstein principles that come into his
swing<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:22.250> positions<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.340> he<00:00:23.580> gets

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
swing and the positions that he gets

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.689 
swing and the positions that he gets
himself<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.689> transfer<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.830> power<00:00:25.890> he's<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
himself in to transfer that power he's a

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.950 
himself in to transfer that power he's a
big<00:00:26.939> boy<00:00:27.180> but<00:00:29.179> transfers<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.300> power<00:00:30.539> ended

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
big boy but transfers that power ended

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.400 
big boy but transfers that power ended
it<00:00:31.080> swing<00:00:31.410> ok<00:00:32.070> keep<00:00:32.489> his<00:00:32.910> hands<00:00:33.270> back<00:00:33.540> coming

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
it swing ok keep his hands back coming

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.900 
it swing ok keep his hands back coming
through<00:00:34.760> clearly<00:00:35.760> rotating<00:00:37.430> not<00:00:38.430> moving

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
through clearly rotating not moving

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.040 
through clearly rotating not moving
forward<00:00:40.160> he<00:00:41.160> steps<00:00:41.489> he<00:00:41.879> makes<00:00:42.120> his<00:00:42.329> stride<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
forward he steps he makes his stride and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.770 
forward he steps he makes his stride and
then<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.940> point<00:00:45.270> he<00:00:45.660> starts<00:00:45.989> rotating

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
then at that point he starts rotating

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.920 
then at that point he starts rotating
right<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.020> kind<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.770> looking<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.930> just

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
right here kind of looking at the just

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.439 
right here kind of looking at the just
where<00:00:52.110> he's<00:00:52.199> touching<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:53.910> how<00:00:54.059> far

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
where he's touching you can see how far

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.160 
where he's touching you can see how far
back<00:00:54.840> his<00:00:55.469> hands<00:00:55.829> are<00:00:56.690> right<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.960> area

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
back his hands are right in this area

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.330 
back his hands are right in this area
look<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.160> his<00:00:59.280> bad<00:00:59.489> angle<00:01:00.739> looking<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
look at his bad angle looking at the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.119 
look at his bad angle looking at the
length<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.850> his<00:01:03.000> stride<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:04.110> again<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.949> can

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
length of his stride and again you can

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.920 
length of his stride and again you can
either<00:01:05.250> stride<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.030> position<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:06.720> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
either stride to that position or you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.280 
either stride to that position or you
can<00:01:07.110> stay<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.500> position<00:01:08.780> but<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.170> can

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
can stay in that position but you can

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.730 
can stay in that position but you can
see<00:01:10.439> once<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.860> plant<00:01:11.689> hands<00:01:12.689> are<00:01:12.869> back<00:01:13.049> now

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
see once you plant hands are back now

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.940 
see once you plant hands are back now
we're<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> draw<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> line<00:01:14.630> right<00:01:15.950> up

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
we're going to draw a line right up

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.050 
we're going to draw a line right up
through<00:01:18.979> ok<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.250> you're<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.520> watch<00:01:20.729> as

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
through ok and you're going to watch as

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.870 
through ok and you're going to watch as
he<00:01:21.479> rotates<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.500> hips<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.830> shoulder<00:01:26.310> look<00:01:26.729> at

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
he rotates the hips the shoulder look at

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.510 
he rotates the hips the shoulder look at
that<00:01:27.000> how<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> bat<00:01:27.570> stays<00:01:27.960> right<00:01:28.560> up<00:01:28.890> next<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that how the bat stays right up next to

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
how his back elbow slots into next to

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.679 
how his back elbow slots into next to
his<00:01:36.570> side<00:01:36.920> ok<00:01:37.950> keeping<00:01:38.729> his<00:01:38.850> hands<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.299> nice

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
his side ok keeping his hands in nice

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.770 
his side ok keeping his hands in nice
and<00:01:39.930> tight<00:01:40.200> right<00:01:41.299> up<00:01:42.299> against<00:01:42.630> his<00:01:42.750> shoulder

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and tight right up against his shoulder

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.300 
and tight right up against his shoulder
like<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:45.030> he's<00:01:45.659> rotating<00:01:46.439> about<00:01:47.070> that

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
like that and he's rotating about that

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.600 
like that and he's rotating about that
axis<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.119> order<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.950> transfer<00:01:49.950> all<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.399> that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
axis in order to transfer all of that

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.120 
axis in order to transfer all of that
power<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:51.960> he's<00:01:52.110> got<00:01:52.290> stored<00:01:52.680> up<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.530 
power that he's got stored up on that
back<00:01:53.310> leg<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:54.540> rotating<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> around<00:01:55.790> ok

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.710 

and<00:02:00.930> then<00:02:01.230> you<00:02:01.350> got<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.620> look<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:05.250> line

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
and then you got to look at the line

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.550 
and then you got to look at the line
that<00:02:06.720> he's<00:02:06.930> got<00:02:07.280> from<00:02:11.300> here<00:02:12.300> back<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.140> his<00:02:13.350> head

that he's got from here back to his head

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.420 
that he's got from here back to his head
now<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:13.890> isn't<00:02:14.220> isn't<00:02:15.210> shot<00:02:15.630> exactly

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
now this isn't isn't shot exactly

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.830 
now this isn't isn't shot exactly
straight<00:02:17.430> from<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> side<00:02:18.030> it's<00:02:18.540> about<00:02:18.690> as

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
straight from the side it's about as

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.900 
straight from the side it's about as
good<00:02:18.900> as<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.200> can<00:02:19.320> get<00:02:19.500> at<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.770> major<00:02:20.640> league

game but you can see where his head is
back<00:02:22.920> behind<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:24.930> his<00:02:25.050> hands<00:02:25.320> coming
