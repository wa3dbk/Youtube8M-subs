00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
basically right when you spawn you can

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.760 
basically right when you spawn you can
see<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> enemy<00:00:53.550> across<00:00:53.879> from<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.590> again<00:00:55.590> I'm

I would love to see kill assists in the
game<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:40.700> help<00:01:40.960> further<00:01:41.960> not<00:01:42.830> just<00:01:43.040> getting

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
game to help further not just getting

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.800 
game to help further not just getting
killed<00:01:43.700> but<00:01:43.940> getting<00:01:44.120> kills<00:01:44.390> this<00:01:44.600> and

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
killed but getting kills this and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.390 
killed but getting kills this and
actually<00:01:44.930> having<00:01:45.710> stats<00:01:45.980> carryover<00:01:48.400> and

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
actually having stats carryover and

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.250 
actually having stats carryover and
again<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.940> rocket<00:01:50.270> launcher<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.870> very

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
again the rocket launcher is very

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.980 
again the rocket launcher is very
expensive<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:53.090> as<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.270> flamethrower<00:01:53.510> I<00:01:53.810> had

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
expensive so as the flamethrower I had

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.100 
expensive so as the flamethrower I had
nearly<00:01:54.230> thousand<00:01:55.100> coins<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.730> down<00:01:56.270> like<00:01:56.510> 250
