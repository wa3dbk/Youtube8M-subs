00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.580
 there he is stealing the ball trying 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.000
 put it for sardinero the midfield 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.210
 because there is a penalty 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.070
 there is a favorable penalty 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.780
 to Hercules possibility of the second goal 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.200
 for the team 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.200
 herculano amarillo for david mateos 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.890
 and we see what a fantastic inner ball and 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.660
 how mateos is crossed at the end 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.850
 probable of penalty but it is a penalty 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.100
 very absurd not because I think that 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.200
 slides mateos and effectively ends 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.420
 knocking down the sardine 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.710
 well then let's see why he has the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.530
 possibility of the hercules to mark the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.160
 second and to put a little bit of earth 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.180
 in between in this match 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.180
 of the eighth day 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.870
 Well, look here because there goes the Hercules 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.020
 for marked in mÃ©rida 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.220
 the party does it in the 29th minute 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.060
 to put the 2 to 0 on the scoreboard 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.539
 there we see it 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 left leg just a lot of the ball 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.910
 very little is raised to that ball at 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.910
 fran merida bonus 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.220
 touching the ball
