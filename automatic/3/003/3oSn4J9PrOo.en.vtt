don't worry we're gonna take us apart

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.379 
don't worry we're gonna take us apart
just<00:05:04.750> like<00:05:04.900> we<00:05:05.020> took<00:05:05.169> apart<00:05:05.469> the<00:05:06.280> previous<00:05:07.180> two

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
just like we took apart the previous two

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:17.129 
just like we took apart the previous two
measures<00:05:07.719> but<00:05:07.870> listed<00:05:12.509> 5<00:05:13.509> 5<00:05:14.469> 4<00:05:16.020> 3

measures but listed 5 5 4 3
okay<00:05:17.889> now<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.490> alternate<00:05:19.180> again<00:05:19.509> if<00:05:19.750> you<00:05:19.930> if

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
okay now the alternate again if you if

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.080 
okay now the alternate again if you if
your<00:05:21.009> hand<00:05:21.219> isn't<00:05:21.550> comfortable<00:05:21.849> with<00:05:22.000> the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
your hand isn't comfortable with the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.409 
your hand isn't comfortable with the
fours<00:05:22.419> 1<00:05:22.990> 4<00:05:23.319> &amp;<00:05:23.440> 5<00:05:23.650> don't<00:05:24.460> worry<00:05:24.699> the<00:05:24.940> fives<00:05:25.210> are

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
fours 1 4 &amp; 5 don't worry the fives are

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.800 
fours 1 4 &amp; 5 don't worry the fives are
probably<00:05:25.690> easier<00:05:25.990> for<00:05:26.110> you<00:05:26.169> then<00:05:26.289> to<00:05:27.279> do<00:05:27.400> this

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
probably easier for you then to do this

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.409 
probably easier for you then to do this
5<00:05:29.279> 5<00:05:30.279> 5<00:05:30.819> 5

the<00:05:31.599> only<00:05:31.750> thing<00:05:31.930> you<00:05:31.990> would<00:05:32.050> have<00:05:32.199> to<00:05:32.259> change

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
the only thing you would have to change

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.249 
the only thing you would have to change
is<00:05:32.830> that<00:05:33.330> because<00:05:34.330> you<00:05:34.810> don't<00:05:34.960> want<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.139> give

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
is that because you don't want to give

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.320 
is that because you don't want to give
your<00:05:35.349> hand<00:05:35.560> to<00:05:35.710> scrunched<00:05:36.400> up<00:05:36.520> here<00:05:36.940> the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
your hand to scrunched up here the

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.790 
your hand to scrunched up here the
alternate<00:05:37.750> finger<00:05:37.990> would<00:05:38.110> be<00:05:38.259> to<00:05:38.500> kind<00:05:38.710> of

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
alternate finger would be to kind of

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.610 
alternate finger would be to kind of
switch<00:05:39.039> them<00:05:39.279> to<00:05:39.310> a<00:05:39.430> 3<00:05:40.089> instead<00:05:40.930> of<00:05:40.990> say<00:05:41.469> up<00:05:41.589> to

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
switch them to a 3 instead of say up to

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.230 
switch them to a 3 instead of say up to
this<00:05:41.800> point<00:05:42.039> we've<00:05:42.250> been<00:05:42.279> using<00:05:42.580> fives<00:05:42.940> and

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
this point we've been using fives and

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.329 
this point we've been using fives and
twos<00:05:44.159> okay<00:05:45.159> we<00:05:45.729> want<00:05:45.940> to<00:05:46.000> switch<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.389> a<00:05:46.419> 3<00:05:47.339> and

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:48.339 
twos okay we want to switch to a 3 and

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:52.279 
twos okay we want to switch to a 3 and
then<00:05:49.029> do<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:49.419> five<00:05:49.979> four<00:05:50.979> okay

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
then do the five four okay

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.740 
then do the five four okay
so<00:05:53.289> you<00:05:53.379> can<00:05:53.889> see<00:05:54.339> the<00:05:54.520> transition<00:05:55.000> slowly

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
so you can see the transition slowly

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.640 
so you can see the transition slowly
moving<00:05:56.610> to<00:05:58.860> 3<00:05:59.860> then<00:06:00.699> 5<00:06:01.150> 4<00:06:01.779> i'm<00:06:02.110> didn't<00:06:02.469> draw<00:06:02.620> it

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
moving to 3 then 5 4 i'm didn't draw it

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.930 
moving to 3 then 5 4 i'm didn't draw it
in<00:06:02.800> the<00:06:02.889> right<00:06:03.009> place<00:06:03.219> suppose<00:06:03.789> we<00:06:03.909> can<00:06:04.089> hear

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
in the right place suppose we can hear

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.519 
in the right place suppose we can hear
now<00:06:06.940> if<00:06:07.449> your<00:06:07.629> hands<00:06:07.779> not<00:06:07.930> big<00:06:08.169> enough<00:06:08.199> for

now if your hands not big enough for

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:12.370 
now if your hands not big enough for
this<00:06:08.759> 5<00:06:09.759> 4<00:06:10.210> you<00:06:10.839> can<00:06:11.020> do<00:06:11.229> this

five three like that okay

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.440 
five three like that okay
I'll<00:06:24.260> take<00:06:24.650> this<00:06:24.770> apart<00:06:25.160> I<00:06:25.340> think<00:06:25.550> next<00:06:25.790> lesson

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
I'll take this apart I think next lesson

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.600 
I'll take this apart I think next lesson
and<00:06:26.630> we'll<00:06:27.200> work<00:06:27.470> on<00:06:27.680> just<00:06:28.070> some<00:06:28.280> of<00:06:28.430> this

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
and we'll work on just some of this

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.420 
and we'll work on just some of this
right-hand<00:06:29.600> portion<00:06:29.840> by<00:06:30.170> itself<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:31.130> you<00:06:31.310> can

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
right-hand portion by itself so you can

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.490 
right-hand portion by itself so you can
get<00:06:31.550> more<00:06:31.730> comfortable<00:06:32.000> with<00:06:32.240> okay<00:06:32.660> and<00:06:32.930> then

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
get more comfortable with okay and then

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.570 
get more comfortable with okay and then
