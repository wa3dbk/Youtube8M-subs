mean<00:02:29.960> to<00:02:30.960> see<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:32.390> personally<00:02:33.390> would<00:02:33.900> actually

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
mean to see I personally would actually

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.620 
mean to see I personally would actually
think<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:35.070> white<00:02:35.520> pants<00:02:35.940> would<00:02:36.240> look<00:02:36.420> better

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
think that white pants would look better

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.810 
think that white pants would look better
under<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.440> just<00:02:37.680> because<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.160> think<00:02:38.580> that's

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
under this just because I think that's

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.500 
under this just because I think that's
kind<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.510> mean<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.260> does<00:02:40.410> look<00:02:40.440> cute<00:02:40.890> but<00:02:40.920> I

kind of I mean it does look cute but I

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.990 
kind of I mean it does look cute but I
mean<00:02:42.510> what<00:02:43.130> panties<00:02:44.130> would<00:02:44.370> match<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.880> ribbon

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
mean what panties would match the ribbon
