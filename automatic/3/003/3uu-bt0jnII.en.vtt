we're just gonna start working the style

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.839 
we're just gonna start working the style
from<00:04:46.229> scratch

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:57.420 

this<00:04:51.849> is<00:04:51.970> make<00:04:52.150> sure<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.300> easy<00:04:52.599> to<00:04:52.720> cut<00:04:56.430> we

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
this is make sure that easy to cut we

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.610 
this is make sure that easy to cut we
got<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.610> problem<00:04:57.880> here<00:04:58.120> we<00:04:58.810> realize<00:04:59.229> that<00:04:59.259> it's

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
got a problem here we realize that it's

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.080 
got a problem here we realize that it's
turning<00:04:59.949> it<00:05:00.039> the<00:05:00.069> wrong<00:05:00.310> way<00:05:00.539> yeah<00:05:03.090> we're

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
turning it the wrong way yeah we're

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.210 
turning it the wrong way yeah we're
gonna<00:05:04.180> do<00:05:04.360> now<00:05:04.599> what<00:05:05.259> Nick's<00:05:05.560> doing<00:05:05.919> is<00:05:06.069> he's

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
gonna do now what Nick's doing is he's

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.580 
gonna do now what Nick's doing is he's
gonna<00:05:06.310> weld<00:05:06.669> that<00:05:06.910> wheel<00:05:07.210> so<00:05:07.870> there's<00:05:08.020> no<00:05:08.199> free

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
gonna weld that wheel so there's no free

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.350 
gonna weld that wheel so there's no free
will<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:08.979> we<00:05:09.099> can<00:05:09.250> actually<00:05:09.430> run<00:05:09.940> this<00:05:10.120> thing

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
will so we can actually run this thing

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.149 
will so we can actually run this thing
backwards

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.070
