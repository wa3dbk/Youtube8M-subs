00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
tools is just to add its because then

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.559 
tools is just to add its because then
because<00:02:08.429> technically<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.119> your<00:02:09.149> Google

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
because technically it's your Google

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.210 
because technically it's your Google

well<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> bit<00:02:11.670> confusing<00:02:11.730> but

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
well it's a bit confusing but

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.869 
well it's a bit confusing but
if<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.379> add<00:02:13.560> your<00:02:13.590> site<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.010> here<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.580> if

it's already been added to the sort of

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.830 
it's already been added to the sort of
weird<00:02:31.860> bit<00:02:32.129> just<00:02:32.430> go<00:02:32.549> out<00:02:32.670> site<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.599> is<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
weird bit just go out site this is the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.119 
weird bit just go out site this is the
opposite<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.170> many<00:02:34.319> way<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.560> doing<00:02:34.799> it<00:02:34.920> I

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
opposite the many way of doing it I

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.979 
opposite the many way of doing it I
think<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.760> continue<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.660> because<00:02:36.870> it's

think you continue and because it's
already<00:02:37.110> verified<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.950> do<00:02:38.280> anything

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
already verified in I do anything

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.059 
already verified in I do anything
