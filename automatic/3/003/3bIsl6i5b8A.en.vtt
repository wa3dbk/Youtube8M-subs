and the magnet field see how it's going

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.460 
and the magnet field see how it's going
to<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.500> ends<00:00:43.040> it's<00:00:43.640> it's<00:00:44.090> drawn<00:00:44.990> it<00:00:45.140> the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
to the ends it's it's drawn it the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.790 
to the ends it's it's drawn it the
positive<00:00:46.070> field<00:00:46.400> out<00:00:46.700> to<00:00:47.060> the<00:00:47.210> ends<00:00:49.120> and<00:00:50.800> it

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
positive field out to the ends and it

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
positive field out to the ends and it
starts<00:00:52.160> to<00:00:52.309> do<00:00:52.489> a<00:00:52.630> swirling<00:00:53.630> motion<00:00:54.400> like<00:00:55.400> a<00:00:55.430> v8

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
starts to do a swirling motion like a v8

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.690 
starts to do a swirling motion like a v8
see<00:00:56.420> right<00:00:56.660> there<00:00:59.830> it<00:01:00.830> does<00:01:01.129> it<00:01:01.280> everywhere

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
see right there it does it everywhere

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.469 
see right there it does it everywhere
like<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.970> little<00:01:02.390> tornados<00:01:03.820> this<00:01:04.820> water<00:01:05.180> is

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
like a little tornados this water is

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.590 
like a little tornados this water is
actually<00:01:05.869> seeding<00:01:06.830> very<00:01:07.460> good<00:01:10.210> see<00:01:11.210> all<00:01:11.420> the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
actually seeding very good see all the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.900 
actually seeding very good see all the
swirling<00:01:12.200> action<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:16.100> lets<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:16.490> know<00:01:16.520> that

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
swirling action that lets you know that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.600 
swirling action that lets you know that
the<00:01:17.000> water<00:01:17.180> is<00:01:17.420> seeding<00:01:17.930> that<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.800> is<00:01:18.979> in<00:01:19.280> stage

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
the water is seeding that it is in stage

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.639

off this little white foam it stays on

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.749 
off this little white foam it stays on
the<00:01:28.250> cell<00:01:28.550> you<00:01:28.930> know<00:01:29.930> for<00:01:30.170> hours<00:01:30.680> if<00:01:31.399> I<00:01:31.550> don't

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
the cell you know for hours if I don't

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.200 
the cell you know for hours if I don't
run<00:01:31.940> it<00:01:32.119> again<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:33.740> doesn't<00:01:34.100> dissipate<00:01:34.729> it

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
run it again it doesn't dissipate it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:45.889 
run it again it doesn't dissipate it
stays<00:01:35.660> like<00:01:35.930> that<00:01:40.000> but<00:01:41.000> isn't<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:41.360> beautiful

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.880 

this<00:01:46.469> cell<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.100> actually<00:01:48.200> pretty<00:01:49.200> awesome

it's<00:01:50.250> charging<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.179> water<00:01:51.679> beautifully<00:01:53.210> with

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
it's charging the water beautifully with

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.480 
it's charging the water beautifully with
that<00:01:54.259> special<00:01:55.259> rare<00:01:55.500> earth<00:01:55.799> metal<00:01:56.219> that's

that special rare earth metal that's
inside<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.390> center<00:01:57.869> core<00:01:58.200> there<00:02:00.140> see<00:02:01.140> it's

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
inside the center core there see it's

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.679 
inside the center core there see it's
covering<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.829> whole<00:02:02.719> top<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:04.319> white<00:02:04.560> foam

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
power off now what happens it does flash

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.949 
power off now what happens it does flash
points<00:02:36.590> see<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.709> still<00:02:38.010> spins<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:39.450> foam<00:02:39.690> just

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
points see it still spins the foam just

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.780 
points see it still spins the foam just
hangs<00:02:40.260> out<00:02:43.340> wow<00:02:45.019> this<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.260> actually<00:02:46.790> looking
