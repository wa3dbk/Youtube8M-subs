00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
need it we need to build what we have to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.160 
need it we need to build what we have to
build<00:02:36.409> starting<00:02:37.409> from<00:02:37.790> not<00:02:38.790> Dero<00:02:39.180> but<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:41.030> I

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
build starting from not Dero but and I

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.069 
build starting from not Dero but and I
think<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.549> club<00:02:44.549> is<00:02:44.939> it's<00:02:45.420> not<00:02:45.629> only<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
think a club is it's not only the

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.860 
think a club is it's not only the
manager<00:02:46.379> it's<00:02:46.950> all<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> people<00:02:47.489> around<00:02:47.970> and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
manager it's all the people around and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.890 
manager it's all the people around and
certainly<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.680> spirit<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.519> sphere<00:02:50.900> creating

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
certainly the spirit the sphere creating

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.729 
certainly the spirit the sphere creating
by<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.109> fence

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
by the fence

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.819 
by the fence
so<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.909> course<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.989> need<00:02:55.019> everybody

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829
