able<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.870> thread<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.709> through<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.190> two<00:03:53.400> teeth

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
able to thread it through the two teeth

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.800 
able to thread it through the two teeth
that<00:03:53.700> are<00:03:54.350> together<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.799> go<00:03:56.579> underneath<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
that are together and go underneath the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.640 
that are together and go underneath the
bridge<00:03:57.840> or<00:03:58.500> underneath<00:03:59.299> the<00:04:00.299> wire<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.900> your<00:04:01.109> of

your<00:04:01.680> orthodontic<00:04:02.549> braces<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.660> but<00:04:04.620> I'll<00:04:04.829> try

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
your orthodontic braces and but I'll try

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.949 
your orthodontic braces and but I'll try
to<00:04:05.190> go<00:04:05.400> into<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.910> little<00:04:06.150> bit<00:04:06.299> later<00:04:06.630> when

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
to go into that a little bit later when

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.050 
to go into that a little bit later when
we<00:04:07.230> do<00:04:07.350> talk<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.799> bridge<00:04:07.920> bridges<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.819> and

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
we do talk and bridge bridges and and

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.920 
we do talk and bridge bridges and and
maybe<00:04:09.299> orthodontics<00:04:10.160> so<00:04:11.569> basically<00:04:12.569> that's

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
maybe orthodontics so basically that's

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.780 
maybe orthodontics so basically that's
it<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.440> would<00:04:13.530> recommend<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.670> would

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
it I would recommend that you would

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.170 
it I would recommend that you would
floss<00:04:15.090> once<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.900> day<00:04:16.160> now<00:04:17.160> us<00:04:17.760> professionals

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
floss once a day now us professionals

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.759 
floss once a day now us professionals
sometimes<00:04:18.660> we're<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:19.019> little<00:04:19.169> bit<00:04:19.260> fussy<00:04:19.590> and

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
sometimes we're a little bit fussy and

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.320 
sometimes we're a little bit fussy and
we<00:04:20.070> tell<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.519> has<00:04:20.639> to<00:04:20.669> be<00:04:20.789> done<00:04:20.940> right<00:04:21.090> for

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
we tell you it has to be done right for

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.820 
we tell you it has to be done right for
a<00:04:21.359> bit

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
a bit

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.700 
a bit
yes<00:04:22.830> that's<00:04:23.099> ideal<00:04:23.490> but<00:04:24.180> if<00:04:25.110> I'm<00:04:25.440> going<00:04:25.620> to

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
yes that's ideal but if I'm going to

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.840 
yes that's ideal but if I'm going to
lose<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.099> and<00:04:26.340> you're<00:04:26.520> not

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
lose you and you're not

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.790 
lose you and you're not
want<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.300> do<00:04:27.420> it<00:04:27.450> then<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:28.020> think<00:04:28.350> it<00:04:28.500> would<00:04:28.680> be

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
want to do it then I think it would be

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.040 
want to do it then I think it would be
better<00:04:28.980> to<00:04:29.280> do<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.430> once<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:29.970> day<00:04:30.120> whenever<00:04:30.780> you

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
better to do it once a day whenever you

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.650 
better to do it once a day whenever you
can<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:31.710> that's<00:04:32.670> fine<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.120> need<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.420> do<00:04:33.510> it

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
can and that's fine you need to do it

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.770 
can and that's fine you need to do it
every<00:04:33.750> 24<00:04:34.200> hours<00:04:34.490> so<00:04:35.490> this<00:04:35.760> way<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.390> plaque

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
every 24 hours so this way the plaque

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.630 
every 24 hours so this way the plaque
that<00:04:37.140> will<00:04:37.440> build<00:04:37.650> up<00:04:37.770> on<00:04:37.890> your<00:04:38.070> teeth<00:04:38.310> won't

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
that will build up on your teeth won't

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.540 
that will build up on your teeth won't
have<00:04:38.910> time<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.480> change<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:40.110> tartar<00:04:40.500> which<00:04:41.370> is

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
have time to change to tartar which is

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.500 
have time to change to tartar which is
the<00:04:41.640> hard<00:04:41.880> deposit

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
the hard deposit

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.770 
the hard deposit
once<00:04:42.720> you<00:04:42.870> have<00:04:43.050> tartar<00:04:44.030> we<00:04:45.030> have<00:04:45.420> to<00:04:45.570> use

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
once you have tartar we have to use

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.350 
once you have tartar we have to use
instruments<00:04:46.350> we<00:04:46.710> have<00:04:47.010> to<00:04:47.190> use<00:04:47.400> ultrasounds

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
instruments we have to use ultrasounds

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.780 
instruments we have to use ultrasounds
to<00:04:48.420> remove<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.590> longer<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.100> tartar<00:04:50.490> stays

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
to remove it the longer the tartar stays

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.710 
to remove it the longer the tartar stays
the<00:04:51.240> more<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.600> calcifies<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:53.040> harder<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.490> gets

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
the more it calcifies the harder it gets

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.790 
the more it calcifies the harder it gets
so<00:04:54.720> that's<00:04:55.170> why<00:04:55.260> it's<00:04:55.380> really<00:04:55.590> really

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
so that's why it's really really

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.620 
so that's why it's really really
important<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.430> know<00:04:56.520> we<00:04:56.730> sound<00:04:57.000> very<00:04:57.300> pushy

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
important I know we sound very pushy

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.120 
important I know we sound very pushy
when<00:04:57.930> we're<00:04:58.080> telling<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.500> brush<00:04:58.770> twice<00:04:59.010> a

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
when we're telling you to brush twice a

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.520 
when we're telling you to brush twice a
day<00:04:59.460> and<00:04:59.640> to<00:04:59.790> floss<00:05:00.060> once<00:05:00.330> a<00:05:00.420> day<00:05:00.570> but<00:05:01.350> there's

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
day and to floss once a day but there's

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.680 
day and to floss once a day but there's
a<00:05:01.590> reason<00:05:01.950> for<00:05:01.980> that<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.700> it's<00:05:03.090> basically

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
a reason for that and it's basically

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.110 
a reason for that and it's basically
it's<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.200> a<00:05:04.350> race<00:05:04.560> against<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.400> build-up<00:05:05.970> of

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
it's it's a race against the build-up of

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.680 
it's it's a race against the build-up of
tartar<00:05:06.470> so<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:07.950> hope<00:05:08.610> that<00:05:08.850> answered<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.540> few

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
tartar so I hope that answered a few

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.420 
tartar so I hope that answered a few
questions<00:05:09.750> and<00:05:10.440> if<00:05:10.650> you<00:05:10.800> do<00:05:10.920> have<00:05:11.100> other<00:05:11.130> ones

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
questions and if you do have other ones

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.290 
questions and if you do have other ones
just<00:05:11.790> let<00:05:12.300> me<00:05:12.360> know<00:05:12.390> thank<00:05:13.230> you
