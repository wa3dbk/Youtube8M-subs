think it is and of course a third very
necessary<00:02:00.770> flexi<00:02:01.770> rods<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.910> trick<00:02:03.149> hair

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
necessary flexi rods so the trick hair

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.460 
necessary flexi rods so the trick hair
really<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:04.430> go<00:02:05.430> all<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:06.240> with<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:06.930> twisting

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
really is to go all in with the twisting

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.070 
really is to go all in with the twisting
solution<00:02:08.130> so<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.610> was<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:09.270> shy<00:02:09.570> with<00:02:09.630> applying

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
solution so I was not shy with applying

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.260 
solution so I was not shy with applying
that<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.560> you'll<00:02:10.709> see<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.340> turns<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that and you'll see that it turns the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.470 
that and you'll see that it turns the
section<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.810> my<00:02:12.959> hair<00:02:12.989> very<00:02:13.620> very<00:02:13.770> white<00:02:14.480> I'll

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
section of my hair very very white I'll

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.479 
section of my hair very very white I'll
let<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.260> guys<00:02:16.470> watch<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.860> rest<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> video

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
let you guys watch the rest of the video

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.610 
let you guys watch the rest of the video
it's<00:02:17.850> pretty<00:02:18.209> self-explanatory

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
it's pretty self-explanatory

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.370 
it's pretty self-explanatory
just<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.610> lot<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.880> lotion<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.390> then<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.900> detangle

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
just a lot of lotion and then I detangle

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.620 
just a lot of lotion and then I detangle
each<00:02:22.709> section<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:23.610> wind<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.030> around<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
each section and then wind it around the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:33.290 
each section and then wind it around the
flexi<00:02:25.019> rod<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.410> let<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.799> work<00:02:25.980> its<00:02:26.250> magic

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
can see I simply just twist my piece of
