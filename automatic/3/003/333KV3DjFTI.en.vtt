00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.820
 hello very good as you can see 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.139
 the title or how are you seeing now 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.440
 same in the video 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.960
 let's see how to put the unique name 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.529
 pick them up others you want next to the 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.650
 date and how are we going to get it 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.579
 with the famous menu option number of 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.579
 license series 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.510
 I do not know if this will be your official function 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:38.070
 but at least they have found a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.760
 utility to this good menu let's see 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.760
 How is this 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.579
 we enter the menu with the mode key 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.720
 and we go to option number of 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.720
 license series 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.280
 well as you see me I get the name 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.840
 we are others in theory will come out in the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.329
 White 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.630
 and we have to move to the 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.070
 first digit east that is candle for 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.740
 move you do not have to do 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.740
 pressing on the mode key 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.540
 once you've skipped the first 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.700
 digit with the up and down keys 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.470
 you see that it is changing letters good in 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.350
 this first in this different first 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.210
 let's say you only have letters from a to z 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.119
 and when you have the selected 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.009
 tight key and you see that you see the 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:57.880
 letter at the end of the word the digit 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:01.090
 next you have the numbers from 0 to 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.130
 9 and the same when you select that 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.770
 you want to pretend you think it will appear 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.560
 above 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.000
 If you are wrong, you go to him 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.060
 always pressing with the mode button 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.040
 squeeze and shockey and erase the last 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.860
 letter that has been arranged little things good 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.019
 I have not gotten I think he does not have the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.019
 option to put any space 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.310
 and it's limited I think it's nothing more than 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.489
 good nothing more than 15 characters 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.130
 good apart from these destinations too 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.890
 that for you to get the option on 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.530
 name next to the date you have to 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:51.980
 have the option to show the date in 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.170
 the requested mode let's say if you disable the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.880
 option to show the date then 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.099
 will hide the date but we will also 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.959
 will hide the name details put then 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.970
 in this option 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.030
 good one last appointment that I forgot 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.890
 and that is that on the camera screen 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.840
 you will see neither the date nor the name 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.569
 mental that I'm recording but in the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.170
 videos that will show you the 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.380
 name and date 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.239
 and now I think that everything is already said 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.030
 I hope you liked the trick 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.470
 that you liked in the media and that 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.280
 behind the wheel 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.280
 until next time
