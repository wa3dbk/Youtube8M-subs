00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.510 
water and then dump the water out and
what<00:00:49.990> happens<00:00:50.290> when<00:00:50.470> you<00:00:50.590> pour<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.100> milk<00:00:51.340> in

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
is that the milk fats don't stick

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.620 
is that the milk fats don't stick
immediately<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.610> pan<00:00:54.820> instead<00:00:55.300> they<00:00:55.450> have

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
immediately to the pan instead they have

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.780 
immediately to the pan instead they have
this<00:00:55.840> protective<00:00:56.560> layer<00:00:56.739> of<00:00:56.980> water<00:00:57.460> and

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
this protective layer of water and

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.250 
this protective layer of water and
they're<00:00:58.180> not<00:00:58.270> going<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:58.540> stick<00:00:58.780> right<00:00:58.840> to<00:00:59.079> the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
they're not going to stick right to the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.410 
they're not going to stick right to the
pants<00:00:59.530> we<00:00:59.680> turn<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.070> stove<00:01:00.100> on<00:01:00.460> you<00:01:01.120> know<00:01:01.210> the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
pants we turn the stove on you know the

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.940 
pants we turn the stove on you know the
water<00:01:01.630> protects<00:01:02.079> it<00:01:02.170> from<00:01:02.200> sticking<00:01:02.500> right

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
water protects it from sticking right

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.649 
water protects it from sticking right
and<00:01:03.190> it's<00:01:03.310> a<00:01:03.460> great<00:01:04.030> tip<00:01:04.149> because<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.420> lot<00:01:04.600> of

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
and it's a great tip because a lot of

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.810 
and it's a great tip because a lot of
time<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:04.960> happens<00:01:05.259> as<00:01:05.530> we<00:01:05.710> boil<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.640> milk

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
time that happens as we boil the milk

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.080 
time that happens as we boil the milk
and<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:08.229> know<00:01:08.350> if<00:01:08.439> you<00:01:08.530> haven't<00:01:08.880> stirred<00:01:09.880> it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
and you know if you haven't stirred it

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.559 
and you know if you haven't stirred it
properly<00:01:10.479> you<00:01:10.689> have<00:01:10.720> that<00:01:10.990> film<00:01:12.240> notice<00:01:13.240> yes
