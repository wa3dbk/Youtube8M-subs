00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
another feature on corn for amplifiers

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.350 
another feature on corn for amplifiers
is<00:00:31.930> anything<00:00:32.830> that<00:00:32.890> makes<00:00:33.220> a<00:00:33.430> sound<00:00:33.640> so<00:00:34.210> this

cabinet that you're going to see later

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.880 
cabinet that you're going to see later
on<00:00:37.840> is<00:00:38.379> made<00:00:38.710> from<00:00:39.340> solid<00:00:39.760> pine<00:00:40.269> so<00:00:40.930> no<00:00:41.230> plywood

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
on is made from solid pine so no plywood

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.410 
on is made from solid pine so no plywood
no<00:00:42.460> NDF<00:00:43.589> know<00:00:44.589> terrible<00:00:45.399> color<00:00:45.790> board<00:00:46.120> let<00:00:46.329> you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
no NDF know terrible color board let you

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.880 
no NDF know terrible color board let you
get<00:00:46.570> on<00:00:46.600> some<00:00:46.840> really<00:00:47.050> cheap<00:00:47.350> stuff<00:00:47.649> but

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
get on some really cheap stuff but

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.340 
get on some really cheap stuff but
completely<00:00:48.370> solid<00:00:48.730> pine<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.329> I<00:00:49.870> think<00:00:50.079> again

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
completely solid pine and I think again

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.229 
completely solid pine and I think again
conferred<00:00:51.250> have<00:00:51.340> a<00:00:51.399> really<00:00:51.640> interesting<00:00:51.879> take

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
conferred have a really interesting take

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.880 
conferred have a really interesting take
on<00:00:52.390> this<00:00:52.570> you<00:00:52.719> know<00:00:52.809> they<00:00:53.050> look<00:00:53.379> at<00:00:53.559> guitars

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
on this you know they look at guitars

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.340 
on this you know they look at guitars
like<00:00:54.579> you<00:00:54.760> know<00:00:54.910> Les<00:00:55.360> Paul's<00:00:55.629> and<00:00:55.840> strats<00:00:56.140> and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
like you know Les Paul's and strats and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.410 
like you know Les Paul's and strats and
everybody<00:00:56.739> concedes<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.399> using<00:00:57.820> solid<00:00:58.239> wood

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
everybody concedes that using solid wood

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.959 
everybody concedes that using solid wood
is<00:00:58.570> absolutely<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.260> best<00:00:59.410> way<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.739> get<00:01:00.070> the

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
is absolutely the best way to get the

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.090 
is absolutely the best way to get the
most<00:01:01.149> resonant<00:01:01.480> tone<00:01:01.870> it<00:01:02.199> rings<00:01:02.440> accurately

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
most resonant tone it rings accurately

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.710 
most resonant tone it rings accurately
like<00:01:03.280> Affeldt<00:01:03.520> Elizabeth<00:01:03.940> it<00:01:04.149> made<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.420> bell

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
like Affeldt Elizabeth it made a bell

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.749 
like Affeldt Elizabeth it made a bell
from<00:01:04.989> one<00:01:05.199> piece<00:01:05.410> of<00:01:05.560> material<00:01:05.680> ring<00:01:06.220> yeah<00:01:06.610> and

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
from one piece of material ring yeah and

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:07.980 
from one piece of material ring yeah and
if<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.000> make<00:01:07.149> it<00:01:07.180> from<00:01:07.390> many<00:01:07.630> pieces<00:01:07.840> of

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
if you make it from many pieces of

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.570 
if you make it from many pieces of
material<00:01:08.140> they<00:01:08.500> why<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.770> get<00:01:09.039> then<00:01:09.250> hit<00:01:09.460> at

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
material they why to get then hit at

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.609 
material they why to get then hit at
each<00:01:09.700> other<00:01:09.880> done<00:01:10.090> yeah<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.570> so<00:01:10.960> so<00:01:11.289> they<00:01:11.410> take

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
each other done yeah and so so they take

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.249 
each other done yeah and so so they take
the<00:01:11.800> view<00:01:12.009> that<00:01:12.390> using<00:01:13.390> solid<00:01:13.720> words<00:01:13.930> on<00:01:14.080> their

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
the view that using solid words on their

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.020 
the view that using solid words on their
cabinets<00:01:14.800> is<00:01:14.920> really<00:01:15.190> important<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:15.729> and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
cabinets is really important and and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.699 
cabinets is really important and and
corporate<00:01:16.750> will<00:01:16.899> tell<00:01:17.110> you<00:01:17.259> and<00:01:17.500> if<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:17.649> ever

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
corporate will tell you and if you ever

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.370 
corporate will tell you and if you ever
get<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.009> chance<00:01:18.069> to<00:01:18.340> do<00:01:18.520> this<00:01:18.670> take<00:01:19.300> your<00:01:19.599> head

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
get the chance to do this take your head

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.230 
get the chance to do this take your head
whether<00:01:20.860> you've<00:01:21.039> got<00:01:21.069> you<00:01:21.459> know<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.610> boutique

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
whether you've got you know a boutique

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.150 
whether you've got you know a boutique
hair<00:01:22.390> or<00:01:22.599> pd<00:01:22.929> head<00:01:23.110> or<00:01:23.259> Marshall<00:01:23.890> head<00:01:24.039> or

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
hair or pd head or Marshall head or

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.130 
hair or pd head or Marshall head or
whatever<00:01:24.459> and<00:01:24.670> try<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.330> through<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.660> corn<00:01:25.929> for

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
whatever and try it through a corn for

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.990 
whatever and try it through a corn for
cabinet<00:01:26.560> because<00:01:27.280> even<00:01:27.550> if<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:27.700> can't<00:01:27.880> afford

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
cabinet because even if you can't afford

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.400 
cabinet because even if you can't afford
the<00:01:28.209> amplifier<00:01:28.599> maybe<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:28.990> can<00:01:29.110> afford<00:01:29.200> the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
the amplifier maybe you can afford the

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.960 
the amplifier maybe you can afford the
cabinet<00:01:29.800> and<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.009> does<00:01:30.280> make<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.580> big

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
cabinet and it does make a big

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:46.580 
cabinet and it does make a big
difference<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:31.599> time

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:02:10.860 

mmm

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:10.870 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.880 

it's<00:02:11.870> one<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.170> advantages<00:02:12.410> conferred

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
it's one of the advantages conferred

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.860 
it's one of the advantages conferred
have<00:02:13.310> by<00:02:13.610> pricing<00:02:14.000> all<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.450> their<00:02:14.569> amplifiers

have by pricing all of their amplifiers

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.800

in which the speaker is cup is attached

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.120 
in which the speaker is cup is attached
into<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.570> cabinet<00:03:12.050> with<00:03:12.470> all<00:03:12.620> affect<00:03:13.010> the

into the cabinet with all affect the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.780 
into the cabinet with all affect the
tone<00:03:13.400> basically<00:03:14.390> sort<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.840> cut<00:03:14.989> in<00:03:15.140> them

you get a very directional field sound
and<00:03:23.239> if<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.870> front<00:03:24.290> mount<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.620> speaker<00:03:25.010> you

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
and if you front mount the speaker you

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.030 
and if you front mount the speaker you
get<00:03:25.280> more<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.579> a<00:03:25.670> widespread<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:27.739> order<00:03:27.920> it

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
get more of a widespread of the order it

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.740 
get more of a widespread of the order it
is<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.280> believe<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.910> or<00:03:28.940> not<00:03:29.030> if<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.360> can<00:03:29.420> do<00:03:29.630> this

on an amplifier is say half an inch

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.970 
on an amplifier is say half an inch
thick<00:03:34.579> and<00:03:35.299> you<00:03:35.810> really<00:03:36.140> meant<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.530> speaker

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
thick and you really meant the speaker

they're the sound to go through so

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.850 
they're the sound to go through so
actually<00:03:44.329> as<00:03:44.540> soon<00:03:45.049> as<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.290> sound<00:03:45.530> comes<00:03:45.769> out

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
actually as soon as the sound comes out

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.850 
actually as soon as the sound comes out
the<00:03:46.010> speaker<00:03:46.280> it's<00:03:46.820> instantly<00:03:47.510> sort<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.350> chum

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
the speaker it's instantly sort of chum

which in real terms costs a little bit

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.069 
which in real terms costs a little bit
more<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.640> few<00:03:56.060> pounds<00:03:56.420> more<00:03:56.630> because<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:56.959> takes

more a few pounds more because it takes
a<00:03:57.200> little<00:03:57.320> bit<00:03:57.440> longer<00:03:57.680> than<00:03:57.950> two<00:03:58.160> to<00:03:58.660> assemble

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
a little bit longer than two to assemble
