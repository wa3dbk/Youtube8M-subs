Brock<00:00:17.279> did<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.180> know<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.330> logic<00:00:18.900> 10<00:00:19.199> comes

audition the patch during playback if

all we need to have part of the
instrument<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.109> we're<00:00:58.289> auditioning<00:00:58.410> or<00:00:59.070> at

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
instrument that we're auditioning or at

instrument that we're auditioning or at
least<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.520> portion<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.239> played<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.170> at

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
least a portion of it played in like at

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.439 
least a portion of it played in like at
least<00:01:01.469> four<00:01:01.829> bars<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.000> case<00:01:03.210> I

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
least four bars now in this case I

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.359 
least four bars now in this case I
already<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> song<00:01:04.199> played<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.860> we're

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
already have the song played in we're

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.980 
already have the song played in we're
going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.670> auditioning<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> top<00:01:06.659> part

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
going to be auditioning the top part

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.620 
going to be auditioning the top part
which<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.439> keyboard<00:01:08.030> we<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.180> also<00:01:09.330> do

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
which is the keyboard we can also do

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.810 
which is the keyboard we can also do
this<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> guitar<00:01:10.409> part<00:01:10.650> where<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.520> play<00:01:11.760> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this for a guitar part where we play it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.929 
this for a guitar part where we play it
in<00:01:11.939> dry<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:12.750> reamp<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.500> later<00:01:13.939> we're

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
in dry and then reamp it later we're

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.370 
in dry and then reamp it later we're
auditioning<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.600> keyboard<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.320> I

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
auditioning the keyboard here and I

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.260 
auditioning the keyboard here and I
already<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.280> pretty<00:01:17.610> much<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
already know that I pretty much want a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.630 
already know that I pretty much want a
road<00:01:18.509> sound<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.590> there's<00:01:19.890> definitely<00:01:20.369> quite

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
road sound but there's definitely quite

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.070 
road sound but there's definitely quite
a<00:01:20.670> few<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.970> those<00:01:21.150> available<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:21.930> we're

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
a few of those available so what we're

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.450 
a few of those available so what we're
going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.680> we're<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> open<00:01:23.220> up

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
going to do is we're going to open up

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.740 
going to do is we're going to open up
the<00:01:23.610> library<00:01:24.150> which<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.960> key<00:01:25.170> command<00:01:25.470> Y<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.750> I

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the library which is key command Y and I

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.660 
the library which is key command Y and I
have<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.229> track<00:01:28.500> selected<00:01:29.070> let's<00:01:29.490> just

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
have this track selected let's just

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.069 
have this track selected let's just
start<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> very<00:01:30.060> top

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.270 

definitely<00:01:37.079> sounds<00:01:37.259> cool<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.070> too<00:01:38.250> much

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
definitely sounds cool but it's too much

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.910 
definitely sounds cool but it's too much
of<00:01:38.429> an<00:01:38.640> effect<00:01:39.030> let's<00:01:39.479> try<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.719> next<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:45.920> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
of an effect let's try the next one to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.880 
of an effect let's try the next one to
thin

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.170 

perfect<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.010> exactly<00:01:56.580> what<00:01:56.730> I'm<00:01:56.820> looking

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
perfect that's exactly what I'm looking

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.940 
perfect that's exactly what I'm looking
for<00:01:57.390> right<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:58.050> definitely<00:01:58.260> has<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
for right there it definitely has the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520 
for right there it definitely has the
vintage<00:01:59.310> road<00:01:59.580> sound<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.870> we<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.350> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
vintage road sound now we can see that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.010 
vintage road sound now we can see that
auditioning<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.310> part<00:02:02.580> within<00:02:02.880> context<00:02:03.840> is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
auditioning the part within context is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.990 
auditioning the part within context is
so<00:02:04.410> much<00:02:04.560> more<00:02:04.740> meaningful<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.370> we<00:02:05.820> can

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
so much more meaningful because we can

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.880 
so much more meaningful because we can
hear<00:02:06.180> how<00:02:06.330> it's<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.810> sound<00:02:07.020> or<00:02:07.380> at<00:02:07.710> least

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
hear how it's going to sound or at least

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.380 
hear how it's going to sound or at least
close<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.369> how<00:02:08.490> it's<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.820> to<00:02:08.880> sound<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
close to how it's going to sound in the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.930 
close to how it's going to sound in the
