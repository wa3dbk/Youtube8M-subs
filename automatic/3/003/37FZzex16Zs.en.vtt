freezing<00:00:23.250> up

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.570 

also<00:00:32.260> know<00:00:32.410> some<00:00:32.710> of<00:00:32.740> the<00:00:32.860> loading<00:00:33.220> screens

also know some of the loading screens
sometimes<00:00:34.150> also<00:00:34.450> freezing<00:00:35.140> up<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.570> hopefully

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
sometimes also freezing up so hopefully

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:46.590 
sometimes also freezing up so hopefully
it<00:00:37.990> won't<00:00:38.200> happen<00:00:38.500> on<00:00:38.830> this

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600

now<00:01:17.340> what<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.550> understand<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.330> why<00:01:18.480> codemasters

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
now what I understand is why codemasters

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.260 
now what I understand is why codemasters
would<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.890> rush<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:20.790> out<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
would just rush this right out to the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.360 
would just rush this right out to the
market<00:01:21.450> without<00:01:21.750> really<00:01:22.680> testing<00:01:23.190> these

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
market without really testing these

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.220 
market without really testing these
console<00:01:23.910> needs<00:01:24.300> and<00:01:24.570> understand<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.080> put<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
console needs and understand it put a

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.450 
console needs and understand it put a
lot<00:01:25.350> more<00:01:25.470> emphasis<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.130> pc<00:01:26.640> games

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
consoles i think is where they make the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:02:22.850 
consoles i think is where they make the
most<00:01:30.750> amount<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.260> money<00:01:31.440> anyway
