yep<00:00:15.160> okay<00:00:16.150> here<00:00:16.360> we<00:00:16.450> go<00:00:16.480> with<00:00:16.750> another<00:00:16.779> thing

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
yep okay here we go with another thing

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.140 
yep okay here we go with another thing
we<00:00:17.349> found<00:00:17.619> on<00:00:17.770> Pinterest<00:00:18.220> today<00:00:18.880> we're<00:00:19.060> going

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
we found on Pinterest today we're going

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.439 
we found on Pinterest today we're going
to<00:00:19.240> test<00:00:19.600> this<00:00:19.810> theory<00:00:20.170> that<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:21.609> can<00:00:21.789> make

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
to test this theory that you can make

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.200 
to test this theory that you can make
your<00:00:22.600> bananas<00:00:23.050> last<00:00:23.410> longer<00:00:23.770> if<00:00:24.070> you<00:00:24.640> wrap<00:00:24.939> a

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
your bananas last longer if you wrap a

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.570 
your bananas last longer if you wrap a
plastic<00:00:25.449> bag<00:00:25.990> around<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:26.740> stem<00:00:27.010> so<00:00:27.310> that<00:00:27.460> the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
plastic bag around the stem so that the

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.310 
plastic bag around the stem so that the
air<00:00:27.699> can't<00:00:27.970> get<00:00:28.090> to<00:00:28.269> them<00:00:28.359> or<00:00:28.539> put<00:00:29.140> aluminum

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
air can't get to them or put aluminum

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.890 
air can't get to them or put aluminum
foil<00:00:29.800> around<00:00:30.010> the<00:00:30.250> stem<00:00:30.519> so<00:00:31.029> air<00:00:31.269> can't<00:00:31.570> get<00:00:31.750> to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
foil around the stem so air can't get to

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.880 
foil around the stem so air can't get to
them<00:00:31.990> so<00:00:32.080> we're<00:00:32.199> going<00:00:32.290> to<00:00:32.379> try<00:00:32.590> all<00:00:32.619> three

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
them so we're going to try all three

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.950 
them so we're going to try all three
we're<00:00:33.430> going<00:00:33.519> to<00:00:33.610> leave<00:00:33.850> some<00:00:33.879> alone<00:00:34.390> we're

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
we're going to leave some alone we're

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.170 
we're going to leave some alone we're
going<00:00:35.140> to<00:00:35.290> wrap<00:00:35.620> aluminum<00:00:35.800> foil<00:00:36.700> around

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
going to wrap aluminum foil around

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.819 
going to wrap aluminum foil around
another<00:00:37.420> set<00:00:37.750> and<00:00:37.960> we're<00:00:38.469> going<00:00:38.590> to<00:00:38.620> wrap

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
another set and we're going to wrap

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.340 
another set and we're going to wrap
plastic<00:00:39.370> bag<00:00:39.550> around<00:00:39.820> another<00:00:40.600> set<00:00:40.899> so<00:00:41.140> let's

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
plastic bag around another set so let's

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.740 
plastic bag around another set so let's
do<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.649> plastic<00:00:41.860> bag<00:00:42.250> all<00:00:42.760> you<00:00:42.940> have<00:00:43.090> to<00:00:43.300> do<00:00:43.450> is

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
do the plastic bag all you have to do is

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.619 
do the plastic bag all you have to do is
fold<00:00:44.320> up<00:00:44.500> your<00:00:44.530> plastic<00:00:45.010> bag<00:00:45.360> wrap<00:00:46.360> it<00:00:46.510> around

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
fold up your plastic bag wrap it around

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.260 
fold up your plastic bag wrap it around
the<00:00:46.930> stem<00:00:47.200> so<00:00:47.530> that<00:00:47.559> air<00:00:47.920> cannot<00:00:48.280> get<00:00:48.520> to<00:00:48.789> the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
the stem so that air cannot get to the

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.660 
the stem so that air cannot get to the
end<00:00:49.420> of<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.660> stem<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.190> rubber<00:00:54.430> band

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
end of the stem and for the rubber band

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.310 
end of the stem and for the rubber band
around<00:00:54.789> it<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:58.149> we'll<00:00:58.300> let<00:00:58.420> that<00:00:58.449> one<00:00:58.809> sit<00:00:59.110> and

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
around it so we'll let that one sit and

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.720 
around it so we'll let that one sit and
then<00:00:59.500> we're<00:00:59.620> going<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.800> do<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.039> aluminum<00:01:00.460> foil

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
then we're going to do the aluminum foil

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
then we're going to do the aluminum foil
around<00:01:01.270> the<00:01:01.539> second<00:01:01.930> set<00:01:06.150> make<00:01:07.150> sure<00:01:07.390> that<00:01:07.570> no

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
around the second set make sure that no

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.440 
around the second set make sure that no
air<00:01:07.990> can<00:01:08.020> get<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.740> stem<00:01:12.119> okay<00:01:13.119> I<00:01:13.150> probably

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
air can get to the stem okay I probably

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.330 
air can get to the stem okay I probably
have<00:01:13.900> a<00:01:13.930> little<00:01:14.080> bit<00:01:14.260> too<00:01:14.470> much<00:01:14.619> a<00:01:14.680> little<00:01:14.920> foil

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
have a little bit too much a little foil

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.310 
have a little bit too much a little foil
there<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:16.210> then<00:01:16.780> we're<00:01:16.900> just<00:01:16.930> going<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.170> leave

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
there and then we're just going to leave

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.320 
there and then we're just going to leave
this<00:01:17.470> one<00:01:17.710> set<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.580> now<00:01:18.610> what<00:01:19.060> we're<00:01:19.180> going<00:01:19.299> to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
this one set so now what we're going to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.609 
this one set so now what we're going to
do<00:01:19.540> is<00:01:19.689> we're<00:01:19.810> going<00:01:19.900> to<00:01:19.960> let<00:01:20.049> them<00:01:20.140> set<00:01:20.380> for

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
do is we're going to let them set for

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.289 
do is we're going to let them set for
like<00:01:20.740> three<00:01:20.950> or<00:01:21.009> four<00:01:21.070> days<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:21.729> we'll<00:01:22.119> come

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
like three or four days and we'll come

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.060 
like three or four days and we'll come
back<00:01:22.479> each<00:01:22.659> day<00:01:22.689> and<00:01:23.229> take<00:01:23.439> a<00:01:23.470> picture<00:01:23.680> of<00:01:23.830> them

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
back each day and take a picture of them

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.060 
back each day and take a picture of them
to<00:01:24.340> see<00:01:24.610> how<00:01:25.210> well<00:01:25.450> they're<00:01:25.659> doing<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.799> check

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
to see how well they're doing so check

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:58.830 
to see how well they're doing so check
back<00:01:27.100> with<00:01:27.369> us

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840 

okay<00:01:59.840> so<00:01:59.899> our<00:02:00.200> banana<00:02:00.560> experiment<00:02:01.369> is<00:02:01.520> over

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
okay so our banana experiment is over

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.270 
okay so our banana experiment is over
with<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.329> what<00:02:02.780> we<00:02:02.929> have<00:02:03.049> determined<00:02:03.229> is<00:02:03.799> it

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
with and what we have determined is it

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.209 
with and what we have determined is it
doesn't<00:02:04.609> matter<00:02:04.969> if<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:06.140> wrap<00:02:06.649> them<00:02:06.920> with

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
doesn't matter if you wrap them with

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.279 
doesn't matter if you wrap them with
plastic<00:02:07.850> or<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.509> wrap<00:02:08.720> them<00:02:08.899> with<00:02:08.929> aluminum

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
plastic or you wrap them with aluminum

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.589 
plastic or you wrap them with aluminum
foil<00:02:09.830> or<00:02:10.069> you<00:02:10.459> don't<00:02:10.640> wrap<00:02:10.789> them<00:02:11.000> at<00:02:11.120> all

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
foil or you don't wrap them at all

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.710 
foil or you don't wrap them at all
they<00:02:11.959> all<00:02:12.230> aged<00:02:12.650> pretty<00:02:13.250> much<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:14.180> same<00:02:14.420> this

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
they all aged pretty much the same this

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.190 
they all aged pretty much the same this
has<00:02:14.930> been<00:02:15.140> experiment<00:02:15.860> since<00:02:16.160> last<00:02:16.489> Thursday

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
has been experiment since last Thursday

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.190 
has been experiment since last Thursday
so<00:02:18.200> now<00:02:18.680> we're<00:02:18.890> going<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.040> make<00:02:19.160> banana<00:02:19.310> bread

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
so now we're going to make banana bread

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.449 
so now we're going to make banana bread
so<00:02:21.200> we're<00:02:21.319> going<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.500> get<00:02:21.620> these<00:02:21.769> bananas<00:02:21.950> out

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
so we're going to get these bananas out

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.860 
so we're going to get these bananas out
of<00:02:22.640> here<00:02:22.849> because<00:02:23.180> they're<00:02:23.360> starting<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.720> draw

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
of here because they're starting to draw

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.930 
of here because they're starting to draw
gnats<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.500> our<00:02:25.010> front<00:02:25.280> office<00:02:25.340> said<00:02:25.730> if<00:02:25.819> they

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
gnats and our front office said if they

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.369 
gnats and our front office said if they
draw<00:02:26.120> naps<00:02:26.360> they're<00:02:26.540> gonna<00:02:26.660> shoot<00:02:26.989> us<00:02:27.140> so

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
draw naps they're gonna shoot us so

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.869 
draw naps they're gonna shoot us so
we're<00:02:27.680> going<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.069> get<00:02:28.190> rid<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.489> bananas

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
we're going to get rid of the bananas

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.039 
we're going to get rid of the bananas
and<00:02:29.269> we're<00:02:29.360> going<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.510> make<00:02:29.629> some<00:02:29.780> banana

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
and we're going to make some banana

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.569 
and we're going to make some banana
bread<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.349> bull<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.190> share<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.459> with

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
bread and bull just share it with
