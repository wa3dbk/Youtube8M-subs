up to about another three hours or so I
want<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.950> thank<00:04:24.159> my<00:04:24.370> mom<00:04:24.580> because<00:04:25.000> she

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
want to thank my mom because she

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.290 
want to thank my mom because she
was<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.740> one<00:04:25.890> who<00:04:26.100> helped<00:04:26.400> me<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.730> most<00:04:26.910> I

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
was the one who helped me the most I

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.300 
was the one who helped me the most I
hurt<00:04:27.870> my<00:04:28.050> arm<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.470> was<00:04:28.590> incapable<00:04:28.890> of<00:04:29.160> doing

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
hurt my arm and was incapable of doing

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.660 
hurt my arm and was incapable of doing
this<00:04:29.700> project<00:04:29.970> on<00:04:30.390> my<00:04:30.420> own<00:04:30.690> I<00:04:31.430> learned<00:04:32.430> many

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
this project on my own I learned many

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.080 
this project on my own I learned many
things<00:04:32.820> from<00:04:33.210> doing<00:04:33.540> this<00:04:33.660> project<00:04:34.280> one<00:04:35.280> the

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
things from doing this project one the

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.020 
things from doing this project one the
cell<00:04:36.360> is<00:04:36.570> very<00:04:36.960> complex<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.550> think<00:04:38.790> it<00:04:38.910> is

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
cell is very complex and I think it is

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.870 
cell is very complex and I think it is
truly<00:04:39.750> unbelievable<00:04:40.140> how<00:04:41.130> small<00:04:41.550> yet

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
truly unbelievable how small yet

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.270 
truly unbelievable how small yet
important<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.750> is<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.680> functioning<00:04:44.190> of

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
important it is to the functioning of

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.630 
important it is to the functioning of
organisms<00:04:45.110> -<00:04:46.110> there<00:04:46.770> are<00:04:46.920> many<00:04:47.160> different

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
organisms - there are many different

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.460 
organisms - there are many different
organelles<00:04:48.090> in<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.930> have<00:04:49.080> different

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
organelles in it that have different

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.890 
organelles in it that have different
jobs<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.100> it<00:04:50.670> is<00:04:50.850> amazing<00:04:51.480> how<00:04:51.510> they<00:04:51.780> all

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
jobs and it is amazing how they all

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.250 
jobs and it is amazing how they all
function<00:04:52.530> together<00:04:52.710> accordingly<00:04:54.050> lastly<00:04:55.050> I

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
function together accordingly lastly I

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.110 
function together accordingly lastly I
love<00:04:55.920> science<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.730> art<00:04:57.000> projects<00:04:57.510> like<00:04:57.840> these
