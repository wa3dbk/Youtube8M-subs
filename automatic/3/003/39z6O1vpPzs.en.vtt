00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 So people, now we're going to learn to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.139
 make the doll's feet 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.679
 I'll show you at first. 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.130
 how to make the simplest basic foot 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:23.150
 even that restinho including what 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:26.279
 We're going to use it for the fofuxa doubt fear to 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.560
 first thing polka dot size in 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.400
 three dolls we will use sizes 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.880
 many different 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.550
 but the most used for the doll 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.399
 approximately 30 centimeters are the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.730
 35 and 40 balls 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.510
 Are we going to take this step? 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.289
 basic step with the most 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.800
 users 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.489
 Styrofoam balls they sometimes have 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.059
 not only this amendment that mail about 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.789
 assaulted but also a few carobs 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.940
 it's one of the imperfections then the people 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.560
 can also take a fine sandpaper and give a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.240
 disabled 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.240
 no bahia 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:20.100
 we will see that all around her this 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.540
 dump up here is so expensive is 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.790
 only one side of us because the other 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.630
 Are you going to stay below your foot? 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.700
 have a problem 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.540
 I do not know if this is going to happen anymore. 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.560
 She's very well outgoing here so let's go 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.770
 take this excess because at the time of 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.410
 model when you see the heated 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.510
 he takes the form of what he has if he has 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.860
 an imperfection here very great he 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.580
 will book 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.040
 are how the finish is very important 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.430
 We're going to take this perfection. 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.460
 closed 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.430
 Let's put the balls like me 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.960
 because usually up because if not 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.080
 of the event is marked 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.040
 I use the balls with the line 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.810
 horizontal 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.810
 that way the balls line is it 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.440
 horizontal because, because if you 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.930
 do as soon as it has any relief 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.300
 where the tax amendment will appear on top 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.830
 from the little foot 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.330
 so the first thing we're gonna take 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.989
 a cap here on the two more balls 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.910
 it's a little piece even a little bit 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.790
 to fix a straight part and power 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.239
 put a bay in the other gives you 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.340
 see but it's just a little professional 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:52.459
 because of the camera 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:58.160
 op is a little bit even did not take the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:00.230
 know that they are a shit let's get 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.750
 here at ball 35 doing the same thing 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.540
 does not have to be the same size as 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.959
 removed from the 40 that the ball that is 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.879
 smaller 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.650
 always keeping the horizontal lines in the 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.060
 same sense that the lines give in the same 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.250
 sense 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.299
 so what are we going to do now we will 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:25.130
 necklace noted that'll be one 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:28.030
 difference because we're going to use where 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.040
 we export as reference here to 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.810
 to touch each other 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.480
 well up here a constant good in the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.730
 another will not have space downstairs going 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.560
 get a bigger space 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.209
 ok no problem because we will 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.670
 take a share here as we go 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.840
 paste with hot glue whenever you have 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:54.370
 styrofoam use hot glue hot glue on 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.370
 smaller ball 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:00.370
 put position that is larger 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:10.730
 keeping them close together here strip 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:14.919
 always the glue of hot glue to 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.510
 finishing is also better, right? 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:21.169
 When are you going to eat you glue pros 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.240
 two feet already and leaves separated because 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.490
 sometimes the hot glue it takes me 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.300
 here, for example, you have not yet 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.750
 same gun heats I got here one 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.450
 Dude, it's already twisted. 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.200
 because at the time you cut it to 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.360
 do not get off the right foot position 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.240
 so that part that was left over 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.669
 little here is the part that we go 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.620
 cut to make the sole of the foot of the 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.139
 doll the way we go 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.780
 position the foot to the 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.190
 larger ball down 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.940
 Let's see in that part that we do not 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.390
 I call the small ball 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:07.080
 the ball and that was left over 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:12.900
 Let's cut a little less than the 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.400
 Half of the half-ball of the 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.910
 half think it would be more or less here 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.600
 and I'm cutting up more just to 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.300
 stay in the country in more roundabout 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.900
 even boring the role of clown 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:34.980
 let's get knots of the same line stigmas 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:38.000
 Look, it's going to be this way, but I'm less 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.000
 than half the half 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:45.360
 now we are going to model the government that 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:51.390
 the same way we have already 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:53.100
 we know and shape the head a 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:58.070
 thing but there could be the ironing board 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.070
 As I said, it's a smooth, firm surface. 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:10.650
 in this audience the napkin to avoid 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:14.090
 in this damage ewe the offer from here 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.520
 bit that I use the basis for 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:21.900
 affirm the little foot because if you do 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.240
 this is that at the time of modeling is not 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.990
 not very good and not very easy 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:33.750
 Our job is that I use two little pots 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:35.669
 these 37 mls even because 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:40.130
 because they are the size 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:43.700
 she stays here a little foot positioned 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:46.320
 practically the size of the little foot 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:50.640
 because that's because in the same way 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.820
 when I used that modeling side 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:58.350
 head of the time you will pull 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.790
 and you'll see that nothing gets in the way of finding 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.930
 What are you going to have to pull well? 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:07.289
 the event will at least pass the 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.620
 mark that gives one is Styrofoam 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:11.889
 you can cut 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:16.169
 it's an illegal hack so if you have 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:19.510
 There are people here who use only one 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:23.889
 I'd rather use both to give this one 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:27.370
 we have here in newborn screening itself is this 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:32.020
 The vadinho that has in the foot put 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:38.470
 different for you because what matters 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:42.250
 You will do so and so God has. 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:44.190
 that pull here and here as you can not 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:51.300
 turn around generating iran generating like 

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:55.360
 did with the tin I had in the head 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.260
 I usually do it on my own. 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.030
 When will I make a doll? 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.310
 especially I get more prevents it 

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.039
 sitting 

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:05.470
 I prefer because you have more. 

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:08.430
 exposure to press the 

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.430
 traditional and candle
