 formalized or not amenable 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.160
 quantifying problems he 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.930
 is an analysis 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.330
 situation prediction and formation 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.119
 decision processing solution 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.290
 expert groups 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.680
 this method makes high 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.640
 expert competency requirements 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.170
 procedure for applying this ment 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.780
 called the expertise who can

 issuing organization 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.200
 qualified opinion on 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.289
 any question 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.590
 decide this organization to him at the same time 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.240
 It is recognized that the expert is more 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.570
 competent specialist in this 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.570
 areas 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.590
 in what cases examination is carried out

 decisions and assess their priority and 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.149
 other similar questions

 expert group recognized as good 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.470
 by the meter if available 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.770
 a large amount of quality 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.630
 information about the problem and knowledge and experience 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:33.200
 experts corresponds to this area in 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.200
 this case 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.700
 examination results 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.250
 determined by majority vote 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.409
 experts in other words is taken 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.569
 decision for which she spoke

 meter in that case 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.430
 if there is little information about the problem 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.970
 for example the problem 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:13.879
 new and not learned but knowledge and experience 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.879
 experts in this field is not enough 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.750
 however, this does not cancel the procedure. 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.989
 expertise experts can take 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.909
 participation in work 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.900
 nevertheless accept the final 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:30.140
 solution becomes more difficult for example 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.459
 cannot be used as 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.099
 final decision opinion 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.640
 majority in this case opinion 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.930
 one expert may be correct 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.079
 so for final acceptance 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.980
 solutions use complex methods 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.980
 processing results 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.230
 what is the algorithm 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:57.140
 expertise is a sequence 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.910
 following steps setting goals 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.250
 expertise 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.200
 task setting group formation 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.690
 expert formation analytic 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.810
 groups 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.590
 expert survey processing 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.150
 results 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.310
 analysis and synthesis ie formation 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.260
 management decision while 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.820
 polling and processing procedures 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.770
 may be repeated several times for 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.950
 improve the quality of the final 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.950
 solutions
