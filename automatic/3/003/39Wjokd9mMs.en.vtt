much better method and that is basically
by<00:01:20.340> using<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.880> curse<00:01:21.210> clients<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:23.159> will

by using the curse clients and that will

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.460 
by using the curse clients and that will
automatically<00:01:23.970> put<00:01:24.390> your<00:01:24.630> add-ons<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.200> that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
folder and when a new patch comes out it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.850 
folder and when a new patch comes out it
means<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.229> automatically

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
means that they can automatically

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.190 
means that they can automatically
updated<00:01:29.369> there<00:01:29.970> will<00:01:30.119> be<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> link<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.960> the
