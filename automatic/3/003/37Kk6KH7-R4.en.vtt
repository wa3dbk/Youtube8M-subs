00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Always I am indebted 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.169
 This time 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.010
 Metabolic water 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:17.830
 I would like to tell you what 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.700
 But is, for example, when you see something a horny and balance 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.690
 Of this kind of wind 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:30.140
 Have you ever seen something like looking at a table 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:39.380
 Though I have a moisture to water excretion to take it because when measuring the moisture 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:41.730
 The water drained out is urine and it is insensitive to steam and it can not be felt with the skin or skin 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:47.329
 Go out moisture 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:51.050
 8 things included in Ben Ben 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.610
 Here, I think a total of 2500ml 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.810
 Intake of water 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:04.879
 Drinking water Drinking water I understand that 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:06.490
 This is also know in you will be included moisture also in the food moisture food 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.780
 Metabolic water 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.730
 There are leaving tweets in the inoculation 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.110
 What the hell is this 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.110
 Though it is 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.220
 To tell you the Tteyuu metabolism water in a word to the other true 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:29.510
 Eat things 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.840
 Kedomo it has a three major nutrients called carbohydrates lipid protein 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.469
 that is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.950
 It is digested variously and nuclear reaction synchronizes 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:41.829
 Finally able to 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.829
 It means that water is generated 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:51.810
 Eat food and water can be produced from carbohydrate and lipid proteins in addition to the water contained in the food 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.810
 I 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.460
 Although we are looking at here board 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.300
 It is a rate of recommended energy intake 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.780
 Sugar lipid protein 3 major nutrients 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.020
 Unification is 4kcal lipid per gram 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.500
 9 kcal protein 4 kcal 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.250
 Is it 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.670
 It is in one day 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.560
 In all 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:23.349
 55% carbohydrates and 25% lipids 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.310
 Protein is 25 to 20% 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:29.270
 It is for consumption at a rate of contact 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.100
 Good balance 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.100
 It is said that 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.250
 Good 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.130
 These in individual proportions 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.130
 When ingested 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:49.410
 It is the most balanced energy intake rate for the body, but this sugar 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.569
 Lipid protein 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.159
 How much water per 100g 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:02.159
 It is 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:06.850
 If you can , this is different from the water contained in your diet 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:10.400
 For example, if there are ingredients and juice drink something that miso soup 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.720
 Because the shell is already moist 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:21.030
 It was when I ate other tools 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.030
 I think that it is contained in carbohydrate lipid protein , but from such things 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.560
 Per sushi one 100g 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.560
 55 ml 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:38.860
 7 ml of product per 100 g of lipid 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:45.390
 42 l per 100 g of protein 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.390
 To produce 41 ml of water 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.750
 This is 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.130
 It is metabolic water 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.550
 Because 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:04:00.790
 Drank Well water Lee 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:05.410
 In addition to the water contained when eating, carbohydrate lipid proteins 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.130
 More water is in the degradation metabolism 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.690
 Occur 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:14.080
 I think it would be nice if you could remember 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:20.769
 As for the fine numbers, this is right 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:26.280
 Which or say when the important people of the energy intake rate leaving water is crowded Once ingested that nutrition 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:30.360
 If you know that you'll just get water 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.360
 Only the metabolism with the Don be calculated that I mean obtained 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.740
 I think that comes out 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.150
 Well 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.580
 Something in nutrition metabolism pattern of practice is in something I this nursing process 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.129
 What 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.710
 When we measure elementary one minute suite 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:49.050
 As it is effective when we use, we say that big snow by all means 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:55.259
 Than that detailed thing is good 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.710
 It is a hot water that there is simply that there is water that can be consumed from there 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.419
 Ne 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.419
 I want you to remember
