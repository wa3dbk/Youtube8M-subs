here with the white color once you go
further<00:02:28.730> in<00:02:29.180> let's<00:02:30.020> take<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.470> out<00:02:30.710> you<00:02:31.010> have

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
further in let's take this out you have

further in let's take this out you have
the<00:02:32.020> back<00:02:33.020> cover<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.620> course<00:02:34.330> they<00:02:35.330> would<00:02:35.450> call

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
the back cover of course they would call

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.390 
the back cover of course they would call
it<00:02:35.780> transparent<00:02:36.500> but<00:02:36.710> it's<00:02:36.830> more<00:02:37.190> like<00:02:37.370> a
