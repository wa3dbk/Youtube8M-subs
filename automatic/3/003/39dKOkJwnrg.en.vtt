00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.440 
in it for example like the black leather
because<00:01:51.490> what<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.730> like<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:52.030> do<00:01:52.120> when<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.300> wear

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
because what I like to do when I wear

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.000 
because what I like to do when I wear
this<00:01:52.540> one<00:01:52.690> is<00:01:52.810> over<00:01:52.930> like<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.260> black<00:01:53.470> leather

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
this one is over like a black leather

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.860 
this one is over like a black leather
watch<00:01:54.370> and<00:01:54.850> like<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.000> black<00:01:55.270> leather<00:01:55.540> belt

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
watch and like a black leather belt

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.320 
watch and like a black leather belt
which<00:01:56.260> is<00:01:56.410> really<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:57.250> don't<00:01:57.520> know<00:01:57.610> why<00:01:57.760> just<00:01:58.090> it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
which is really I don't know why just it

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.400

definitely<00:01:58.630> suits<00:01:58.870> that<00:01:59.020> because<00:01:59.229> the

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
definitely suits that because the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.340 
definitely suits that because the
