00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.949
 hard to get your more vital portable look 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.480
 so truth for what you are going to do is 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.119
 one that has four examples of the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.170
 colorblock unrestrained patrio greetings 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.290
 scabies 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.110
 jester i go luke to wake katherine 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:41.219
 and blue 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.379
 so more at the bottom of her eyes 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.379
 blue is telling me how 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.120

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.329

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.460
 through us on my eyes below him 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.690
 Well I have a little lock to cross 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.670
 bluish 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:09.030
 more greenish, actually not for me 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.750
 really kind above the eyes really and just 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.479
 then no cat iphone only the eyelid 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:22.170
 super dark and then the submission polo 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:24.150
 blue water and bring photographer 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.090
 a wooden mascara is really very little 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.000
 this one 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.210
 it all really isn't but yes it is 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.770
 also less portable so yes those are going 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.000
 throw choose your mascara will do 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.520
 just be with yourself and the special 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.920
 miscarriages so yeah I smoke acquire mascara 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.439
 because my look is completely useless 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.090
 the eyes above rose 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.429
 so i think it's a bit better 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.100
 mascara bigger 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.899
 can also say man becomes cat option 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.060
 translated into portable how they do it 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.250
 that mosca for everyone 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.000
 becomes one of the most fever boutique 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.000
 a sedentary one 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.390
 personal Carmani pink face 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.649
 because the beginning really a bit of 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.489
 Heat seemed to find little brown eyes 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.280

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.209

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:37.470
 is a good tip to eyeliner all 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.470
 to fix the summer eye shadow 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.310
 why on pace 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.520
 I have a consultant that sees it this way 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.710
 finding polio by becoming and in 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.360
 bank that no longer suits but you can 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.550
 your doing is just slow but we 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.270
 keep it simple and it does cool them 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.450
 lied 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:18.180

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.600
 can of course also just a very thin 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.210
 line do to your mascara line is we 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.680
 just that as the only life and 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.510
 as you say, but not eye shadow 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:34.260
 gets so dark then you grab too 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.400
 made if you also find garrison then 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.670
 remains eyeshadow omitted 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.670
 of course started slowly so i got there 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.560
 Yes, this is also more for 's 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.180
 what she does that evening takes on 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.830
 the netherlands i would like that eyeshadow or best 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.780
 lets do on do those that are lightweight 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.700
 where one would i suffer just something 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.530
 thinner t yes exactly that's you 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.519
 done more often because I don't like this 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.830
 I just lie in the closet 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.320
 this king your eyeliner I find there 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.959
 just once in a while just one 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.480
 and you think a colored bee do I know 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:11.040
 not when I start wearing this look 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.989
 I may not even have people 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.290
 say a little more grosso 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.540
 beautiful your eye shadow type donna you 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.609
 but it doesn't use more in arnhem 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.160
 we really want to be colored there 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.200
 really i am not so very much van de 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.490

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.190

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.370
 color pigment quit or so not so color 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.500
 is the first 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.860
 because where is the goal and everything 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.690
 but for the example it is 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.250
 you see a bit darker so I put it 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.490
 here also and and do some more 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.870
 colorize with that dark eye shadow 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.840
 is there really bulbs and bulb kees 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.080

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.080
 nice green 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:16.060
 that is necessary yes mine but then mine 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:20.280
 is working very low over low so we 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.280
 you will have we are not there yet 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.740
 I think it's so cool to hear this yes yes yes 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:33.910
 Yes Yes 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.289
 via box easier for oh I have 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:41.970
 than silver I hope to laughter 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:41.970
 then scrape on the inside 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:51.250
 very brit in distracted this look by the 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:55.169
 ok mascara and I am actually 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.169
 as good as you go for a little work growth 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:06.290
 just for one for a party women 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:07.940
 yes yes i think only could but what is 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.740
 well how could you be less true because 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.450
 maybe you should ravenstein 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.670
 then it kept running around your eyes 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.860
 which makes your year or four look good 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.830
 I think I'll have it sooner 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.870
 eyes and things then do from the trees 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.380
 to make this research easier in yes 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:27.410
 they mist for two years but not everything 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:31.790
 roadside was a kind of solo mask 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.690
 i would like my real name to be dark u 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.580
 to make 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:47.180
 see again about level no not my ex 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:51.920
 was from claire you me this about four 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:53.410
 translate very nicely but preferably 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.540
 wear one 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:07:00.500
 Well maybe just basically day 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:04.340
 more for the evening but it could be something 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.980
 be more silver than so yes 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.940
 me I will just leave it that way 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.920
 as he is now 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.260
 and you could hide from something less 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.900
 you can always say it in part along the way 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.590
 go and do garden for centuries or and 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.630
 my door i can look my woman in the 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.860
 evening I think he would love we during the day 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.200
 can if you have a little less black 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.730
 used and then not the lips say 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.570
 if color is just gone then it would be 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:32.480
 also toned a bitch but i would 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.670
 I really wear it at a party 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.100
 but yes you can look inferior by 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.330
 just put it a little below and below 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.280
 maybe a little bit upstairs 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:44.510
 but not like that 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:46.550
 or too much fun we collect 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:51.130
 try and if you want the result 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.130
 see things then we go bye
