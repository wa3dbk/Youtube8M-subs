danger<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.250> rest<00:02:39.640> not<00:02:39.939> just<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.269> physical

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
danger is in rest not just the physical

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.630

part<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.560> personality<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.250> think<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.610> a

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
part but the personality I think is a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.640 
part but the personality I think is a
natural<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.360> think<00:02:43.780> it's<00:02:43.900> like<00:02:44.019> second<00:02:44.620> nature

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650
