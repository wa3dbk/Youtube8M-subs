the<00:00:42.120> first<00:00:42.329> thing<00:00:42.480> I'm<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> talk<00:00:42.870> about

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the first thing I'm going to talk about

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.319 
the first thing I'm going to talk about
is<00:00:43.260> how<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.379> use<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> comb<00:00:43.829> filter<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.370> two<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
is how to use a comb filter or two to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.910 
is how to use a comb filter or two to
quickly<00:00:45.690> make<00:00:45.960> an<00:00:46.079> accordion<00:00:46.320> sound<00:00:46.710> with

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
quickly make an accordion sound with

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.220 
quickly make an accordion sound with
almost<00:00:47.610> any<00:00:47.850> wave<00:00:48.059> table<00:00:48.450> over<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.110> got

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
almost any wave table over here we got

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.229 
almost any wave table over here we got
the<00:00:49.379> original<00:00:49.559> accordion<00:00:50.250> patch<00:00:52.430> good<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.910> on

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the original accordion patch good and on

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.540 
the original accordion patch good and on
the<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:54.870> good<00:00:55.770> old<00:00:55.920> shity

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the right we have good old shity

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.830 
the right we have good old shity
initialised<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.940> I'm<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.480> gonna<00:01:00.570> pick<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
initialised so I'm just gonna pick a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260 
initialised so I'm just gonna pick a
random<00:01:01.050> wave<00:01:01.379> table<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:01.980> I've<00:01:02.129> grown<00:01:02.850> three

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
random wave table here I've grown three

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.580 
random wave table here I've grown three
let's<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.660> how<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.930> works<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:09.470> until<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
let's see how that works and until it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.940 
let's see how that works and until it
sounds<00:01:10.770> kind<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.250> an<00:01:11.369> organ<00:01:12.740> that's<00:01:13.740> all

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
sounds kind of like an organ that's all

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.469 
sounds kind of like an organ that's all
you<00:01:14.070> need<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.580> good<00:01:14.820> accordion<00:01:15.240> sound

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you need to get a good accordion sound

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
you need to get a good accordion sound
that's<00:01:16.259> where<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> comb<00:01:16.740> filter<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.250> with

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that's where the comb filter on with

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
that's where the comb filter on with
damping<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.540> feedback<00:01:19.470> all<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> way<00:01:19.830> up<00:01:21.170> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
damping and feedback all the way up and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.820 
damping and feedback all the way up and
that's<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.560> 90%<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.850> sound<00:01:24.560> by<00:01:25.560> throwing

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
that's like 90% of the sound by throwing

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.520 
that's like 90% of the sound by throwing
feedback<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.670> reverb<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.140> little<00:01:28.290> bit<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
feedback on reverb and a little bit of a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.580 
feedback on reverb and a little bit of a
chorus<00:01:28.909> you're<00:01:29.909> gonna<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.180> closer<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.810> this

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
chorus you're gonna get closer to this

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.660 
chorus you're gonna get closer to this
but<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> mean<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.250> random<00:01:35.369> wave

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
but I mean that was just a random wave

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.910 
but I mean that was just a random wave
table<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.810> worked<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.140> great<00:01:37.320> so

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
table and that worked out great so

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.130 
table and that worked out great so
that's<00:01:38.310> number<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> second<00:01:39.930> thing<00:01:40.020> in

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that's number one so the second thing in

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.260 
that's number one so the second thing in
the<00:01:40.200> list<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.770> trying<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.369> extend<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> attack

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the list is trying to extend the attack

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.200 
the list is trying to extend the attack
phase<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.979> your<00:01:43.979> standard<00:01:44.399> envelopes<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:45.119> in

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
phase of your standard envelopes here in

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.719 
phase of your standard envelopes here in
massive<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.710> way<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.490> actually

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
massive and that way you can actually

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.310 
massive and that way you can actually
turn<00:01:48.710> your<00:01:49.710> normal<00:01:50.100> patch<00:01:50.360> into<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> riser<00:01:51.659> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
turn your normal patch into a riser and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.080 
turn your normal patch into a riser and
that's<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.649> did<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.130> let<00:01:53.759> me<00:01:53.820> bring<00:01:53.970> this

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that's what I did here let me bring this

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.999 
that's what I did here let me bring this
over<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> riser<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.710> you

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
over here so this is the riser that you

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.920 
over here so this is the riser that you
hear<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.549> beginning<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.329> track

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
hear in the beginning of this track

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:09.009 
hear in the beginning of this track
slash<00:01:58.409> video

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.110 

so<00:02:10.019> on<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.470> forth<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.250> if<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.430> turn<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:11.700> macro

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
so on so forth so if I turn this macro

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.910 
so on so forth so if I turn this macro
off<00:02:12.299> this<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.780> what<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.110> patch<00:02:13.319> normally

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
off this is what the patch normally

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.180 
off this is what the patch normally
sounds<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.849> one<00:02:14.970> long<00:02:15.150> note<00:02:19.129> so<00:02:20.129> to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
sounds like just one long note so to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.160 
sounds like just one long note so to
make<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:21.000> work<00:02:21.209> out<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.720> make<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.989> happen

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
make that work out to make that happen

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.949 
make that work out to make that happen
I'm<00:02:23.099> gonna<00:02:23.250> use<00:02:23.430> our<00:02:23.610> basic<00:02:24.120> accordion<00:02:24.810> over

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
I'm gonna use our basic accordion over

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.390 
I'm gonna use our basic accordion over
here<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.319> we<00:02:25.410> got<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:28.010> sounds<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.190> good

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
here that we got going it sounds so good

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.309 
here that we got going it sounds so good
so<00:02:30.150> then<00:02:30.299> what<00:02:30.390> I'm<00:02:30.480> gonna<00:02:30.569> do<00:02:30.780> with<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:30.959> is

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
so then what I'm gonna do with that is

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.559 
so then what I'm gonna do with that is
I'm<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.680> attach<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.129> envelope<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:33.269> the

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
I'm going to attach this envelope to the

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.309 
I'm going to attach this envelope to the
pitch<00:02:33.840> up<00:02:34.739> two<00:02:35.010> octaves<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.579> since<00:02:36.269> we<00:02:37.110> have

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
pitch up two octaves and since we have

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.319 
pitch up two octaves and since we have
we're<00:02:38.040> mainly<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.430> using<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> comb<00:02:38.970> filter

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
we're mainly just using a comb filter

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.509 
we're mainly just using a comb filter
I'm<00:02:39.629> going<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.049> attach<00:02:40.319> it<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.799> pitch<00:02:41.220> as

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
I'm going to attach it to this pitch as

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.420 
I'm going to attach it to this pitch as
well<00:02:41.790> should<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.390> give<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.989> same<00:02:43.170> effect

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
well should you give you the same effect

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.720 
well should you give you the same effect
so<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.879> have<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.030> low<00:02:45.239> attack

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:56.300 

it<00:02:48.629> gets<00:02:48.840> through<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.080> all<00:02:49.319> very<00:02:49.590> quickly

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.400 

even<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.000> relatively<00:02:57.360> high<00:02:57.750> attack<00:02:58.110> isn't

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
even a relatively high attack isn't

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.470 
even a relatively high attack isn't
gonna<00:02:58.680> give<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.010> long<00:02:59.220> enough<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.700> a<00:03:00.209> build

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
gonna give you long enough of a build

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.110 
gonna give you long enough of a build
for<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.959> riser<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:02.069> even<00:03:02.520> all<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.730> way<00:03:02.760> up<00:03:02.910> it

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
for a riser so even all the way up it

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.980 
for a riser so even all the way up it
only<00:03:03.300> give<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.510> like<00:03:03.660> four<00:03:04.620> five<00:03:05.490> bars<00:03:05.790> max<00:03:06.120> so

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
only give you like four five bars max so

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.500 
only give you like four five bars max so
what<00:03:07.319> you<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:08.100> extend<00:03:08.580> this<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.330> bring

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
what you do to extend this is you bring

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.750 
what you do to extend this is you bring
the<00:03:09.660> room<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.590> attack<00:03:10.920> level<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.580> about

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
the room the attack level to about

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.010 
the room the attack level to about
halfway<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:13.010> set<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.130> decay<00:03:14.489> all<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.690> way<00:03:15.810> up

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
halfway and set the decay all the way up

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.620 
halfway and set the decay all the way up
with<00:03:16.400> linear<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.239> it's<00:03:18.360> just<00:03:18.540> a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
with linear on so that it's just a

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.970 
with linear on so that it's just a
big-ass<00:03:19.260> line<00:03:20.000> from<00:03:21.110> zero<00:03:22.110> from<00:03:22.680> square<00:03:22.950> one

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
big-ass line from zero from square one

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.610 
big-ass line from zero from square one
all<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.209> way<00:03:24.270> to<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.480> top<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:25.350> it's<00:03:25.530> gonna

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
all the way to the top so it's gonna

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.160 
all the way to the top so it's gonna
take<00:03:25.950> instead<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.940> just<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.330> attack<00:03:27.750> phase

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
take instead of just the attack phase

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.949 
take instead of just the attack phase
amount<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:28.890> time<00:03:29.209> it's<00:03:30.209> gonna<00:03:30.300> take<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.660> decay

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
amount of time it's gonna take the decay

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.530 
amount of time it's gonna take the decay
phase<00:03:31.260> as<00:03:31.560> well<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:33.200> 24<00:03:34.340> semitones<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.580> all

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
phase as well so 24 semitones and all

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.720 
phase as well so 24 semitones and all
the<00:03:36.690> way<00:03:36.780> up<00:03:36.870> on<00:03:37.050> this<00:03:37.200> pitch<00:03:37.500> knob<00:03:37.739> is<00:03:38.400> gonna

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
the way up on this pitch knob is gonna

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:51.250 
the way up on this pitch knob is gonna
take<00:03:39.019> twice<00:03:40.019> as<00:03:40.080> long

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.949 

so<00:03:51.860> on<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:52.340> forth<00:03:52.610> so<00:03:52.940> that's<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.659> Rises

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
so on and so forth so that's the Rises

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.360 
so on and so forth so that's the Rises
that<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.200> used<00:03:54.349> at<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.620> beginning<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.159> and

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
that I used at the beginning of this and

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.899 
that I used at the beginning of this and
it's<00:03:55.670> often<00:03:56.209> how<00:03:56.420> I'll<00:03:56.750> attach<00:03:57.080> macros<00:03:57.909> to

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
it's often how I'll attach macros to

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.720 
it's often how I'll attach macros to
make<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.239> riser<00:03:59.569> macro<00:04:00.349> and<00:04:01.010> just<00:04:01.370> about<00:04:01.519> any

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
make a riser macro and just about any

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.550 
make a riser macro and just about any
patch<00:04:01.970> now<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.840> third<00:04:03.019> thing<00:04:03.049> I<00:04:03.260> wanted<00:04:03.500> to

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
patch now the third thing I wanted to

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.850 
patch now the third thing I wanted to
bring<00:04:03.739> up<00:04:03.860> for<00:04:04.040> this<00:04:04.129> patch<00:04:04.400> was<00:04:04.819> how<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:05.510> can

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
bring up for this patch was how you can

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.559 
bring up for this patch was how you can
situationally<00:04:06.860> make<00:04:07.760> what<00:04:08.330> would<00:04:08.450> normally

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
situationally make what would normally

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.990 
situationally make what would normally
be<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.989> shitty<00:04:09.319> decision<00:04:09.860> and<00:04:10.069> kind<00:04:10.819> of<00:04:10.879> make<00:04:10.970> it

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
be a shitty decision and kind of make it

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.280 
be a shitty decision and kind of make it
work<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:11.989> I<00:04:12.410> have<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.099> pitch<00:04:13.280> cut<00:04:13.549> off<00:04:13.670> here

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
work so I have the pitch cut off here

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.500 
work so I have the pitch cut off here
it's<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.680> mean<00:04:15.830> it's<00:04:15.860> off<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.609> even<00:04:17.150> when<00:04:17.389> it's

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
it's I mean it's off and even when it's

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.560 
it's I mean it's off and even when it's
turned<00:04:17.750> on<00:04:17.870> it's<00:04:18.530> completely<00:04:19.400> off<00:04:19.549> here<00:04:22.360> as<00:04:23.360> I

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
turned on it's completely off here as I

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.180 
turned on it's completely off here as I
move<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.110> right<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:24.560> starts<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:24.979> sound

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
move it to the right it starts to sound

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.219 
move it to the right it starts to sound
pretty<00:04:25.639> terrible<00:04:30.729> but<00:04:31.729> in<00:04:32.000> this<00:04:32.479> context

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
pretty terrible but in this context

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.560 
pretty terrible but in this context
being<00:04:33.500> that<00:04:33.650> it's<00:04:33.770> an<00:04:33.860> accordion<00:04:34.100> that's<00:04:35.060> kind

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
being that it's an accordion that's kind

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.260 
being that it's an accordion that's kind
of<00:04:35.660> a<00:04:35.750> thing<00:04:36.020> is<00:04:36.320> hearing<00:04:36.889> not<00:04:37.850> only<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.120> regular

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
of a thing is hearing not only a regular

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.360 
of a thing is hearing not only a regular
accordion<00:04:38.870> sound<00:04:39.110> but<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.560> kind<00:04:39.770> of<00:04:39.860> mangled

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
accordion sound but the kind of mangled

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.480 
accordion sound but the kind of mangled
outta<00:04:41.060> tune<00:04:41.510> shitty<00:04:41.870> accordion<00:04:42.410> so<00:04:42.800> that's

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
outta tune shitty accordion so that's

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.879 
outta tune shitty accordion so that's
what<00:04:43.669> I<00:04:43.699> set<00:04:43.820> this<00:04:44.090> first<00:04:44.600> macro<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.139> was

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
what I set this first macro to was

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.920 
what I set this first macro to was
rather<00:04:46.070> than<00:04:46.310> attaching<00:04:46.639> it<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.180> know<00:04:47.300> 15

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
rather than attaching it to you know 15

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.129 
rather than attaching it to you know 15
different<00:04:48.289> parameters<00:04:48.800> just<00:04:49.070> one<00:04:49.940> and<00:04:50.300> using

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
different parameters just one and using

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.360 
different parameters just one and using
it<00:04:51.229> in<00:04:51.320> a<00:04:51.350> way<00:04:51.380> that<00:04:51.650> you<00:04:51.740> normally<00:04:51.919> wouldn't

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
it in a way that you normally wouldn't

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.420 
it in a way that you normally wouldn't
this<00:04:53.240> guy<00:04:53.479> over<00:04:53.630> here<00:04:53.750> is<00:04:54.229> usually<00:04:54.650> set<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.100> one

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
this guy over here is usually set to one

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.060 
this guy over here is usually set to one
that's<00:04:56.180> its<00:04:56.450> standard<00:04:59.380> so<00:05:00.380> when<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.650> start<00:05:00.889> to

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
that's its standard so when you start to

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.920 
that's its standard so when you start to
attach<00:05:01.820> this<00:05:02.030> Mac<00:05:02.270> or<00:05:02.450> when<00:05:02.630> you<00:05:02.690> start<00:05:02.870> to

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
attach this Mac or when you start to

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.490 
attach this Mac or when you start to
move<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.169> macro<00:05:03.560> up<00:05:04.960> it<00:05:05.960> just<00:05:06.139> sounds<00:05:06.349> like<00:05:06.380> a

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
move this macro up it just sounds like a

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.900 
move this macro up it just sounds like a
detuned<00:05:06.889> synth<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:09.860> when<00:05:10.010> I<00:05:10.039> put<00:05:10.340> this<00:05:10.370> all<00:05:10.729> the

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
detuned synth so when I put this all the

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.480 
detuned synth so when I put this all the
way<00:05:11.000> up<00:05:11.030> initially<00:05:11.990> it<00:05:12.349> started<00:05:12.979> to<00:05:13.099> have<00:05:13.250> that

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
way up initially it started to have that

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.850 
way up initially it started to have that
broken<00:05:13.729> sound<00:05:16.599> that<00:05:17.599> made<00:05:17.810> me<00:05:17.960> try<00:05:18.229> out<00:05:18.440> you

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
broken sound that made me try out you

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.650 
broken sound that made me try out you
know<00:05:18.979> pushing<00:05:19.370> this<00:05:19.520> too<00:05:19.849> you<00:05:20.539> know<00:05:20.630> for

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
know pushing this too you know for

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.469 
know pushing this too you know for
something<00:05:21.560> I've<00:05:21.650> literally<00:05:21.919> never<00:05:22.220> done<00:05:22.729> for

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
something I've literally never done for

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.820 
something I've literally never done for
pitch<00:05:23.900> cut-off<00:05:25.780> step<00:05:26.780> four<00:05:27.080> you<00:05:27.500> get<00:05:27.620> this

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
pitch cut-off step four you get this

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990
