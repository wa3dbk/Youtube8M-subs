00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.179
 for the song in this kitchen easy my 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.679
 name is andy and today I 'm going 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.870
 to teach how to make delicious jelly 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.300
 of strawberry yogurt that is really 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.310
 very rich is super easy to make and 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.930
 besides it is perfect to give this 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.060
 true mothers day that is a 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.430
 super healthy option and also also 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.080
 riquÃ­sima and economic well that the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.939
 I highly recommend the time of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.710
 preparation is approximately 30 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.290
 minutes and then we have to 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.460
 refrigerate at least 3 hours so 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.090
 I hope you like this video 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.090
 let us begin 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.420
 for this recipe we need 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.780
 two unflavored gelatin sachets that are 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.300
 14 grams 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.960
 two cups of plain yogurt without sugar 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.059
 low fat 2 cups cut strawberries 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.760
 in pieces or can use any 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.550
 type of fruit that you prefer 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.190
 we also need 2 cups of water 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.900
 a third cup of sugar sugar is 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.750
 to taste they can use a little more 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.479
 If you prefer, we also need a 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.180
 spoonful of honey and half a spoonful of 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.400
 vanilla extract to decorate I'm 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.290
 using strawberries cut into pieces and 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.290
 melted chocolate let's start 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.470
 in a pot add half a cup of water 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.680
 and also add 2 cups of strawberries 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.860
 cut into pieces and a third cup 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.440
 of sugar as I told you the sugar is at 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.570
 they can add a little more if 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.850
 they prefer it the sugar also goes to 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.070
 depend a lot on how sweet they are 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.110
 the strawberries that are using so 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.970
 first try the strawberries and then 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.820
 they decide how much sugar they want to add 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.010
 let's let the strawberries cook 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.410
 at medium heat for about 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.380
 20 minutes or until they have been reduced 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.140
 and they become a mixture similar to 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.690
 the strawberry jam while the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.940
 strawberries are now cooked in another pot 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.970
 they will boil the rest of the water remember 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.760
 is a cup and a half more water and since 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.620
 the water is boiling turn off the fire 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.440
 and on the water we are going to add the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.150
 unflavored gelatin sachets go to 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.330
 stir well until the gelatine 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.040
 has completely dissolved this takes 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.290
 a little bit of time so stir 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.940
 very well for a couple of minutes until 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.000
 the gelatin has dissolved 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.490
 completely 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.320
 since the gelatin is dissolved now 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.720
 remove the pot from the stove and 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.990
 reserve it until you are ready to 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.880
 use it after 20 minutes that's how 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.400
 you see the strawberries as you can see they have 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.160
 turned into a jam this is the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.600
 consistency that they want to obtain since 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.459
 the strawberries are ready 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.650
 now remove those from the game and we're going to 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.910
 let cool a bit the go 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.370
 to put in the refrigerator by 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.750
 approximately 10 minutes so that 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.750
 the process is faster 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.090
 in a large bowl we are going to mix two 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.580
 cups plain yogurt and we will 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.049
 Season with half a tablespoon of honey and 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.049
 half a spoonful of vanilla extract 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.880
 they stir a little 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.840
 and now we are going to empty the mixture of 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.840
 gelatin 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.360
 let's mix it very well with the mixture 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.310
 of the gelatin I'm going to use a 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.379
 hand blender to mix everything very 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.750
 well if you like, you can do it in the 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.610
 blender or you can mix everything with one 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.440
 spatula or with a fork or with a 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.260
 spoon with what they have at hand the 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.360
 it does not matter 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.640
 the blender will give you a consistency 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.470
 more frothy to gelatin and time 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.220
 to cool will stay as if it were a 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.470
 mixture between gelatin and mousse 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.600
 since everything is well combined now you 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.730
 let's add the mix of strawberries 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.960
 the strawberries do not add them before because 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.730
 I really want to stay in 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.890
 big pieces so I did not want to grind 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.510
 with the rest of the ingredients as well 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.150
 that's why I'm adding it up 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.080
 Now stir very well so that everything 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.390
 join 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.300
 since everything is well mixed now 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.920
 taste the flavor and if you think you lack 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.530
 sugar can add a little more 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.450
 honey if you remember only the beginning 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.190
 I added half a spoonful of honey so 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.380
 Now I'm going to add another media 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.790
 spoonful of honey but remember they can 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.150
 add more honey if they think it necessary 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.380
 sugar is to taste as they are 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.480
 happy with the taste 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.810
 that's it, now we're ready to 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.550
 empty in the mold this trick I saw it in 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.170
 the channel of the recipes of now if not 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.700
 you know the channel of the now really is 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.550
 I highly recommend you have recipes 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.290
 incredible and super healthy for 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.850
 Prevent gelatin cpi mold 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.220
 let's moisten a paper towel 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.140
 with a little vegetable oil and go 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.240
 to rub the molds with this wipe 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.010
 all the center and all the outline for 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.510
 that gelatin is not going to stick to 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.550
 the time to unmold the 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.040
 now we are going to fill the molds myself 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.660
 I am using this heart and also 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.350
 I'm going to use a few more hearts 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.690
 little ones 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.520
 the big heart would be for my mom and 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.160
 the little ones would be for my sister my 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.520
 sister-in-law and my aunts so that all 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.410
 have a gift on mothers day 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.509
 here I already have the molds filled with 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.740
 gelatine now we are going to refrigerate it 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.740
 at least 3 to 4 hours 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.810
 after four hours the jellies and 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.910
 are ready to be disassembled 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.710
 I'm going to pass a knife through the sides 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.750
 to release the gelatin a little bit and 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.750
 then I'm going to flip it over my plate 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.559
 they already saw how easy it was indeed that the 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:39.610
 tip of the hour was perfect it is not 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:41.680
 they hit but nothing 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.509
 I'm going to center my heart because a 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.629
 little crooked so I'll move a 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.550
 little more to the center with a spatula and 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:50.289
 truly the heart as it is 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.120
 It looks perfect but I'm going to decorate it 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.889
 bit 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.229
 and now I'm going to decorate the whole outline 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.270
 from my heart with a little bit of strawberries are 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.270
 some strawberries cut into pieces 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.610
 and then I'm going to decorate my plate with a 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.919
 little bit of strawberries too 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.189
 and with some melted chocolate I'm going 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.240
 to write something nice about gelatin 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:13.680
 you can decorate in the way that 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.169
 you want and really the 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.240
 decoration is optional indeed that the 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.120
 Jell-O like that by itself is delicious 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.800
 and it also looks super pretty 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.570
 the melted chocolate is in a 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.000
 plastic bag which has a 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.930
 small hole in the tip and that's what 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.150
 what am I using to write 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.710
 since I have finished writing now 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.240
 I'm going to decorate the strawberries a little bit with 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.220
 some melted chocolate too 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.620
 I'm just decorating them with a 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.300
 zigzag movement 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.590
 I'm going to add a little chocolate 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.889
 white to give you a little bit more 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.889
 colour 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.160
 and then I'm going to decorate the plate with 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.540
 these sweet little flowers that I bought and 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.880
 that's all in truth that the heart 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:58.130
 it was beautiful is the perfect gift 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.130
 I hope you like good luck
