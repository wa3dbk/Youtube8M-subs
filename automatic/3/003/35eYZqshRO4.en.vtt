00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.210
 well this 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.330
 air time 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.630
 lexus in this video let's start talking 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.890
 of the equality condition of two numbers 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.400
 complexes 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.250
 here I have complex numbers and a 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.869
 apart real but well imaginary part and 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.670
 another complex number z2 the condition 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.960
 so that the complex numbers are 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:41.290
 same then it would be for the number 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:46.269
 complex and one is equal to the number 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:50.140
 complex z2 necessary condition is the 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:57.640
 next I put museum here the most gay 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:01:05.140
 there's more little baby will be equal to being 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:09.130
 more than deciding not only c 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.490
 real part of the former was equal to the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.159
 the real part of the 2nd then the real 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.710
 equal to the real part of 2nd c and part 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.990
 b was equal to the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.479
 of the other number 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.420
 then this is the condition for two 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.979
 complex numbers are equal part 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.780
 real one has to be equal to real peace 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.610
 on the other and the imaginary part of a 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.180
 be equal to the imaginary part of the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.219
 other 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.509
 Let's do an exercise by applying this. 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.390
 now 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.770
 so here I have two numbers 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.170
 complete right 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:51.340
 determine x and y so that the numbers 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:56.670
 complex and 1 and 2 are equal then the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:02.950
 staff this number complex and one here 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:06.759
 has your share the most baby is good 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.380
 you see that the air here and this is the 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.470
 baby that is together with him 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.470
 this other number 2 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:19.570
 who also let the the call to be 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:26.530
 do not stay the same letter more than 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:27.460
 its number 5 and the derac is ox + 4 and 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.430
 so this number 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:36.850
 the complex né so that it is equal z1 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:46.180
 equal to the number z2 I simply 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:56.050
 copied that you are here 2 x 1 mas y mas sei 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:58.410
 must be equal to 5 plus x + 4 and that 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:05.590
 starts comparisons right 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:09.910
 2x more and must be equal to 5 2 x y 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.830
 It must be equal to 5 and want to part 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.110
 of the former must be equal to the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.120
 and the real part of the second part 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.000
 imaginary has to be equal to the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:28.690
 most of them have everything and I did not vote 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.820
 here personal apart che smas 4 and x + 4 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.440
 This has to be like 6 I just want it 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.590
 that order here right? 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.570
 fish plus four and ante 6 leave 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.940
 Now I make the system come to do. 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.860
 My system has several ways I 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.580
 I'll make it as simple as I think 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:50.410
 replacement solved system first 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:53.230
 Isol here is easier than it is 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.640
 get 5 - the 2 x that passed by another 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:02.560
 side once you have used and replaced 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:06.570
 just in this one and there I get x plus four 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:13.210
 times 5 - two days 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:24.070
 equal to 6 4 and 5 distributive here tô 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:26.640
 now tried to insulate 24 - 2 - 8 x equal to 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.640
 6 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:41.169
 How do I do it now to gather here? 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:43.720
 ó the ipê x - 8 x will give less 7 x 6 - 20 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:50.289
 When I came to get by, right? 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:52.030
 - 7 x equal to minus 14 or multiply 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.780
 for at least one to end knowledge and 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.229
 at 7x = 14 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.560
 for ax dividing 17 on the other hand 14 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:08.280
 about seven and we came to the conclusion that x 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.280
 is equal to 2 x 2 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.550
 Now that I found it, I'll go back there. 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:25.090
 top two substitute here in and the xi and 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:31.680
 y y is equal to 5 minus 2 times 2 and y is 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:35.080
 equal to 5 -4 and equal to 1 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.550
 now the complex number is not 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:46.120
 this is the value of x and y 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:47.770
 then that is the value of x equals 2 and y 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.919
 equal to 1 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.599
 these are the necessary values ​​that 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.569
 the x or y to assume so that the 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.349
 complex numbers sides do not teach are 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.810
 equals 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.800
 So, there's personal equality of numbers. 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.940
 complexes 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:07.930
 we use the property real part has to 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:10.210
 equal to the real part of the other and the 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.219
 has to be equal to the real part of the 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.590
 other and the part to imagine and until it arrived 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.630
 the imaginary part of the other and 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.389
 we made a system here 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.219
 good so for now this thought this video 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.139
 teaching here to keep 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:25.000
 informed of videos that daily 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.250
 I'm posting sign up for my channel. 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.620
 on youtube and on the next video we will give 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.340
 following 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.340
 complete
