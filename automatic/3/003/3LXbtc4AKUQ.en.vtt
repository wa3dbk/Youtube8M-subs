00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.950
 how can we then consider that the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.950
 Dominican republic can violate the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.690
 human rights I believe that the lord 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.719
 gonzÃ¡lez has come very far 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.209
 and I want to ask you royal sir that 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.619
 govern Saint Vincent and Grenadines and the 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.570
 Dominican republic allows you to 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.939
 we govern ourselves we do not 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.439
 We accept in no way that you 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.210
 want to impose on the sovereignty of a 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.820
 democratic state that has 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.380
 institutions that respect the new 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.040
 Constitution of the Dominican Republic 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.480
 establishes in Article 184 that the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.170
 decisions emanating from the court 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.430
 constitutional are final 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.620
 irrevocable and binding to all 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.739
 powers of the state we live in 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.960
 a rights regime if the president 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.909
 of the republic does not apply the sentences 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.199
 of the constitutional court is exposed 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.120
 even to impeachment in the 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.429
 congress of the republic for violation to 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.160
 the constitution of the republic of all 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.770
 way we are working 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.540
 with the Haitian government in seeking a 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.269
 exit to the cases where we have to 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.500
 attend is not true that the republic 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.960
 Dominican has been removed the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.330
 nationality to nobody I can not 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.210
 remove what they did not have to any 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.090
 person the nationality in republic 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.050
 Dominican Republic is obtained by mechanisms that 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.090
 are established in our 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.420
 constitution by conditions 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.479
 constitutional and it may be that a lot 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:31.310
 people have the confusion of understanding that 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.490
 because the sentence reached 1929 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.899
 Until 2010 many people can understand 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.690
 that was a sentence of character 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.580
 retroactive but it happens that all the 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.149
 people all the constitutions of the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.460
 Dominican republic from 1929 until the 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.340
 date set the same conditions 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.410
 of how citizenship is obtained in the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.390
 Dominican Republic and what is 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.979
 making that sentence send to regulate 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.140
 to people who live in a way 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.780
 irregular in the Dominican Republic of 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.420
 which several tens of thousands are 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.220
 people who live in a legal limbo 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.300
 that have no defined status in the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.100
 Dominican Republic 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.080
 this migratory process that 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.450
 sovereignly the Dominican republic goes 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.270
 to celebrate and that we do not accept 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.940
 impositions of anyone does not matter that the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.220
 country be small or large is a 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.080
 sovereign decision because the matter of 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.120
 residence and nationality were 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.340
 corresponds to sovereign states and 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.110
 we are a sovereign state and not 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.090
 we accept that nobody anyone 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.470
 Absolutely nobody plays with the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.720
 sovereignty of the Dominican Republic 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.030
 because the day I have to decline 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.320
 as president of the republic the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.820
 sovereignty situation 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.270
 so I do not deserve to be the president of 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.460
 my country for that reason is I demand 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.290
 respect for the Dominican Republic the 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.390
 that have to dissent from us has 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.220
 all the right to disagree but that what 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.430
 do respecting our right as 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.810
 independent and sovereign nation 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.020
 fortunately president martelly 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.970
 whose speech yesterday I salute 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.250
 has announced that it is in the conditions 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.960
 to continue the dialogue that we will have and 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.480
 I feel that this is the way out for this 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.040
 problem that we have in that dialogue in 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.980
 the one they are addressing not only 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.750
 immigration issues but issues that 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.390
 they concern both countries to improve 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.250
 the living conditions of our people 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.620
 in that dialogue we will look for the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.620
 exit that is necessary to solve 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.900
 this impasse because while I am 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.760
 president of the Dominican Republic in 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.150
 my country are not going to violate the 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.520
 rights of anyone I want to regularize 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.100
 but respecting the rights of all 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.380
 the people in this process we will have 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.600
 several stages to which they have to 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.460
 receive a residence visa 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.470
 will give a residence visa what 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.270
 want a tour visa a visa 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.730
 ride what they want a permit 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.250
 work will have a work permit and 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.630
 what they say they have the right 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.100
 acquired to be national 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.650
 Dominicans we are proposing 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.170
 submit to the national congress a law of 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.720
 naturalization to pick up those 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.370
 people who do not have a defined limb 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.290
 in legal terms the republic 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.340
 Dominican and we 're going to do it because 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.410
 we believe 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.840
 because we are committed to that 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.400
 because we believe that no people can 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.830
 move forward violating the rights of 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.290
 no person and we in republic 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.760
 Dominican we have never been sitting on 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.859
 a bench to accuse him of rape 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.410
 of human rights and therefore not what 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.360
 we can accept excuse in me that there 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.100
 had to talk like this but 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.960
 that speech could not stop 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.030
 in the air without us saying 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.320
 what things happen in the republic 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.320
 Dominican thank you very much
