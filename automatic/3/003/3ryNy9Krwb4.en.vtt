00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:12.230
 a bit per second twitch about the uni-campus in Karlsruhe 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.089
 Predictable at the back then the flashes must come from the middle 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:19.380
 Sometimes they are sitting on the campus edge 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.640
 what he happens to look like is art 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.019
 and science 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.409
 Behind it are the light artist Timo to Rot and astroparticle physics 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.060
 Andreas Kocks 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.160
 Sources of lightning are called 16 profession feet for free these are the individual 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.250
 Building blocks of art 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.390
 Installation Kosslick Brazil plays 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.750
 the artist Okt and the profession or at Lambach although the plot played along 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.280
 Countries included or dead or born 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.660
 and he towards the APA we can and want 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.810
 Above all, Kerkrade Otto Fricke's bank robbery looks at their frequency 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.980
 Connected and he offered there will not stop in front of this field 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.370
 Although Red Bull Crashed correct the operation 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.100
 the Cascade detector at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.170
 measures the traces of cosmic radiation so-called air showers look air 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.990
 Betting who owns many pimple gardens 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.119
 the work bring soil into the goldmine beam to be generated in 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.259
 Durban who and the many visitors to the experiment so Andreas France no 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.580
 senior scientist from Cascade 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.290
 there is always much talk about cosmic particles and air show but Brigid 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.360
 Barth did not warn Peter 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.700
 and about the idea of ​​advertising with the Court with any 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.970
 the reported air Schauer and Lyon with bar make cosmic radiation the air 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.119
 even our he entered must have been produced by ferry or atomic nuclei or electrons 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.889
 in space in black holes supernova explosions or other 

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:45.500
 violent events are accelerated 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.850
 You can find these high-energy cosmic particles everywhere in the universe 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.380
 Of course, intelligent leather balls will also contribute to the game 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.450
 Werder 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.640
 and can be paintings here and this type of measurements is just happening 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.980
 in Karlsruhe 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.440
 Frigge the high-energy particles into our atmosphere then produce them 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.610
 cascading more and more secondary particles and that their number of energy 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.150
 And distribution can tell you much about the original fast chatroom core 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.879
 and the process went faster has learned 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.560
 he will but he jumped back there 'red' upright and project leader of 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:22.290
 Horses op on Blackbird also gives Lutz Trümper a year 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.650
 Headscarves are worn by the Cottbus 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.809
 gray jacket 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.570
 the 16 free art installation 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.729
 are therefore directly connected to the detectors of the cascade experiment 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.159
 the People Rheine down a handicapped Kurt Michel Pauly child 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.410
 then maybe only one 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.360
 was more or even 2 am 1 of the high energy cosmic at the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.159
 Paintings thanks to which all go away Kolbinger expiration 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.750
 Of course, everything is clear for the physicists working on the project 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.459
 Accordingly, there were questions at the beginning of the institute 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.369
 whether there are more practicing doper strolling there 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.299
 under towels Not and Rainer both Precht 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.919
 Lotta Birgit Dalheimer greed and bubbled make but the skeptics 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.960
 The cost of choleric did not slow it down 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.310
 the artist Otmar actually collaborated with the physicists 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.189
 excited 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.979
 seldom said so were the scientists in his previous ones 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:16.219
 Projects so quickly convinced to join Ulrich Garnadt competitions 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:17.709
 for this project 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.419
 not only alone possible concrete cases still an offer 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.969
 had experimentally Walter Pache Ortner on whether municipal properties BBL 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:30.989
 Cheers focus on minimalist images and the whole 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.049
 especially in the scientific context 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:33.980
 at Premiere 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.599
 4 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.739
 all natural sciences dealing with validity 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.620
 he was inspired by a 16 by 16 LEDs large display the Cascade 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.359
 Experiments with which the researchers use the function Pires detector Felix 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.060
 monitor 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.370
 every kind of honesty in her speech 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.069
 the tragedy is within reach 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.819
 the physicists believe Roth 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.649
 have a highly differentiated and not for any dealing with pictures 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.790
 the artistic approach simply expands the horizon 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:04.209
 and then of course the scientists are simply playful Barça 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.999
 shakes bounced APA b 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:10.599
 Euro the material conditions per customer ARPU also really develop 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.819
 Percent where you get 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.539
 aesthetic reasons were also an important aspect for the physicist Hauenstein 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.030
 The Kolping also included offering beautiful objects 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.860
 artistic objects with a lot of love and with who many ideas and with 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.169
 who does not explain clock creativity 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.909
 even though they are these beautiful objects seventh the pictoriality of the cosmic 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.400
 If you want to experience radiation then you have to be patient 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.220
 The Cascade Experiment will be finished next spring and on the occasion of the 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.440
 The final concert in Karlsruhe will be free in the detector 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.879
 self-built 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.129
 we will post them in this podcast on time and on our website 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.739
