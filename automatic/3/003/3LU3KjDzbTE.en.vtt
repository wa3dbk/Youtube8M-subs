00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.000
 pebbles from block makers 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.099
 power we have long been accustomed to but it turns out 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.770
 happens and vice versa when the master 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.939
 peripherals are releasing laptops like this 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.759
 happened to razer 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.160
 introduced laptop play comes 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.780
 double-packed computer top 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.449
 layer standard gray cardboard 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.379
 black inner hard case with 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.050
 green rim 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.839
 boxes really nothing unusual 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.420
 no extra keyboards only 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.670
 Microfiber cloth charging very 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.199
 by the way modest size well and myself 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.720
 a laptop 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.850
 the height is only 18 millimeters not some 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.519
 there is an elegant fat man 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.589
 ultrabook weight exactly two kilograms then 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.750
 have a backpack fit and no shoulders 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.820
 too heavy have made such 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.180
 compactness and just borrowed 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.000
 good ideas from fellows on purpose formula 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.250
 the case of rubles is the same as the macbook three 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.189
 a piece of aluminum providing the desired 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.260
 torsional stiffness 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.619
 look and look like a thin screen cover 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.560
 slightly rounded edges and sharp edges without 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.560
 you cover is decorated with stamping and 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.780
 luminous razer green logo 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.369
 the body is completely rolled up nice on 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.469
 touch matt sun 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.409
 last truth quickly covered 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.509
 fingerprints 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.999
 inside of the laptop, too, everything is strictly 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.710
 the display is surrounded by a thin frame and on 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.399
 the bottom is a pair 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.929
 speakers 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.850
 Power and keyboard island keys 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.409
 full-sized with a soft stroke 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.929
 illuminated green and the light-emitting diodes and 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.289
 Here with a set of buttons razer arrived 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.750
 unexpectedly there is no page down jacket as well 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.549
 us pet combined with fn because of what 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.859
 some familiar combinations on 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.349
 laptop inaccessible but on gaming 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.689
 keyboard options ideally press 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:10.239
 at once you can at least all the shift keys and 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.640
 the counter as it should be big plus 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.340
 there is support for macros for setting them up 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.590
 responsible synapse program 20 allows 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.110
 give each button a new value 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.140
 also write a sequence on it 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.700
 action of any complexity 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.040
 the touchpad is a bit unexpected over all 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.739
 featured it looks like ultra ordinary 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.690
 panel button large area smooth 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.840
 multi-touch surface support 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.359
 but in fact it is not pressed a 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.180
 work on the classical scheme with a pair 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.280
 separate buttons at the bottom combination 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.739
 unusual and at first enters into a stupor 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.230
 But you have to use touchpad 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.120
 not so often for games there is always a mouse 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.400
 for more simple things you can poke 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.500
 free to touch 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.569
 supports gestures and working with 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.790
 they are really comfortable here and cranks 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.099
 just 14 inches so the laptop is comfortable 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.790
 keep just stretched out 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.099
 hands although susceptibility to pushing 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.980
 display is not important where the matrix is ​​more important 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.940
 this is ip with crazy for laptop 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.130
 a resolution of 3200 by 1800 on such 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.660
 diagonal it gives a density of two hundred 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.940
 sixty two dots per inch 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.280
 The picture in definition is comparable to 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.650
 flagship phones as with such 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.200
 the windows looks like the answer 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.510
 the system browsers and word to this 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.370
 perfectly fit and fine 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.290
 scalable but with many 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.209
 third-party programs will have to either 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.709
 get a magnifying glass or go to 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.079
 more modest resolution 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.800
 not inferior to the matrix and other 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.440
 parameters 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.720
 color rendition as it should be and ps 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.590
 close to the ideal and allows you to work 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.810
 printing 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.570
 and brightness enough to work under 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.970
 lamp but not in the sun 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.410
 the display close the glass and noticeably 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.090
 glare well and now about the most interesting 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.130
 the technical component of the laptop is not 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.300
 looking at the dimensions of the blade is equipped 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.430
 top class 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.930
 based on a full four 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.800
 intel core 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.520
 RAM capacity 8 gigabytes ddr3 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.460
 gifts 870 m is responsible for the graphics 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:19.239
 frequency of 941 megahertz with three 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.959
 gigabytes gddr5 is it enough 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.420
 for games 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.120
 situation next full di all our 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.450
 test projects at high settings 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.320
 issued at least 30 fps with the same family 3 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.550
 200 by 1800 this was not achieved 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.500
 maximum for them was the average 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.140
 laptop level but 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.300
 this is a great result to process in 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.160
 four higher resolution is the same 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.740
 the most that include four 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.860
 smoothing across the screen is similar by the way 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.830
 the effect of transcendent clarity without a hint 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.500
 on the ladder at the edges of the object 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.180
 Finally, the price in the configuration with ssd 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.550
 128 gigabytes 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.480
 razer blade will cost almost 100 thousand 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.880
 rubles 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.700
 the figure in our opinion is quite reasonable 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.160
 whatever one may say competitors are comparable 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.590
 size and capabilities of the novelty is not 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.590
 and in the near future is not expected
