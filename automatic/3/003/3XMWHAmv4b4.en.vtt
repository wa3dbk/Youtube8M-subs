00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
better it's not unusual for us to back

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.119 
better it's not unusual for us to back
up<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.479> say<00:02:06.659> maybe<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:07.079> rushed<00:02:07.469> into<00:02:07.680> judgment

thousand and five we begin to realize

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.940 
thousand and five we begin to realize
that<00:02:15.220> Pluto<00:02:15.940> called<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.450> planet<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.080> 1930

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
that Pluto called a planet in 1930

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.710 
that Pluto called a planet in 1930
before<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.610> Kuiper<00:02:18.880> belt<00:02:19.240> was<00:02:19.390> even

and very frightening Lee we also didn't

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040

before<00:02:39.580> things<00:02:40.150> got<00:02:40.420> out<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.660> hand<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.800> they

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
before things got out of hand so they

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.820 
before things got out of hand so they
came<00:02:42.610> up<00:02:42.670> with<00:02:43.030> three<00:02:43.330> things<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:44.230> first<00:02:44.590> is

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
came up with three things the first is

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.340 
came up with three things the first is
that<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:45.280> must<00:02:45.460> orbit<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.000> Sun<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.900> second

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
that you must orbit the Sun the second

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.860 
that you must orbit the Sun the second
is<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.770> must<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.220> enough<00:02:48.520> mass<00:02:48.790> for

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
is that you must have enough mass for

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.750 
is that you must have enough mass for
hydrostatic<00:02:49.870> equilibrium<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.830> occur<00:02:51.130> that

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
hydrostatic equilibrium to occur that

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.900 
hydrostatic equilibrium to occur that
basically<00:02:52.450> means<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:53.140> your<00:02:53.440> round<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:54.130> the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
basically means that your round and the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.510 
basically means that your round and the
third<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.990> you<00:02:56.170> must<00:02:56.470> have<00:02:56.710> cleared<00:02:57.160> your

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
third is that you must have cleared your

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.820 
third is that you must have cleared your
orbital<00:02:58.060> neighborhood<00:02:58.690> now<00:02:59.170> it's<00:02:59.350> that<00:02:59.530> last

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
orbital neighborhood now it's that last

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.650 
orbital neighborhood now it's that last
one<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.430> was<00:03:00.550> a<00:03:00.580> little<00:03:00.670> bit<00:03:01.000> controversial

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
one that was a little bit controversial

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.170 
one that was a little bit controversial
and<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.620> one<00:03:02.830> that<00:03:03.010> Pluto<00:03:03.550> does<00:03:03.910> not

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
and is the one that Pluto does not

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.440 
and is the one that Pluto does not
satisfy<00:03:04.860> therefore<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.040> makes<00:03:06.250> Pluto<00:03:06.730> not<00:03:07.210> a

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
satisfy therefore it makes Pluto not a

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.260 
satisfy therefore it makes Pluto not a
planet<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.530> Pluto<00:03:08.950> was<00:03:09.130> reclassified<00:03:09.640> as<00:03:10.240> a

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
planet so Pluto was reclassified as a

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.020 
planet so Pluto was reclassified as a

it<00:03:19.450> was<00:03:19.690> labeled<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:20.170> planet<00:03:20.590> then<00:03:21.040> objects

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
it was labeled a planet then objects

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.000 
it was labeled a planet then objects
