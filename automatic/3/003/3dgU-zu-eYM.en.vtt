00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.270
 to all girls I am with a new one 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.340
 video today I want to make the 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.830
 review of a little product I received 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.530
 about a month ago and about a month ago 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.480
 i'm testing it proving i'm enjoying it 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.090
 a lot is really giving me good people 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.610
 results and therefore it seems to me the case of 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.080
 talk about it and then the product in 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.530
 question is helix extra or the cream 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.330
 with snail slime extracts 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.489
 first I show you the flyer 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.070
 company where you can find 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.070
 in any case, the products that they are 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.390
 sell the characteristics of each of the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.329
 of the products and adds how to apply 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.800
 the product and tells you a little 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.730
 general information as to 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.329
 regards the ingredients then the sites 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.489
 first and foremost is www.badoo.com this is 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.980
 here but I will also insert it for you 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.700
 in the info box below then give us 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.040
 look at the product in question 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.819
 which was sent to me precisely 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.200
 the cream and the ex-ex this one from 30 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:18.009
 ml 30 grams of product for 29 30 euros 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.049
 of price then first of all I like it 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.999
 just to tell you that in this product 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.219
 unlike many other products 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:27.459
 always maybe extracted from snail slime 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.679
 I don't mention names, however, the most 

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:31.740
 famous in the trade with respect to this 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.569
 as in c is made worse 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.999
 this product in particular does not 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.759
 contains greasy parabens silicones ogm 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:42.490
 peg allergens and perfumes I can tell you 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.039
 that practically the first ingredient is 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.380
 snail slime extract there is water e 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.929
 snail slime so already from here 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.149
 we can understand that actually 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:56.289
 doses of the active ingredient are 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.450
 definitely beautiful tall in short then 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.039
 this product has a deadline of six 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.710
 months because clearly being 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.970
 totally 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.740
 formed from compounds of natural origin 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.530
 snail extracts snail extract 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.890
 etc. finds the deadline for sure 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.530
 goes to shrink I show you how 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.959
 formulated as the product is structured 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.090
 so I've already used a lot of it 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.280
 a month I'm using it and between 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.680
 parenthesis advice I feel of 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.380
 give you is to use this product 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.300
 in the evening exclusively in the evening because it is 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.610
 however a photosensitive product 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.800
 you know no like glycolic acid 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.380
 etcetera in short, are those products that 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.650
 in contact with light they can give you one 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.690
 in short, unpleasant reaction here is me 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.980
 used it in the evening before going to 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.269
 read and I must tell you that I am there 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.080
 very well the consistency is enough 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.850
 rubbery I don't know if you can notice it's done 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.810
 in this way it is absorbed 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.550
 really quickly this is up 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.230
 I really wouldn't have bet this 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.780
 tell you the truth as I would not bet 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.959
 on the fact that the fragrance could 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.269
 absolutely not remember the slime of 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.739
 snail because it really was a moment 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.780
 skeptical about this thing because I said 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.400
 god though he stinks in quotation marks of 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.799
 snail 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.810
 I don't know how much I'll actually use it no 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.329
 actually the scent is very light 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.730
 I would never have said so nice 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.320
 feeling only the scent that in this one 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.150
 cream there was precisely the extract of 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.769
 snail slime 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.750
 then I tell you a little about mine 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.980
 experience with this product i like 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.070
 I told you a month that I am 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.530
 using is a month that I really am 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.130
 obtaining results already from the third 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.040
 application then the thing I have 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.989
 noted in absolute positive of this 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.450
 product is that if you have some stain 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.430
 from pimple from ex buffalo or some 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.280
 pimple you know precisely those 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.680
 reds that sometimes also hurt in the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.100
 around two applications, that is, not even 2 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.220
 Two applications for two days 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.660
 the redness totally disappears and the 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:10.020
 pimple really fades by 50 per 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.000
 I really know what a minimum of a hundred 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.390
 I suffer from some sporadic spot 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.160
 nothing extraordinary but I can tell you 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.050
 that putting this cream on those 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.270
 pimples that are nothing 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.220
 of striking in my case the next day 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.010
 directly a maximum of two days later 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.170
 I just don't have a pimple so already 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.670
 from there you don't want to squeeze 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.520
 etcetera because within two 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.500
 days you know that you leaving them 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.270
 however, whether they already have the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.920
 yellow needle so that you too 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.930
 wanting doing face cleansing 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.210
 may you be special whether they are still 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.570
 red the pimple then goes away this 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.150
 really 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.680
 the most striking aspect for how much 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.710
 concerns this product is its own 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.020
 what my heart made me say 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.900
 I really need to talk about it and other effects 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.890
 that I noticed improvements 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.530
 improvement are in regards to 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.800
 just the firmness of the skin 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.120
 skin tone I find my skin 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.650
 of the face just a lot brighter 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.020
 almost without imperfections girls it is 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.110
 really good this cream is me 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.220
 really, really, really enjoying it 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:20.430
 it takes very little because anyway 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.290
 that is, it is still quite jealous 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.990
 consistency therefore really extends 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.620
 easily it really is with a month of 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.630
 utilization 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.750
 every night look how much there is 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:35.100
 yet for which I think the price is 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.870
 let's go away let's say to smooth for 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.750
 the fact that this cream as far as I am 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.390
 it concerns me will last another two three months 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.390
 all therefore the important thing is to stay in 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.130
 six months repetition deadline because 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:50.820
 not containing petrolatum etc. 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.190
 surely the deadline goes to let's say a 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.950
 decrease here is the expiration time 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.840
 but I with this product I am 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.420
 finding it really very well so if 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.310
 you suffer from acne 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.230
 noticeable scars have spots 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.430
 of the skin wrinkles or whatever it is 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.350
 stretch marks I recommend this 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.660
 product because it is really suitable for 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.880
 the treatment of these pathologies 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.940
 these in quotes of these problems 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.250
 here so I remember once 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.260
 time to their site that babalù marca.com 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.830
 anyway I write here again 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:29.100
 below in the info box them in addition to the cream 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:33.150
 still have other products in the year 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:35.250
 gel that is also suitable for mi skin 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.940
 I'm reading mixed acne gives a 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.800
 lifting effect also have the cream for 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.220
 the hands that precisely serves for 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.420
 skin elasticity 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.510
 exact and also protects against agents 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.720
 atmospheric exteriors also have cream 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:54.090
 body that in addition to the right burr of a base 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.420
 snail slime and also aloe based 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.510
 real almond oil 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:01.660
 so calendula is definitely nutritious 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.490
 here we say and regenerating and on their own 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:07.240
 site should have also entered 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:10.060

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.490
