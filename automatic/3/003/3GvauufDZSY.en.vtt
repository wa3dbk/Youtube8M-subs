00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello everyone, I hope you know 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.109
 are fine has already been a 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.300
 long since I got part 4 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.820
 of pokemon betas so now I go back 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.549
 with part 5 this will be the last part 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.980
 where will I show or characters and 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.250
 some more good things without more talk 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.949
 let's start good let's start with red and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.230
 green this is very well known to you 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.119
 surely and it's about that you had to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.220
 fight with the teacher or up to fight 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.320
 with mutual this can be achieved in the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.230
 video game based on a click that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.690
 I will leave in the description possibly your 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.010
 equipment consisted of level 66 taurus 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.290
 executor 67 arcana in 68 depends on what 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.300
 initial pokemon choose this will choose the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 that is weak against yours and will be in 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.579
 level 69 and finally a guide to 2 in 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.980
 level 70 this is a character 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.590
 unknown that did not appear in the end 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.770
 the reason is not known but it seems to be a 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.170
 scientific the pokemon music good 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.329
 how I feel lazy to put the song on them 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.549
 I leave the link below the first is the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.680
 introduction the second is the town 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.020
 palette which 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.380
 a bit creepy and has a resemblance 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.080
 with the dracula piano song 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.670
 let's go to good yellow pokemon here 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.400
 There is a lot to say but the most 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.640
 interesting are his or st we go to 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.160
 gold and silver pokemon well to start the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.770
 video game would be called pokemon 2 then 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.200
 of that they were called gold 2 and silver 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.960
 2 but at the end they were chosen by pokémon 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.570
 gold and silver then it would be planned 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.040
 put silver gold how weird this is 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.590
 that gold was the main character 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.440
 although it has logic since golden the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.290
 videogames is called eco let's go to 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.690
 crystal in this image can be appreciated 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.540
 the communication in the pokemon center to 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.550
 Through the link cable you can also 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.680
 observe the female character which 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.530
 is different and resembles some of the 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.810
 pokemon school characters by 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.700
 last time we see that the edge of 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.880
 the super gameboy 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.610
 let's go with ruby ​​sapphire I did not find either 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.500
 a lot but yes some or st we go to 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.500
 red fire and green leaf 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.870
 songs here there is nothing what yes there is 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.660
 it's the oak beta that looks better than the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.880
 of the final version in this you had the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.090
 acrobatic and race bikes 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.430
 sapphire ruby that later they were removed we happened 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.440
 to platinum since there are no emeralds 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.650
 diamond and pearl good platinum 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.870
 there is not much good as we see this 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.990
 is the beta spirit of garzon thing that 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.110
 is not the same as before, let's go white 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.450
 and black in this there is a gray according to law 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.550
 this glitches was possibly set 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.670
 to a painting room which is 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.800
 canceled below I leave the video here 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.430
 we see the esprit of versus of struggle and 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.709
 uncaged in which do not change much 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.780
 good people that was all I said 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.790
 everything that can be said about a beta 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.920
 Pokemon I had a hard time doing this 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.810
 fifth part but good if I achieve 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.010
 get some mega blond beta and 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.140
 sapphire alpha 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.070
 I will make a good video bonus now yes 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.070
 goodbye goodbye
