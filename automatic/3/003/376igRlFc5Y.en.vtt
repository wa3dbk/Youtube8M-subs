00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.570
 comment our video temple just is 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.820
 a map came this payment I feel the voice is 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.039
 this one that I've put kids is a voice 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.190
 What do you give me sometimes to put me 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.440
 I bore a lot and good this map is a 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.710
 map of the payment and is to tell you 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.570
 basically you can not open if 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.030
 you have seen the map can not go up 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.860
 the frob that did not record my voice 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.840
 record already managed to solve to see 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.329
 if moment life pulls and this is the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.930
 weapon that they have put in the package 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.340
 maps have put a weapon that is this one that 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.960
 you can also use in normal public 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.020
 I thought not and well the map is 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.060
 basically here a point of responds to 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.680
 principle here is the site has been more 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.380
 What can you have on the map? 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.820
 me so I can cover one here and if 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.120
 wants a colleague countryman also here 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.040
 another covering there and this is one thing 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.479
 I really like that you can go like this 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.070
 the maps below 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.189
 you can go through this map below like this 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.400
 rus and fight below is very good 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.950
 I'm really cool 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.020
 an oil plant was going to say is 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.829
 a dam look that water 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.640
 is a prey here there is no more to teach 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:30.090
 here is the cube is the tour in the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.759
 little bridge here there is a good other bridge 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.619
 that you have here as well as this badge 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.439
 to cover you shoot there those who 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.539
 see out there gets there or thereabouts is 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.179
 can enter on that side and for this 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.520
 also that is, there is nothing, there is no 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.619
 problem let's first teach that one 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.240
 side we 're going to see a round and go 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.479
 to teach then the center as a game 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.479
 always here you have a site as well as a 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.479
 wardrobe a kind of wardrobe that 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.849
 you have one there there another fuck 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.220
 that does not break you have another one here 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.439
 you can also russia around here 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.140
 down in plan you get in here now and 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.310
 such and such I will now teach it from 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.250
 no way 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.959
 around here you can go up to the center 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.860
 you can go up to the center as you have seen 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.290
 there another one the other wardrobe that 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.940
 there are always two entries there are always two 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.770
 entries in all the sites so that you do not 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.140
 can they be so they can not 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.420
 exaggerated way here in case you want 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.540
 back you can check back below 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.250
 out there over here and so they do not see you and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.800
 here another site does a little campero 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.780
 which are the two containers of the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.780
 spams of the response 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.360
 and this is a site a turbine there 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.140
 a turbine and here you can go here 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.930
 down 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.930
 be down here is what happens 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.150
 the sirens and the voices similarly 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.910
 that it has happened that there has been an exit 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.760
 massive water and then it's killed you 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.050
 roll and kill you 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.260
 and to see 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.900
 I was down there that is can be lowered 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.590
 around here another with another kind wardrobe 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.660
 smaller is not a wardrobe is like 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.580
 command centers to say it some 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.380
 way is a command center they are centers 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.510
 of command here this is the center all the 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.770
 center there is another tunnel like that of 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.410
 there 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:31.190
 and he sat on 30 bridge 34 and it 's the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.380
 bridge 21 is the plan as two zones I 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.330
 I would say there are two zones in the area 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.310
 blue because if you look at everything it's so 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.650
 blue all the lines and everything is in 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.560
 blue and this is the red zone that is 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.650
 all in red all lines all all 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.400
 in red and also the command centers 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.990
 are in red and those in blue and now 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.880
 As you can see, the water has come out and not 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.100
 nothing happens we are as normal before 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.780
 here you can go up if the 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.640
 water and you go up here so it does not kill you 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.460
 in case you're in the middle here another 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.800
 turbine 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.330
 and we have already gone around the map and now 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.220
 we have seen a little bit of downtown 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.810
 this is the center here you have a 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.300
 van to hide makes you a 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.660
 little bit here as you can open 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.020
 so from behind get in here or go down 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.320
 over there and around here another van and another 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.580
 of these other giant salt pipe and 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.140
 I think there's nothing more to teach 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:29.580
 on this map so well what I said like 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.289
 favorites that always help a lot 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.210
 subscribe if you are not subscribed 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.879
 also talk a lot and now we 're not going 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.439
 to throw there and see what happens and good 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:39.500
 kids until next time 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:39.500
 I 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.820
 you crossed the grenade and everything
