00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.650
 Me, why does a person live alone? 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.590
 and have no one to talk to and so are two 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.900

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.590
 we started as the conversations and this 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.740
 talk to this subject is not gonna stay

 on and will not let go 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.420
 because I think it 's an activity 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.290
 acting we've dealt with the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.660
 others

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.930
 boring learning participation during

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.459

 cohesion and social participation 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.940

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.190
 replicated at locations not needed 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.920

 a strong partnership between the community and the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.730
 local institutions 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.440
 the typhoon etau cachinho can be seen 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.780
 as the sustainable solution for 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.090
 preserving the quality and the belt 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.890
