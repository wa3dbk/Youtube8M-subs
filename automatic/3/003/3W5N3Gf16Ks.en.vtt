that<00:00:24.040> everything<00:00:24.580> I<00:00:24.760> do<00:00:24.820> from<00:00:25.150> now<00:00:25.240> on<00:00:25.599> I<00:00:25.630> video

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
that everything I do from now on I video

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.109 
that everything I do from now on I video
I<00:00:26.490> don't<00:00:27.490> know<00:00:27.550> why<00:00:27.700> but<00:00:29.520> we<00:00:30.520> are<00:00:30.699> in<00:00:31.000> the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
I don't know why but we are in the

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.890 
I don't know why but we are in the
process<00:00:31.359> of<00:00:32.020> putting<00:00:32.710> in<00:00:32.949> all<00:00:33.100> new<00:00:33.370> batteries

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
process of putting in all new batteries

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.860 
process of putting in all new batteries
more<00:00:34.900> solar<00:00:35.320> and<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:38.519> we<00:00:39.519> are<00:00:39.699> creating<00:00:40.510> our

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
more solar and so we are creating our

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.330 
more solar and so we are creating our
jumper<00:00:41.379> wires<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:43.300> go<00:00:43.860> between<00:00:44.860> our

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
jumper wires that go between our

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.510 
jumper wires that go between our
batteries<00:00:45.730> are<00:00:45.969> series<00:00:46.450> wires<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:47.860> nine

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
batteries are series wires there nine

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.470 
batteries are series wires there nine
inches<00:00:48.880> long<00:00:49.200> we're<00:00:50.200> putting<00:00:50.530> our<00:00:50.649> endzone

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
inches long we're putting our endzone

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.030 
inches long we're putting our endzone
ripping<00:00:52.480> them<00:00:52.570> down<00:00:52.809> and<00:00:53.110> then<00:00:53.230> work<00:00:53.469> hate

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
ripping them down and then work hate

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.240 
ripping them down and then work hate
shrinking<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:56.020> as<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.469> see<00:00:56.710> I'm<00:00:56.890> cutting

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
shrinking so as you see I'm cutting

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.090 
shrinking so as you see I'm cutting
roughly<00:00:57.730> a<00:00:57.940> half<00:00:58.899> inch<00:00:59.200> of<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.500> insulation

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
roughly a half inch of the insulation

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.820 
roughly a half inch of the insulation
off<00:01:00.280> this<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:01.660> all<00:01:01.840> cable<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:04.629> ott<00:01:04.899> yeah<00:01:05.649> it's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
off this to all cable to ott yeah it's

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.260 
off this to all cable to ott yeah it's
too<00:01:06.009> old<00:01:06.220> okay<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:08.170> like<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.820> we'll<00:01:10.090> need

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
too old okay it's like like we'll need

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.359 
too old okay it's like like we'll need
like<00:01:10.330> welding<00:01:10.690> table<00:01:11.050> shorter<00:01:11.560> no<00:01:12.100> I'm<00:01:12.160> not

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
like welding table shorter no I'm not

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.260 
like welding table shorter no I'm not
overdoing<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.090> her<00:01:13.479> do<00:01:13.660> you<00:01:13.750> need<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.590> minimum

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
overdoing it her do you need the minimum

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.770 
overdoing it her do you need the minimum
to<00:01:16.270> all<00:01:16.450> cables<00:01:16.899> is<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.530> maximum<00:01:18.280> size<00:01:19.150> cable

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
to all cables is the maximum size cable

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.330 
to all cables is the maximum size cable
you<00:01:19.930> want<00:01:20.170> between<00:01:20.530> your<00:01:20.680> batteries<00:01:21.040> are<00:01:21.189> so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
you want between your batteries are so

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.289 
you want between your batteries are so
waste<00:01:21.610> this<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.869> for<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.170> best<00:01:23.439> I<00:01:24.299> guess

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
waste this is the for the best I guess

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.330 
waste this is the for the best I guess
you'd<00:01:25.450> call<00:01:25.479> it<00:01:25.630> conductivity<00:01:26.619> of<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.830> DC

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
you'd call it conductivity of the DC

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.270 
you'd call it conductivity of the DC
power<00:01:28.170> evenly<00:01:29.170> distributes<00:01:29.860> all<00:01:30.070> of<00:01:30.189> the

power evenly distributes all of the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.590 
power evenly distributes all of the
power<00:01:30.490> okay<00:01:32.640> that's<00:01:33.640> what<00:01:33.790> I've<00:01:33.909> been<00:01:33.939> told<00:01:34.270> I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
power okay that's what I've been told I

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.370 
power okay that's what I've been told I
just<00:01:35.080> lost<00:01:35.229> my<00:01:35.380> ratio<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:38.020> that<00:01:38.170> on<00:01:38.259> video

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
just lost my ratio get that on video

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.350 
just lost my ratio get that on video
didn't<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:38.860> yep<00:01:39.220> sure<00:01:39.430> did<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:43.030> cut<00:01:43.240> my

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
didn't you yep sure did if I cut my

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.179 
didn't you yep sure did if I cut my
shelf<00:01:43.600> you'll<00:01:43.720> have<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:43.960> on<00:01:44.110> video<00:01:44.229> too

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189

this<00:01:51.189> cable<00:01:51.640> i<00:01:51.670> bought<00:01:52.890> expensive<00:01:53.890> cable<00:01:55.079> but

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
this cable i bought expensive cable but

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:03.870 
this cable i bought expensive cable but
as<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.350> see<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.969> got<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.299> ton<00:01:58.780> soon<00:02:01.079> now<00:02:02.880> put

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
as you see it's got a ton soon now put

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.809 
as you see it's got a ton soon now put

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
an end on both ends keep them the same

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.609 
an end on both ends keep them the same
way<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.420> go<00:02:07.600> outside<00:02:07.719> picked<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.259> heck<00:02:08.440> out
