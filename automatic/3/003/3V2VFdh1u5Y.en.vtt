 Hello Shimura is my good 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:17.020
 Today I would like to introduce this Love Kiss Lowry lipstick 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.620
 That child says have become a form of something roses where the open 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.690
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.370
 Open 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.260
 I have written here this is maybe love kiss rouge lipstick 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.880
 But I think that it is written 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.720
 In Urawa 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.720
 Something like this 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.440
 Something here 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.859
 It's very crunchy 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.859
 There is an ace here when I open it for a moment 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.280
 It began to like a smoked network in the others 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.840
 My lips are so easy to dry 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:01.440
 I bought it because I wanted to do it, but it was like this. 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.220
 When I do not use it seems to be like this. When I use it, I removed it from here and then 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.269
 I've come this way 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.620
 It seems to light up 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.450
 And then 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.790
 Here Kana 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.260
 I'm sorry I'm a lecturer I'm a lecturer 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.360
 It looks like I 'm turning around 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.630
 It came out to this place 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:30.650
 8 I would like to use it forever 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:33.980
 I mean, before I applied, I was so glossy that I could get along with my lips 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.640
 Although it was uneasy, the complaint attached to me properly 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:42.350
 It does not have become the angle of view 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.820
 Softening shoes and TsuyoTsuyo strength of feeling rather than that there was here 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.280
 I now 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.580
 Something 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.800
 I felt that say Do not bought a full-fledged cosmetics 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.950
 I'd had expected the feeling ish little more toys 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.180
 I think I did not do that 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.820
 And today introduced this lip 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.820
