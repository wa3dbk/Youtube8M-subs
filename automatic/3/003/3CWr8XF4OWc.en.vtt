00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.230 
actually change the background here so
we'll<00:01:32.270> select<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:32.869> background<00:01:33.409> image<00:01:34.240> we'll

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
we'll select a background image we'll

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.560 
we'll select a background image we'll
select<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.630> unique<00:01:35.930> apps<00:01:36.170> logo<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.570> we'll

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
have all these come down here and just

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:59.750 
have all these come down here and just
bust<00:01:47.119> off

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.790 

and<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.660> can<00:02:00.840> actually<00:02:00.990> destroy<00:02:01.620> the

and you can actually destroy the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.500 
and you can actually destroy the
background<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.430> by<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:03.180> ahead<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
background here by going ahead and

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.070 
background here by going ahead and
getting<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.870> machine<00:02:04.290> gun<00:02:04.500> out<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:05.990> going<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080

power<00:02:07.320> consumed

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.350 

so<00:02:13.110> kind<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.439> simple<00:02:13.769> application<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.700> can

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
so kind of a simple application but can

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.449 
so kind of a simple application but can
be<00:02:15.510> fun<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:15.959> I'm<00:02:16.140> not<00:02:16.470> saying<00:02:17.370> this

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
be fun it's I'm not saying this

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.460 
be fun it's I'm not saying this
application<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.269> going<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:19.439> know

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470
