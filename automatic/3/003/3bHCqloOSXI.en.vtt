the glitch pathway and it'll keep the
Panzer<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.609> game<00:03:51.819> now<00:03:52.450> this<00:03:52.659> glitch<00:03:52.930> does

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
Panzer in the game now this glitch does

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.619 
Panzer in the game now this glitch does
take<00:03:53.680> some<00:03:53.889> practice<00:03:53.950> but<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.879> is<00:03:55.090> totally

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629
