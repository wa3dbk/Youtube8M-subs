00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.029
 he already does that for a while 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.490
 the penguins from madagascar the location 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.080
 to come we were requested whole 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.500
 classically asked for the idea in the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.970
 localization steam here in germany 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:20.160
 When it was called we demand the idea 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.720
 that we at madagascar the penguins 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.900
 speak has been born here 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.550
 the German dubbing voice got the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.140
 American version and then at 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.429
 Occupy came to the idea that was 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340
 The penguins are great 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.690
 a band so little money expensive at least 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.360
 also succeed or anything with one 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.950
 to take cultural cohesion as a course 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.390
 to be able to synchronize is added 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.610
 even that as a man I was requested 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.860
 the lust there is a role there 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.600
 just a movie of dreamworks and there 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.710
 there's a side roll of four penguins 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.590
 that would be so cool if the talks 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.670
 that could of course be great first 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.020
 Sync- talk animated film makes 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.780
 Personally fall big street 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.449
 great idea and then it was still called that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.829
 almost like a band is and we were 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.480
 but just a little bit 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.039
 a bit like that after album production 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.140
 torn and one of us was im 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.369
 holiday but not so much else 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.080
 speaks also with our band of 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.700
 looks and says that does not matter 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.409
 it also has no speaking role 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.180
 that was twice as funny for him 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.770
 and we insisted that on 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.150
 the end of madagascar 1 all four speak 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.320
 although that does not matter to them 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.810
 spoken and not speaking 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.130
 Nevertheless , they speak and from there something 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.310
 of course this is very big 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.080
 Success has been and always in 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.420
 Continuations went on in the new episodes 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.890
 that we continue to speak the penguins 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.259
 Of course that's a great gift 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.150
 and often know the role these the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.619
 to play four colleagues and yes and it 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.540
 I also sat five or six 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.390
 No idea what I mean to my role 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.229
 skipper accompanied and it was already after 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.840
 the first movie 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.310
 if we do that again and again someday 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.060
 So another feature movie is featured 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.189
 would give 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.200
 with the penguin and now the time has come 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.729
 and he is ready and that now 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.049
 much bigger than anything else 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.649
 At least, penguins have done so far 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.740
 on the big screen and what you believe 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.119
 you where the success of the penguins is that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.700
 they are the ones now 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.200
 get spin-off 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.149
 Of course they are just great 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.130
 minor role in madagascar I think so too 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.780
 king julien hammer character but the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.340
 Of course, penguins picture because they are so cute 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.160
 are our tough guys 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.840
 at the same time and completely crazy it is 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.209
 almost to the action and completely crazy 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.800
 things are totally fearless they are 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.570
 the animals that can not fly but 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.610
 they fly in the movie all the time 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.959
 they are the ones they made themselves 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.970
 the action before because there very very 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.160
 also simply pushed ever 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.200
 with theirs they were the animals 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.500
 have brought home and so on 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.380
 continue 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.660
 what are a very impulsive 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.220
 Big ones are total action type and that 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.860
 is definitely what i am suitable for 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.830
 a fun animated movie now 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.510
 do you have the role of the little boy ? 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:00.480
 from then exactly annoying of the general 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.300
 Sweet little Knobbly penguins 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.530
 how much of that is in you and 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.459
 how much of free is in smudo 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.750
 So of course I'm here with us too 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.470
 the sweet cuddly and the nesthÃ¤kchen 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.730
 clearly in the private of me is so 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.019
 a lot in it as well as in all of us 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.610
 missing and also like all of the 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.500
 penguins loyalty between the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.739
 penguin is very tall and is also at 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.120
 us in the benzer no matter what if we look 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.290
 as a band have decided something too 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.730
 if individuals do not like that 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.380
 wear that the others do with us 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.640
 that and then it's going forward for everyone 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.560
 and there we are all completely 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.400
 agree otherwise infected since not much of me 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.040
 in there personally 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.980
 it is it in the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.010
 co-roles are so synonymous relative 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.840
 simple types now have kinofilm 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.000
 the something like a course and before 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.400
 everything private is a complex character 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.290
 and transforms us transforms 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.269
 Also in the film which is quite exciting because it 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.010
 when we talk what we talk too 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.690
 always so high and this time he has an out 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.000
 few moments where he is so a bit 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.040
 it comes true that it is real 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.640
 but otherwise I think it would be 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.950
 exaggerated to say this 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.450
 this complexity the love for 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.060
 roadmap you danced us already a bit 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.920
 van aken very little teaser maybe 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.300
 what awaits us from those of the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.250
 penguins from madagascar have their own 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.290
 Above all, we learn film at the very beginning 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.380
 the origin that knows him is clear 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.549
 here still eternal ice but like her 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.540
 The relationship has become known 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.770
 between skipper the boss and is like 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.540
 a father-son relationship like that 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.070
 is created and then what the 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.080
 actually do what theirs really do 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.790
 real passion has been you 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.800
 the crazy ones break out of theory 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.540
 wanted and now they are now 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.250
 get that with why they are so 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.770
 get along very exciting and one 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:46.850
 action so I thought several times 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:48.020
 look like this is just crazy 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.250
 from the third part was already neat 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.990
 but thats nothing compared to 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.580
 Now I think we are through her 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.870
 must moderate him by the warning strike 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.250
 access by the in any case the 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.300
 thumb thank you thank you very much 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.300
 all good things good
