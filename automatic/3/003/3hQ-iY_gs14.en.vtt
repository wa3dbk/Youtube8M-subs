over the past few weeks with the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.600 
over the past few weeks with the
parading<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.590> these<00:00:47.570> poor<00:00:48.570> captives<00:00:49.110> on

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
parading of these poor captives on

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.290 
parading of these poor captives on
various<00:00:51.350> -<00:00:52.350> videos<00:00:52.890> was<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.969> there<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
various - videos was that there was a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.360 
various - videos was that there was a
sense<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.379> happening<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.920> Egypt

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
sense that this was happening to Egypt

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.119 
sense that this was happening to Egypt
and<00:00:56.579> particularly<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> Christians<00:00:58.129> I

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
and particularly to the Christians I

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.200 
and particularly to the Christians I
think<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.270> were<00:01:00.449> coming<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.530> sense<00:01:01.800> of

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
think we were coming to a sense of

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.690 
think we were coming to a sense of
reconciliation<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.930> sense<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:05.070> calming

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
reconciliation and a sense of of calming

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.620 
reconciliation and a sense of of calming
but<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.540> has<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:07.790> brought<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
but this has really brought back a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.390 
but this has really brought back a
feeling<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> pain<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:12.240> feeling<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.400> there

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
feeling of pain and a feeling that there

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.609 
feeling of pain and a feeling that there
is<00:01:14.430> still<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> lot<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.119> do<00:01:15.540> before<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.470> can

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
is still a lot to do before we can

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.580 
is still a lot to do before we can
achieve<00:01:17.189> more<00:01:17.729> peace<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.479> can't<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.259> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
achieve more peace we can't and of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.260 
achieve more peace we can't and of
course<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:20.009> shouldn't<00:01:20.250> extract<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
course we shouldn't extract the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
course we shouldn't extract the
religious<00:01:21.750> component<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.070> horrible

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
religious component from the horrible

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.830 
religious component from the horrible
events<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.090> taken<00:01:24.210> place<00:01:24.390> over<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
events that have taken place over the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.870

past<00:01:24.900> few<00:01:25.320> hours<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.460> understand

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
past few hours we think we understand

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.319 
past few hours we think we understand
but<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.840> seems<00:01:28.170> looking<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> region<00:01:30.150> as

term - because I find a difficulty in

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.660 
term - because I find a difficulty in
affairs<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.500> state<00:02:01.799> because<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.310> states<00:02:02.579> have

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
affairs of state because the states have

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.690

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
systems and they don't do this but but

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.639 
systems and they don't do this but but
it<00:02:06.509> seems<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.110> very<00:02:07.290> narrowing

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
it seems to be a very narrowing

oh<00:03:49.320> no<00:03:49.500> I'm<00:03:49.650> sure<00:03:49.709> they<00:03:50.040> believe<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.519> what

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
oh no I'm sure they believe in what

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.050 
oh no I'm sure they believe in what
they're<00:03:50.820> doing

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
they're doing

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.990 
they're doing
but<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.660> still<00:03:52.320> have<00:03:52.530> faith<00:03:52.769> that<00:03:53.100> even<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.700> small

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
but I still have faith that even a small

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.340 
but I still have faith that even a small
proportion<00:03:54.360> they<00:03:54.630> have<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.780> sense<00:03:55.019> of<00:03:55.140> humanity

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
proportion they have a sense of humanity

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.380 
proportion they have a sense of humanity
call<00:03:55.800> upon<00:03:56.100> now<00:03:56.550> we're<00:03:56.820> not<00:03:56.910> so<00:03:57.090> we're<00:03:57.239> saying

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
call upon now we're not so we're saying

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.210 
call upon now we're not so we're saying
it's<00:03:57.510> not<00:03:57.570> about<00:03:57.690> faith<00:03:58.080> but<00:03:58.110> for<00:03:58.620> them<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:59.010> is

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
it's not about faith but for them it is

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.479 
it's not about faith but for them it is
and<00:03:59.610> so<00:04:00.239> therefore<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:01.110> is<00:04:01.170> up<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.620> people<00:04:01.890> who

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
and so therefore it is up to people who

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.820 
and so therefore it is up to people who
are<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.880> teach<00:04:03.150> them<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:04.320> is<00:04:04.560> not

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
are to teach them that this is not

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.310 
are to teach them that this is not
really<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.610> way<00:04:05.880> they<00:04:06.060> live<00:04:06.269> their<00:04:06.300> faith<00:04:06.480> to

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
really the way they live their faith to

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.020 
really the way they live their faith to
be<00:04:07.440> able<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.800> do<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.070> as<00:04:08.250> robustly<00:04:08.700> as<00:04:08.850> they

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
be able to do that as robustly as they

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.060 
be able to do that as robustly as they
can<00:04:09.239> for<00:04:09.750> them<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.110> is<00:04:10.230> about<00:04:10.410> faith<00:04:10.650> for<00:04:10.980> them

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
can for them it is about faith for them

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.699 
can for them it is about faith for them
it's<00:04:11.190> defending<00:04:11.670> their<00:04:11.880> faith<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.810> but<00:04:13.500> if

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
it's defending their faith but but if

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.490 
it's defending their faith but but if
we're<00:04:13.950> saying<00:04:14.160> it's<00:04:14.370> not<00:04:14.610> then<00:04:15.360> we<00:04:15.390> need<00:04:15.570> to

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
Egyptian authorities could do as much as
