00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
eating up space because the zip file

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
eating up space because the zip file
doesn't<00:01:34.320> really<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.680> anything<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.460> so

the<00:01:42.750> app<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.200> beta<00:01:43.380> there<00:01:43.680> aren't<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> whole

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the app is in beta there aren't a whole

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.249 
the app is in beta there aren't a whole
lot<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.670> worlds<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.479> I've<00:01:45.630> added<00:01:45.930> yet

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
lot of worlds that I've added yet

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.480 
lot of worlds that I've added yet
because<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.649> will<00:01:46.710> take<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> while<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.369> get

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
because that will take a while to get

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.300 
because that will take a while to get
done<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.810> say<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.009> were<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
done so say that you were in the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.219 
done so say that you were in the
minecraft<00:01:50.790> forums<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.570> downloaded<00:01:52.110> your

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
minecraft forums and you downloaded your

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.020 
minecraft forums and you downloaded your
own<00:01:52.409> world<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.040> want<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.310> wanted<00:01:53.880> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
own world and you want to wanted to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.969 
own world and you want to wanted to
install<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.479> well<00:01:55.170> I've<00:01:55.290> even<00:01:55.560> made<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
install it well I've even made that

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.490 
install it well I've even made that
easier<00:01:56.159> too<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.299> install<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> map<00:01:58.079> it'll

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
easier too so if you install a map it'll

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.200 
easier too so if you install a map it'll
take<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.070> file<00:01:59.310> browser<00:01:59.640> here<00:02:00.000> which

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
take you to this file browser here which

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.300 
take you to this file browser here which
is<00:02:00.450> taking<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.500> downloads<00:02:02.159> folder

is taking you to your downloads folder

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.980 
is taking you to your downloads folder

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
