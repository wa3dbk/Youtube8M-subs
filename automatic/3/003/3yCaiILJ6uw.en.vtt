00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.690
 there are companies faberlik these lipsticks they 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.910
 first appeared long ago were alone 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.579
 shades then some shades removed 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.460
 replaced with other shades some 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.259
 stayed and this lipstick and tried 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.630
 quite recently and therefore want 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.300
 share with you your impressions 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.079
 lipstick is very interesting in the performance of something 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.780
 she has a very interesting tube 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.359
 the contents of the lipstick are in such here 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.780
 as if the container tubes and the brush itself 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:45.929
 is in a separate compartment such here 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.410
 the way she pulls out the tassel is very 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:51.960
 comfortable and flat it is comfortable to apply 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.670
 I am a brush and very well and lipstick I love 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.609
 apply with a brush so for me 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.559
 very good that lipstick comes with 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.510
 tassel 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.670
 the brush is a nice villus to me perfectly 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.589
 does not fall 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.860
 very good quality tassel 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.750
 there is a brush on each tube 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.259
 there is a sticker on each lipstick 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.220
 Nakleechka Nakleechki written 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:20.610
 lipstick number and date of manufacture 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.909
 Nakleechka she double inside there is the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.320
 there is on sticks like this 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.090
 connects and here inside is 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.140
 the composition that is and now that the composition 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.619
 This lipstick includes a list 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.320
 if you give well measure on a scale 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.200
 ten-point scale there is a pack 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.380
 then I would rate him at 10 points 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.289
 then how comfortable is it ? 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.469
 eight shades now I'll show you 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:56.930
 only three of which i use 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.930
 it's a shade of 42 91 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:10.209
 shade 42 91 this sugar rose there is still 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:15.129
 here is such a shade 44 28 tatyana to 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.930
 called strawberry juice one of 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.750
 shades I use and the other two 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:25.799
 I am here at the office as 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.799
 samples and there is another chuck 4427 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.920
 By the way it is called karamelnaya 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.049
 nougat I saw a lot of reviews on this 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.930
 creamy lipstick that with a brush and y 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.930
 other YouTube and they talked about 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.760
 but one of them, for example, I watched 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.540
 Natalya Petrova Anna said that 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.340
 she liked very much 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.530
 this lipstick but she had other shades 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.140
 what i want here i use the moment 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.840
 a shade of 42 91 now I have 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.510
 on the lips and what I want to say about him 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.299
 No, but the quality of the lipstick is not very 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.209
 I liked it because it is about sushi 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.459
 the book of life I sow when ours is fast 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.340
 somehow lips are absorbed not lips 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.010
 tightened and become dry here 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.440
 another youtube she told about 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.250
 shade from about the same lipstick but 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.609
 other shades that I noticed in general that 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.099
 for example, if you take the air flow 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:29.079
 lipstick too companies faberlik she I 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.169
 I tried with pearl pearl 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.639
 air, too, we dried the lips of God and 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:38.829
 then I took a lipstick and a different shade 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.109
 from the same series and it turned out 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.760
 what 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.829
 lipstick from the same series but different 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.569
 shade without nacre she does me 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.150
 perfect fit then final dried 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.700
 google I understood that here rather 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.160
 just the same story that some 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.400
 some shades they have some 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.819
 sushi warring effect again those 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.260
 shades about which said another 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.150
 blogger she told that and very 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.340
 liked the quality of lipstick rather 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.680
 All this those lipsticks which not possess 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.640
 such an effect and most likely if 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.190
 buy it other shades they 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.340
 will not dry your lips and I found a way out 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.729
 for myself as a brush 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.310
 like help somehow feel sorry for her somewhere 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:27.360
 Do here if it was such an option 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.660
 it can be used without damage 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.250
 my lips let's say so I took a balm 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.370
 there I take a protective lip balm 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.870
 winter I put it on lips first 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.729
 then on this balm on our 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.919
 directly this one like me 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.470
 tassel you already wear this here 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.360
 lipstick still want to say about 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.820
 the qualities of this lipstick 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.380
 most likely it no longer goes either 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.130
 lipstick i.e. it doesn't fit tight 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.590
 a layer on the lips and when itâ€™s ours 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.350
 gives you the effect of semi gloss semi lipstick 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.389
 so if you are used again 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.940
 use lipstick 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.789
 then you do not cream lipstick with a brush 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.030
 not really fit when we are not 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.620
 end i'll leave the tube all the same 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.930
 because firstly I'm somewhere in 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.090
 I read the Internet as much as possible 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.520
 use when lipstick ends 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.669
 she has some definite of her 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.430
 part in this one 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.190
 compartment in which is attached in the pier 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.320
 barrels where lipstick itself is attached and 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.789
 First, I put it for the sake of a brush 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.729
 because I brush very 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:35.039
 liked very well applied and 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.050
 Again, the view and I read that you can 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.660
 this lipstick that basically you and 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.490
 painted if you really liked 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.320
 it is perfect in quality and shade 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.500
 You can come here this part 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.240
 which remained in the mole of the barrel that is in 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.000
 the tube of lipstick that you donâ€™t 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.310
 dyed it impossible to paint it here 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.729
 can melt in some way but 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.169
 most likely I will make a separate video and 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.870
 tell you i will share this secret and 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:04.349
 you can melt the lipstick and place it 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.680
 let 's say that's when it ends 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.750
 creamy lipstick itself another lipstick 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.270
 which is still possible her here 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.949
 place in that compartment and 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.770
 respectively, and use their 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:19.039
 favorite lipstick and apply and use 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.039
 tassels
