the Great Patriotic War and the reason

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.730 
the Great Patriotic War and the reason
why<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.540> sleet<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.350> unique<00:02:40.620> because

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
why the sleet is so unique because

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.020 
why the sleet is so unique because
Russia<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.310> one<00:02:41.460> of<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.640> countries<00:02:42.000> that

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
Russia is one of the countries that

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.240 
Russia is one of the countries that

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
needs it the most because the majority

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.660 
needs it the most because the majority

the best one for the job and right now

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.160 
the best one for the job and right now
Russia<00:03:06.900> owns<00:03:07.200> six<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:08.010> such<00:03:08.220> icebreakers<00:03:09.170> okay
