how you can use this as a guide for
proportions<00:02:14.569> for<00:02:16.030> any<00:02:17.030> kind<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.510> armor<00:02:17.810> that

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050

you want to make many of you make your

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.710 
you want to make many of you make your
averages<00:02:21.110> differently<00:02:21.680> than<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.190> do<00:02:22.250> and

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
averages differently than I do and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.040 
averages differently than I do and
that's<00:02:23.720> just<00:02:23.959> fine<00:02:24.819> I<00:02:25.819> got<00:02:26.330> this<00:02:26.510> pair<00:02:26.989> of

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
that's just fine I got this pair of

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.530 
that's just fine I got this pair of
calipers<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:28.790> gives<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.150> your<00:02:29.330> head

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
calipers and this gives you your head

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.040 
calipers and this gives you your head
measuring<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:31.480> then<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.630> got<00:02:32.810> the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
measuring and then you got the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.410 
measuring and then you got the
measurement<00:02:33.530> down<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.950> bottom<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.370> your

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
measurement down to the bottom of your

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.740 
measurement down to the bottom of your
rib<00:02:35.420> cage<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:37.069> can<00:02:37.220> actually<00:02:37.670> measure<00:02:38.480> the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
rib cage you can actually measure the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.440 
rib cage you can actually measure the
whole<00:02:38.900> rib<00:02:39.140> cage<00:02:39.440> or<00:02:39.910> measured<00:02:40.910> by<00:02:41.090> heads

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
whole rib cage or measured by heads

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.380 
whole rib cage or measured by heads
which<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.080> normal<00:02:42.800> we<00:02:43.790> get<00:02:43.940> this<00:02:44.090> head

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
which is normal we get this head

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.770 
which is normal we get this head
properly<00:02:45.370> placed<00:02:46.370> here<00:02:47.500> there<00:02:48.500> we<00:02:48.620> go<00:02:50.620> and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
properly placed here there we go and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.120 
properly placed here there we go and
three<00:02:53.780> heads<00:02:53.959> down<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.410> should<00:02:54.440> meet<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
three heads down it should meet to the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.590 
three heads down it should meet to the
bottom<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.790> ribcage<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.190> then<00:02:58.600> another

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
bottom of the ribcage and then another

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.100 
bottom of the ribcage and then another
head<00:02:59.930> down<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:01.480> point<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.660> bone<00:03:02.900> in

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
head down to the point of the bone in

head down to the point of the bone in
the<00:03:03.230> groin<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:05.180> then<00:03:05.299> you<00:03:05.450> go<00:03:05.570> back<00:03:05.780> up<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.700> it

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
the groin and then you go back up and it

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.569 
the groin and then you go back up and it
should<00:03:07.940> be<00:03:07.970> almost<00:03:08.510> two<00:03:08.959> heads<00:03:09.430> from<00:03:10.430> that

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
should be almost two heads from that

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.640 
should be almost two heads from that
point<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:11.570> point<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.230> same<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.620> that

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
point to that point and the same to that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.330 
point to that point and the same to that
point<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:15.709> anyway<00:03:15.950> there's<00:03:16.160> your

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
point and but anyway there's your

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.789 
point and but anyway there's your
measurements<00:03:16.910> right<00:03:17.060> there<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:18.410> can<00:03:18.620> measure

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
measurements right there you can measure

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.090 
measurements right there you can measure
the<00:03:19.040> width<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.459> this<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:19.970> hips<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.950> can

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
the width of this the hips you can

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.830 
the width of this the hips you can
measure<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.549> heights<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.120> hips<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.690> can

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
measure the heights of the hips you can

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.210 
measure the heights of the hips you can
measure<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.320> width<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:26.410> thorax<00:03:27.410> the

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
measure the width of the thorax the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.580 
measure the width of the thorax the
heights<00:03:28.459> of<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.760> thorax<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:29.900> then<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.470> can

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
heights of the thorax and then you can

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.830 
heights of the thorax and then you can
go<00:03:30.709> from<00:03:30.859> there<00:03:30.950> as<00:03:31.370> well<00:03:31.760> as<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.150> length<00:03:32.600> of

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
go from there as well as the length of

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.280 
go from there as well as the length of
the<00:03:34.209> bone<00:03:35.209> here<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:36.140> bone<00:03:36.320> there<00:03:38.290> this

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
the bone here and a bone there this

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.819 
the bone here and a bone there this
elbow<00:03:39.859> should<00:03:40.130> fall<00:03:40.579> in<00:03:40.790> right<00:03:41.470> even<00:03:42.470> with<00:03:42.590> the

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
elbow should fall in right even with the

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.560 
elbow should fall in right even with the
bottom<00:03:43.310> of<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.459> rib<00:03:43.640> cage<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.180> does<00:03:44.359> on

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
bottom of the rib cage and it does on

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.090 
bottom of the rib cage and it does on
this<00:03:46.870> but<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:48.079> way<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.320> can<00:03:48.709> make<00:03:48.890> your<00:03:49.040> own

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
this but that way you can make your own

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.840 
this but that way you can make your own
armatures<00:03:50.090> at<00:03:50.359> home<00:03:50.900> from<00:03:51.859> this<00:03:52.100> armature<00:03:52.489> so

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
armatures at home from this armature so

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.110 
armatures at home from this armature so
you<00:03:52.910> could<00:03:53.720> buy<00:03:53.930> this<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.730> if<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.940> don't

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
you could buy this and if you don't

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.050 
you could buy this and if you don't
decide<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:56.959> use<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.560> if<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.370> decide<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.819> save

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
decide to use it if you decide to save

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.539 
decide to use it if you decide to save
it<00:03:59.209> for<00:03:59.390> something<00:03:59.600> special<00:04:00.019> and<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:01.400> will

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
it for something special and you will

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.300 
it for something special and you will
still<00:04:01.819> want<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.120> learn<00:04:02.269> your<00:04:02.780> proportions<00:04:03.500> you

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
still want to learn your proportions you

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.360 
still want to learn your proportions you
can<00:04:04.430> learn<00:04:04.640> it<00:04:04.700> off<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:06.560> armature<00:04:06.980> itself

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
can learn it off the the armature itself

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.349 
can learn it off the the armature itself
now<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:08.390> smaller<00:04:08.799> armature<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:10.579> 18<00:04:11.000> incher

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
now the smaller armature the 18 incher

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.650 
now the smaller armature the 18 incher
doesn't<00:04:12.169> have<00:04:12.380> the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
doesn't have the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.350 
doesn't have the
bones<00:04:12.810> in<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.230> arm<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.970> that's<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.120> only

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
bones in the arm and that's the only

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.009 
bones in the arm and that's the only
difference<00:04:16.730> it's<00:04:17.730> just<00:04:18.000> smaller<00:04:18.510> hand

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
difference it's just smaller hand

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:27.770 
difference it's just smaller hand
doesn't<00:04:19.590> have<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.860> bones<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:27.150> i<00:04:27.180> thought<00:04:27.600> i'd

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
doesn't have the bones so i thought i'd

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.410 
doesn't have the bones so i thought i'd
point<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.170> out<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:28.790> you<00:04:29.790> get<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.180> horse

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
point that out to you you get the horse

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.840 
point that out to you you get the horse
armature<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:30.960> do<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.230> same<00:04:31.440> thing<00:04:31.710> now<00:04:32.520> i'm

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
armature and do the same thing now i'm

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.820 
armature and do the same thing now i'm
going<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.120> wait<00:04:33.300> till<00:04:33.630> i<00:04:33.750> get<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:34.200> horse
