00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hey, what 's up, joel, look at this site? 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.940
 Martial again is for you 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.770
 recording a new video and apologizing 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.750
 to you for the sixth match of this series 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.370
 of kick videos have taken so long 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.809
 but I had already recorded and ended 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.740
 giving a problem in the video to record 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 again 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.970
 finally giving sequence to our series 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.100
 consecutive video in the sixth part of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.640
 people to talk about is the impact area the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.250
 impact that consists of two steps 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.439
 one is the impact where you hit your 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.869
 competitor and another part of the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.270
 body you hit your opponent in the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.649
 opponent basically we hit three 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.500
 heights we call high 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.809
 low and high is the height 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.590
 of the knee joints and the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.010
 average internal height ribs 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.530
 and stop the head 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.510
 this part does not have many doubts 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.600
 then most people already know the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.980
 big question is the area that we use 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 to reach the current 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.399
 most people have a great deal of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.090
 doubt that she even asks me 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.909
 next joel at the time of kicking what is 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.979
 best to use the breaststroke or the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.350
 cinnamon this is a big doubt inside 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.330
 martial arts and for being one of the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.060
 great fights I also had this great 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.479
 doubt at the beginning of the career I decided 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.750
 study and delve deeper into this exact 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.610
 that's the subject that made it better than I 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.229
 I came to some conclusions that I 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.509
 I'll introduce you here now. 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.320
 First I'll talk about it, Chest. 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.820
 foot 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.799
 When we talk to the nephew of 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.780
 of the foot many people say that 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.799
 the instep is a part of the body 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.680
 sensitive 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.810
 this in a way compared to cinnamon 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.130
 may actually be true by pt 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.880
 b is much more sensitive than 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.950
 cinnamon 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.350
 but the instep is not as sensitive 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.369
 so he worked well with the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.229
 certain techniques 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.850
 it can get really hard 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.340
 very strong on impact and the other 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.140
 which one has more strength and is exactly that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.299
 that I speak now of the heel of him 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.479
 generates more kicking force 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.790
 ie there is the impact is greater that you 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.799
 can calculate sharply by kicking a 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.239
 ball kicks a ball with the cinnamon and 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.790
 after a ball kicked with the instep 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.950
 you will see of course that the chest of the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.260
 foot will rotate more torque will generate more 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.489
 force and if this is science I am not 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.620
 speaking from a point of view that I am 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.629
 scientifically speaking the breaststroke 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.120
 will generate more impact 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.459
 the cinnamon she goes she has more 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.620
 resistance that is for you that is a 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.900
 beginner kicking the cinnamon might 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.459
 of causing less than two but does not mean 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.760
 which will cause more impact on the opponent 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.040
 and also ends up with a larger area 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.690
 that is either cinnamon stone has its 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.870
 positive and negative points 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.940
 So this is the sixth video I promised. 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.459
 I did it for you guys but I decided to make one. 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.989
 seventh video as a bonus and this video is 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.000
 very important that you watch 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.550
 I decided at the last minute to make this video 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.920
 because it was very cool and I want 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.989
 talk to you about the angles of 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.560
 kick that if you liked this series
