00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
no limit but I think it would be a

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.830 
no limit but I think it would be a
better<00:02:35.579> for<00:02:35.849> horse<00:02:36.030> event<00:02:36.359> of<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.569> final

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
better for horse event of the final

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.660 
better for horse event of the final
table<00:02:37.079> is<00:02:37.170> still<00:02:37.260> horse<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.159> don't<00:02:38.489> mind

playing<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.939> no-limit<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.359> can<00:02:39.540> say<00:02:39.689> that<00:02:39.719> one<00:02:39.959> of

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
playing a no-limit I can say that one of

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.750 
playing a no-limit I can say that one of
my<00:02:40.140> better<00:02:40.290> games<00:02:40.409> a<00:02:40.829> lot<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.430> people<00:02:41.549> are

it's<00:02:43.500> 50,000<00:02:44.219> buy-in<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:46.620> going<00:02:46.709> to

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
it's 50,000 buy-in so it's going to

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.229 
it's 50,000 buy-in so it's going to
really<00:02:46.950> show<00:02:47.219> was<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.519> best<00:02:47.670> player<00:02:47.939> at<00:02:47.969> all

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
the mix games but I really don't think

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.399 
the mix games but I really don't think
that's<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.700> case<00:02:50.819> because<00:02:51.480> it's<00:02:52.139> still<00:02:52.379> a

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
that's the case because it's still a

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.319 
that's the case because it's still a
