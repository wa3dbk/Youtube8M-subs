this piece that sticks out our his toes

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.420 
this piece that sticks out our his toes
going<00:02:24.219> to<00:02:24.310> fold<00:02:24.549> them<00:02:24.670> up<00:02:24.849> like<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:26.310> do<00:02:27.310> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
going to fold them up like that do the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.610 
going to fold them up like that do the
same<00:02:27.670> for<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.150> side<00:02:29.609> like<00:02:30.609> that<00:02:30.639> and<00:02:31.620> fold

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
same for this side like that and fold

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.720

can't<00:05:01.540> look<00:05:01.810> left<00:05:02.140> or<00:05:02.320> right<00:05:02.530> just<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:03.130> little

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
can't look left or right just a little

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.910 
can't look left or right just a little
bit<00:05:05.070> which<00:05:06.070> isn't<00:05:06.430> too<00:05:06.580> bad<00:05:07.440> his<00:05:08.440> shoulders

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
bit which isn't too bad his shoulders

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.710 
bit which isn't too bad his shoulders
have<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.370> ability<00:05:09.730> to<00:05:09.760> rotate<00:05:10.060> all<00:05:10.480> the<00:05:10.510> way

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
have the ability to rotate all the way

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.530 
have the ability to rotate all the way
around<00:05:11.100> although<00:05:12.100> his<00:05:12.370> kibble<00:05:12.850> tends<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.420> get

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
around although his kibble tends to get

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.070 
around although his kibble tends to get
in<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:13.750> way<00:05:13.870> a<00:05:13.900> little<00:05:14.110> bit<00:05:14.610> he<00:05:15.610> can<00:05:15.940> go<00:05:16.810> out

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
in the way a little bit he can go out

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.250 
in the way a little bit he can go out
but<00:05:17.530> not<00:05:17.650> much<00:05:18.240> however<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.420> can<00:05:19.450> cheat<00:05:19.840> by

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
but not much however you can cheat by

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.760 
but not much however you can cheat by
moving<00:05:21.160> his<00:05:21.310> arm<00:05:21.670> outward<00:05:22.330> like<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:25.530> he<00:05:26.530> has

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
moving his arm outward like so he has

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:33.960 
moving his arm outward like so he has
excellent<00:05:27.070> elbow<00:05:27.940> articulation<00:05:32.010> he<00:05:33.010> has<00:05:33.220> no

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
excellent elbow articulation he has no

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.150 
excellent elbow articulation he has no
articulation<00:05:34.510> at<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:34.840> wrist<00:05:35.160> no

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
articulation at the wrist no

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.820 
articulation at the wrist no
articulation<00:05:36.760> at<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.330> waist<00:05:37.570> he<00:05:38.410> does<00:05:38.650> have

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
articulation at the waist he does have

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.280 
articulation at the waist he does have
articulation<00:05:39.430> at<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:39.850> hips<00:05:40.090> which<00:05:41.020> allows

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
articulation at the hips which allows

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.780 
articulation at the hips which allows
him<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:41.620> do<00:05:42.330> very<00:05:43.330> nice<00:05:43.540> splits<00:05:44.430> so<00:05:45.430> he<00:05:45.640> can

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
him to do very nice splits so he can

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.660 
him to do very nice splits so he can
enter<00:05:46.090> the<00:05:46.180> ballet<00:05:46.770> you<00:05:47.770> can<00:05:47.920> go<00:05:48.040> forward<00:05:48.370> and

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
enter the ballet you can go forward and

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.190 
enter the ballet you can go forward and
back<00:05:48.820> even<00:05:49.420> though<00:05:49.510> his<00:05:49.540> legs<00:05:49.960> are<00:05:50.110> a<00:05:50.170> little

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
back even though his legs are a little

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.420 
back even though his legs are a little
stubby<00:05:50.740> and<00:05:51.360> he<00:05:52.360> has<00:05:52.630> knee<00:05:53.350> articulation<00:05:54.280> and

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
stubby and he has knee articulation and

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.850 
stubby and he has knee articulation and
a<00:05:55.120> little<00:05:55.510> bit<00:05:55.600> of<00:05:55.630> fluid<00:05:55.930> articulation<00:05:56.620> for

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
a little bit of fluid articulation for

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.080 
a little bit of fluid articulation for
his<00:05:57.010> transformation<00:05:59.610> so<00:06:00.610> you<00:06:00.700> can<00:06:00.850> definitely

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
his transformation so you can definitely

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.740 
his transformation so you can definitely
put<00:06:01.480> this<00:06:01.510> guy<00:06:01.840> in<00:06:01.870> some<00:06:02.290> pretty<00:06:02.500> neat<00:06:02.650> poses

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
put this guy in some pretty neat poses

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.240 
put this guy in some pretty neat poses
the<00:06:04.750> only<00:06:04.930> negative<00:06:05.350> thing<00:06:05.380> about<00:06:05.590> the<00:06:05.950> figure

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
the only negative thing about the figure

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.700 
the only negative thing about the figure
in<00:06:06.370> robot<00:06:06.670> form<00:06:06.730> is<00:06:07.240> that<00:06:07.420> he<00:06:07.660> is<00:06:07.690> hollow<00:06:08.350> in

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
in robot form is that he is hollow in

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.500 
in robot form is that he is hollow in
the<00:06:08.950> back<00:06:10.350> but<00:06:11.350> then<00:06:12.160> again<00:06:12.280> we<00:06:13.000> always<00:06:13.150> knew

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
the back but then again we always knew

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.840 
the back but then again we always knew
that<00:06:13.540> bulkhead<00:06:14.020> was<00:06:14.290> empty<00:06:14.620> inside<00:06:14.850> that's

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
that bulkhead was empty inside that's

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.150 
that bulkhead was empty inside that's
why<00:06:16.060> he<00:06:16.240> fills<00:06:16.510> it<00:06:16.660> up<00:06:16.720> with<00:06:16.900> alcohol<00:06:17.320> here's<00:06:18.010> a

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
why he fills it up with alcohol here's a

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.740 
why he fills it up with alcohol here's a
more<00:06:18.340> detailed<00:06:18.670> look<00:06:18.790> at<00:06:19.030> his<00:06:19.120> head<00:06:19.360> and<00:06:19.540> upper

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
more detailed look at his head and upper

more detailed look at his head and upper
body<00:06:19.870> all<00:06:20.380> around<00:06:20.830> this<00:06:21.040> is<00:06:21.190> an<00:06:21.310> amazing

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
body all around this is an amazing

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.060 
body all around this is an amazing
figure<00:06:22.000> his<00:06:22.540> alt<00:06:22.810> form<00:06:23.140> pegs<00:06:23.440> together<00:06:23.830> and

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
figure his alt form pegs together and

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.010 
figure his alt form pegs together and
stays<00:06:24.280> together<00:06:24.490> very<00:06:24.940> securely<00:06:25.360> his

stays together very securely his
transformation<00:06:26.560> is<00:06:27.010> rather<00:06:27.220> ingenious<00:06:27.730> for

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
transformation is rather ingenious for

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
something this small and his robot form

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.570 
something this small and his robot form
