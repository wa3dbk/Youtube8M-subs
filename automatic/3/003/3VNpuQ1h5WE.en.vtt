I don't know I don't know exactly how it
works<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.750> question<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.560> is<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
works and the question is is the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.189 
works and the question is is the
battlefield<00:01:00.180> 4<00:01:00.510> beta<00:01:02.300> truly<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> beta<00:01:03.840> and

battlefield 4 beta truly a beta and
there's<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> couple<00:01:04.829> different<00:01:05.070> points<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.970> I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
there's a couple different points that I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.179 
there's a couple different points that I
just<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.680> maybe<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.070> can

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
just want to make and then maybe we can

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.980 
just want to make and then maybe we can
have<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> discussion<00:01:08.729> down<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.509> comments

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.500 
expect to see in a beta now the other
thing<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:29.500> flip<00:02:29.860> side<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.550> is<00:02:30.790> kind<00:02:31.330> of

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
thing on the flip side that is kind of

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.360 
thing on the flip side that is kind of
really<00:02:31.870> confusing<00:02:32.320> on<00:02:32.590> top<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:33.040> hang<00:02:33.310> on

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
really confusing on top of hang on

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.370 
really confusing on top of hang on
before<00:02:33.520> i<00:02:33.700> get<00:02:33.820> into<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.030> obviously<00:02:35.020> they

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
before i get into that obviously they

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.320 
before i get into that obviously they
can<00:02:35.590> get<00:02:35.800> an<00:02:35.890> idea<00:02:35.980> on<00:02:36.250> gunplay<00:02:36.880> with<00:02:37.090> the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
can get an idea on gunplay with the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.840 
can get an idea on gunplay with the
weapons<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.750> are<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.110> beta<00:02:38.520> damages<00:02:39.520> and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
weapons that are in the beta damages and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.030 
weapons that are in the beta damages and
so<00:02:40.450> on<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:40.840> forth<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.350> decide<00:02:41.650> whether<00:02:41.950> or

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
so on and so forth and decide whether or

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.980 
so on and so forth and decide whether or
not<00:02:42.160> balance<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.850> looking<00:02:43.150> good<00:02:43.330> on<00:02:43.570> a<00:02:43.600> large

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
not balance is looking good on a large

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.360 
not balance is looking good on a large
large<00:02:44.440> scale<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.840> obviously<00:02:47.470> that

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
large scale so that is obviously that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.010 
large scale so that is obviously that
could<00:02:48.490> even<00:02:48.580> be<00:02:48.730> done<00:02:48.820> in<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.209> demo<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:49.870> could

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
could even be done in a demo that could

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.630 
could even be done in a demo that could
be<00:02:50.110> fixed<00:02:50.260> with<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.500> day<00:02:50.650> one<00:02:50.830> patch<00:02:51.040> normally

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
be fixed with a day one patch normally

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.270 
be fixed with a day one patch normally
it's<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.880> debate<00:02:52.270> between<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:53.410> this<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.680> demo<00:02:54.100> of

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
it's a debate between is this a demo of

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.660 
it's a debate between is this a demo of
the<00:02:54.580> final<00:02:54.910> game<00:02:55.120> or<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.750> this<00:02:56.050> a<00:02:56.320> beta<00:02:57.130> where

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
the final game or is this a beta where

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.520 
the final game or is this a beta where
it's<00:02:58.000> going<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.360> be<00:02:58.450> significantly<00:02:59.110> different

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
it's going to be significantly different

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.990 
it's going to be significantly different
based<00:02:59.830> on<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.820> beta<00:03:01.060> periods<00:03:01.630> impact<00:03:02.310> on<00:03:03.310> the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
game developers data and all that great

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.860 
game developers data and all that great
fun<00:03:07.570> stuff<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.560> other<00:03:08.770> side<00:03:09.370> of<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.670> is<00:03:09.880> and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
fun stuff the other side of it is and

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.449 
fun stuff the other side of it is and
it's<00:03:11.080> not<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:11.410> much<00:03:11.470> we're<00:03:11.920> asking<00:03:12.310> whether

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
it's not so much we're asking whether

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.570 
it's not so much we're asking whether
this<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.940> demo<00:03:13.270> because<00:03:13.860> this<00:03:14.860> should<00:03:15.370> not

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
this is a demo because this should not

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.240 
this is a demo because this should not
be<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.880> demo<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.420> this<00:03:16.930> game<00:03:17.230> in<00:03:17.590> my<00:03:17.950> personal

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
be a demo of this game in my personal

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.620 
be a demo of this game in my personal
opinion<00:03:19.830> everybody<00:03:20.830> knows<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.760> this<00:03:22.090> this

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
opinion everybody knows that this this

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.400 
opinion everybody knows that this this
game<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.200> pushing<00:03:24.840> CPUs<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.140> hundred

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
game is pushing CPUs to a hundred

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.580 
game is pushing CPUs to a hundred
percent<00:03:26.620> threshold<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.519> have<00:03:27.700> an<00:03:28.030> i7<00:03:28.590> 3770k

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
percent threshold I have an i7 3770k

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.220 
percent threshold I have an i7 3770k
it's<00:03:30.370> not<00:03:30.549> overclocked<00:03:31.090> but<00:03:31.360> I'm<00:03:31.510> pushing<00:03:31.750> it

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
it's not overclocked but I'm pushing it

it's not overclocked but I'm pushing it
gets<00:03:32.769> pushed<00:03:33.010> up<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.310> about<00:03:33.459> eighty<00:03:33.760> percent

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
gets pushed up to about eighty percent

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.670 
gets pushed up to about eighty percent
or<00:03:35.320> so<00:03:35.350> when<00:03:35.799> I'm<00:03:35.950> playing<00:03:36.130> on<00:03:36.850> medium<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.930> I

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
or so when I'm playing on medium and I

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.570 
or so when I'm playing on medium and I
have<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.310> cross<00:03:40.299> fired<00:03:40.600> 79<00:03:41.170> 70s<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.040> I'm

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
have to cross fired 79 70s and I'm

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.539 
have to cross fired 79 70s and I'm
pushing<00:03:42.880> like<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:44.380> all<00:03:44.799> depends<00:03:45.250> on<00:03:45.370> what's

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
pushing like it all depends on what's

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.550 
pushing like it all depends on what's
going<00:03:45.820> on<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:45.970> get<00:03:46.209> like<00:03:46.360> 300<00:03:46.930> frames<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
going on I get like 300 frames and the

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.009 
going on I get like 300 frames and the
menus<00:03:47.950> but<00:03:48.730> sometimes<00:03:49.299> i<00:03:49.450> get<00:03:49.510> like<00:03:49.840> down<00:03:50.650> to

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
menus but sometimes i get like down to

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.120 
menus but sometimes i get like down to
35<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.410> 45<00:03:53.920> frames<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.760> pretty<00:03:55.120> common<00:03:56.130> usually

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
35 to 45 frames is pretty common usually

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.410 
35 to 45 frames is pretty common usually
i'm<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.280> little<00:03:57.400> higher<00:03:57.640> than<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:58.000> but<00:03:58.239> i'm

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
i'm a little higher than that but i'm

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.660 
i'm a little higher than that but i'm

it uses more CPU power than battlefield
4<00:04:15.190> beta<00:04:15.370> right<00:04:15.700> now<00:04:15.880> is<00:04:16.169> when<00:04:17.169> I'm<00:04:17.320> rendering<00:04:17.950> a

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
4 beta right now is when I'm rendering a

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.460 
4 beta right now is when I'm rendering a
video<00:04:18.280> because<00:04:18.700> my<00:04:19.419> computer<00:04:19.570> just<00:04:19.840> takes<00:04:20.290> up

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
video because my computer just takes up

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.290 
video because my computer just takes up
a<00:04:20.530> hundred<00:04:20.859> percent<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.400> goes<00:04:21.579> it<00:04:22.270> goes

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
a hundred percent it goes it goes

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.060 
a hundred percent it goes it goes
through<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.900> roof<00:04:23.050> trying<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.590> use<00:04:23.740> as<00:04:23.919> much

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
through the roof trying to use as much

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.680 
through the roof trying to use as much
power<00:04:24.280> as<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:24.520> can<00:04:24.790> to<00:04:24.820> get<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.120> video<00:04:25.360> done<00:04:25.570> as

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
power as it can to get the video done as

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.550 
power as it can to get the video done as
fast<00:04:25.870> as<00:04:26.050> possible<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.850> it<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.690> doesn't<00:04:29.169> seem

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
fast as possible so it it doesn't seem
