00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.130
 Today we are in the bound forest 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.880
 namely, this video is a subscribers 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.710
 be cheekier 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.090
 that means I thank you very much 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.309
 with you and indeed are now 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.780
 Over 100 subscribers and I am pleased 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.580
 very clear before all things that they 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.500
 not immediately supported but also good 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.970
 distributed criticism which is very important to me 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.570
 if I'm always trying in the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.910
 to improve in my videos and that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.910
 today's special should be sort of a kind 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.930
 be a grassroots decision or 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.610
 can act on a channel medium and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.780
 so i have considered that i have one 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.180
 intro a farmer 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.620
 I 've already come up with two 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.200
 or two, but the drafts 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.430
 can still be easily changed 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.480
 and I'll show you right away and you 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.070
 I can say if I am good or bad 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.620
 finds or which of them is better 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.300
 or which simply all in itself 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.500
 can be improved on these two 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.420
 introns and you can also say what you are 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.739
 you do not need a classic 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.129
 Tomorrow reached us completely and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.129
 just look 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.430
 Well that was already the two videos 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.110
 So if one of them has fallen or 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.430
 to say something here what you want 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.680
 maybe possibly can separate or 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.590
 if you ever need to write this 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.030
 his fountain in the comments purely 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.349
 and I take care that I'm not here 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.920
 to be steered or so I have 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:43.620
 Unfortunately, no what I want 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.620
 Have fun and a lot of success
