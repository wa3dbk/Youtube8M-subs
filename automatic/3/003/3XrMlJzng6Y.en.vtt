okay hello
this<00:00:04.240> is<00:00:04.450> basically<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:06.460> results<00:00:06.819> up<00:00:06.940> again

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
this is basically the results up again

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.180 
this is basically the results up again
and

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.109 

what<00:00:11.879> I've<00:00:12.360> done<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.900> achieve<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.530> is

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:14.119 
what I've done to achieve this is

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.460 
what I've done to achieve this is
basically<00:00:15.119> the<00:00:15.240> same<00:00:15.389> as<00:00:15.570> what<00:00:15.779> Kurt<00:00:16.049> has<00:00:16.259> done

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
basically the same as what Kurt has done

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.760 
basically the same as what Kurt has done
I<00:00:17.390> created<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.509> new<00:00:18.660> layer<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.880> I<00:00:20.960> had<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.380> put

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
I created a new layer and I had it I put

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.490 
I created a new layer and I had it I put
a<00:00:22.829> few<00:00:23.099> later<00:00:23.520> overrides<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.270> there<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.869> made

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
a few later overrides on there so I made

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.519 
a few later overrides on there so I made
it<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.730> settings<00:00:27.210> down<00:00:27.390> here<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.110> 32

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
it so the settings down here so it's 32

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.909 
it so the settings down here so it's 32
bit<00:00:29.779> I'm<00:00:30.779> turned<00:00:31.079> off<00:00:31.169> final<00:00:31.529> gather<00:00:31.680> because

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
bit I'm turned off final gather because

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:32.930 
bit I'm turned off final gather because
you<00:00:31.980> didn't<00:00:32.219> need<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.730> particular

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
you didn't need it for this particular

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.569 
you didn't need it for this particular
thing<00:00:34.010> created<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.390> motion<00:00:36.390> vector<00:00:36.420> pass<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
thing created a motion vector pass and

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.450 
thing created a motion vector pass and
then<00:00:38.579> sewed<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.210> an<00:00:39.300> opening<00:00:39.629> acts<00:00:39.780> are

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
then sewed it is an opening acts are

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.520 
then sewed it is an opening acts are
and<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.300> foreground<00:00:42.809> layer

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.980 

I

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.230 

I'll<00:00:50.230> get<00:00:50.380> to<00:00:50.440> it<00:00:50.620> I'll<00:00:51.340> turn<00:00:51.550> this<00:00:51.730> down<00:00:51.910> so

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
I'll get to it I'll turn this down so

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.710 
I'll get to it I'll turn this down so
it's<00:00:52.480> just<00:00:52.600> like<00:00:52.930> that<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:55.270> left<00:00:55.480> at<00:00:55.630> a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
it's just like that and it's left at a

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.870 
it's just like that and it's left at a
tiff<00:00:55.930> for

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
tiff for

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.330 
tiff for
and

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.450 

then<00:01:01.320> wherever<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.460> then<00:01:03.550> basically

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.149 

so<00:01:07.090> if<00:01:07.150> I<00:01:07.270> scrub<00:01:08.080> through<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:08.470> I've<00:01:09.040> only

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
so if I scrub through this I've only

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.700 
so if I scrub through this I've only
rendered<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.760> few<00:01:10.000> of<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.180> frames

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.859 

you<00:01:13.310> can<00:01:13.460> see<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.850> sort<00:01:14.090> of<00:01:14.150> results<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:14.810> I'm

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
you can see the sort of results that I'm

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.740 
you can see the sort of results that I'm
getting<00:01:15.049> obviously<00:01:15.920> slightly<00:01:16.610> a<00:01:16.820> bit<00:01:17.420> too

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
getting obviously slightly a bit too

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.360 
getting obviously slightly a bit too
much

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.960 

so<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> done<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.330> often

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.960 

date<00:01:25.540> movie

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
date movie

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:51.270 
date movie
quite<00:01:28.540> nice

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.010 

give<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.000> little<00:01:52.299> second<00:01:52.869> while<00:01:53.049> it<00:01:53.200> does<00:01:53.380> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
give it a little second while it does a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.430 
give it a little second while it does a
and<00:01:55.560> ppl<00:01:56.130> pulls<00:01:56.369> it

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.570 

okay<00:02:00.860> so

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
okay so

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.550 
okay so
here's<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.300> ram<00:02:03.450> preview

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.150 

and<00:02:08.099> see<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.369> moving<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.440> the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
and see you moving and the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.500 
and see you moving and the
so<00:02:13.060> if<00:02:13.120> we<00:02:13.270> scrub<00:02:13.840> through<00:02:14.020> it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
so if we scrub through it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.839 
so if we scrub through it
you<00:02:16.049> can<00:02:16.260> see<00:02:16.530> what<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.159> looks<00:02:17.189> like<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.700> Eve

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
you can see what it looks like and Eve

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.809 
you can see what it looks like and Eve
go<00:02:18.000> over<00:02:18.180> there<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:19.049> can<00:02:19.200> change<00:02:19.439> the<00:02:19.819> amount

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
go over there you can change the amount

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.350 
go over there you can change the amount
they're<00:02:21.530> basically<00:02:22.530> what<00:02:22.829> my<00:02:22.950> motion<00:02:23.579> vectors

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
they're basically what my motion vectors

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.069 
they're basically what my motion vectors
look<00:02:24.569> like<00:02:25.129> are<00:02:26.900> like<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:29.689> so<00:02:30.689> I<00:02:30.720> don't<00:02:30.810> know

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
look like are like this so I don't know

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.680 
look like are like this so I don't know
if<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.319> look<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.620> same

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.230 

so<00:02:37.380> sort<00:02:37.740> of

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.150 

and<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.930> way<00:02:41.050> I've<00:02:41.170> done<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.440> I've<00:02:41.470> done<00:02:41.800> it<00:02:41.980> as

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
and the way I've done it I've done it as

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.559 
and the way I've done it I've done it as
an<00:02:42.280> opening<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.270> far<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.640> then

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
an opening it so far and then

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.900 
an opening it so far and then
I<00:02:47.659> did<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.290> downloaded<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.780> plugin

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
I did I downloaded the the plugin

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.820 
I did I downloaded the the plugin
add<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.390> couple<00:02:53.690> of<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.990> previously<00:02:54.710> but<00:02:55.070> and

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
add a couple of it previously but and

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.250 
add a couple of it previously but and
basically<00:02:57.880> if<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:58.940> click<00:02:59.120> on<00:02:59.270> here<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.600> then

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.009 

don't<00:03:02.799> give<00:03:02.920> me<00:03:02.950> all<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.400> other<00:03:03.519> options<00:03:04.019> for

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
don't give me all the other options for

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.679 
don't give me all the other options for
this<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:05.379> need<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.650> do<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.920> XYZ<00:03:06.689> can't

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
this and you need to do the XYZ can't

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.539 
this and you need to do the XYZ can't
really<00:03:07.870> see<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.170> actually<00:03:08.409> because<00:03:08.829> it's<00:03:09.010> too

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
really see it actually because it's too

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.740 
really see it actually because it's too
too<00:03:10.299> long<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:11.069> thing<00:03:12.069> but<00:03:12.280> says<00:03:12.670> XY<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.420> just

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
too long a thing but says XY is it just

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.270 
too long a thing but says XY is it just
about<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.110> see<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.349> end<00:03:14.470> there

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
about to see the end there

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.540 
about to see the end there
and<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.390> will<00:03:17.480> bring<00:03:17.630> this<00:03:18.440> in<00:03:18.680> otherwise<00:03:19.340> if

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
and that will bring this in otherwise if

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:35.250 
and that will bring this in otherwise if
I<00:03:19.670> leave<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.590> put<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.680> back<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.930> normal

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.309 

it<00:03:35.799> will<00:03:35.950> go<00:03:36.069> back<00:03:36.280> to

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
it will go back to

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.360 
it will go back to
i<00:03:38.439> rendered<00:03:39.189> them

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
i rendered them

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:50.160 
i rendered them
image<00:03:41.150> basically<00:03:41.629> so

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.290 

stop<00:03:50.590> at<00:03:50.740> that

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.840 

and<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.930> can<00:03:56.080> see<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.500> it's<00:03:56.650> got<00:03:56.710> em<00:03:57.100> so<00:03:57.790> it

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
and you can see that it's got em so it

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.930 
and you can see that it's got em so it
doesn't<00:03:58.180> align<00:03:58.890> 100-percent<00:03:59.890> perfectly

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
doesn't align 100-percent perfectly

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.510 
doesn't align 100-percent perfectly
like<00:04:02.570> what<00:04:03.050> you've<00:04:03.500> been<00:04:03.680> getting<00:04:04.010> yourself

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
like what you've been getting yourself

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.030 
like what you've been getting yourself
but<00:04:04.880> you<00:04:05.600> can<00:04:05.750> see<00:04:05.900> that<00:04:05.930> because<00:04:06.830> you're

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
but you can see that because you're

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.760 
but you can see that because you're
supposed<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.550> hide<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.970> anyway<00:04:08.620> well<00:04:09.620> I<00:04:09.680> think

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
supposed to hide it anyway well I think

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.200 
supposed to hide it anyway well I think
you<00:04:10.010> are<00:04:10.160> um

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
you are um

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.380 
you are um
so<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.900> can<00:04:13.020> see<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.500> effect<00:04:13.830> that<00:04:13.950> it's

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
so you can see the effect that it's

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.430 
so you can see the effect that it's
having<00:04:15.390> on<00:04:15.660> everything<00:04:16.140> so

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440
