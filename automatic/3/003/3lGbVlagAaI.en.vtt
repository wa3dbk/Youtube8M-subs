00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.450
 the one so welcome to all web hd in 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.519
 this time we are going to learn how to make 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.130
 this effect that you are seeing on screen 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.320
 which is an effect as if it were a drawing 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.320
 with pencil and well we can share 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.910
 any photo in this effect for 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.980
 start let's go here to unlock 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.080
 the layer we go double click and the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.930
 padlock now what we should do is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.560
 duplicate the layer for it we're going to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.240
 press the control keys j and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.940
 automatically we will create a 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.850
 new layer now we must create a layer 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.890
 of fill that is this circular icon 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 that comes out here we're going to give you a click 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.559
 left and what we are going to do is 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.870
 give it and where it says tone and saturation and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.270
 we will leave a menu simply go 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.059
 to lower all the saturation that we have left 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.390
 at minus 100 and we can close this 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.579
 window we go to the second layer 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.800
 which is what we had duplicated is this 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.420
 is what is called a copy layer and what 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.059
 we are going to do is change the mode of 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.100
 composition here where it says normal we're going 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.020
 to unfold the menu and we're going to 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.730
 select the one that is called over 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.920
 expose color 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.760
 then let's press the keys 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.040
 control and the key and by pressing the 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.890
 two keys we will have the image like this 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.590
 blank as they are seeing then we 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.660
 we go to where it says filter that is 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.210
 up here and we're going to look for the option 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.460
 that is called defocusing let's look 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.920
 then in this new menu the option that 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.800
 it's called gaussian blur we give a 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.630
 click and we will leave here because as 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.080
 some modifications simply here 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.740
 Radio where it says we will modify 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.960
 so that you observe that the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.160
 image is changing as to the effect 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.300
 of pencil drawing for example there in 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:58.450
 14.1 it looks excellent I give it ok and if so 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.790
 we observe with the lupita we are going to give us 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.190
 note that the details are excellent 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.070
 you really see the effect as if it were 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.920
 a pencil drawing and so simple is 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.410
 do this effect in any version 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.360
 of photoshop really if you have 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.950

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.940
 can give it in the comments and I with 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.520
