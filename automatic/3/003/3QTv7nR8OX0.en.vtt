00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.280 
I want to
that<00:02:11.260> kind<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.620> beachy<00:02:12.069> messy<00:02:12.520> kind<00:02:12.849> of<00:02:12.970> look

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
that kind of beachy messy kind of look

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.330 
that kind of beachy messy kind of look
so<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.250> face<00:02:15.489> framing<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.980> if<00:02:18.250> you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
so this is the face framing and if you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:39.260 
so this is the face framing and if you
see<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.580> kind<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.790> goes<00:02:18.940> at<00:02:19.120> an<00:02:19.209> angle

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:56.230 

and<00:02:39.840> then

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.750 

it's<00:02:57.380> cut<00:02:58.380> at<00:02:58.500> an<00:02:58.620> angle<00:02:59.660> and<00:03:01.370> she<00:03:02.370> started

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
it's cut at an angle and she started

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.600 
it's cut at an angle and she started
basically<00:03:02.970> right<00:03:03.480> up<00:03:03.630> under<00:03:03.870> my<00:03:03.990> lip<00:03:04.610> well

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
basically right up under my lip well

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.610 
basically right up under my lip well
maybe<00:03:06.030> not<00:03:06.240> because<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.720> my<00:03:06.960> curls<00:03:07.290> already

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
maybe not because it my curls already

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.170 
maybe not because it my curls already
trying<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.890> come<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.160> but<00:03:09.090> she<00:03:09.150> started<00:03:11.180> right

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
trying to come in but she started right

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.850 
trying to come in but she started right
a<00:03:12.510> little<00:03:13.110> bit<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.440> under<00:03:13.830> my<00:03:14.010> chin<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:15.800> I<00:03:16.800> know

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
a little bit of under my chin and I know

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.190 
a little bit of under my chin and I know
it's<00:03:17.100> not<00:03:17.220> exactly<00:03:17.600> perfect<00:03:18.600> on<00:03:18.750> each<00:03:18.900> side

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
it's not exactly perfect on each side

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.970 
it's not exactly perfect on each side
because<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.100> noticed<00:03:20.490> that<00:03:21.440> but<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.830> always

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
because I noticed that but that always

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.980 
because I noticed that but that always
happens<00:03:23.100> with<00:03:23.550> my<00:03:23.670> hair<00:03:23.850> for<00:03:24.090> some<00:03:24.240> reason<00:03:24.630> not

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
happens with my hair for some reason not

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.800 
happens with my hair for some reason not
each<00:03:25.350> sign<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.800> exactly<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:26.940> she<00:03:27.390> got<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.690> as

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
each sign is exactly but she got it as

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:37.640 
each sign is exactly but she got it as
close<00:03:28.050> as<00:03:28.290> possible

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.729

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:55.260 

I<00:04:34.350> think<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.160> can<00:04:35.370> see<00:04:35.580> that<00:04:35.610> i'm<00:04:36.330> trying<00:04:36.540> to

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.680 
just so you can kind of see the shake
that<00:04:57.460> there's<00:04:57.700> a<00:04:57.820> lot<00:04:57.970> of<00:04:58.000> questions<00:04:58.510> about

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
that there's a lot of questions about

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.180 
that there's a lot of questions about
the<00:04:59.050> shape<00:04:59.320> of<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.560> flesh<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:01.530> she<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:03.130> I

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
the shape of the flesh and she that I

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.980 
the shape of the flesh and she that I
really<00:05:03.580> don't<00:05:03.760> have<00:05:03.910> layers<00:05:04.180> left<00:05:04.660> because<00:05:04.900> I

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
really don't have layers left because I

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.660 
really don't have layers left because I
had<00:05:05.170> to<00:05:05.260> bring<00:05:05.440> bring<00:05:05.920> them<00:05:06.040> up<00:05:06.220> as<00:05:06.400> much<00:05:06.610> as

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
had to bring bring them up as much as

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.550 
had to bring bring them up as much as
possible<00:05:06.880> because<00:05:07.570> of<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.020> fact<00:05:08.230> that<00:05:08.350> my

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
possible because of the fact that my

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.130 
possible because of the fact that my
hair<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:08.890> thin<00:05:09.130> right<00:05:09.340> now<00:05:09.420> so<00:05:10.420> my<00:05:10.660> shortest

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
hair so thin right now so my shortest

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:21.570 
hair so thin right now so my shortest
layer<00:05:11.500> in<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:12.070> back<00:05:13.320> is<00:05:14.320> about<00:05:19.980> it's<00:05:20.980> not<00:05:21.280> I

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
layer in the back is about it's not I

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.820 
layer in the back is about it's not I
really<00:05:21.820> don't<00:05:21.940> have<00:05:22.210> layers<00:05:22.510> anymore<00:05:23.140> I<00:05:23.380> had

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
really don't have layers anymore I had

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.320 
really don't have layers anymore I had
to<00:05:23.920> bring<00:05:24.070> up<00:05:24.250> as<00:05:24.430> much<00:05:24.670> as<00:05:24.730> she<00:05:24.970> could<00:05:25.120> from

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
to bring up as much as she could from

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.200 
to bring up as much as she could from
the<00:05:25.420> bottom<00:05:25.720> two<00:05:26.400> so<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.550> doesn't<00:05:27.760> look<00:05:28.030> as

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
the bottom two so it doesn't look as

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.370 
the bottom two so it doesn't look as
thin<00:05:28.540> on<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.020> ends<00:05:29.500> and<00:05:29.680> raggedy<00:05:30.720> so<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:32.200> only

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
thin on the ends and raggedy so the only

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.090 
thin on the ends and raggedy so the only
layers<00:05:32.740> i<00:05:32.920> have<00:05:33.250> is<00:05:33.490> just<00:05:33.670> wiki<00:05:34.030> going<00:05:34.420> this<00:05:34.600> in

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
layers i have is just wiki going this in

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.240 
layers i have is just wiki going this in
the<00:05:36.100> face<00:05:36.340> frame<00:05:36.640> area<00:05:37.530> to<00:05:38.530> bring<00:05:38.740> it<00:05:38.860> into<00:05:39.010> the

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
the face frame area to bring it into the

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.910 
the face frame area to bring it into the
v-cut<00:05:39.840> so<00:05:40.840> I<00:05:40.870> hope<00:05:41.050> that<00:05:41.110> explains<00:05:41.670> my<00:05:42.670> cuz<00:05:43.060> i

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
v-cut so I hope that explains my cuz i
