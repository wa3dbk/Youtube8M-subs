00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.009 
today so I ended up getting 66 strength
at<00:02:42.000> experiments<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.150> was<00:02:43.599> fortunate<00:02:43.840> enough

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
at experiments and was fortunate enough

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.030 
at experiments and was fortunate enough
to<00:02:44.200> find<00:02:44.319> a<00:02:44.650> very<00:02:44.889> unpopulated<00:02:45.459> world<00:02:45.639> and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
to find a very unpopulated world and

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.000 
to find a very unpopulated world and
yeah<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.609> wanted<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.569> quickly<00:02:49.750> go<00:02:50.019> over<00:02:50.049> how

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
yeah so wanted to quickly go over how

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.009 
yeah so wanted to quickly go over how
live<00:02:51.400> streaming<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.879> going<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.090> work<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.930> I'm

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
different training spot I tried ghouls

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.390 
different training spot I tried ghouls
and<00:03:29.109> i<00:03:29.199> found<00:03:29.440> out<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.949> spot<00:03:30.190> is

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
and i found out that this spot is

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.550 
and i found out that this spot is
actually<00:03:30.819> very<00:03:30.849> horrible<00:03:31.569> for<00:03:32.049> one<00:03:32.199> defense

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
actually very horrible for one defense

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.770 
actually very horrible for one defense
peers<00:03:32.859> and<00:03:34.799> yeah<00:03:35.799> I<00:03:36.040> end<00:03:36.159> up<00:03:36.250> did<00:03:36.849> I<00:03:37.030> did<00:03:37.209> get<00:03:37.329> 67

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
peers and yeah I end up did I did get 67

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.530 
peers and yeah I end up did I did get 67
strength<00:03:38.199> here<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.470> did<00:03:38.739> test<00:03:38.949> it<00:03:39.099> out<00:03:39.299> but<00:03:40.299> it

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
strength here I did test it out but it

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.479 
strength here I did test it out but it
turns<00:03:40.569> out<00:03:40.989> that<00:03:41.049> it's<00:03:41.620> really<00:03:41.799> only<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.129> spot

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
turns out that it's really only a spot

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.430 
turns out that it's really only a spot
that's<00:03:42.669> good<00:03:42.940> for<00:03:43.269> Berserker<00:03:44.229> peers<00:03:44.470> remains

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
that's good for Berserker peers remains

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.500 
that's good for Berserker peers remains
yeah<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:47.859> that's<00:03:47.979> about<00:03:48.099> it<00:03:48.190> anyway<00:03:48.729> I<00:03:48.760> figured
