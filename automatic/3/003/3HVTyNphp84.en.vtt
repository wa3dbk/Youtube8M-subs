here<00:00:01.199> are<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.319> few<00:00:01.350> tips<00:00:01.709> and<00:00:01.920> tricks<00:00:01.979> I<00:00:02.340> use<00:00:02.610> to

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
here are a few tips and tricks I use to

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.539 
here are a few tips and tricks I use to
install<00:00:03.149> keratin<00:00:03.959> tipped<00:00:04.170> hair<00:00:04.529> via<00:00:04.950> fusion

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
install keratin tipped hair via fusion

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.450 
install keratin tipped hair via fusion
method<00:00:06.290> normally<00:00:07.290> how<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.500> go<00:00:07.799> ahead<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.099> I

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
method normally how I go ahead and I

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.459 
method normally how I go ahead and I
separate<00:00:08.970> out<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.599> hair<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:09.960> want<00:00:10.230> to

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
separate out the hair that I want to

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.520 
separate out the hair that I want to
apply<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.040> extension<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.969> I've<00:00:12.480> got<00:00:12.690> one

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
apply the extension to is I've got one

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.870 
apply the extension to is I've got one
line<00:00:13.740> here<00:00:14.009> that's<00:00:14.099> parting<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.580> hair<00:00:14.610> away

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
line here that's parting the hair away

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.939 
line here that's parting the hair away
I'm<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> take<00:00:16.049> another<00:00:16.170> line<00:00:16.529> parallel

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
I'm going to take another line parallel

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.529 
I'm going to take another line parallel
to<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:19.640> so<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.760> line<00:00:20.970> should<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.210> kind<00:00:21.449> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
to that so this line should be kind of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.779 
to that so this line should be kind of
straight<00:00:21.960> parallel<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> above<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.519> and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
straight parallel to the above one and

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.759 
straight parallel to the above one and
then<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> kind<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.019> decide<00:00:25.260> where<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> want<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
then I kind of decide where I want the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.650 
then I kind of decide where I want the
bond<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.580> I'll<00:00:26.670> let<00:00:26.910> down<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.420> sides

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
bond to be and I'll let down the sides

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.500 
bond to be and I'll let down the sides
of<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.170> I'll<00:00:28.230> let<00:00:28.380> down<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.800> side<00:00:29.510> keeping

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
of it so I'll let down this side keeping

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.999 
of it so I'll let down this side keeping
a<00:00:30.630> little<00:00:30.840> bit<00:00:30.960> my<00:00:31.080> hand<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.439> let<00:00:31.619> down<00:00:31.650> this

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
a little bit my hand I'm a let down this

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.889 
a little bit my hand I'm a let down this
side<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.669> then<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.239> left<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.690> nice

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
side and then I'm left with a nice

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.560 
side and then I'm left with a nice
square<00:00:34.440> chunk<00:00:34.920> here<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.880> apply<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.149> extension

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
square chunk here to apply the extension

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.819 
square chunk here to apply the extension
-<00:00:38.239> next<00:00:39.239> I'm<00:00:39.420> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> use<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:40.050> hair<00:00:40.379> template

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
- next I'm going to use a hair template

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.860 
- next I'm going to use a hair template
to<00:00:40.980> isolate<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> hair<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> will<00:00:42.780> be

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
to isolate the hair that I will be

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.060 
to isolate the hair that I will be
except<00:00:43.200> applying<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> extension<00:00:44.309> -<00:00:45.920> you<00:00:46.920> want

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
except applying the extension - you want

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.380 
except applying the extension - you want
to<00:00:47.160> make<00:00:47.250> sure<00:00:47.430> also<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
to make sure also that this is in the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.959 
to make sure also that this is in the
downward<00:00:48.840> position<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.620> you're<00:00:49.710> not

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
downward position and that you're not

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.520 
downward position and that you're not
that<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.360> straight<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.350> or

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
that it's not straight up like this or

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.479 
that it's not straight up like this or
you're<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:52.920> extensions<00:00:53.399> that

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
you're going to get extensions that

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.010 
you're going to get extensions that
stick<00:00:53.789> out<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.000> put<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> downward

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
stick out so put it in the downward

I'm going to show you another example of

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.020 
I'm going to show you another example of
how<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.299> might<00:01:45.450> add<00:01:45.750> highlights<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:46.880> if<00:01:47.880> your

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
how you might add highlights or if your

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.420 
how you might add highlights or if your
client<00:01:48.390> has<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:49.140> mix<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.890> colors<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.340> they

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
client has a mix of colors that they

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.980 
client has a mix of colors that they
don't<00:01:50.640> carry<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.060> extensions<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.810> want

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
don't carry in extensions and you want

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.660 
don't carry in extensions and you want
to<00:01:52.079> mix<00:01:52.229> two<00:01:52.470> colors<00:01:52.680> without<00:01:53.070> having<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.520> too

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670

streaky
once<00:01:55.110> again<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.439> did<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> parallel<00:01:56.070> line<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
once again I did the parallel line and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.039 
once again I did the parallel line and
then<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.610> dropped<00:01:56.909> off<00:01:57.090> some<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.600> sides<00:01:57.840> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
then I dropped off some of the sides so

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.990 
then I dropped off some of the sides so
now<00:01:58.200> I've<00:01:58.259> got<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> nice<00:01:58.649> square<00:01:58.950> piece<00:02:02.000> holding

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
now I've got a nice square piece holding

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.090 
now I've got a nice square piece holding
it<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.210> downward<00:02:03.630> position<00:02:03.950> clip<00:02:04.950> this

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
it in the downward position clip this

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.869 
it in the downward position clip this
into<00:02:05.369> place

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.520

going to get two pieces of hair from it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.050 
going to get two pieces of hair from it
and<00:02:18.090> then<00:02:18.239> we've<00:02:18.390> got<00:02:18.569> two<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.940> then<00:02:20.940> I've

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
position melting the bond and then

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.110
