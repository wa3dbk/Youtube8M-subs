the<00:00:00.390> macula<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:00.989> a<00:00:01.079> specialized<00:00:01.800> region<00:00:02.310> in

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
the macula is a specialized region in

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.610 
the macula is a specialized region in
the<00:00:02.730> center<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.270> retina<00:00:03.600> which<00:00:04.200> we<00:00:04.410> use

the center of the retina which we use

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.460 
the center of the retina which we use
