software

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:51.200 

APK<00:02:38.769> software<00:02:39.769> install

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.970 

so

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.559 

also<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.819> can<00:02:58.909> make<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.300> video<00:03:00.230> skype<00:03:01.569> skype

also you can make a video skype skype
video<00:03:02.930> call<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:05.090> see

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:29.760 

you<00:03:11.140> see<00:03:11.380> here's<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.420> video<00:03:13.420> call

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:39.760 

ok<00:03:30.550> let's<00:03:30.760> say<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.720> hose

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.059 

design

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:51.110 

is<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:45.329> power<00:03:47.749> as<00:03:48.749> the<00:03:48.810> day<00:03:49.439> return<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.549> menu

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
is the power as the day return this menu

00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:09.660 
is the power as the day return this menu
is<00:03:51.709> a<00:03:52.709> USB<00:03:54.469> charge<00:03:55.469> of<00:03:55.650> here

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:17.900 

so<00:04:10.270> this<00:04:10.720> is<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:12.090> Box<00:04:13.090> chip<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:14.580> 13<00:04:15.580> x<00:04:16.230> big<00:04:17.230> model

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
so this is the Box chip a 13 x big model

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.530 
so this is the Box chip a 13 x big model
it's<00:04:20.400> 35<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:22.570> then<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.710> know<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:24.669> pay<00:04:25.000> may<00:04:25.480> be

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
it's 35 and then you know you pay may be

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.190 
it's 35 and then you know you pay may be
owning<00:04:25.840> they<00:04:26.740> pry
