00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
know the timeline I never even tried

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.420 
know the timeline I never even tried
getting<00:00:37.110> nukes<00:00:37.260> when<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:38.010> game<00:00:38.160> first<00:00:38.190> came

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
getting nukes when the game first came

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.420 
getting nukes when the game first came
out<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.730> only<00:00:39.059> started<00:00:39.540> trying<00:00:39.899> after<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.190> map

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
out I only started trying after this map

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.940 
out I only started trying after this map
pack<00:00:41.640> came<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> randomly<00:00:42.829> ended<00:00:43.829> up

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
pack came out and I randomly ended up

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.799 
pack came out and I randomly ended up
getting<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.210> got<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> couple

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
getting one on this and I I got a couple

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.500 
getting one on this and I I got a couple
of<00:00:46.020> them<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.260> row<00:00:46.520> after<00:00:47.520> playing<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.059> this

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
of them in a row after playing this this

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.860 
of them in a row after playing this this
game<00:00:48.719> type<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.460> ground<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:50.690> domination<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
game type on ground more domination and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.869 
game type on ground more domination and
basically<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.160> about<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.520> room<00:00:53.730> right

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
basically it's all about this room right

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.850 
basically it's all about this room right
here<00:00:53.940> typically<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:55.199> setup<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:55.680> be

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
here typically my setup would be

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.260 
here typically my setup would be
different<00:00:56.460> than<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:56.760> I'm<00:00:56.850> running<00:00:57.149> right

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
different than what I'm running right

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.299 
different than what I'm running right
now<00:00:57.300> my<00:00:58.050> new<00:00:58.230> class<00:00:58.620> when<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> was<00:00:59.039> running

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
now my new class when I was running

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.340 
now my new class when I was running
originally<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.359> my<00:01:00.449> first<00:01:00.660> nuke<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.260> an

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
originally in my first nuke it was an

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.119 
originally in my first nuke it was an
m16<00:01:01.949> holographic<00:01:02.960> duel<00:01:03.960> akimbo<00:01:04.409> Rangers<00:01:04.920> for

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
m16 holographic duel akimbo Rangers for

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.210 
m16 holographic duel akimbo Rangers for
short<00:01:05.339> range<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:07.020> dual<00:01:07.439> rafa<00:01:07.979> cos

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
short range in here and or dual rafa cos

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.980 
short range in here and or dual rafa cos
and<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:08.580> claymores<00:01:09.119> definitely<00:01:09.630> gotta<00:01:09.810> have

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and then claymores definitely gotta have

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.219 
and then claymores definitely gotta have
claymores<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.500> scavengers<00:01:11.180> because

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
claymores and scavengers because

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.960 
claymores and scavengers because
basically<00:01:13.229> they'll<00:01:13.920> run<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:14.610> there's<00:01:14.850> only

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
basically they'll run up there's only

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.660 
basically they'll run up there's only
one<00:01:15.150> entry<00:01:15.450> point<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.259> them<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.799> come<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.100> on

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
one entry point for them to come up on

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.510 
one entry point for them to come up on
the<00:01:17.790> left-hand<00:01:18.119> side<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.159> basically<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.369> got

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the left-hand side so basically they got

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.149 
the left-hand side so basically they got
to<00:01:20.640> come<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> stairs<00:01:21.479> or<00:01:22.070> through<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
to come up up the stairs or through the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.550 
to come up up the stairs or through the
outside<00:01:23.520> that's<00:01:24.060> pretty<00:01:24.600> much<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.960> it's

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
outside that's pretty much it so it's

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.999 
outside that's pretty much it so it's
easy<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.070> hold<00:01:26.520> down<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.979> write<00:01:28.979> here

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
easy to hold down and you can write here

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
easy to hold down and you can write here
is<00:01:29.220> an<00:01:29.820> example<00:01:29.909> basically<00:01:30.810> I'm<00:01:30.900> trying<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
is an example basically I'm trying to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.370 
is an example basically I'm trying to
use<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.040> my<00:01:32.159> advantage<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:33.210> uh

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
use this to my advantage and then uh

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.560 
use this to my advantage and then uh
ended<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.530> getting<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.799> kill<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.640> but

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
ended up getting the kill but but

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.590 
ended up getting the kill but but
basically<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:39.270> good

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
basically it's it's a really really good

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.120 
basically it's it's a really really good
place<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.079> hold<00:01:40.229> down<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:40.860> seven

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
place to hold down you can get seven

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.090 
place to hold down you can get seven
kills<00:01:41.310> fairly<00:01:41.850> easy<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.710> be<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:43.860> way<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
kills fairly easy and be on your way to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.170 
kills fairly easy and be on your way to
that<00:01:44.220> tactical<00:01:44.850> nuke<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.970> right<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.000> I

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that tactical nuke so and right here I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.410 
that tactical nuke so and right here I
get<00:01:48.570> my<00:01:48.689> six<00:01:48.899> kill<00:01:49.140> already<00:01:49.530> now<00:01:50.070> watch<00:01:50.610> I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
get my six kill already now watch I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.719 
get my six kill already now watch I
think<00:01:52.350> I'm<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:52.770> watch<00:01:53.250> where<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> go
