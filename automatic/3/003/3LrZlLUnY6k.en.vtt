okay and absolutely normal to be a
little<00:00:24.240> bit<00:00:24.600> tight<00:00:24.869> because<00:00:25.710> you're

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
little bit tight because you're

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.589 
little bit tight because you're
recruiting<00:00:26.189> different<00:00:26.880> muscles<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.539> when

you're recruiting different muscles and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.890 
you're recruiting different muscles and
changing<00:00:29.849> your<00:00:29.939> technique<00:00:30.420> you're

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
changing your technique you're

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.420 
changing your technique you're
automatically<00:00:31.470> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.830> be<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.009> little<00:00:32.219> bit

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
automatically going to be a little bit

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.639 
automatically going to be a little bit
tight<00:00:32.730> now<00:00:33.450> once<00:00:33.750> you've<00:00:33.899> gotten<00:00:34.110> used<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
tight now once you've gotten used to the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.709 
tight now once you've gotten used to the
changes<00:00:35.070> however<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.090> end<00:00:36.390> goal<00:00:36.690> is

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
changes however and the end goal is

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.920 
changes however and the end goal is
always<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.770> loose<00:00:38.219> okay<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.329> how<00:00:39.480> what's

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
way I know is what's called the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.190 
way I know is what's called the
looseness<00:00:44.460> style<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> concept

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
looseness style and this is a concept

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.889 
looseness style and this is a concept
from<00:00:46.440> Jeff<00:00:46.739> Greenwald<00:00:47.309> whom<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.149> did<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.480> course

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
from Jeff Greenwald whom we did a course

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
from Jeff Greenwald whom we did a course
with<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> couple<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.920> months<00:00:50.190> ago<00:00:50.399> called<00:00:50.610> play

with a couple of months ago called play
out<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.210> your<00:00:51.480> mind<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.989> basically<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
out of your mind and basically with the

to squeeze your fist and on a scale of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.150 
to squeeze your fist and on a scale of
one<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.300> ten<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.930> squeeze<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.559> hard<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:02.039> you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
one to ten if you squeeze as hard as you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.359 
one to ten if you squeeze as hard as you
can<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.969> arm<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:04.140> super<00:01:04.619> tight<00:01:04.890> okay<00:01:05.309> so

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
can and your arm is super tight okay so

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.120 
can and your arm is super tight okay so
that's<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.820> ten<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.330> then<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.590> down<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that's a ten and then you go down and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.640 
that's a ten and then you go down and
you<00:01:08.610> release<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.659> fist<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.080> little<00:01:10.350> bit<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you release the fist a little bit you

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.859 
you release the fist a little bit you
that<00:01:10.920> arm<00:01:11.130> gets<00:01:11.369> looser<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.909> looser<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.570> nine

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that arm gets looser and looser so nine

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.810 
that arm gets looser and looser so nine
eight<00:01:13.369> seven<00:01:14.369> six<00:01:14.400> five<00:01:15.409> four<00:01:16.409> three<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.340> then

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
eight seven six five four three and then

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.429 
eight seven six five four three and then
you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> way<00:01:18.450> down<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
you can go all the way down to one and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.530 
you can go all the way down to one and
that's<00:01:19.890> where<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> arms<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.670> loose<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.360> can

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
that's where the arms is loose as it can

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.910 
that's where the arms is loose as it can
possibly<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:22.350> okay

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
possibly be okay

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.990 
possibly be okay
so<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> optimal<00:01:24.150> level<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.340> found<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
so the optimal level that I found and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.370 
so the optimal level that I found and
that's<00:01:27.180> also<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:27.689> Jeff<00:01:27.900> Greenwald

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that's also what Jeff Greenwald

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.740 
that's also what Jeff Greenwald
recommends<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.009> around<00:01:29.340> three<00:01:29.700> or<00:01:29.729> four<00:01:30.450> on

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
recommends is around three or four on

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.749 
recommends is around three or four on
the<00:01:30.960> looseness<00:01:31.170> style<00:01:31.650> okay<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> want<00:01:32.700> to

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the looseness style okay so you want to

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.510 
the looseness style okay so you want to
get<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> feel<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:34.680> three<00:01:34.979> or<00:01:35.189> four

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
get a feel for that that three or four

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.240 
get a feel for that that three or four
tension<00:01:36.210> level<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:36.930> arm<00:01:37.110> that's<00:01:37.740> usually

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
tension level in your arm that's usually

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.399 
tension level in your arm that's usually
optimal<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.600> hit<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> tennis<00:01:40.110> ball

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
optimal for you to hit the tennis ball

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.010 
optimal for you to hit the tennis ball
and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.820> play<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.869> out

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
and then when you play you can go out

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.749 
and then when you play you can go out
and<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.560> recall<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.369> feeling

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and you can recall that feeling

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.700 
and you can recall that feeling
especially<00:01:44.970> when<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> tendency<00:01:46.680> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
especially when you have a tendency to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.800 
especially when you have a tendency to
get<00:01:47.040> tight<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.610> you'll<00:01:47.970> notice<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.630> your

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
get tight and you'll notice that your

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
get tight and you'll notice that your
arm<00:01:48.990> tightens<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.070> more<00:01:50.250> going

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
arm tightens up and then it's more going

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.450 
arm tightens up and then it's more going
to<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:51.420> an<00:01:51.540> eight<00:01:51.780> nine<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.380> ten<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.950> then

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
to be like an eight nine or ten and then

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.429 
to be like an eight nine or ten and then
you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.729> recall<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.420> feeling<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.079> that

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
you can recall that feeling and that

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.920 
you can recall that feeling and that
works<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.860> lot<00:01:56.100> better<00:01:56.180> than<00:01:57.180> telling<00:01:57.570> yourself

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
works a lot better than telling yourself

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.300 
works a lot better than telling yourself
to<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.170> loose<00:01:58.469> because<00:01:58.829> I'm<00:01:58.979> sure<00:01:59.159> you've

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
to be loose because I'm sure you've

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.770 
to be loose because I'm sure you've
tried<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.180> usually<00:02:00.570> does<00:02:00.750> not

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
tried that and that usually does not

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.380 
tried that and that usually does not
work<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> looseness<00:02:02.219> style<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.820> extremely

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
work so the looseness style is extremely

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.209 
work so the looseness style is extremely
effective<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.320> highly<00:02:04.619> recommend<00:02:04.740> that

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
effective and I highly recommend that

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.909 
effective and I highly recommend that
you<00:02:05.340> give<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.670> try
