00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.840

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.420
 the taste of everyone made with several 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.090
 different shapes but separate ingredients 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.270
 a special recipe for you go to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.270
 the kitchen 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.560
 the first step for us to start 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.080
 prepare our recipe is in the choice 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.420
 rice types of rice more 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.610
 known are carnaroli and arboreal 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.719
 for our recipe today I chose the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.940
 scoundrel 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.040
 today we will prepare a risotto of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.079
 brie air with pistachio 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.989
 so I chose a vegetable stock with 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.730
 very soft taste 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.780
 I have here all my ingredients 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.070
 separated 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.070
 now we can extend 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 Let's start by braising the onion in the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.500
 butter always give preference to the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.050
 butter without salt so as not to interfere with 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 Flavor of the onion risotto is at the point where 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.390
 I want now let's go with rice 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.080
 For this recipe I chose cognac 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.200
 but we could use white wine 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.180
 the choice of brandy was to give a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.700
 different touch on taste 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.320
 along with gruyÃ©re the rice 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 well absorbed drink 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.700
 I'll start with broth 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.350
 As the broth evaporates, you will 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.990
 completing more calmly 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.720
 this is the basis for any and all 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.899
 risoto recipe and there you go 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.920
 completing with the stock and always stirring 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.630
 to make the smile very creamy 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.789
 usually takes 20 minutes to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.050
 reach the desired point of cooking 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.970
 of rice 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.640
 I put on bald enough I 'll leave 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.460
 steam stew and quickly grate the cheese 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.720
 Gruyere chose a woman because he is a 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.540
 lightly spicy cream cheese and 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.579
 give a good contrast to good pistachio 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.500
 put the cheese in a pot and I'll 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:18.329
 enjoy and stay the stage pintasse 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.239
 besides tasty it will give a 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.239
 Crunchy and a very nice color recipe 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.290
 the rice is already at the point I want 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.710
 Let's go to the finals. I'll put the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:38.240
 group and a small spoon is grated 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.340
 butter a little parmesan and the 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.740
 chopped pistachio I'll book one 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:48.590
 little to finish my plate risotto 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.710
 It's all right to choose a dish. 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.290
 I'll put the risotto in the center of the 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:59.740
 dish and I'll decorate with the pistachios that 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.740
 I reserve a good appetite. 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.370
 saw how easy it is to prepare a dish 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.000
 simple and sophisticated at the same time 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.420
 now it 's a big kiss with you and until 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.420
