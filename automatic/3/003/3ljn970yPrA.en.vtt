00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.720
 hello we're going from the brothers who already 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.009
 we are in the second video of the series 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.899
 in which I will show you all the 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.730
 causes of microtransactions in 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.310
 all weapons available in the game 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.470
 in this episode you have on screen the 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.730
 camouflage war in the jungle a 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.620
 camouflage that does not call me the 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.880
 attention in my opinion could be up 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.340
 one of the camouflages with which 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.340
 would come in the game and dvds noticed 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.330
 I do not think they've worked hard this 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.660
 camouflage if the green and nothing anxiety 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.780
 very jungle it seems fine but I do not 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.160
 it looks like a camouflage because good before 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.470
 to say goodbye I would like to ask you to 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.330
 You see like and share in this video 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.559
 because it has cost me money to buy me 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.660
 all fields deadlines just for 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.900
 you because in the end I will be 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.300
 using one or two camouflage as much and 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.000
 he buys everything only so that 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.620
 you can see all of them 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.680
 weapons and so decide what camouflage 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.549
 buy also I have to take 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.600
 enough time to record each clip 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:09.290
 with each weapon and then have to edit it 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.710
 to bring you the video so the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.450
