chicken here when you start thinking in

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.609 
chicken here when you start thinking in
terms<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.309> fat<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:15.450> all<00:00:15.719> really<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.350> here

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
terms of fat it's all really in here

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.269 
terms of fat it's all really in here
it's<00:00:16.890> all<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.420> skin<00:00:18.859> when<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:19.890> get<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.160> this

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
it's all in the skin when we get to this

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.340 
it's all in the skin when we get to this
stage<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:21.060> want<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.240> cut<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.600> quite<00:00:21.869> thin<00:00:22.199> the

stage you want to cut it quite thin the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.840 
stage you want to cut it quite thin the
idea<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.710> cutting<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.100> into<00:00:23.369> small<00:00:23.640> strips

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
idea of cutting this into small strips

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.300 
idea of cutting this into small strips
it<00:00:24.210> cooks<00:00:24.539> quite<00:00:24.900> quickly<00:00:25.199> sharp<00:00:25.769> knife<00:00:25.980> just

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
it cooks quite quickly sharp knife just

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.130 
it cooks quite quickly sharp knife just
run<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.820> all<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.240> way<00:00:27.330> through<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.779> middle

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
run that all the way through the middle

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.710 
run that all the way through the middle
of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:29.070> chicken<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.060> see<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.599> we're

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
of the chicken you can see that so we're

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.389 
of the chicken you can see that so we're
creating<00:00:30.929> two<00:00:31.289> little<00:00:31.560> Phillips<00:00:31.920> there<00:00:32.130> then

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
creating two little Phillips there then

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.400 
creating two little Phillips there then
we're<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.640> cutting<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.030> into<00:00:33.410> little

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
we're just cutting that into little

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.530 
we're just cutting that into little
strips<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:37.590> let's<00:00:37.770> get<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> first

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
strips like this so let's get the first

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.990 
strips like this so let's get the first
level<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.980> our<00:00:40.980> steam<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.399> sitting<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.820> there

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
level of our steam is sitting in there

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.729 
level of our steam is sitting in there
here<00:00:46.520> also<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.670> sit<00:00:48.059> down<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.350> top<00:00:49.559> there

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
here also just sit down on the top there

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
here also just sit down on the top there
like<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.100> okay<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.629> important

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
like that okay and it's important

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
like that okay and it's important
against<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.649> mean<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.949> emphasize<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.520> really

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
against I mean to emphasize it really

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.580 
against I mean to emphasize it really
but<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.629> important<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.020> soak<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.440> just

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
but it's so important to soak it just

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.990 
but it's so important to soak it just
like<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:55.949> bamboo<00:00:56.340> skewers<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.850> put

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
like you do bamboo skewers that you put

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.369 
like you do bamboo skewers that you put
on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> barbie<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.930> prevents<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
on the barbie because it prevents it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.189 
on the barbie because it prevents it
