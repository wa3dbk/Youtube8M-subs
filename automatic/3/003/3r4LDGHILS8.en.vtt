00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.670
 present you the best plans for 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.670

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.120
 known today are orchids 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.630
 we have three different orchids 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.670
 the cambria with its orange flowers on 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.779
 most well known of all is the one who holds 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.240
 probably the best now 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.310
 apartment is the phalaenopsis of which 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.360
 the peculiarity when phalaenopsis 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.910
 fans 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.489
 Well we remove the flowers but 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.010
 can bloom again on the same between flo 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.050
 rattle the cymbidium the cymbidium that has the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.520
 particularity of supporting local caire 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.100
 it's an orchid that we can 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.420
 come out as soon as it freezes from 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.250
 of the month of May we will leave in a 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.480
 rest period and we have returned to 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.519
 from september 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.379
 September is from that date 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.979
 it will bloom naturally in your 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.479
 apartment 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.370
 the plans the money we find enough 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:54.559
 easily currently in 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.670
 garden centers and florists 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.629
 anthurium with white red flowers 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.670
 or roses 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.170
 particular sign of this plant if 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.809
 you buried it too much after a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.970
 repotting it will no longer bloom a 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.010
 another plant that is very known with its 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.530
 pretty special flowers the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.750
 spathiphyllum which has the particularity of 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.219
 do not like the direct rays of the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.289
 sun is a general rule 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.420
 practically for all these plants and 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.070
 then there is amaryllis now 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.530
 then the amaryllis that we can force 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.780
 amount amassed time a bull to do 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.210
 bloom an amaryllis know one thing 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.859
 it is necessary to water it during 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.109
 the flowering period once the 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.689
 flowers will be fans and it's cutting 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.100
 the flowers and continue to dew to 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.299
 the fertilizer so that the leaves 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.570
 continue to flourish 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.780
 you never cut the leaves the ears 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.520
 if the man the christmas cactus that are 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.950
 in bloom now so there is a 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.810
 little peculiarity with respect to these 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.539
 flowers if you have one and it does not 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.090
 not flourish just break the 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.189
 leaves delicately like that you 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.700
 do this in the month of September and on the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.590
 break 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.320
 you may be lucky to have 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.420
 a new flowering a rule 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.710
 general when the ears son men 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.979
 begin to bloom in his 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.170
 apartment do not move the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.120
 plant because the buttons may fall 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.500
 and then I'll finish with a plant 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.640
 that we see quite often these are the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.930
 calanques in the east so why the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.030
 creeks up and are in bloom in this 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.069
 moment these are slopes of zou 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.950
 blow that is to say that it flourishes 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:26.300
 naturally when the days are 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.300
 shorter than nights
