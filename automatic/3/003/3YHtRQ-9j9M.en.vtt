00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.310
 here it is finally arrived 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.369
 new iphone 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.559
 I can't wait to try it on a lot of 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.579
 functions like all smartphones but I know 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.379
 already that high will really be 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.030
 impossible to use them 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.980
 but for some time even the houses have 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.809
 they are aware that customers would like 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.949
 to be able to use the 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.839
 car phone 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.400
 we are not talking about the speakerphone that 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.739
 by now there is everywhere but of a 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.110
 intelligent interface to manage the 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.360
 functions like music navigation i 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.339
 messages in reality as we are 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.659
 accustomed to smartphones in the car 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.730
 we would like to find the same graphic 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.989
 even the same icons up to 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.329
 recently things were not going well 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.009
 exactly in this direction facilities 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.570
 they were complex full of functions 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.850
 sometimes useless even read online 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.560
 that something has moved of the last 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.750
 times the most important actors of 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.880
 this area they call google ed 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.280
 apple are about to take the field with 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.690
 completely new operating systems e 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.429
 so let's go to the iphone because the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.470
 Apple routed the competition with 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.869
 its system of integration between the apple 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.100
 and the machine carp her and her name ed 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.530
 is a standard that has already been received 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.660
 the approval of many manufacturers 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.459
 who will adopt it both of cars and of 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.009
 multimedia systems of the caliber of 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:35.599
 pioneer that at home the form of a cap 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.069
 she and you don't learn the string 

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:39.069
 new features or new symbols 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.390
 no 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.159
 and since ferrari was the first 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.930
 builder to put it in the car and since 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.119
 driving it is always pleasant 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.210
 the experiments we do with this 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.619
 flaming ferrari ff the connection 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.670
 how much simpler it can be 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.229
 to imagine 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.170
 on the car side there is a very classic 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.539
 usb while regarding the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.950
 phone the typical socket is used 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.950
 apple lightning 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.170
 the display shows the icons 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.300
 main features of the iphone since 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.590
 phone which is obviously connected in 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.150
 voice to the music 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.380
 which you can choose from all the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.990
 music inside the phone 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.090
 messages can be dictated 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.980
 directly through serious and not 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.780
 ends here because carp she succeeds in 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.570
 the system of 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.340
 Siri command with the car keys 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:49.310
 here for example with this button on the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.270
 plank we find yesterday I'm hungry I can 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.190
 help you 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.080
 check out these nearby places and 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.090
 where you are or do not believe it folds 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.140
 links I found a number of 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.610
 restaurants 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.830
 six of these are fairly close 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.780
 where you are there is no need to 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.790
 buy a ferrari at parties to have 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.100
 car plate and this year are 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.290
 many other models are coming 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.480
 give credit to the pony to have been i 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.280
 more careful and as a tradition also i 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.560
 faster in developing this one 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.750
 new interface that eventually leads to 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.340
 greater security and us for the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.880
 security we have a real one 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:42.150
 passion 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:45.300
 yesterday look at me on four wheels 4 meters e 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.000
 97 cm of pure lines charm 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.260
 sinuous that attract the eyes 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.100
 especially when you approach it 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.100
 German rivals
