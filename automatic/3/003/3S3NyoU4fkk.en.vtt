00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
ammo being 60 out of 120 that gives you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.639 
ammo being 60 out of 120 that gives you
three<00:02:05.369> Clips<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> better<00:02:07.170> chance<00:02:07.259> of

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
three Clips you have a better chance of

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.930 
three Clips you have a better chance of
surviving<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.959> road<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.979> reload<00:02:11.640> is

surviving but the road the reload is
very<00:02:12.750> very<00:02:13.200> slow<00:02:15.380> alright<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.799> power<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.610> a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
