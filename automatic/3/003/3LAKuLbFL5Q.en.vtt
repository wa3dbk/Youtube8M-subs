00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.920
 hello how about this time I'm going to 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.750
 draw something that I like to call the 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.660
 hippopotamus dancer after drinking 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.510
 several talks at the party and watching a 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.460
 video on the internet or one that called me 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.130
 a lot of attention on some animals 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:22.689
 that were drugged with some plants of a 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.660
 tree but that was from south africa germany 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.000
 good something like that 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.640
 and I said those animals after the video 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.040
 they will return to the same place or they should 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.510
 a zoo to dissect them 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.910
 I said nothing and this that some others 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.670
 they came back 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.430
 time will be drawn a hippopotamus not 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.970
 I understood why there are so many animals 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.940
 alive a hippopotamus 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.579
 maybe it was because I as a child watching 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.670
 Sesame Street 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.519
 a chapter on a very little party 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.739
 like he's dancing as a child 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.589
 I thought the hippos are drugged 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.079
 he's drunk being sesame square one 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.030
 series for children 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.500
 talking about sesame square who who 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.310
 will say the Sesame Street characters 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.770
 álvarez and popo tamón for example veto no 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.000
 I think she's wearing your hippopotamus 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.660
 object goes from fever to breastplate 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.710
 something like that, I hope they hire me 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.220
 d 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.409
 of Sesame Street to make the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.710
 tertiary was that season 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.970
 Program 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.530
 good as you can see in this drawing 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.180
 about drawing tell you a little bit to 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.640
 make it more fun 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.850
 because in the other video I think I speak 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.820
 too much and I did not like it very well 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.930
 the idea 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.520
 What I missed the couple of hippos 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.560
 be apart from what I put him drunk and 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.659
 drugged making a fool of yourself 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.460
 ear 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.110
 the following would be you can see it 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.870
 well-known shadow that thoroughly 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.550
 drawing and background 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.740
 norm that nobody has seen 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.470
 when a follower does not think about something 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.500
 a duty but ok 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.660
 Well I hope you liked it was 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.150
