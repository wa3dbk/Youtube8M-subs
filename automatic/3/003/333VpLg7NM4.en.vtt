00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 very good social status we slide in 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.750
 minecraft 1.7 points 2 let's see a 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.120
 mod and let's kill cow cows just like 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.309
 he writes he evaporated a mod that he adds 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.160
 in motorcycles this is pretty cool is a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.199
 little as it is a little bit played is 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.150
 a tad good but well enough 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.189
 cool then we have first we will have 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.430
 what to do is the wheels that are made with 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.680
 gold and surrounding it with iron and we have 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.269
 rust, we're going to do both, although 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.080
 I already have it down and it's silly but 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.080
 Good, I feel like 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.559
 the two wheels now we have to do 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.809
 we have to do this so it is like this and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.270
 this is how he gives us everything here is team 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.969
 engine and now that we have this we have 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.760
 that the oval is this a chest a chair 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.950
 edges and that already costs a little more 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.250
 find it but good we put war 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.390
 who gave me 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.930
 the two wheels 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.320
 and the gold and we do bike chassis in 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.739
 shenzhen and if we put the chassis together and 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.520
 I am here for you as it was like that and with 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:11.860
 wool if we do the black widow or if 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.860
 we put the red one the hand marauder 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.860
 we have here is fine the mountain is 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.450
 well the truth is that now you will see 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.810
 but we're going to put this 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.820
 example that I like a lot 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.409
 we must admit that he is cool 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.409
 yes we got on 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.860
 so that it is moving only as you see 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.329
 is that they are weak I was buying Sofia 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.840
 but it sounds like the engine and if 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.039
 we give left control and right click 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.549
 we get this here that here we put 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.890
 the coal because you turn acts like 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.600
 a like a viewer 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.370
 worth the world is so sought not 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.340
 you have to put the coal here and that 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.830
 we have to have it in hand now yes 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.630
 that progresses very fast 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.360
 but as I say it is a tad blocked 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.370
 brakes brakes brakes brakes does not brake has not 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.130
 said back the area costs him 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.590
 it costs control it's super weird aside 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.950
 look how are we going 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.240
 it's very rare, but it works well with 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.460
 the coal this as you are seeing and the 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.470
 problem is when colliding 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.930
 let's move forward to participate but super 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.960
 fast then if we see some bug 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:30.440
 I want value here year you see disappears 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:35.340
 is this woman worth is it true what she is 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:38.040
 the heat box this is huge 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.519
 that is, we can not move forward 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.270
 It's like the bike is this but fuck 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.880
 still 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.870
 well also explodes yes yes if you hit 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.170
 but the version is that it's as if the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.050
 motorcycle and the heat box is rare and 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.720
 here 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.660
 something like that 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.080
 it's a little weird because from here 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.080
 with a 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.610
 it's a bit strange to see the way this 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.230
 cool and is an erase t why I wanted 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.030
 bring it here that you know that to me 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.819
 love the backpacks is why going 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.510
 on the right 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.140
 well it's a bit weird as I say 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.430
 I told him he's cool but the problem 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.299
 is all this if I did not have all this 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.040
 fuck 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.200
 there yes that bad would do badly this is the other 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.459
 to see the mold is very cool but the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.310
 problem is this that I am telling you or 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:37.260
 be 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:40.709
 there is no super weird control of the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.220
 strip strip strip strip strip strip wow strip 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.710
 my mother the conduit 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.140
 It's a weird bit but it's very good 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.319
 actually how strange that I have not 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.079
 destroyed and that too 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.650
 he's super cool because that can not be 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.989
 denying that it was super epic but 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.420
 has maybe too many classic books 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.790
 so I leave nothing here as a mod 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.080
 curious as an engine arete and you know that I 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.670
 love them I will show you test 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.440
 and the truth is that it is not all bad 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.050
 It has a certain charm even if it's only 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.670
 to decorate the bike 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.560
 You can also use it but as you can see 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.709
 is consuming the coal that we have 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.970
 in the hand because the ovens are inside 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.049
 but hey it's quite enough 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.930
 all right 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.409
 I do not know a very curious way and this is the 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.669
 way a rather weird way that yes though 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.700
 is a little blocked I like it 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.550
 because it 's pretty weird 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.529
 and the truth is that it is super epic 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.809
 They are very cool as are made that 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.749
 yes the new music of minecraft 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:44.599
 how rare but good this is the way 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:46.999
 as I say is not that it is a super mod 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.279
 precisely but it has seemed very 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:51.469
 cool the truth you have in that the 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.580
 description you have to download a little 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:55.990
 to find it because there are several 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:01.430
 would show in the same link let me pass 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:05.589
 It's very cool but well this is 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.589
 install for 1.7 points 

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:10.119
 bye
