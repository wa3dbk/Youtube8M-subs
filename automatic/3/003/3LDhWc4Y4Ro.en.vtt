00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
alongside Luis Suarez he tended to pass

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.560 
alongside Luis Suarez he tended to pass
the<00:01:37.770> ball<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> lot<00:01:38.159> more<00:01:38.310> than<00:01:38.490> normally<00:01:39.360> than

he normally does he is stereotypically a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.639 
he normally does he is stereotypically a
rather<00:01:41.400> selfish<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.090> ball<00:01:42.960> greedy<00:01:43.350> player

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
rather selfish and ball greedy player

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.030 
rather selfish and ball greedy player
although<00:01:43.950> he<00:01:44.430> has<00:01:44.670> started<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.570> his<00:01:46.350> credit<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
were to pass the ball a little bit more

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.330 
were to pass the ball a little bit more
time<00:01:48.509> perhaps<00:01:48.720> pick<00:01:49.500> himself<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.979> some

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
time perhaps pick himself up some

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.770 
time perhaps pick himself up some
assists<00:01:50.790> I've<00:01:50.909> upped<00:01:51.060> his<00:01:51.149> dribbling<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.630> well

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
assists I've upped his dribbling as well

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.060 
assists I've upped his dribbling as well
because<00:01:52.049> his<00:01:52.170> touch<00:01:52.380> has<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:52.799> improved

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
because his touch has really improved

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.590 
because his touch has really improved
since<00:01:53.250> he's<00:01:53.399> been<00:01:53.520> at<00:01:53.640> Liverpool<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.180> his

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
since he's been at Liverpool and his

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.120 
since he's been at Liverpool and his
defending<00:01:55.079> has<00:01:55.259> dropped<00:01:55.619> why<00:01:55.860> one

defending has dropped why one

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.219 
defending has dropped why one
considering<00:01:56.790> he<00:01:57.030> doesn't<00:01:57.390> really<00:01:57.750> try<00:01:58.110> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
considering he doesn't really try it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.100 
considering he doesn't really try it
back<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.680> help<00:01:59.399> out<00:01:59.549> defensively<00:01:59.700> at<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.570> so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
back and help out defensively at all so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.020 
back and help out defensively at all so
I<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:01.560> think<00:02:01.740> he<00:02:01.829> deserves<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.399> higher

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
I don't think he deserves a higher

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.959 
I don't think he deserves a higher
defensive<00:02:03.570> rating<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:04.049> physical<00:02:04.759> 73<00:02:05.759> because

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
defensive rating but physical 73 because

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.969 
defensive rating but physical 73 because
he's<00:02:06.119> quite<00:02:06.329> strong<00:02:06.689> but<00:02:06.869> not<00:02:07.290> necessarily

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
he's quite strong but not necessarily

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.410 
he's quite strong but not necessarily
brilliant<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> air<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:08.910> his<00:02:09.000> jumping

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
brilliant in the air and his jumping

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.150 
brilliant in the air and his jumping
isn't<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.289> good<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:10.679> his<00:02:10.800> balance<00:02:11.069> and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
isn't that good but his balance and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.680 
isn't that good but his balance and
agility<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.670> pretty<00:02:11.970> decent<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.480> we're<00:02:12.599> giving

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
agility a pretty decent so we're giving

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.790 
agility a pretty decent so we're giving
him<00:02:12.840> 73<00:02:13.379> physical

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
him 73 physical

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.740 
him 73 physical
and<00:02:13.890> that's<00:02:14.580> Daniel<00:02:14.880> Sturridge<00:02:15.270> let's<00:02:15.570> move

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and that's Daniel Sturridge let's move

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.230 
and that's Daniel Sturridge let's move
on<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.170> Raheem<00:02:16.860> Sterling<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:18.000> first

on to Raheem Sterling and the first

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.820 
on to Raheem Sterling and the first
thing<00:02:18.390> you'll<00:02:18.540> notice<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.170> he's<00:02:19.590> been

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
thing you'll notice is that he's been

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.150 
thing you'll notice is that he's been
moved<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> cam<00:02:20.820> from<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.480> right<00:02:21.840> wing<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.530> kind

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
moved to a cam from a right wing I kind

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.470 
moved to a cam from a right wing I kind
of<00:02:23.190> put<00:02:23.340> him<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.640> central<00:02:24.060> role<00:02:24.240> because

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
of put him in that central role because

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.720 
of put him in that central role because
that's<00:02:24.630> why<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.960> feel<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.770> he<00:02:25.980> plays<00:02:26.220> best<00:02:26.490> and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
that's why I feel that he plays best and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.940 
that's why I feel that he plays best and
he'd<00:02:26.850> be<00:02:26.880> better<00:02:27.090> suited<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.810> FIFA<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.770> course

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
he'd be better suited for FIFA of course

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.320 
he'd be better suited for FIFA of course
bear<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.250> mind<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:29.580> he<00:02:29.880> had<00:02:30.090> been<00:02:30.300> a

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470

15<00:03:47.790> or<00:03:48.120> not<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.540> would<00:03:48.630> presume<00:03:49.020> that<00:03:49.050> they'll

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
probably keep him a right-wing but i've

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.670 
probably keep him a right-wing but i've
decided<00:03:51.270> to<00:03:51.450> move<00:03:51.600> them<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.840> camp<00:03:52.020> 4<00:03:52.170> under

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
is Philippe Coutinho and the first thing

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.720 
is Philippe Coutinho and the first thing
that<00:03:58.050> jumps<00:03:58.350> out<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.530> there<00:03:58.739> or<00:03:58.980> jumps<00:03:59.340> out<00:03:59.489> at

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
that jumps out you there or jumps out at

that jumps out you there or jumps out at
you<00:03:59.910> various<00:04:00.209> fact<00:04:00.420> I've<00:04:00.570> upped<00:04:00.810> him<00:04:00.959> from

you various fact I've upped him from

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.370 
you various fact I've upped him from
8281<00:04:02.280> overall<00:04:03.239> because<00:04:03.480> he<00:04:03.959> had<00:04:04.050> a<00:04:04.110> very<00:04:04.290> very

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
8281 overall because he had a very very

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.170 
8281 overall because he had a very very
good<00:04:04.530> season<00:04:04.770> last<00:04:05.100> year<00:04:05.250> for<00:04:05.610> Liverpool<00:04:06.060> and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
good season last year for Liverpool and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.810 
good season last year for Liverpool and
was<00:04:06.900> involved<00:04:07.140> in<00:04:07.350> a<00:04:07.500> lot<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.670> the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
was involved in a lot of the of the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.370 
was involved in a lot of the of the
creative<00:04:09.270> stuff<00:04:09.510> going<00:04:09.780> forward<00:04:10.080> which<00:04:10.230> is

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
creative stuff going forward which is

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.050 
creative stuff going forward which is
the<00:04:10.500> reason<00:04:10.739> why<00:04:11.130> his<00:04:11.190> passing<00:04:11.670> has<00:04:11.760> gone<00:04:11.910> up

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
the reason why his passing has gone up

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.790 
the reason why his passing has gone up
one<00:04:12.269> doesn't<00:04:12.780> score<00:04:12.989> too<00:04:13.140> many<00:04:13.320> goals<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.769> I

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
one doesn't score too many goals and I

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.650 
one doesn't score too many goals and I
don't<00:04:13.980> think<00:04:14.190> he's<00:04:14.310> shooting<00:04:14.730> deserves<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.570> be

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
don't think he's shooting deserves to be

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.150 
don't think he's shooting deserves to be
as<00:04:15.720> high<00:04:15.810> as<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:15.959> was<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:16.320> drop<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.680> by<00:04:16.859> one<00:04:17.040> is

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
as high as it was so drop that by one is

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.190 
as high as it was so drop that by one is
