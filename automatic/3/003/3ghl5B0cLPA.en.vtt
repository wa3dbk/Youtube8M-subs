00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.320
Hi everyone! This is Anpan Kids TV!

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.300
Today we're gonna play Anpanman easy shogi (Japanese chess)! 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.440
We have done step 1 and 2 in the former video,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.720
so this time we finally try step 3!

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.029
So, let's play!

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.490
For the beginning, I'm explaining the rule briefly to you, Leonard!

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.609
This side is Team Baikinman, and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.240
this side is Team Anpanman.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.270
Each piece can proceed to the direction which the arrows indicate!

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.050

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.710
So, in Baikinman's case, he can move to forward, sides or diagonally front.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.840
Horror man is able to move forward, or sides.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.040
Dokinchan can move forward or diagonally front!

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.980
We're moving the pieces each other in turns.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.699
For example, if Baikinman moves here,

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.780

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.600
Currypanman

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.810
will be taken!

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.730
He will be caught by Baikinman!

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.920
He is taken out!

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.520
When he goes across the line, they will win!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.510
In reverse, if Anpanman goes across this line, they will win! 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.530
In addition, for instance,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.180
if Horror man

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.920
can catch Anpanman, 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.040
Team Baikinman will win!

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.480
It's a bit confising, but don't worry Leonard,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.320
let's try it step by step!

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.600
So, let's start!

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.860

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.799
We have to exchange greetings for beginning!

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.279
Yoroshiku Onegai Shimasu! (Let's do our best!)

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.980
Leonard, please go ahead!

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.660
How will you move your first piece??

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.869
Oh, Currypanman moved forward!

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.039
Shokupanman proceeds to forward!

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.840
Here we go.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.720
Okay~

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.140
Anpanman slides to the right, correct?

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.680
Then... I let it move like this.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.060
Awh~ I couldn't cheat you!!

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.689
I thought you did not recognize but it was wrong~!

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.319
Baikinman has gone...

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.989
So you won, Leonard!

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.949
I lost... :(

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.140
All right, for ending, let's exchange greeting again!

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.719

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.629
"It was a good game. Thank you so much!"

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.819
Since I lost so quickly,

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.589
we're having a revenge match!

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:18.149
And now our pieces are located like this.

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.679
Let's go!!!

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.460
Baikinman gets Currypanman!

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.949
I caught him!

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.790
Oh no you took Dokinchan from my team...

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.280

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:41.949
However,

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.029
I am already here, Leonard!

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.560

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.200
Goooooal!

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.699
Yey!

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.849
This time I won:)

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.569
Thank you so much.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.659
Leonard looks disappointed... haha

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:05.829
Don't be so serious, Leonard!

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.769
Let's learn English for finishing!

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.169

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.039
This shogi piece is made of wood.

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.099
What is "ki" in English?

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.139
Ki is called wood in English

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.999

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.090

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.120
Please keep it in mind!

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.660
I hope you enjoy this video!

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.180
Thanks for watching! See you next time! Bye!
