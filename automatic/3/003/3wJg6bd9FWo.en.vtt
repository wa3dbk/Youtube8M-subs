the sealed grounds and if there's not
birds<00:00:18.750> there<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:20.010> wait<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:20.670> birds<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.060> pop

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
birds there just wait for birds to pop

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.080 
birds there just wait for birds to pop
up<00:00:21.600> at<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.439> door<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.310> just<00:00:23.519> wait<00:00:23.670> at<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> door

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
up at the door so just wait at the door

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.470 
up at the door so just wait at the door
until<00:00:24.570> more<00:00:25.260> birds<00:00:25.500> pop<00:00:25.859> up<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.330> go

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
until more birds pop up or you can go

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.070 
until more birds pop up or you can go
inside<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.320> back<00:00:28.439> outside<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:29.550> usually<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
inside and back outside but usually the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.979 
inside and back outside but usually the
birds<00:00:31.349> pop<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.920> faster<00:00:32.520> then<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.420> would<00:00:33.750> take

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
birds pop up faster then it would take

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.979 
birds pop up faster then it would take
to<00:00:34.320> go<00:00:34.440> inside<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.280> back<00:00:35.670> outside<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.750> I

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
to go inside then back outside so I

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.260 
to go inside then back outside so I
would<00:00:37.260> recommend<00:00:37.440> waiting<00:00:38.280> at<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.700> door<00:00:38.969> of

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
really really slowly as slow as I can go

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.149 
really really slowly as slow as I can go
and<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.399> swing<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.729> fast<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.619> time<00:01:53.130> I

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and just swing it fast so that time I

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.580 
and just swing it fast so that time I
did<00:01:53.970> get<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.950> bird<00:01:55.950> feather<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:57.229> I'll<00:01:58.229> show<00:01:58.530> you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
did get a bird feather so I'll show you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.810 
did get a bird feather so I'll show you
the<00:01:59.310> method<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.880> go<00:02:00.030> inside<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.810> back<00:02:00.960> outside

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.510 

sometimes<00:02:04.820> it's<00:02:05.299> faster<00:02:05.929> than<00:02:06.710> weeding

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
sometimes it's faster than weeding

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.089 
sometimes it's faster than weeding
because<00:02:08.450> sometimes<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.349> birds<00:02:09.590> don't<00:02:09.800> come

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
because sometimes the birds don't come

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.589 
because sometimes the birds don't come
back<00:02:10.340> as<00:02:10.670> fast<00:02:12.730> they<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:13.970> come<00:02:14.180> back<00:02:14.360> at

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
back as fast they just come back at

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.540 
back as fast they just come back at
random<00:02:15.069> so<00:02:16.069> go<00:02:16.790> inside<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.620> turn<00:02:18.860> around<00:02:19.190> go

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
random so go inside and turn around go

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.920 
random so go inside and turn around go
back<00:02:19.580> outside<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.920> right<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:22.569> I'm<00:02:23.569> gonna<00:02:23.720> go

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
back outside so right now I'm gonna go

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.910 
back outside so right now I'm gonna go
back<00:02:24.140> out<00:02:24.700> pull<00:02:25.700> out<00:02:25.730> my<00:02:26.000> net<00:02:26.180> walk<00:02:26.930> up<00:02:27.170> really

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
back out pull out my net walk up really

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.580 
back out pull out my net walk up really
really<00:02:28.250> slowly

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.850 

very<00:02:36.250> swing<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.090> really<00:02:37.390> fast<00:02:37.660> there<00:02:38.590> we<00:02:38.680> go<00:02:38.830> I

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860
