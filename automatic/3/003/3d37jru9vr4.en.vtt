00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
case to make sure it's on the inside

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.120 
case to make sure it's on the inside
because<00:02:07.690> it's<00:02:07.960> on<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.200> outside<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.770> could

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
because it's on the outside it could

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.160 
because it's on the outside it could
possibly<00:02:09.340> chip<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.179> then<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.660> just<00:02:10.840> keep

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
possibly chip and then you just keep

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.440 
possibly chip and then you just keep
them<00:02:11.410> in<00:02:11.620> your<00:02:11.650> little<00:02:12.160> paint<00:02:12.400> away<00:02:12.519> once<00:02:13.090> you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
them in your little paint away once you

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.690 
them in your little paint away once you
finish<00:02:13.959> dabbing<00:02:14.500> or<00:02:14.739> at<00:02:15.040> least<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.519> get

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
finish dabbing or at least you get

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.640 
finish dabbing or at least you get
enough<00:02:15.970> paint<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.540> your<00:02:16.690> cases<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.080> want<00:02:17.410> just

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
enough paint on your cases you want just

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.560 
enough paint on your cases you want just
start<00:02:17.920> blowing<00:02:18.400> at<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.610> very<00:02:18.910> bottom<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.390> your

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
start blowing at the very bottom of your

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.290 
start blowing at the very bottom of your
case<00:02:19.780> or<00:02:20.050> just<00:02:20.680> tilt<00:02:21.100> your<00:02:21.280> case<00:02:21.580> upside<00:02:22.090> down

so the paint starts moving to the top of

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.400 
so the paint starts moving to the top of
the<00:02:24.940> case<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.480> makes<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.900> really<00:02:25.930> really

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
the case and it makes a really really

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.530 
the case and it makes a really really
cool<00:02:26.530> little<00:02:27.100> transformation<00:02:28.030> thing<00:02:28.269> with<00:02:28.510> a
