00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.730
 video tutorial I'm going to show you the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.200
 best psp games without a doubt 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.200
 well let's start this shit 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.670
 at number 10 we have with 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.590
 steak to the bravo 3 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.230
 this is a bullet game in third 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.619
 person with very good graphics a 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.869
 good interfax a good sound you are a 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.750
 soldier and you must do missions against 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.610
 mercenaries the gameplay is acceptable 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.559
 but the controls are crap and the 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.320
 game form is garbage because it is 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.590
 very uncomfortable at number 9 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.690
 we have great tourism this is a great 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.360
 game that has the best graphics in 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.070
 cars and tracks has a sound 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.560
 Enveloping the game is about 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.140
 you compete in 35 circuits around 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.570
 world and you can win more than 800 cars 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.360
 It has very accurate controls and a 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.160
 easy handling the game is about who you are 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.230
 a professional pilot and you must win 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.600
 championships to advance in this game 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.970
 against I have to say that it is a 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.189
 shit that's why he's in this position 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.049
 because you can not change the cars and it's 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.229
 very professional if you like you are a 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.590
 chupaculos in the position number 8 we have 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.350
 spears ones filter this is a game 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.240
 action with good graphics and good sound 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.430
 has a variety of weapons both 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.920
 combat as strategy plus glasses 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.600
 of night vision and heat the game 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.540
 try that an Iranian mercenary 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.460
 kidnaps an American ship and touches 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.070
 go to take control of the ship again 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.409
 the gameplay is good but my opinion 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.869
 You can put the controls on the 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.330
 ass what I do not like either is that 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.500
 this story is very short in the post 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.690
 number 7 we have call of duty this is a 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.460
 game with good graphics outdoors 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.369
 and in the game has an enveloping sound 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.860
 in combat the story is the same great 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.990
 fucking medal of honor story has 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.789
 easy controls to operate the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.830
 gameplay is that you must do missions 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.490
 to advance in the story you can 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.000
 unlock artillery images going on 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.950
 the missions has an online mode I have 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.430
 to say that this bastard game is very 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.340
 short and that seems crazy to me shitting in 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.160
 the number 6 place we have godos guard 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.319
 olympus this is a prequel to god of 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.299
 war 1 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.950
 has good graphics good 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.799
 good detail lighting in your 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.870
 characters and exteriors has a sound 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.639
 Envelope in combat and videos 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.349
 story is that kratos fucked by his 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.989
 nightmares for killing his family 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.150
 serve the gods to help him 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.129
 forget them he must save the world from 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.650
 Atlas and the fucking wife of Ares who 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.659
 they want to destroy the world in my opinion 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.790
 it's not so good that's why it's in this 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.010
 position has a good gameplay 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.749
 but this fucking game is very short and 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.819
 that did hurt the pee balls 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:56.930
 apart the bastard who did it took it out on 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.760
 English at number 5 we have 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.609
 assassins believe this game starts 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.340
 after asÃ­n 1 is a game with 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:08.250
 some spectacular graphics both in 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.230
 characters like the game outside 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.480
 try that you're a century killer 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.340
 fourth you must do missions killing 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.829
 objectives that fight against you and are 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.840
 on behalf of the Templars who are a 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.689
 sect dedicated to enforcing the laws 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.389
 that they impose you can climb up 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.459
 walls the story is very good because 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.890
 you are altair a character of life 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.290
 passed which manages our 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.780
 that is in the animus that is a machine 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.020
 that transports you to the past as one 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.110
 of your ancestors in the position number 4 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.090
 we have need for speed most glove 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.850
 this game has good graphics in its 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.220
 cars and tracks the nitro looks really 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.380
 It has a good sound both on the track 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.300
 as in his soundtrack he does not have a 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.240
 good story because it's a game of 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.310
 Pendejo cars have exquisite controls 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.870
 that you can configure to your liking the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.330
 which give you a way to play 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.970
 nice the game mode is that 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.700
 you compete against 17 players winning their 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.459
 challenges and cars which is going up 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.989

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.120
 car game although they are not 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.180
 published in other tutorials is the 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.150
 best car game for the psp in the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.239

 missions to finish the game what not 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.430
 I like it is that the fags checkpoint 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.220
 they are far away has a way 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.160
