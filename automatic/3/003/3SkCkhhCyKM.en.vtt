00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.799
 so to all 335 and the scent of tobacco 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.610
 today is a deceased snuff 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.840
 who sent me agreed it means 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.560
 that is , water is tobacco 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.650
 Pahar 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.390
 cigarettes in a cigar factory and where 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.390
 Rotenberg Nevsky Prospect 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.649
 tank is a mixture 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:43.469
 berlin and the range of tobacco and virgini 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:50.910
 Well, the tobacco came to me honestly 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:54.140
 for sushinu he could not stand for a long time you 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.140
 I had to revive a little 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.479
 and give it a bit to come round and here 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.830
 today we will try 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:09.549
 we will smoke on damn kunas tape 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:18.450
 slicing so the problem is clogging I think 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:20.549
 will not be cold because tobacco gives such 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.630
 quite restrained 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.600
 nut tones woody little graft 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.720
 tree 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.659
 there is certainly quite bright and 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.810
 dominant so sweet sugar 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.390
 caramel and here I have it for something 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.649
 it seemed superfluous because what if 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:47.270
 this caramel is enough to drop 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:49.009
 discreet pleasant would be the smell of tobacco 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.149
 here I think loading factory 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:56.590
 pursued a sort of big widen 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:01.850
 audience of consumers of this tobacco and 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.069
 humpback century and lovers 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.560
 flavored blends gentle remember 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.159
 who's not very good is that 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.159
 we started here 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.550
 but 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:31.900
 start bright such woody star them 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:37.209
 in the flavor under the apparent effect 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.790
 dominant berley here when I got 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.690
 add again thought he at all 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:48.730
 first because the content is burley in it 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:55.269
 big enough marks Sasha from banks 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:57.370
 poured therefore certainly here 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.079
 dominates of course burley you are such 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.079
 woody nut flavor and eat 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.079
 sweetness 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.530
 but it is very light barely perceptible big 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.180
 primacy apparently oriental topokki 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.709
 which will amount to freezing tied 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.709
 declared they give 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.550
 nice such a peppercorn she is not on things 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.040
 very nice and interesting and start 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.450
 let's see what happens next I think 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.880
 that at the end we will meet on our straw 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:45.620
 little while I said it myself already on them 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.420
 here a quarter smoked it let's see what 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.200
 will be at the end and already some results 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.200
 slipper won 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.050
 so my friends will finish my tank 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.400
 can say about 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:06.000
 the aromatics taste was definitely coming 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.460
 really liked the middle of the tube 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.560
 taste like that first to the middle 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:19.090
 formed in the middle they turned 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:23.830
 such a nice nuts wonderful aroma with 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.360
 volumes enough son so 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.080
 poison is very interesting 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.850
 turned aromas in virginia unconditionally 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.480
 affected from such a left to easy easy 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.360
 sweetness was 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.180
 but unfortunately all cooking is not soared 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:43.040
 there that peppery thats that's what 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:46.030
 the tube was she became such 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:52.610
 then slightly on things turned into such 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:56.750
 not a very pleasant bitterness here which 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:00.920
 the end just closed all the flavor and and 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.830
 enough thing was impossible snuff 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:09.040
 barrel damaged after all transportation 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.970
 that is, the mind could not recover after 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.510
 final moisture loss because 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.360
 well, after drying, tobacco loses and 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.520
 the company some finns and 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.670
 oils which unfortunately because 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.720
 moisture does not establish that there 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.820
 perhaps the ending for this was 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.680
 unintelligible unpleasant but maybe not 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.730
 that is, but I cannot say I am tobacco 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:39.760
 Sorry , I didn't smoke from a jar, but like this 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:42.020
 so that is, but there is some problem 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.210
 Bulgarian taverns, as it were, with 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:49.570
 on the one hand everything is good but on the other 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:53.059
 the parties have some definite 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.169
 always certain defects 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:58.249
 mobile and enough is enough 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:01.139
 I wonder what a nice Berlin mixes 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:03.689
 so uninterestingly boring and unpleasant 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.429
 ending well on this probably all thanks 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.429
 that we dry up the lines before new meetings
