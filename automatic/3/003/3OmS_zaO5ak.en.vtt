the next step is going to involve me
taking<00:00:46.980> my<00:00:47.390> measuring<00:00:48.390> device<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.850> finding

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
taking my measuring device and finding

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.369 
taking my measuring device and finding
the<00:00:51.000> middle<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:53.270> this<00:00:54.270> side<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.870> box<00:00:55.110> so

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the middle of this side of the box so

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.290 
the middle of this side of the box so
this<00:00:56.309> box<00:00:56.789> measures<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:58.879> just<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.969> shade

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
this box measures to be just a shade

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.860 
this box measures to be just a shade
over<00:01:00.620> 7<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.739> 1/16<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:02.699> inch<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.690> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
over 7 and 1/16 is an inch in this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.939 
over 7 and 1/16 is an inch in this
direction<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.530> want<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> make<00:01:04.830> it

where I'm going to cut for the neck and
as<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:42.150> know<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.600> piece<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.960> wood<00:01:43.170> is

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
as we know this piece of wood is

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.370 
as we know this piece of wood is
one-and-a-half<00:01:44.460> inches<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.060> direction

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
one-and-a-half inches in this direction

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.880 
one-and-a-half inches in this direction
three-quarters<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.409> an<00:01:46.530> inch<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.770> this

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
three-quarters of an inch in this

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.999 
three-quarters of an inch in this
direction<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.409> I'm<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> measure<00:01:49.860> out

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
direction so I'm going to measure out

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.030 
direction so I'm going to measure out
three<00:01:50.850> quarters<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.420> an<00:01:51.540> inch<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.960> either<00:01:52.560> side

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
three quarters of an inch on either side

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.380 
three quarters of an inch on either side
of<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.930> center<00:01:55.320> point<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.860> box<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.430> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
of the center point on this box as that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.830 
of the center point on this box as that
would<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:57.570> an<00:01:57.840> inch<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> half<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.409> total<00:01:59.840> so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
would be an inch and a half in total so

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.389 
would be an inch and a half in total so
