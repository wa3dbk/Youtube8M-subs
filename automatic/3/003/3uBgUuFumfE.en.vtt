let's dive right in now we will be

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.900 
let's dive right in now we will be
taking<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.710> look<00:00:46.829> at<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> fastest<00:00:47.460> based<00:00:47.670> route

and<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> fastest<00:00:48.660> way<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.840> earn<00:00:49.050> ten<00:00:49.289> coins<00:00:49.500> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and the fastest way to earn ten coins I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
and the fastest way to earn ten coins I
say<00:00:50.460> base<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.090> need<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> learn<00:00:51.510> well

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
