00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
that does distillation guy as well as a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
that does distillation guy as well as a
cd-rom<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:51.589> says<00:00:51.830> stuck<00:00:52.129> here<00:00:53.050> this<00:00:54.050> e<00:00:54.199> s9<00:00:54.500> 32

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
cd-rom that says stuck here this e s9 32

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.030 
cd-rom that says stuck here this e s9 32
L<00:00:55.159> is<00:00:55.430> small<00:00:55.580> pump<00:00:56.449> size<00:00:56.720> slim<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.500> light<00:00:57.710> so

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
L is small pump size slim and light so

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.399 
L is small pump size slim and light so
you<00:00:58.100> can<00:00:58.190> easily<00:00:58.489> mount<00:00:58.879> it<00:00:59.059> on<00:00:59.150> your<00:00:59.180> wall

you can easily mount it on your wall
another<00:01:00.409> advantage<00:01:00.769> is<00:01:00.949> that<00:01:01.129> dcs-932l<00:01:02.000> does

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
another advantage is that dcs-932l does

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.869 
another advantage is that dcs-932l does
not<00:01:02.809> have<00:01:02.989> external<00:01:03.500> antennas<00:01:04.040> so<00:01:04.460> hiding<00:01:04.670> it

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
not have external antennas so hiding it

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.730 
not have external antennas so hiding it
away<00:01:04.970> is<00:01:05.269> easy<00:01:08.140> all<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:09.200> is<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:10.130> laptop<00:01:11.000> or

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
away is easy all it is a laptop or

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.819 
away is easy all it is a laptop or
desktop<00:01:12.740> an<00:01:13.399> errata<00:01:14.380> with<00:01:15.380> internet<00:01:15.799> access

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
desktop an errata with internet access

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.490 
desktop an errata with internet access
in<00:01:16.640> order<00:01:16.789> to<00:01:16.939> get<00:01:17.500> dcs-932l<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:19.100> work

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.520 

this<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.700> dcs-932l<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.660> we<00:01:24.840> shall<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.170> how<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
this is dcs-932l so we shall see how it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:34.780 
this is dcs-932l so we shall see how it
works<00:01:25.740> by<00:01:26.040> my<00:01:26.340> dealing

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.880 

so<00:01:35.330> now<00:01:35.450> I'm<00:01:35.540> going<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.810> find<00:01:36.050> in<00:01:36.290> using<00:01:36.710> the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
so now I'm going to find in using the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:45.480 
so now I'm going to find in using the
cadets<00:01:37.400> that<00:01:37.610> I<00:01:37.670> previously

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.120 

as<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.610> can<00:01:46.790> see<00:01:47.030> every<00:01:47.500> mydlink<00:01:48.500> camera<00:01:48.710> will

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
as you can see every mydlink camera will

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.810 
as you can see every mydlink camera will
have<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.490> unique<00:01:49.910> by<00:01:50.510> giving<00:01:50.810> number<00:01:51.200> over<00:01:51.440> here

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
have a unique by giving number over here

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.540 
have a unique by giving number over here
on<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.940> left<00:01:53.180> hand<00:01:53.300> side<00:01:53.660> there<00:01:54.140> will<00:01:54.230> be<00:01:54.260> a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
on the left hand side there will be a

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.800 
on the left hand side there will be a
series<00:01:55.550> of<00:01:55.580> you<00:01:55.850> know<00:01:55.940> devices<00:01:56.480> that<00:01:56.660> you<00:01:56.780> can

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810

shown you previously select the model so

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.770 
shown you previously select the model so
you<00:02:08.360> can<00:02:08.570> now<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.780> know<00:02:08.930> adjust<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:10.310> camera
