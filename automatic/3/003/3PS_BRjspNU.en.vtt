00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.600 
download speed this is my upload as you
can<00:01:34.409> see<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.619> wasn't<00:01:34.740> bad<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.070> was<00:01:35.369> hitting

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
can see it wasn't bad I was hitting

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.719 
can see it wasn't bad I was hitting
seventeen<00:01:36.180> sixteen<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.220> soon<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.549> I

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
seventeen sixteen but as soon as I

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.569 
seventeen sixteen but as soon as I
connected<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.450> airport<00:01:40.380> Express<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.979> started

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
connected the airport Express I started

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.649 
connected the airport Express I started
hitting<00:01:41.670> thirty<00:01:42.049> on<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.110> regular<00:01:43.560> basis<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:47.659> it

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
hitting thirty on a regular basis so it

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.359 
hitting thirty on a regular basis so it
definitely<00:01:49.320> increases<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.890> speed<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.250> your

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
definitely increases the speed of your

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.740 
definitely increases the speed of your
internet<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.149> you're<00:01:51.329> thinking<00:01:51.659> about

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
internet so if you're thinking about

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.469 
internet so if you're thinking about
buying<00:01:52.079> an<00:01:52.860> Apple<00:01:53.310> Airport<00:01:53.670> Express<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
buying an Apple Airport Express and
