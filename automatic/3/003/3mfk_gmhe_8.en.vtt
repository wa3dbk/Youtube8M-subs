00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone gave it time that it wasn't 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.049
 convinced on the lex replay in fact 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.330
 pokemon x and pokemon start however today 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.210
 They have developed a code can rejoice 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.259
 now I'm not sure that in my opinion 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.850
 is very important 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.109
 however not all we say have 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.439
 it just happens how to use this code 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.689
 it is already but where are the codes of the gods 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.820
 objects and have message in the reached 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.300
 another note that says get everyone 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.130
 all objects only with that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.950
 code just get really little 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.460
 all the objects of all the games that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.870
 They have come out in practice by the Rossoblu and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.160
 for example 8 in the network the various gems that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.920
 as I understand it they were not 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.570
 accessible was not yet accessible 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.570
 if not with the cyber gadget 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:13.080
 here they are and then another object that 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.720
 surely it has several of you can 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.420
 like these guys I didn't have 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.420
 never seen this attack x2 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.240
 if anyone maybe some more game 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.770
 older because i played up to 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.040
 pokemon rubino so I don't know if 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.619
 be part of some more game 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.340
 old I don't even know how they were 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.440
 available however what it can 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.080
 interesting to many of you is definitely 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:02:00.540
 let's see it was set before support 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:02:03.229
 morning the iPhone is we look for it 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.979
 to find it because there really are 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.979
 with infinite objects 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:19.260
 let's see where the leagues are 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.770
 koch which are of pokÃ©mon or silver 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.790
 because I remember that they came out of these 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.790
 the few or balls 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.940
 then let's see if I can 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.940
 find two 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.160
 also the lucio church for example that 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.410
 hard enough to find why 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:53.610
 must take from goals for there not me 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:56.820
 memory is the most important one 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:03.120
 I would like you to see here it is precisely here 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:06.950
 the z ok one that can be given precisely 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.950
 allasio is the ati ass 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.459
 but I hope this video is there 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.790
 liked 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:18.450
 so if you have the power sales go 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.170
 immediately use this code because 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.190
 I think he's okay rise up against 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:30.200
 by all and what to say see you at 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.200
 next video hello
