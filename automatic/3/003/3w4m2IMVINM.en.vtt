00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
here I actually mount it behind the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.710 
here I actually mount it behind the
passenger<00:00:19.949> seat<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.910> reason<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.210> do<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.390> is

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
passenger seat the reason I do that is

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.439 
passenger seat the reason I do that is
mostly<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.500> because<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.220> easier<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> get

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
mostly just because it's easier to get

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.290 
mostly just because it's easier to get
to<00:00:24.510> there's<00:00:25.250> really<00:00:26.250> easy<00:00:26.400> access<00:00:26.640> from<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
to there's really easy access from the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.999 
to there's really easy access from the
driver's<00:00:27.840> seat<00:00:27.960> there<00:00:28.250> for<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> bottle

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
driver's seat there for the bottle

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.799 
driver's seat there for the bottle
the<00:00:32.009> older<00:00:32.309> NOS<00:00:32.700> bottles<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> skinnier<00:00:33.600> ones

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the older NOS bottles the skinnier ones

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.319 
the older NOS bottles the skinnier ones
like<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.200> will<00:00:34.530> fit<00:00:34.770> back<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.010> no<00:00:35.820> problem

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
like this will fit back here no problem

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.139 
like this will fit back here no problem
the<00:00:37.140> fatter<00:00:37.380> ones<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> newer<00:00:38.040> style<00:00:38.700> NOS

bottles<00:00:39.480> won't<00:00:39.719> fit<00:00:39.930> behind<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> seat<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
bottles won't fit behind the seat so a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.670 
bottles won't fit behind the seat so a
lot<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.399> people<00:00:41.550> don't<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.530> but<00:00:43.530> again

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
lot of people don't know that but again

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.500 
lot of people don't know that but again
it's<00:00:43.950> don't<00:00:44.700> need<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> remote<00:00:45.149> bottle<00:00:45.300> opener

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
it's don't need a remote bottle opener

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.080 
it's don't need a remote bottle opener
and<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.020> easy<00:00:46.530> access<00:00:47.039> from<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.399> driver's

and it's easy access from the driver's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.660 
and it's easy access from the driver's
seat<00:00:48.239> there<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.660> see<00:00:49.309> you<00:00:50.309> notice<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
seat there as you can see you notice the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.069 
seat there as you can see you notice the
bottles<00:00:50.969> twist<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.480> bit<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.870> it's

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
bottles twist a little bit as it's

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
bottles twist a little bit as it's
mounted<00:00:52.440> that's<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:53.039> as<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.610> accelerate

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
mounted that's because as you accelerate

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.729 
mounted that's because as you accelerate
the<00:00:54.120> nitrous<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.840> liquid<00:00:55.140> nitrous<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.590> going

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the nitrous the liquid nitrous is going

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.860 
the nitrous the liquid nitrous is going
to<00:00:55.800> flow<00:00:56.010> toward<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.610> back<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> bottle

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
to flow toward the back of the bottle

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.439 
to flow toward the back of the bottle
there<00:00:58.050> which<00:00:58.859> would<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> left<00:01:00.059> side<00:01:00.270> as

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
there which would be the left side as

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.770 
there which would be the left side as
we're<00:01:00.600> looking<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.250> it's<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.780> gets

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
we're looking at it it's just so it gets

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.359 
we're looking at it it's just so it gets
picked<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.140> under<00:01:04.439> acceleration<00:01:04.739> you're<00:01:05.280> not

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
picked up under acceleration you're not

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.990 
picked up under acceleration you're not
picking<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:05.970> air<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:07.610> also<00:01:08.610> notice<00:01:08.970> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
picking up just air I also notice that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.440 
picking up just air I also notice that
the<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.479> mounted<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.960> wood<00:01:10.260> board<00:01:11.450> the

the it's mounted to a wood board the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.730 
the it's mounted to a wood board the
reason<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.049> didn't<00:01:13.350> want<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.500> drill

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
reason I do that I didn't want to drill

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.990 
reason I do that I didn't want to drill
any<00:01:13.890> holes<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.189> anything<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.640> floor<00:01:14.850> of

the<00:01:21.689> nitrous<00:01:22.020> off<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> line<00:01:23.640> kind<00:01:23.970> of

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the nitrous off you see the line kind of

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.810 
the nitrous off you see the line kind of
running<00:01:25.020> right<00:01:25.170> down<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.860> goes<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.670> into

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
running right down there I goes up into

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.250 
running right down there I goes up into
the<00:01:26.939> console<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.630> point

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
the console at that point

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.760 
the console at that point
and<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.090> center<00:01:31.390> console<00:01:31.870> see<00:01:32.470> it<00:01:32.560> runs

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
and from the center console see it runs

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.940 
and from the center console see it runs
up<00:01:32.920> under<00:01:33.160> the<00:01:33.280> -<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.520> little<00:01:34.060> bit<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.770> pretty

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
up under the - a little bit it's pretty

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.290 
up under the - a little bit it's pretty
well<00:01:36.100> secured<00:01:36.460> up<00:01:36.580> in<00:01:36.700> there<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.060> you'll

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
well secured up in there so that you'll

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.410 
well secured up in there so that you'll
be<00:01:37.420> able<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.660> see<00:01:37.780> much<00:01:37.960> more<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.300> goes

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
be able to see much more then it goes

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.470 
be able to see much more then it goes
out<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.690> door<00:01:40.870> here<00:01:42.120> again<00:01:43.120> I<00:01:43.150> didn't<00:01:43.420> make

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
out the door here again I didn't make

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.820 
out the door here again I didn't make
any<00:01:43.690> holes<00:01:43.900> in<00:01:44.080> there<00:01:44.230> I<00:01:44.260> just<00:01:44.320> kind<00:01:44.620> of<00:01:44.650> went

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
any holes in there I just kind of went

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.300 
any holes in there I just kind of went
through<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.070> rubber<00:01:45.250> boot<00:01:45.600> for<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:47.310> door

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
through the rubber boot for the door

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.300 
through the rubber boot for the door
itself<00:01:48.700> all<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.270> electronics<00:01:49.750> in<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.930> door

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
itself all the electronics in the door

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.500 
itself all the electronics in the door
the<00:01:51.310> reason<00:01:51.550> I<00:01:51.580> did<00:01:51.730> that<00:01:51.760> again<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.210> just<00:01:52.240> to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
the reason I did that again is just to

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.330 
the reason I did that again is just to
keep<00:01:52.630> any<00:01:52.810> permanent<00:01:53.230> holes<00:01:53.500> from<00:01:53.740> getting<00:01:54.280> in

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
keep any permanent holes from getting in

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.390 
keep any permanent holes from getting in
the<00:01:54.430> car<00:01:54.610> potential<00:01:55.180> rust<00:01:55.360> problems<00:01:55.720> later<00:01:55.930> on

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
the car potential rust problems later on

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
the car potential rust problems later on
well<00:01:57.400> while<00:01:57.700> I'm<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:57.940> here<00:01:57.970> I'll<00:01:58.150> go<00:01:58.210> ahead<00:01:58.270> and

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
well while I'm in here I'll go ahead and

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.010 
well while I'm in here I'll go ahead and
show<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:58.980> the<00:01:59.980> nitrous<00:02:00.400> switch<00:02:00.760> my<00:02:01.180> panel<00:02:01.840> and

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
show you the nitrous switch my panel and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.430 
show you the nitrous switch my panel and
mounting<00:02:02.860> location<00:02:03.400> I<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.840> put<00:02:05.020> it<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.260> there

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
mounting location I just put it in there

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.280 
mounting location I just put it in there
and<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:06.430> ashtray<00:02:06.990> spot

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
and the ashtray spot

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.200 
and the ashtray spot
took<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.950> ashtray<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.790> actually<00:02:10.060> made<00:02:10.180> a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
took the ashtray this is actually made a

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.580 
took the ashtray this is actually made a
wood<00:02:10.450> I'll<00:02:10.660> probably<00:02:10.869> end<00:02:11.050> up<00:02:11.110> making<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.470> of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
wood I'll probably end up making it of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.960 
wood I'll probably end up making it of
metal<00:02:11.920> laters<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.400> now<00:02:12.490> that<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.700> have<00:02:12.880> the

metal laters and now that I have the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.080 
metal laters and now that I have the
dimensions<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:14.800> just<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.100> RadioShack<00:02:15.550> rocker

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.410 

you<00:02:38.489> can<00:02:38.610> see<00:02:38.760> where<00:02:38.909> the<00:02:39.110> nitrous<00:02:40.110> runs<00:02:40.379> in

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
you can see where the nitrous runs in

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.770 
you can see where the nitrous runs in
through<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.680> hole<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.209> engine<00:02:45.209> bay<00:02:45.540> back

through the hole in the engine bay back

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.949 
through the hole in the engine bay back
there<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.140> was<00:02:46.260> already<00:02:46.470> there<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:47.959> went

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
there that was already there I went

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.630 
there that was already there I went
ahead<00:02:49.019> just<00:02:49.290> ran<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.560> up<00:02:49.680> through<00:02:50.220> there<00:02:50.400> it

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
ahead just ran it up through there it

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.000 
ahead just ran it up through there it
goes<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.030> first<00:02:51.209> cylinder<00:02:51.659> there<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.290> see

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
goes to the first cylinder there I see

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.500 
goes to the first cylinder there I see
the<00:02:53.129> regulator<00:02:53.549> assembly<00:02:53.700> in<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.239> end<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.450> the

the regulator assembly in the end of the
two<00:02:54.900> solenoids<00:02:55.140> there<00:02:55.650> go<00:02:56.310> ahead<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.549> tell

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
two solenoids there go ahead and tell

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.130 
two solenoids there go ahead and tell
you<00:02:56.819> how<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.000> system<00:02:57.480> works<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.810> case<00:02:57.989> you're

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
you how the system works in case you're

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.140 
you how the system works in case you're
not<00:02:58.260> familiar<00:02:58.410> with<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.950> that's<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.430> NOS<00:02:59.879> dry

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150

but<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.930> first<00:03:04.170> solenoid<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.709> see<00:03:04.890> back

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
but the first solenoid you see back

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.850 
but the first solenoid you see back
there<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:06.150> one<00:03:06.299> that's<00:03:06.420> actually

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
there is the one that's actually

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.470 
there is the one that's actually
operated<00:03:07.860> by<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.400> arming<00:03:08.849> switch<00:03:09.120> and

there for the kit one side of that

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.500 
there for the kit one side of that
obviously<00:03:54.050> runs<00:03:54.470> down<00:03:54.650> into<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:55.300> vacuum<00:03:56.300> port

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
obviously runs down into the vacuum port

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.000 
obviously runs down into the vacuum port
for<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.810> intake<00:03:57.080> manifold<00:03:57.560> that's<00:03:57.800> going<00:03:57.950> to

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
for the intake manifold that's going to

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.940 
for the intake manifold that's going to
be<00:03:58.099> your<00:03:58.220> bleed<00:03:58.519> off<00:03:59.140> which<00:04:00.140> basically<00:04:00.709> it's

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
be your bleed off which basically it's

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.559 
be your bleed off which basically it's
going<00:04:01.069> to<00:04:01.160> vent<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.610> certain<00:04:02.330> amount<00:04:02.510> of

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
going to vent a certain amount of

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.610 
going to vent a certain amount of
nitrous<00:04:02.900> into<00:04:03.080> your<00:04:03.200> intake<00:04:03.500> at<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:03.799> point

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
nitrous into your intake at that point

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.350 
nitrous into your intake at that point
the<00:04:06.620> second<00:04:06.980> line<00:04:07.099> here<00:04:07.280> runs<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.940> fuel

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
the second line here runs to the fuel

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.550 
the second line here runs to the fuel
pressure<00:04:08.599> regulator<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.290> that's<00:04:09.440> what

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
pressure regulator and that's what

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.890 
pressure regulator and that's what
actually<00:04:09.739> bumps<00:04:10.130> your<00:04:10.250> fuel<00:04:10.459> pressure<00:04:10.610> up<00:04:11.030> so

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
actually bumps your fuel pressure up so

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.420 
actually bumps your fuel pressure up so
it's<00:04:12.049> going<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.200> pressurize<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:13.069> fuel

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
it's going to pressurize that fuel

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.000 
it's going to pressurize that fuel
pressure<00:04:13.720> regulator<00:04:14.720> line<00:04:15.110> to<00:04:15.290> about<00:04:15.500> 40<00:04:15.829> psi

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
pressure regulator line to about 40 psi

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.009 
pressure regulator line to about 40 psi
or<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:16.700> that's<00:04:17.150> going<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.389> bump<00:04:17.510> up<00:04:17.690> your<00:04:17.780> fuel

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
or so that's going to bump up your fuel

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.190 
or so that's going to bump up your fuel
pressure<00:04:18.169> anywhere<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.709> 80<00:04:18.859> 90<00:04:19.370> pounds<00:04:20.200> and

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
pressure anywhere to 80 90 pounds and

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.270 
pressure anywhere to 80 90 pounds and
that's<00:04:21.380> what's<00:04:21.620> actually<00:04:21.709> gonna<00:04:22.010> make<00:04:22.160> the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
that's what's actually gonna make the

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.920 
that's what's actually gonna make the
power<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.790> nitrous<00:04:23.150> just<00:04:23.419> allows<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:23.870> to

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
power the nitrous just allows you to

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.050 
power the nitrous just allows you to
burn<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:24.350> excess<00:04:24.770> fuel<00:04:25.010> that<00:04:25.970> you're

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
burn that excess fuel that you're

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.030 
burn that excess fuel that you're
putting<00:04:26.270> in<00:04:26.450> at<00:04:26.540> that<00:04:26.660> point<00:04:26.720> once<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.830> have

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
putting in at that point once you have

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.950 
putting in at that point once you have
the<00:04:28.870> fuel<00:04:29.870> rail<00:04:30.050> pressurized<00:04:30.590> like<00:04:30.830> that

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
the fuel rail pressurized like that

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.480 
the fuel rail pressurized like that
this<00:04:32.960> fuel<00:04:33.410> pressure<00:04:33.650> safety<00:04:34.070> switch<00:04:34.310> right

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
this fuel pressure safety switch right

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.360 
this fuel pressure safety switch right
here<00:04:34.610> closes<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.389> that<00:04:35.419> basically<00:04:36.370> closes

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
here closes and that basically closes

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.650 
here closes and that basically closes
the<00:04:37.460> circuit<00:04:37.790> for<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.000> second<00:04:38.330> nitrous

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
the circuit for the second nitrous

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.580 
the circuit for the second nitrous
solenoid<00:04:39.020> it's<00:04:39.889> a<00:04:40.010> kind<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.400> safety<00:04:40.639> measure

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
solenoid it's a kind of a safety measure

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.750 
solenoid it's a kind of a safety measure
number<00:04:42.590> one<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:42.919> allows<00:04:43.010> you<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.370> go<00:04:43.460> from<00:04:43.610> a

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
number one it allows you to go from a

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.129 
number one it allows you to go from a
rich<00:04:43.910> condition<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.539> lean<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.840> out<00:04:44.960> with

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
rich condition and lean it out with

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.840 
rich condition and lean it out with
nitrous<00:04:45.530> so<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:46.039> make<00:04:46.190> sure<00:04:46.400> that<00:04:46.580> you<00:04:46.669> have

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
nitrous so and make sure that you have

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.310 
nitrous so and make sure that you have
the<00:04:47.000> fuel<00:04:47.210> there<00:04:47.389> before<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.810> nitrous<00:04:48.139> goes

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
the fuel there before the nitrous goes

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.320 
the fuel there before the nitrous goes
at<00:04:48.470> your<00:04:48.620> engine<00:04:48.710> number<00:04:49.580> two<00:04:49.850> if<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:50.030> do<00:04:50.150> have

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
at your engine number two if you do have

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.590 
at your engine number two if you do have
a<00:04:50.360> failure<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:52.340> for<00:04:53.030> whatever<00:04:53.150> reason

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
a failure and the for whatever reason

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.909 
a failure and the for whatever reason
you<00:04:53.660> have<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.810> vacuum<00:04:53.960> line<00:04:54.320> come<00:04:54.560> off<00:04:54.680> or

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
you have a vacuum line come off or

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.290 
you have a vacuum line come off or
something<00:04:55.220> like<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:56.030> fuel

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
something like that and the fuel

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.350 
something like that and the fuel
pressure<00:04:56.510> doesn't<00:04:57.470> get<00:04:57.710> spiked<00:04:58.039> it<00:04:58.940> keeps<00:04:59.210> the

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
pressure doesn't get spiked it keeps the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.790 
pressure doesn't get spiked it keeps the
nitrous<00:04:59.690> from<00:04:59.840> going<00:05:00.050> into<00:05:00.169> your<00:05:00.229> engine<00:05:00.410> so

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
nitrous from going into your engine so

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.379 
nitrous from going into your engine so
keeps<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.610> from<00:05:01.729> getting<00:05:01.850> a<00:05:02.030> lean<00:05:02.210> condition

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
keeps you from getting a lean condition

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.640 
keeps you from getting a lean condition
there<00:05:04.750> once<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:05.900> fuel<00:05:06.110> pressure<00:05:06.350> switch

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
there once that fuel pressure switch

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.300 
there once that fuel pressure switch
closes<00:05:07.160> that<00:05:08.000> activates<00:05:08.660> that<00:05:08.750> second

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
closes that activates that second

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.430 
closes that activates that second
nitrous<00:05:10.310> solenoid<00:05:10.669> over<00:05:10.880> there<00:05:11.110> that<00:05:12.110> opens

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
nitrous solenoid over there that opens

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.870 
nitrous solenoid over there that opens
and<00:05:12.560> that's<00:05:12.620> actually<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.190> main<00:05:13.340> feat<00:05:13.639> for

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
and that's actually the main feat for

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.839 
and that's actually the main feat for
the<00:05:13.940> engine<00:05:14.330> there<00:05:14.479> as<00:05:14.600> you<00:05:14.720> can<00:05:14.870> see<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.110> come

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
the engine there as you can see it come

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.839 
the engine there as you can see it come
and<00:05:16.439> I've<00:05:17.439> got<00:05:17.679> my<00:05:17.800> plum<00:05:18.069> directly<00:05:18.610> into<00:05:18.729> the

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
and I've got my plum directly into the

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.299 
and I've got my plum directly into the
throttle<00:05:19.089> body<00:05:19.300> there<00:05:19.629> just<00:05:20.499> seem<00:05:20.679> to<00:05:21.069> be<00:05:21.099> the

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:21.309 
throttle body there just seem to be the

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:23.359 
throttle body there just seem to be the
easiest<00:05:21.339> place<00:05:21.759> to<00:05:21.999> mount<00:05:22.119> it<00:05:22.270> on<00:05:22.389> this<00:05:22.539> car

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:23.369 
easiest place to mount it on this car

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:26.309 
easiest place to mount it on this car
and<00:05:24.369> there's<00:05:24.879> still<00:05:25.089> plenty<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.449> room<00:05:25.869> from

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
and there's still plenty of room from

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.169 
and there's still plenty of room from
the<00:05:26.469> inlet<00:05:27.279> there<00:05:27.429> till<00:05:27.669> it<00:05:27.729> actually<00:05:27.819> gets

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:28.179 
the inlet there till it actually gets

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:29.549 
the inlet there till it actually gets
into<00:05:28.330> the<00:05:28.419> engine<00:05:28.749> because<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.199> intakes

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:29.559 
into the engine because the intakes

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:34.109 
into the engine because the intakes
pretty<00:05:30.520> long<00:05:30.759> on<00:05:30.939> the<00:05:30.999> 94<00:05:31.419> 95<00:05:31.809> cars<00:05:32.999> you<00:05:33.999> can

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:34.119 
pretty long on the 94 95 cars you can

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:35.760 
pretty long on the 94 95 cars you can
kind<00:05:34.300> of<00:05:34.330> see<00:05:34.509> I've<00:05:34.869> actually<00:05:35.110> got<00:05:35.379> a<00:05:35.409> mounting

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
kind of see I've actually got a mounting

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.040 
kind of see I've actually got a mounting
boss<00:05:35.979> in<00:05:36.249> there<00:05:36.369> made<00:05:36.669> of<00:05:36.959> brass<00:05:37.959> and<00:05:38.860> then<00:05:38.979> the

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
boss in there made of brass and then the

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:43.959 
reason I did that's just because I don't

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
easily strip the threads out or
