 all crash everything was gone so 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.210
 server crash with backup all gone 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.560
 So start almost at zero 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.760
 I will have the security system that way 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.310

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.449
 So take over in parallel 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.440

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.489
 get ready and go online 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.349
 we can really make the stream 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.609
 Extreme duty is there in any case 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.890
 There's also no way off there 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.140
 over because everything was not streamed 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.730
 will be manipulated once streaming 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.320
 he is live and here it is only around 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.090
 Keyboards is about real 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.819
 so to speak, my keyboard is a mouse 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.190
 a mousepad and if you do not stop that 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.390
 scream then everybody can stop here 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.400
 never say there but shit and such 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.989
 further as streaming duty 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.970
 because you just can not prove there 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.930
 can be so and everything is right there 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.180
 rules in it 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.680
 if someone feels cheated 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.780
 then stop in stream or report 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.639
 Report the video and the job 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.799
 choose where cheating was 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.049
 so i will if someone means here 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.280
 Player so and so has cheated on her now 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.260
 Of course I will not be the one 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.030
 all through the whole video watch because 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.900
 I do not have that much time 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.760
 you have to have it yourself 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.109
 show initiative and then the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.639
 stream recording by watching ob 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.350
 who really fucked up then 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.700
 and if you found out and 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.220
 hertha shit then you can 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.530
 then report the place and then so in the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.239
 forum post for example or more npn 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.900
 Write and then I will the whole 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.569
 pursue 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.769
 so much for that is a super thing 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.919
 people often times on the stream 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.579
 when these hardcore rails are running 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.579
 they got it 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.300
 they know how it works 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.090
 I have so much more on it 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.880
 I'm not big on that now 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.510
 One thing still should be this post or 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.900
 this video this video 5000 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.659
 reach clicks and I say 5000 times 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.620
 clicks and 100 likes then I will 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.729
 How do I do that among all the people? 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.710
 Damn, I'm still a bit 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.060
 new what youtube concerns so I am 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.140
 not as sure as you what 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.250
 loss best on youtube 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.349
 I think I do it very differently 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.530
 So if this video has to do so 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.820
 Has reached 5000 clicks this week 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.740
 then I will be among all those in the 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.900
 have announced a comments 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.969
 roccat taito is giving away a mousepad 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.289
 Simply googling times to rocket I could 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.750
 I make my times briefly on webcam 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.870

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:23.940

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.669

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.780
 So we have first here is 23 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:39.539
 and 23 the first race starts 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.250
 I'll race first by then 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.080
 when the video has reached as well as clicks 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.340

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.349
 high quality stream 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.880

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.039

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.969
 you do not have to pay anything for it 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.370

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.229
