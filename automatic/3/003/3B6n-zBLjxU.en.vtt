again<00:02:10.080> included<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.040> icon<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.820> a

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
again included with the icon is a

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.970 
again included with the icon is a
battery<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:13.020> being<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.320> binder<00:02:13.620> fly<00:02:13.800> you'll

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
battery this being a binder fly you'll

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.890 
battery this being a binder fly you'll
get<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> battery<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.640> charger<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
get a battery and a charger so it's a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.400 
get a battery and a charger so it's a
180<00:02:16.650> million<00:02:17.060> 7.4<00:02:18.060> volt<00:02:18.330> battery<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.840> this

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
180 million 7.4 volt battery and this

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.720 
180 million 7.4 volt battery and this
simply<00:02:19.770> just<00:02:19.920> fits<00:02:20.130> into<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> front<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
simply just fits into the front of the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.310 
simply just fits into the front of the
model<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.390> pushes<00:02:21.600> up<00:02:21.810> into<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:22.080> little

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
model so it pushes up into a little

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.949 
model so it pushes up into a little
recess<00:02:22.680> at<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.670> front<00:02:24.000> as<00:02:24.150> easy<00:02:24.360> as<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.720> and

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
recess at the front as easy as that and

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.690 
recess at the front as easy as that and
that<00:02:25.560> also<00:02:25.709> gives<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.160> correct<00:02:26.340> center<00:02:26.640> of

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
that also gives it the correct center of

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.449 
that also gives it the correct center of
gravity<00:02:27.350> so<00:02:28.350> also<00:02:28.590> looking<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.220> front<00:02:29.400> of

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
gravity so also looking in the front of

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.280 
gravity so also looking in the front of
the<00:02:29.519> airplane<00:02:29.690> you'll<00:02:30.690> see<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.989> receiver

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the airplane you'll see the receiver

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.650 
the airplane you'll see the receiver
this<00:02:31.709> receiver<00:02:32.070> has<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.489> s3x<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.330> that'll<00:02:33.540> make

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
this receiver has a s3x so that'll make

00:02:33.660 --> 00:03:31.479 
this receiver has a s3x so that'll make
it<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:34.170> stable<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.650> fly<00:02:34.830> really<00:02:35.010> easy

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.800 

there<00:03:32.489> are<00:03:32.610> some<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.879> features<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.480> the
