really have to play around with the

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.670 
really have to play around with the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
adjustment on it to get it to where it's

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.600

reasonable
I<00:00:45.640> built<00:00:46.420> not<00:00:46.840> required<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.970> walk<00:00:48.970> in<00:00:49.240> here<00:00:49.450> for

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
I built not required a walk in here for

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.270 
I built not required a walk in here for
my<00:00:49.780> wife<00:00:49.960> was<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.320> little<00:00:50.940> board<00:00:51.940> walk<00:00:52.180> up<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:53.080> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
my wife was a little board walk up to a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.580 
my wife was a little board walk up to a
planters<00:00:54.660> station<00:00:55.660> that<00:00:55.840> I<00:00:55.870> made<00:00:56.350> for

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
planters station that I made for

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.080 
planters station that I made for
obviously<00:00:56.980> she's<00:00:57.220> not<00:00:57.250> using<00:00:57.580> it<00:00:57.760> right<00:00:57.910> now

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
obviously she's not using it right now

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.569 
obviously she's not using it right now
and<00:00:58.500> there's<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.590> bunch<00:00:59.740> of<00:00:59.830> dead<00:01:00.040> things<00:01:00.220> in

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
and there's a bunch of dead things in

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.720 
and there's a bunch of dead things in
here<00:01:00.850> but<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.710> way<00:01:02.740> I<00:01:02.890> did<00:01:03.160> the<00:01:03.280> base<00:01:03.460> was

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
here but the way I did the base was

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.810 
here but the way I did the base was
pretty<00:01:03.940> much<00:01:04.059> just<00:01:04.119> like<00:01:04.509> they<00:01:04.720> said<00:01:05.049> in<00:01:05.229> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
pretty much just like they said in the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.790 
pretty much just like they said in the
instructions<00:01:06.870> this<00:01:07.870> I<00:01:08.020> believe<00:01:08.170> is<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.470> two<00:01:08.650> by

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
instructions this I believe is a two by

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.590 
instructions this I believe is a two by
six<00:01:08.830> that<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.370> used<00:01:09.670> they<00:01:09.880> may<00:01:10.060> have<00:01:10.180> called<00:01:10.360> for

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
six that I used they may have called for

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.870 
six that I used they may have called for
a<00:01:10.630> 2<00:01:10.780> by<00:01:10.900> 12<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:11.320> don't<00:01:11.500> know<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:11.860> then<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:12.460> 4<00:01:12.730> by<00:01:12.850> 4

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
a 2 by 12 I don't know and then a 4 by 4

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.320 
a 2 by 12 I don't know and then a 4 by 4
that<00:01:13.300> runs<00:01:13.480> all<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.690> way<00:01:13.870> around<00:01:14.230> it<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
that runs all the way around it and the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.080 
that runs all the way around it and the
way<00:01:16.480> I<00:01:16.510> staked<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.530> into<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:17.920> ground<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.610> you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
way I staked it into the ground is you

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.420 
way I staked it into the ground is you
know<00:01:19.210> me<00:01:19.510> I<00:01:19.780> just<00:01:20.470> drilled<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:20.950> hole<00:01:20.979> through

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
know me I just drilled a hole through

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.310 
know me I just drilled a hole through
here<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.210> is<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.420> piece<00:01:22.659> of<00:01:22.690> bent<00:01:23.080> over

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
rebar and I just drove him down on the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.719 
rebar and I just drove him down on the
ground<00:01:24.970> about<00:01:25.420> 24<00:01:25.930> inches<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:27.340> been<00:01:27.580> here

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
ground about 24 inches it's been here

like I said about 4 years it's never

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.610 
like I said about 4 years it's never
moved<00:01:31.450> but<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.290> problems<00:01:32.950> with<00:01:33.549> it<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:35.350> a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
moved but the problems with it it's a

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.160 
moved but the problems with it it's a
little<00:01:35.920> bit<00:01:36.130> especially<00:01:36.880> if<00:01:37.810> you're<00:01:37.990> standing

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
in the peak it's the highest point it's

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.170 
in the peak it's the highest point it's
probably<00:01:40.000> from<00:01:40.450> where<00:01:40.659> I'm<00:01:40.810> standing<00:01:41.549> about<00:01:42.549> 6

got<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:57.940> at<00:01:58.000> Lowe's<00:01:58.150> or<00:01:58.180> something<00:01:58.630> like<00:01:58.689> that

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
got it at Lowe's or something like that

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.859 
got it at Lowe's or something like that
and<00:01:59.110> put<00:01:59.229> two<00:01:59.409> in<00:01:59.590> there<00:01:59.710> for<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.189> use<00:02:00.869> some

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
and put two in there for to use some

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.920 
and put two in there for to use some
river<00:02:02.290> rock<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.950> know<00:02:03.070> just<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.750> put<00:02:04.750> down

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
river rock you know just to put down

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.300 
river rock you know just to put down
there<00:02:05.110> for<00:02:05.290> decoration<00:02:05.619> I<00:02:06.130> guess

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.760 

it<00:02:10.310> does<00:02:10.520> have<00:02:10.729> Vince<00:02:11.030> on<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.570> there<00:02:12.050> man

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
it does have Vince on it there man

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.490 
it does have Vince on it there man
and<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.250> can<00:02:13.430> unhook<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.110> raise<00:02:15.260> them

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
and you can unhook this and raise them

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.740 
and you can unhook this and raise them
up<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.890> put<00:02:16.130> them<00:02:16.160> in<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.370> hole<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.660> will

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
up and put them in a hole and it will

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.570 
up and put them in a hole and it will
open<00:02:17.900> up<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.470> way<00:02:20.890> like<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.040> said<00:02:22.250> one<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.430> the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
open up that way like I said one of the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.890 
open up that way like I said one of the
biggest<00:02:22.880> problems<00:02:23.210> with<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.540> putting<00:02:23.810> it

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
biggest problems with is putting it

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.600 
biggest problems with is putting it
together<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:24.470> takes<00:02:24.710> a<00:02:24.890> long<00:02:25.100> time<00:02:25.370> there<00:02:25.580> are

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
together it takes a long time there are

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.550 
together it takes a long time there are
tons<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:26.030> nuts<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.630> bolts<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.110> pieces<00:02:27.530> you

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
tons of nuts and bolts and pieces you

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.520 
tons of nuts and bolts and pieces you
have<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.890> decipher<00:02:28.390> put<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.480> all<00:02:29.600> together<00:02:29.750> of

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
have to decipher put it all together of

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.350 
have to decipher put it all together of
course<00:02:30.770> making<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.190> base<00:02:31.430> takes<00:02:31.760> time<00:02:32.090> and

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
course making the base takes time and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.030 
course making the base takes time and
whatnot<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:33.020> just<00:02:33.230> put<00:02:33.380> some<00:02:33.530> ground<00:02:33.740> cover

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
whatnot and I just put some ground cover

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.830 
whatnot and I just put some ground cover
underneath<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.270> then<00:02:35.360> put<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.660> rocks

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
underneath this and then put the rocks

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.220 
underneath this and then put the rocks
on

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
on

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.950 
on
this<00:02:37.190> stuff<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.550> optional<00:02:38.000> you'd<00:02:38.750> probably

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
this stuff is optional you'd probably

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.900 
this stuff is optional you'd probably
get<00:02:39.230> about<00:02:39.470> another<00:02:39.770> four<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.340> half<00:02:40.520> inches

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
get about another four and a half inches

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.390 
get about another four and a half inches
of<00:02:41.090> headroom<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.260> peak<00:02:42.500> if<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.160> didn't

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
was a bunch of overgrowth back there

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.550

you up and then there's a little groove

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.350 
you up and then there's a little groove
that<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.860> fits<00:03:45.100> in<00:03:45.310> hopefully<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:46.030> can<00:03:46.150> see

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
that it fits in hopefully you can see

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.390 
that it fits in hopefully you can see
that<00:03:46.569> book<00:03:46.810> that's<00:03:47.500> how<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.680> holds<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.040> panels

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
that book that's how it holds the panels

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.490 
that book that's how it holds the panels
in<00:03:48.550> it<00:03:49.209> needs<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.630> have<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.780> bunch<00:03:49.990> more<00:03:50.260> in<00:03:50.380> my

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
in it needs to have a bunch more in my

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.760 
in it needs to have a bunch more in my
opinion<00:03:50.890> because<00:03:50.980> these<00:03:51.160> things<00:03:51.310> blow<00:03:51.670> out

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
opinion because these things blow out

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.990 
opinion because these things blow out
but<00:03:53.770> if<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:53.950> keep<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.280> door<00:03:54.430> closed<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.910> may

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
but if you keep the door closed it may

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.880 
but if you keep the door closed it may
not<00:03:55.120> be<00:03:55.270> a<00:03:55.300> problem<00:03:55.570> it's<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.320> little<00:03:56.560> yellowed
