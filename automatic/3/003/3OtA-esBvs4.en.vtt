00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 and then guys this one here a video 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.480
 here fast from Control 2 Office 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.820
 of the btv company in which work for 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.800
 explain to you the absence of videos 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.420
 here on the channel I hope not to let you 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.679
 sleep until the end of the video because 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.929
 Now I'll talk about the problems. 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.449
 technicians that I'm taking leave 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.189
 so I use a video editor that is 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.960
 a program on your computer to be able to 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.390
 dictate the videos you are watching 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.070
 here I do not record the videos naturally 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.599
 so I have to put cuts and 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 things and that's what this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.219
 program and lets do it, I'll call you 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.410
 I'm putting a video on my channel for 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:41.940
 talk about what happened backcountry 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:43.890
 here we come back to the subject of 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.750
 editors I use a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.850
 videos on my computer called sony 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.800
 vegas is a very popular video editor 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.780
 here on youtube several others in october 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.730
 use it is low cost it is easy to 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.160
 use and it is good but it has a problem 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.739
 it takes a long time to grant 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.149
 support for computer parts that 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.789
 you can put it on your computer 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.589
 also known as new hardware and I 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.740
 i bought a new computer recently 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.450
 before I was editing with a notebook 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.830
 active in here in canada thing was not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.260
 Working Well I bought a computer 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.909
 Mega modern with all the other pieces 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.280
 modern thing that I have not had for a long time 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.619
 time and then I went to try to run this 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.509
 video editor on it the problem is it 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.100
 has a video card that is more 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.580
 is probably in the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.259
 market for these games called gtx 980 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.329
 which has called architecture 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.430
 maxwell from nvidia because I 'm saying 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.020
 This is because you use a lot of your board 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.030
 to do the work of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.340
 video editing and the program I 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.650
 I have no support for this card 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.299
 There is no way to do it. 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.189
 Support for any other card that 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.780
 architecture called maxwell here in 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.869
 I work with a computer with a 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.610
 gtx 970 which type the younger sister of 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.590
 Plastic I have at home and she 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.170
 also has no support so it gets very 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.360
 difficult to edit the videos because 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.009
 I have to use only dual-chip cpu 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.600
 computer processor I can not use 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.759
 the video card to make edits 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.770
 of the video and a business gets very slow 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.420
 very slow at the same point I could not even 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.429
 view a video preview to be able to 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.709
 cut the right video and when I get 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.209
 cut had to render export the 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.960
 video file takes a long time 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.580
 last 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.500
 I put here the channel was only 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.330
 It's ready at midnight from Brazil because 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.950
 it took much longer to render 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.350
 than it should then this is a 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.450
 reality at the moment is that thing I 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.070
 I have a modern mega computer but I 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.320
 I can not do things with it. 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.540
 sensational because it does not matter to be 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.730
 only the good hardware the software you 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.770
 uses must have hardware support 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.470
 otherwise the thing does not work and currently 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.120
 is happening without telling the editor 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.100
 video crashes all the time but this one 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.750
 vegas problem even those who use it 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.790
 video editor you october this 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.590
 damn hang every second and I do not 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.540
 escapes that then this is the summary of 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.550
 things I'm trying to bring video 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.020
 here you already have a video of the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.090
 yes the next episode is already 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.980
 practically finished 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.870
 only I can not stop myself 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.130
 of these problem limitations 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.020
 software and hardware and 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.270
 lack of support compatibility that I 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.730
 I have already researched google already 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.380
 all i'm going to try now another 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.030
 video editor who is the premier 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.830
 despite having some similar problems 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.390
 it looks like it has a plugin that does 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.980
 to work with the video card then 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.680
 maybe I can avoid but the thing 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.140
 it's complicated to hope that sony 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.850
 launch the support soon for these cards 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.320
 new videos that are leaving because 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.000
 really, it's very complicated 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.070
 given explanations I hope not 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.020
 I left you sleepy and said goodbye 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.820
 of you in the hope that people will 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.710
 get a solution to this crap 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.720
 logo to the next guys to thank 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.400
 by patience and thanks for your patience 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.380
 twice and I could not think of 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.180
 other words is more finger crossed shaw 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.330
 It's not for me, it's not for things to give. 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.330
 right
