by<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.439> huge<00:01:48.799> crisis<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.610> Europe<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.210> seems

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
by the huge crisis and Europe it seems

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.569 
by the huge crisis and Europe it seems
is<00:01:50.659> not<00:01:50.689> really<00:01:51.259> pulling<00:01:51.530> itself<00:01:52.009> out<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.340> the

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
is not really pulling itself out of the

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.870 
is not really pulling itself out of the
mess<00:01:52.939> that<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:53.630> got<00:01:53.780> into<00:01:54.320> with<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:55.070> crash<00:01:55.369> all

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
mess that it got into with the crash all

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.760 
mess that it got into with the crash all
those<00:01:56.119> years<00:01:56.329> ago<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.840> being<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:57.710> is

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
those years ago and being that this is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.709 
those years ago and being that this is
one<00:01:58.189> of<00:01:58.219> the<00:01:58.340> more<00:01:58.490> impoverished<00:01:58.880> countries

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
one of the more impoverished countries

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.679 
one of the more impoverished countries
inside<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.740> inside<00:02:01.399> Europe<00:02:01.789> it's<00:02:02.240> obviously

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
inside the inside Europe it's obviously

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.480 
inside the inside Europe it's obviously
going<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:03.079> be<00:02:03.200> even<00:02:03.380> more<00:02:03.680> difficult<00:02:03.950> for<00:02:04.399> them

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
going to be even more difficult for them

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.459 
going to be even more difficult for them
to<00:02:04.549> pull<00:02:04.789> themselves<00:02:04.909> out<00:02:05.240> especially<00:02:05.930> with

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
to pull themselves out especially with

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.770 
to pull themselves out especially with

already exist in the country when you

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.840 
already exist in the country when you
add<00:02:27.350> in<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.710> really<00:02:28.250> terrible<00:02:28.610> economic

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
add in a really terrible economic

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.210 
add in a really terrible economic
situation<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.650> wouldn't<00:02:30.920> take

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
situation like this it wouldn't take

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.550 
situation like this it wouldn't take
much<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.970> know<00:02:32.060> reignite<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> lot<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
much to you know reignite a lot of the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.040 
much to you know reignite a lot of the
tension<00:02:33.950> that's<00:02:34.370> already<00:02:34.760> there<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:35.780> this

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
tension that's already there so this

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.720 
tension that's already there so this
looks<00:02:36.260> like<00:02:36.440> this<00:02:36.890> could<00:02:37.070> potentially<00:02:37.220> be

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
looks like this could potentially be

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.200 
looks like this could potentially be
very<00:02:37.910> very<00:02:38.570> dangerous<00:02:38.930> for<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.440> country<00:02:39.590> and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
very very dangerous for the country and

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.900 
very very dangerous for the country and
a<00:02:41.320> genuine<00:02:42.320> symptom<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.130> what's<00:02:43.460> happening
