00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:09.400
 there are many internet comparison videos 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.780
 of several consoles consoles now 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.150
 we see lots of comparison videos 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.370
 xbox year with three or four more 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.700
 last video that came out to the internet 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:23.140
 not talking is comparing two new ones 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.030
 consoles in the game tomb raider face is a 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.520
 game you are seeing these pictures 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.630
 you see that the graph looks like the 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.520
 same thing 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.610
 Calm down, the two of you are fine. 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.160
 modeled okay brightness texture such 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.220
 now take a look up there in the frame 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.920
 rate face or xbox the angle 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.829
 rarely be indifferent to 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.870
 second and sometimes up to 24 frames 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.309
 per second but with time of 30 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.280
 frames per second 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.649
 playstation 4 already has 60 frames 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.530
 per second much more fluid running 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.790
 much lighter much calmer not 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.590
 I know if you're getting some 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.190
 graphic things I will not do 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.680
 nothing 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.770
 this analysis made by the digital site 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.170
 fauller who did all this research and 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.229
 did you even see if this movie network now 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.659
 Microsoft went to defend itself on 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.810
 this game was not quite like that in 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.270
 truth already left at the beginning of the console 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.630
 Because there's not much I can do to get there. 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.990
 to improve to take the more bugs and 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.070
 You will see many sensational things. 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.560
 still the xbox fan 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.930
 They made a point of saying that the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.530
 wise and only a better way to play than 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.360
 I have to play nice and spelling and such and 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.090
 It has everything is a bit thinking about the guild 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.250
 but it 's very clear, man. 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.860
 much better much more fluid much 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.280
 Easier to Play on Playstation 4 500 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.110
 boxes or talking about the fall he also 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.409
 people can see that really 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.500
 4 need to have more memory has more 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.030
 memory allocated to game not only pros 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.520
 all video game processing for 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.619
 videos other things then will continue 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.360
 this controversy but even with the excuse 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.850
 from microsoft 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.129
 It has no justification and really 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.770
 fourth came out ahead with the 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.420
 subject matter 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.260
 the speed of your speed when the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.260
 matter is serious
