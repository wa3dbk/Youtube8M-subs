does say eighty thousand dollars which

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.380 
does say eighty thousand dollars which
does<00:01:32.100> kind<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.490> suck<00:01:32.700> because<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.240> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
does kind of suck because you have to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.780 
does kind of suck because you have to
share<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:33.900> four<00:01:34.380> players<00:01:34.710> minimum<00:01:35.579> and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
share this with four players minimum and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.210 
share this with four players minimum and
six<00:01:36.299> players<00:01:36.540> maximum<00:01:37.229> but<00:01:37.530> Eva's<00:01:37.829> moment<00:01:38.159> in

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
six players maximum but Eva's moment in

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.800 
six players maximum but Eva's moment in
time<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.579> don't<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.329> all<00:01:39.630> one

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
time we don't know if this is all one

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.870 
time we don't know if this is all one
hundred<00:01:39.930> percent<00:01:40.110> true<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.520> then<00:01:41.759> I

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
hundred percent true but if it is then I

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.789 
hundred percent true but if it is then I
guess<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.299> does<00:01:42.479> kind<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.899> suck<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.590> only

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
guess that does kind of suck the only

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.039 
guess that does kind of suck the only
reason<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.220> believe<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.820> fun<00:01:45.030> nw2<00:01:45.600> guy<00:01:45.810> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
reason I do believe this fun nw2 guy is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.660 
reason I do believe this fun nw2 guy is
because<00:01:46.380> everything<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.950> he<00:01:47.220> has<00:01:47.250> leaked

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
because everything that he has leaked

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.639 
because everything that he has leaked
out<00:01:47.880> previously<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:48.869> well<00:01:49.079> he<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.409> quite

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
out previously as well he is quite

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.740 
out previously as well he is quite
alright<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.970> say<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.570> to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
alright but like I say we just have to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
alright but like I say we just have to
wait<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:51.960> see<00:01:52.170> whether<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> eighty<00:01:52.950> thousand

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
wait and see whether the eighty thousand

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.520 
wait and see whether the eighty thousand
dollars<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.000> true<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.200> wasn't

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
dollars is true or not but that wasn't

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.780 
dollars is true or not but that wasn't
the<00:01:55.560> only<00:01:55.680> thing<00:01:55.920> leaked<00:01:56.159> last<00:01:56.340> week<00:01:56.640> about
