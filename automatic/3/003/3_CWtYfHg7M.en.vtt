anyways let's just do a test run on the

anyways let's just do a test run on the
sound<00:03:29.400> quality<00:03:30.350> most<00:03:31.519> tests<00:03:32.519> should<00:03:32.880> not<00:03:33.090> be

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
sound quality most tests should not be

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.400 
sound quality most tests should not be
actually<00:03:33.780> through<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:35.220> mic<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:36.030> an<00:03:36.989> iphone<00:03:37.380> or

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
actually through the mic on an iphone or

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.199 
actually through the mic on an iphone or
anything<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.370> recording<00:03:38.790> because<00:03:38.910> it's

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
anything that is recording because it's

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.229 
anything that is recording because it's
not<00:03:39.329> very<00:03:39.860> trustworthy<00:03:41.000> reliable

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.390 

tests<00:03:45.239> I<00:03:45.450> guess<00:03:45.689> because<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.890> not<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.189> same

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
tests I guess because it is not the same

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.940 
tests I guess because it is not the same
as<00:03:47.700> hearing<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.510> with<00:03:48.930> your<00:03:49.110> ears<00:03:49.260> itself<00:03:49.709> but

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
disconnected as you can hear it starting

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.790 
disconnected as you can hear it starting
to<00:05:00.890> lag<00:05:01.130> a<00:05:01.160> little<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:02.510> this<00:05:02.750> is<00:05:02.780> how<00:05:02.900> far<00:05:03.320> I<00:05:03.350> was

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
to lag a little so this is how far I was

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.740 
to lag a little so this is how far I was
actually<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.580> will<00:05:04.790> will<00:05:05.210> pause<00:05:05.480> it<00:05:05.630> now

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
actually I will will pause it now

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.060 
actually I will will pause it now
because<00:05:05.930> I<00:05:05.990> do<00:05:06.050> not<00:05:06.260> want<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:06.530> get<00:05:06.650> copyrighted

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070

and<00:05:07.460> there<00:05:08.060> is<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.320> pause<00:05:09.320> button<00:05:09.800> right<00:05:10.070> there

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
and there is a pause button right there

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.020 
and there is a pause button right there
alright<00:05:12.180> so<00:05:12.390> this<00:05:12.480> is<00:05:12.630> how<00:05:12.720> farm<00:05:13.050> was<00:05:13.320> actually

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.379 

wow<00:05:19.030> so<00:05:19.330> keep<00:05:19.570> playing<00:05:19.810> this<00:05:20.170> so<00:05:20.380> far<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:20.710> was

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.749 

so<00:05:24.389> we<00:05:24.539> can<00:05:24.660> all<00:05:24.780> say<00:05:25.020> that<00:05:25.289> this<00:05:25.759> wireless

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
so we can all say that this wireless

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.570 
so we can all say that this wireless
headset<00:05:27.240> is<00:05:27.419> very<00:05:27.840> very<00:05:28.259> reliable<00:05:28.889> from

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
headset is very very reliable from

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.610 
headset is very very reliable from
distance<00:05:29.970> wise<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:30.870> does<00:05:31.050> have<00:05:31.229> a<00:05:31.259> really

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
distance wise and it does have a really

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.200 
distance wise and it does have a really
good<00:05:31.710> sound<00:05:32.069> when<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.460> actually<00:05:32.610> put<00:05:32.880> in<00:05:32.970> here

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
good sound when you actually put in here

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.230 
good sound when you actually put in here
is<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.449> only<00:05:33.599> thing<00:05:33.960> that<00:05:34.289> I<00:05:34.590> think<00:05:34.860> is<00:05:35.250> a<00:05:35.610> con

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
is the only thing that I think is a con

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.499 
is the only thing that I think is a con
on<00:05:36.569> this<00:05:37.199> headphones<00:05:37.979> is<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.430> it's<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.270> buds

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
on this headphones is that it's the buds

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.600 
on this headphones is that it's the buds
are<00:05:39.630> very<00:05:39.840> small<00:05:40.289> so<00:05:40.560> that<00:05:40.860> can<00:05:41.370> be<00:05:41.400> very

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
are very small so that can be very

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.520 
are very small so that can be very
irritating<00:05:41.789> for<00:05:42.300> large<00:05:42.509> reared<00:05:42.840> people<00:05:43.199> even

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
irritating for large reared people even

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.189 
irritating for large reared people even
if<00:05:43.919> for<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.580> people<00:05:44.849> for<00:05:45.210> that<00:05:45.599> small<00:05:45.930> years

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
because the cups are so small that after

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.620 
because the cups are so small that after
an<00:05:49.770> hour<00:05:49.919> it<00:05:50.280> does<00:05:50.580> get<00:05:50.910> a<00:05:50.970> little<00:05:51.270> annoying
