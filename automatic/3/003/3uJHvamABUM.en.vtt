00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.810
 Exercise physiology and biochemistry 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.840
 of the resemblance went through three stages 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.430
 before and after the muscle biopsy 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.960
 60s and 70s of last century 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.480
 radioactive isotopes following the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.059
 metabolisms within the muscle would be 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.080
 how to mark molecules of different 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.090
 substances with a gps went that goes 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.680
 showing the metabolic chain and how it 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.720
 break nutrients before loads 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.229
 physical we are talking about the decade 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.670
 of 80 and 90 of the last century and of the 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:52.799
 90 to 2010 for telling you now to 2015 or what 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.890
 what is coming or what is biology 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.390
 molecular or all of the above because 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.970
 new excluders but they are 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.580
 Inclusive are adding biopsy more 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.189
 isotopes plus a series of 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.770
 investigations that show which 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.530
 are the biochemical processes that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.659
 determine that a muscle increases the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.180
 number of mitochondria improve the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.119
 glucose uptake administer better 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.340
 the use of fats 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.340
 muscle hypertrophy if there are petrov s 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.979
 hyperplasia if the mitochondria come together 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.740
 or do not bind and the entire kinase chain 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.869
 they are already very sophisticated substances that 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.700
 they look inside the cell and in the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.090
 cell membranes in the membrane 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.280
 mitochondrial that has put on the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.380
 scientific truth that when you do 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.289
 cable training produces its effects 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.619
 if nutrition does not accompany the effects 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.860
 they are antagonistic or not expected 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.009
 you can say I trained six months and before 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.630
 we said in trains and imesi a year and ximo 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.640
 everything and the guy did not leave the mark not 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.899
 came to performance here we take the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.899
 blames the psychology 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.890
 get the problem over 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.560
 the problem is psychological fail the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.750
 emotion the more I study physiology 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.060
 more I believe in the psychological ones if it is 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.830
 true the psychological and the emotional in 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.140
 the moments of high competition are 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.060
 decisive but when one starts to 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.920
 look at that there are people who do not have 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.990
 high competition and have problems of 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.600
 performance even in the improvement of the 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.600
 health and before losing weight 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.030
 reasonable and to the improvement of their 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.860
 quality of life I go if you go here there is something 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.380
 more because that person is not stressed 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.030
 then the world does not compete today 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.790
 he knows a lot of things that he did not 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.710
 we knew we did not teach him that today to 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.200
 the trainers to the doctors to the 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.590
 nutritionists and physiotherapists 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.700
 it's a capital sin almost 95 per 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.370
 hundred of the states of 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.440
 overtraining fatigue injury in 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.370
 any sports population is 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.310
 associated with two or three emptying things 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.870
 of muscle glycogen and hypoglycemia 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.950
 that's why we are so against the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.720
 food plans or hydrocarbons 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.970
 hypocaloric and dehydration and 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.240
 fluid disorders the water 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.310
 and the sun and potassium electrolytes the 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.860
 Association of both gives symptoms and signs 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.900
 and I have symptoms and signs of one thing and 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.450
 symptoms and sign of another that semiology 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.270
 of fatigue and semiology the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.520
 fatigue 95 percent is focused on 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.990
 problems of food incorporation 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.750
 influenced in the daily food plan 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.260
 so that's not the only doubt 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.970
 which is a backbone but for 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.290
 know sports hydration nutrition 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.640
 you have to understand physiology and 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.270
 biochemistry the exercise of 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.760
 training in those 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.350
 30 or 40 million situations of 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.350
 all sports combined
