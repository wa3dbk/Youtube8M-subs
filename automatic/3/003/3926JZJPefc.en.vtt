okay here we have a fairly centered

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.090 
okay here we have a fairly centered
piece<00:00:34.830> of<00:00:34.860> clay<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.310> we're<00:00:35.730> ready<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.030> start

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
piece of clay and we're ready to start

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.150 
piece of clay and we're ready to start
opening<00:00:38.100> opening<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.270> up<00:00:39.560> and<00:00:40.560> working<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.130> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
opening opening it up and working on a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.850 
opening opening it up and working on a
piece<00:00:43.220> it<00:00:44.220> has<00:00:44.400> a<00:00:44.430> bit<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.910> wobble<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
piece it has a bit of a wobble in it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.860 
piece it has a bit of a wobble in it
still<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.220> I<00:00:47.250> think<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.910> will<00:00:48.390> pull

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
still but I think that that will pull

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.390 
still but I think that that will pull
through<00:00:49.340> during<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.030> growing<00:00:51.720> process

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
through during the the growing process

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.710 
through during the the growing process
just<00:00:53.400> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.700> drop<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> hole<00:00:54.450> you<00:00:56.510> can<00:00:57.510> so

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
just going to drop a hole you can so

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.110 
just going to drop a hole you can so

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
ways there is to do this and how

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.270 
ways there is to do this and how
everybody<00:01:09.690> seems<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.350> kind<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.650> develop<00:01:10.979> their

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
everybody seems to kind of develop their

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210 
everybody seems to kind of develop their
own<00:01:11.310> technique<00:01:12.530> don't<00:01:13.530> ever<00:01:13.710> let<00:01:13.920> anybody

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
own technique don't ever let anybody

own technique don't ever let anybody
tell<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.910> that<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.479> wrong<00:01:17.030> there's<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
tell you that that is wrong there's I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420 
tell you that that is wrong there's I
don't<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:18.780> there's<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.050> way<00:01:19.649> to<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.009> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
don't think there's one way to do this I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.999 
don't think there's one way to do this I
think<00:01:20.490> everybody<00:01:21.060> does<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.450> differently<00:01:22.009> and

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
think everybody does it differently and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.380 
think everybody does it differently and
I<00:01:23.580> think<00:01:23.759> whatever<00:01:23.970> works<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:26.030> is<00:01:27.030> good

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
perspective I have a little bit of a

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.949 
perspective I have a little bit of a
break<00:02:34.459> down<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.610> here<00:02:35.970> where<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.299> clay<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.750> a

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
break down in here where the clay is a

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.710 
break down in here where the clay is a
little<00:02:37.200> too<00:02:37.380> thin<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.519> bottom<00:02:38.910> looks<00:02:39.450> pretty

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
