00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
and we're going to go to pin windows now

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.530 
and we're going to go to pin windows now
when<00:00:51.649> you<00:00:51.710> turn<00:00:51.890> on<00:00:52.129> pin<00:00:52.460> windows<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:53.059> explains

when you turn on pin windows it explains

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.500 
when you turn on pin windows it explains
how<00:00:53.840> to<00:00:53.899> turn<00:00:54.290> how<00:00:54.530> to<00:00:54.590> use<00:00:54.920> it<00:00:55.129> but<00:00:55.280> basically

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
how to turn how to use it but basically

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.569 
how to turn how to use it but basically
the<00:00:56.510> idea<00:00:56.539> behind<00:00:56.960> this<00:00:57.230> is<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:58.070> turn<00:00:58.250> on<00:00:58.370> pin

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
the idea behind this is you turn on pin

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.119 
the idea behind this is you turn on pin
windows<00:00:58.940> when<00:00:59.480> you<00:00:59.750> open<00:01:00.230> app<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:00.890> press
