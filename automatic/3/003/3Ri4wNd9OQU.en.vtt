00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.380 

and<00:01:51.250> you<00:01:51.910> could<00:01:52.060> swipe<00:01:52.300> through<00:01:52.540> your<00:01:52.750> phone

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.240 

so<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.350> example<00:01:58.890> I'll<00:01:59.280> open<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.700> Chrome<00:02:01.250> and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
so for example I'll open up Chrome and

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:17.500 
so for example I'll open up Chrome and
you<00:02:02.900> have<00:02:03.900> a<00:02:03.930> full<00:02:04.290> web<00:02:04.530> browser

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.500 

and<00:02:18.110> tears<00:02:18.440> not<00:02:18.769> Jen<00:02:19.099> Civic<00:02:19.519> calm

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.649 

and<00:02:25.830> then<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:27.310> could<00:02:27.489> start<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.909> thread<00:02:28.090> post

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
and then you could start a thread post

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.220 
and then you could start a thread post
anything<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.879> right<00:02:30.879> here<00:02:31.239> this<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.569> SwiftKey

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
anything and right here this is SwiftKey

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.680 
anything and right here this is SwiftKey
and<00:02:32.530> flow<00:02:33.010> works<00:02:33.280> wonderfully<00:02:34.030> on<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.330> screen

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
and flow works wonderfully on the screen

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.809 
and flow works wonderfully on the screen
so<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.760> word<00:02:36.940> exhaust<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.659> could<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:38.819> think

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
so the word exhaust you could just think

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.900 
so the word exhaust you could just think
at<00:02:40.090> it

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.760 

all<00:02:43.420> right<00:02:43.570> so<00:02:43.720> that's<00:02:43.870> how<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.110> got<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.620> just

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
all right so that's how I got it just

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.770 
all right so that's how I got it just
fine<00:02:45.130> but<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.940> screen<00:02:46.270> is<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.450> as

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
fine but the screen is just as

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.150 
fine but the screen is just as
responsive<00:02:47.380> as<00:02:47.470> your<00:02:47.680> phone<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:50.920> could

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
responsive as your phone so you could

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
use flow just like that and so far I've

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.910 
use flow just like that and so far I've
gotten<00:02:54.820> every<00:02:55.330> single<00:02:55.660> app<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.260> work<00:02:56.470> while<00:02:56.740> in

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
gotten every single app to work while in

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.060 
gotten every single app to work while in
motion<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.300> I'm<00:02:59.140> going<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.440> demonstrate<00:02:59.920> it

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
motion so I'm going to demonstrate it

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.310

now<00:03:00.100> but<00:03:00.550> for<00:03:00.910> example<00:03:01.390> equal<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.930> YouTube

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320

to music you can't have the app sounds
on<00:04:03.580> your<00:04:03.610> phone<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:04.930> for<00:04:05.200> example<00:04:05.620> if<00:04:05.680> you're

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
on your phone so for example if you're

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
work on this with using mirrorlink you

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.750 
work on this with using mirrorlink you
can't<00:04:11.380> have<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.710> voice<00:04:11.890> prompts<00:04:12.400> if<00:04:12.520> you<00:04:12.610> want
