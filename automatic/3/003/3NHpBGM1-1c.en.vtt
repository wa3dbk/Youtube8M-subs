 hello to all today I you 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.010
 shows a new nail art of the series 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.840
 halloween for all those who 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.260
 know it's a mail art 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.210
 inspired by freddy krueger 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.310
 it is a mail art that is very simple to 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.910
 realize and in addition it will be perfect for 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.380
 halloween 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.010
 so I propose to start this 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.170
 mail art 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.090
 we start as always by applying 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.619
 a base on the nails this one is going 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.100
 to protect your nails 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.809
 especially yellowing 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.730
 towards nice and then your nails with a 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.320
 red varnish but be careful we're going 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.909
 leave for the moment free the ring finger 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.949
 indeed for the ring finger we are going 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.329
 involve a pink polish just about the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.839
 same as we use for french 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.780
 manicure 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.879
 it will do very well to make it come 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.440
 now the scotch part then 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.210
 as usual I took a piece of 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.149
 scotch and I have to remove the excess of 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.989
 stick on the back of my hand then with 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.699
 a pair of scissors 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.670
 I just cut strips 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.289
 horizontal on my butt tape 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.030
 nothing complicated here 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:08.970
 just be careful the banks have to 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.899
 to be about the same size 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.899
 that's pretty much what it needs to give 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.690
 we will now place these tapes 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.320
 on our nails or we put the 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.240
 red varnish 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.830
 be careful the polish should 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.630
 to be well dry otherwise it will not work 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.390
 not 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.729
 so on a dry red varnish place 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.450
 just three strips of Scotch tape 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.909
 horizontal way 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.030
 the gap between the bands should be 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.500
 close to the same size towards nice and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.500
 then long on which you have 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.420
 put the scotch with a dark green varnish 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.410
 immediately after the nail polish 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.220
 green remove the scotch tips remove 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.570
 Scotch strips 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.729
 immediately after the nail polish 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.320
 allows for much more bands 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.510
 clear that if we had waited until the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.620
 varnish does not dry 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.420
 after if there are small errors of 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.530
 little burr you can always 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.360
 resume later 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.950
 or just let them 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.680
 are on a halloween nail polish so the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.479
 errors are allowed regarding 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.130
 now the ring finger simply 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.940
 we are going to realize some kinds of 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.950
 blood spots 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.600
 I'm sorry I did not do very well 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.400
 filmed this part simply 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.260
 realized the kinds of big spots a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.810
 little misshapen and around full of 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.489
 small dots to make this pattern 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.250
 I used the same last red as 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.300
 to varnish my nails 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.100
 by the way, here's a little closer 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.140
 varnish that I used to achieve this 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.580
 mail art so in the end it does not take 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.430
 not a lot of instruments and not 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.470
 a lot of varnish anyway I hope 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.870
 that this special halloween varnish freddy 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.070
 krueger will have pleased you 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.300
 if we were all the steps it's 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.950
 a mail art that is very simple to do 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.400
 and that will do its little effect for 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.800
 halloween 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.750
 in any case if you enjoyed the 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.820
 nail art especially do not hesitate to me 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.110
 add a little green thumb and then 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.880
 as usual do not hesitate to me 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.220
 join on social networks where I 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.930
 post very often photos forward 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.440
 first I ask you for your opinion and 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.880
