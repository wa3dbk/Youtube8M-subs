00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello everyone again today in front of you 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 japanese media 10 level scheme goats like 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.560
 usually talk about the weak and strong 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.180
 sides of tactics about many other things 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.949
 the next video you will all see great 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.789
 heavy battleships of the japanese navy 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.490
 and moto 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.260
 Well, now goats scheme in three words is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.970
 small shustrenko deadly 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.099
 destroyer let's start with the little one 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.080
 dimensions compared to dozens of us 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.270
 noticeably less which gives us a little higher 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.950
 chance to evade shots and at high 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.260
 distances say above ten kilometers 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.690
 no one will ever get you if you 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.219
 you'll need to move enough 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.260
 understand that we are not the ship itself 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.469
 melee before us like the first 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.910
 line but no closer than 5 kilometers 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.230
 goat's smart scheme is fine 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.700
 shifts the steering wheel and from the side 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.860
 the side that gives us awesome 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.660
 maneuverability we can easily tighten 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.579
 body to release the torpedoes and again 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.590
 it 's nice to become your opponent's forehead 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.510
 the maximum speed we have as many as 40 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.760
 knots which is practically the highest 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.710
 speeds of all ships but also left 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.299
 only deadliness as before on 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.979
 Japanese destroyers with death 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.710
 concerned the armament of the main caliber and 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.060
 from it we shoot very rarely while 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.830
 to keep firing at 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.869
 the enemy needs the lady to pour the body 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.900
 because the gun does not have time 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.240
 generally nowhere but we have incredible 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.720
 powerful torpedoes first they go in two 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.759
 options 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.000
 so to say stock sick and found 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.770
 slightly less powerful authors do the opposite when 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.930
 we have three torpedo tubes 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.180
 5 torpedoes each 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.909
 from a wide fan there is no distance approximately 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.159
 7 kilometers are not saved at all but one 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.470
 It is also important that the stock torpedo 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.720
 go as long as twenty kilometers we can 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.570
 let the torpedoes on fart maybe get and 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.369
 it happens that we get into tactics 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.840
 the most important thing is that you should 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.790
 understand at the tenth levels 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.520
 draw together with crosses and battleships 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.500
 it is strictly forbidden cruisers well here 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.229
 I understand all gk all affairs waste it 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.880
 dead but at the battleship you wanted by not an hour 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.799
 shoots well and we wear one shot 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.909
 critical damage and hits by the way 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.700
 not often enough 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.860
 but that 's not all if you suddenly wanted 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.810
 put torpedoes on board PMK battleship even 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.510
 at a distance of 5 kilometers you just 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.210
 destroy as she shoots a volley and 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.250
 practically 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.610
 always and volley you enters te ika damage 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.460
 from stably happens and worse we have 2 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.680
 variation of the game 1 is burning 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.990
 opponents of tight spots or sunbathe 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.790
 or else where but minus this tactic in 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.910
 that we will substitute our board anyway 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.160
 and Sinan we get 2 same tactics too 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.200
 very good at launching torpedoes 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.850
 long distance but the trick is that 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.440
 any ship to spot your torpedoes 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.610
 intelligence can absolutely not straining 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.440
 dodge them 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.960
 so here we attack the station 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.920
 incredibly rare but what tactic to get away 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.320
 decide for yourself 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.390
 and we went to the commander he should 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.940
 choose the skins of typical destroyers in 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.620
 the first row only one is repair further 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.080
 boiled torpedo expert 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.330
 the team after all this has a bulb 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.880
 well and then we memorize everything else like 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.660
 smoke visibility and so on now we go 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.610
 in the ship module 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.990
 again we canâ€™t level 10 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.140
 put as many as six modules 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.310
 4 of which are not critical for us 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.600
 we must deliver accelerated 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.850
 reloading torpedo tubes and 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.100
 masking the rest we leave 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.830
 Only if you have the money because 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.750
 they do not contribute much to the ship 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.370
 best shots ended next video 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.140
 we are waiting for them on this I say goodbye 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.450
 speaking to new meetings subscribe to 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.630
 channel rough century put huskies and good luck in 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.630
 sea
