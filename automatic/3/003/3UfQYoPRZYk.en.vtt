00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
here's a game that you guys haven't

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.809 
here's a game that you guys haven't
heard<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.440> on<00:00:04.560> my<00:00:04.710> channel<00:00:05.069> for<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.279> very<00:00:05.580> long

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
heard of on my channel for a very long

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.390 
heard of on my channel for a very long
time<00:00:05.850> Soul<00:00:06.540> Calibur<00:00:06.960> now<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.890> reason<00:00:08.189> why<00:00:08.370> I

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
time Soul Calibur now the reason why I

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.100 
time Soul Calibur now the reason why I
think<00:00:08.550> covered<00:00:09.000> Soul<00:00:09.179> Calibur<00:00:09.570> for<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> long

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
think covered Soul Calibur for a long

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.379 
think covered Soul Calibur for a long
time<00:00:10.410> was<00:00:10.559> mainly<00:00:10.950> because<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.550> presume<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
time was mainly because I presume the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.450 
time was mainly because I presume the
franchise<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.019> be<00:00:13.139> pretty<00:00:13.469> much<00:00:13.710> dead

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
franchise to be pretty much dead

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.849 
franchise to be pretty much dead
and<00:00:14.849> what's<00:00:15.089> Soul<00:00:15.299> Calibur<00:00:15.780> v<00:00:16.049> really<00:00:16.470> not

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
and what's Soul Calibur v really not

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.099 
and what's Soul Calibur v really not
doing<00:00:17.279> well<00:00:17.460> over<00:00:17.730> time<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.270> lot<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.720> us<00:00:18.930> just

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
doing well over time a lot of us just

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.540 
doing well over time a lot of us just
kind<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.410> figured<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.680> franchise<00:00:20.100> was<00:00:20.310> done

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
kind of figured the franchise was done

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.010 
kind of figured the franchise was done
but<00:00:20.820> there<00:00:21.090> might<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.480> glimmer<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.900> hope

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
but there might be a glimmer of hope

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.230 
but there might be a glimmer of hope

really assume that this is for lost

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.910 
really assume that this is for lost
swords<00:00:36.120> which<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.420> most<00:00:36.690> likely<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.410> where<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
swords which it most likely is where the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.250 
swords which it most likely is where the
extra<00:00:38.190> characters<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.730> added<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:39.300> or<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
extra characters be added in there or it

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.830 
extra characters be added in there or it
might<00:00:40.649> possibly<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.879> Soul<00:00:42.180> Calibur<00:00:42.540> 6

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
might possibly be for Soul Calibur 6

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.930 
might possibly be for Soul Calibur 6
because<00:00:43.290> right<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.520> poll<00:00:44.760> it's

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
because right now on this poll it's

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.459 
because right now on this poll it's
pretty<00:00:45.180> much<00:00:45.329> every<00:00:45.690> character<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.170> spin<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
pretty much every character that spin a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.619 
pretty much every character that spin a
Soul<00:00:46.800> Calibur<00:00:47.190> game<00:00:47.399> besides<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.390> guest

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
Soul Calibur game besides the guest

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.869 
Soul Calibur game besides the guest
character<00:00:49.079> sadly<00:00:49.530> they're<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.700> but

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
character sadly they're not on here but

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
character sadly they're not on here but
anybody<00:00:51.149> that's<00:00:51.329> actually<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> legit<00:00:52.320> Soul

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
anybody that's actually a legit Soul

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.619 
anybody that's actually a legit Soul
Calibur<00:00:52.980> character<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.059> wall

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
Calibur character is on this wall

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
Calibur character is on this wall
and<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.930> think<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.559> good<00:00:55.770> idea<00:00:55.949> for

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and I think this is a good idea for

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
and I think this is a good idea for
Namco<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.360> really<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.899> big

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
Namco to do because really the big

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.290 
Namco to do because really the big
problem<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.620> not<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> lot<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.670> people<00:01:00.059> had

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
problem with not a lot of people had

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.450 
problem with not a lot of people had
with<00:01:00.539> Soul<00:01:00.750> Calibur<00:01:01.079> pipe<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.859> mainly<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
with Soul Calibur pipe was mainly that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.549 
with Soul Calibur pipe was mainly that
so<00:01:02.760> many<00:01:02.969> fan<00:01:03.359> favorites<00:01:03.870> basically<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
so many fan favorites basically got the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.530 
so many fan favorites basically got the
axe<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.100> then<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.489> lot<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.970> characters<00:01:06.390> were

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
axe and then a lot of characters were

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.670 
axe and then a lot of characters were
plugged<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.990> people<00:01:07.290> were<00:01:07.619> not

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
plugged in that people were not

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.490 
plugged in that people were not
necessarily<00:01:08.549> banned<00:01:09.000> ugh<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.869> think<00:01:10.229> this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
necessarily banned ugh so I think this

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.170 
necessarily banned ugh so I think this
is<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> good<00:01:10.890> idea<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.400> really<00:01:11.700> judge<00:01:11.939> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
is a good idea it's a really judge of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.330 
is a good idea it's a really judge of
