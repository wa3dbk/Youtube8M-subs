00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.790 
glitter on that and I'll show you that
too<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.139> you're<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.440> hang<00:01:01.589> it<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
too and if you're going to hang it you

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.349 
too and if you're going to hang it you
want<00:01:01.949> something<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> punch<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.670> hole<00:01:02.819> with<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
want something to punch a hole with and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.289 
want something to punch a hole with and
then<00:01:04.080> some<00:01:04.379> yarn<00:01:04.620> or<00:01:05.100> ribbon<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> first

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
then some yarn or ribbon so the first

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.090 
then some yarn or ribbon so the first
step<00:01:06.509> would<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.780> put<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.259> on<00:01:07.469> cardstock

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
step would be to put this on cardstock

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.810 
step would be to put this on cardstock
paper<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:09.469> then<00:01:10.469> you<00:01:10.560> would<00:01:10.649> cut<00:01:10.829> it<00:01:10.950> out<00:01:11.100> or

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
paper and then you would cut it out or

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.510 
paper and then you would cut it out or
the<00:01:12.000> children<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.540> cut<00:01:12.719> it<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:17.250> then<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the children can cut it out and then you

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.600 
the children can cut it out and then you
would<00:01:17.640> take<00:01:17.759> your<00:01:17.939> glue<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> would

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
would take your glue and then you would

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:33.459 
would take your glue and then you would
apply<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> inside<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.860> heart

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.249 

alright<00:01:34.469> so<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.039> have<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.280> cut<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:37.020> next

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
alright so we have that cut out the next

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.289 
alright so we have that cut out the next
step<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:38.130> put<00:01:38.310> some<00:01:38.490> glue<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.270> inside

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
step is to put some glue on the inside

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.240 
step is to put some glue on the inside
so<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.229> tissue<00:01:40.380> paper<00:01:40.530> has<00:01:40.920> something<00:01:41.219> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so the tissue paper has something to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.270 
so the tissue paper has something to
stick<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:43.890> around<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.250> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
stick to and we just go around like that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.219 
stick to and we just go around like that
doing<00:01:44.869> dots<00:01:45.869> all<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.320> way<00:01:46.500> around<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:48.229> it's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
doing dots all the way around and it's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.389 
doing dots all the way around and it's
great<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.560> remind<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> children<00:01:50.250> not<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
great to remind the children not to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.450 
great to remind the children not to
squeeze<00:01:50.820> too<00:01:51.179> hard<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> bottles<00:01:52.460> if

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
squeeze too hard on the bottles if

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
squeeze too hard on the bottles if
you're<00:01:53.700> using<00:01:53.850> liquid<00:01:54.359> glue<00:01:56.899> okay<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.200> so

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you're using liquid glue okay just so

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.880 
you're using liquid glue okay just so
you<00:01:58.320> got<00:01:59.869> enough<00:02:00.869> glue<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.409> tissue

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
you got enough glue that the tissue

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.010 
you got enough glue that the tissue
paper<00:02:01.979> or<00:02:02.249> a<00:02:02.310> stick<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.840> children

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
paper or a stick and then the children

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.300 
paper or a stick and then the children
would<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.350> simply<00:02:04.619> take<00:02:04.829> their<00:02:05.100> tissue

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
would just simply take their tissue

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.630 
would just simply take their tissue
paper<00:02:05.609> squares<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:07.499> put<00:02:07.950> them<00:02:08.130> on<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
paper squares and then put them on the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.660 
paper squares and then put them on the
heart<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.179> fill<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.539> heart<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:10.550> tissue<00:02:11.550> paper

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
heart and fill the heart in tissue paper

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.670 
heart and fill the heart in tissue paper
it's<00:02:12.599> great<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.019> work<00:02:13.140> with<00:02:13.200> for<00:02:13.530> those

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
it's great to work with for those

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.449 
it's great to work with for those
developing<00:02:14.129> fine<00:02:14.340> motor<00:02:14.370> skills<00:02:14.849> because<00:02:15.239> it

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
developing fine motor skills because it

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.240 
developing fine motor skills because it
so<00:02:15.730> thin<00:02:16.409> she<00:02:17.409> won't<00:02:17.530> have<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.859> work<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.129> little

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
so thin she won't have to work a little

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.789 
so thin she won't have to work a little
bit<00:02:18.370> harder<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.790> grasp<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.750> then<00:02:20.500> to

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
bit harder to grasp it and then to

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.259 
bit harder to grasp it and then to
separate<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.459> if<00:02:21.579> there's<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.849> couple<00:02:22.030> pieces

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
separate it if there's a couple pieces

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.740 
separate it if there's a couple pieces
stuck<00:02:22.659> together<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.609> then<00:02:24.609> to<00:02:25.269> put<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.569> down

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
stuck together and then to put it down

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.429 
stuck together and then to put it down
where<00:02:26.290> they<00:02:26.409> want<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.829> on<00:02:27.069> their<00:02:27.579> heart<00:02:28.439> and

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
where they want it on their heart and

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.190 
where they want it on their heart and
then<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.040> push<00:02:30.219> down<00:02:30.430> on<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:31.209> my<00:02:32.019> fingers

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
then to push down on it so my fingers

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.809 
then to push down on it so my fingers
are<00:02:32.379> really<00:02:32.500> getting<00:02:32.799> a<00:02:32.829> great<00:02:33.010> workout<00:02:33.400> with

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
are really getting a great workout with

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.599 
are really getting a great workout with
this<00:02:34.109> so<00:02:35.109> the<00:02:35.200> object<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.709> this<00:02:35.829> would<00:02:36.310> be<00:02:36.430> that

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
this so the object of this would be that

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.000 
this so the object of this would be that
the<00:02:36.700> children<00:02:37.090> fill<00:02:37.359> in<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:38.469> whole<00:02:38.709> heart

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the children fill in the whole heart

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.819 
the children fill in the whole heart
with<00:02:39.219> their<00:02:39.370> tissue<00:02:39.609> paper<00:02:39.879> in<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.150> same<00:02:40.329> time

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
with their tissue paper in the same time

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.970 
with their tissue paper in the same time
with<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:41.980> be<00:02:42.129> every<00:02:42.430> done<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:44.709> one

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
with the be every done that this one

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.750 
with the be every done that this one
right<00:02:45.250> here

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
right here

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.319 
right here
so<00:02:46.750> then<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.049> heart<00:02:47.260> is<00:02:47.530> all<00:02:47.739> filled<00:02:48.099> in<00:02:48.370> and

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
so then the heart is all filled in and

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.629 
so then the heart is all filled in and
then<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.290> if<00:02:50.349> you<00:02:50.470> want<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.919> can<00:02:51.069> just<00:02:51.189> put<00:02:51.609> a

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
should then be dipped off into the paper

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:24.330 
should then be dipped off into the paper
plate<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:21.299> then<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.329> have<00:03:22.629> a<00:03:23.340> beautiful

this<00:03:27.940> if<00:03:28.299> you<00:03:28.449> if<00:03:28.840> there's<00:03:29.109> not<00:03:29.229> gluing<00:03:29.530> or

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
this if you if there's not gluing or

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.710 
this if you if there's not gluing or
anything<00:03:29.889> you<00:03:30.069> can<00:03:30.190> just<00:03:30.220> simply<00:03:30.609> say<00:03:30.849> that<00:03:31.120> or

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
anything you can just simply say that or

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.479 
anything you can just simply say that or
combine<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.379> together<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.949> then<00:03:33.069> put<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.340> back

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
combine it together and then put it back

into<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:34.120> glitter<00:03:34.329> bottle<00:03:34.659> so<00:03:35.079> it's<00:03:35.199> good<00:03:35.349> to

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
into the glitter bottle so it's good to

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.649 
into the glitter bottle so it's good to
have<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.590> match<00:03:35.889> or<00:03:36.159> something<00:03:36.310> under<00:03:36.729> under

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659

whatever you're working on that you're
using<00:03:39.549> glitter<00:03:39.909> with<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.419> so<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:41.139> final<00:03:41.409> step

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
using glitter with and so the final step

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.599 
using glitter with and so the final step
would<00:03:41.709> be<00:03:41.769> if<00:03:41.889> you're<00:03:42.099> going<00:03:42.189> to<00:03:42.310> hang<00:03:42.459> these

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
would be if you're going to hang these

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.159 
would be if you're going to hang these

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:53.949 
could also hang these on bulletin boards

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.110 
could also hang these on bulletin boards
or<00:03:54.280> on<00:03:54.759> the<00:03:54.939> walls<00:03:55.150> for<00:03:55.479> room<00:03:55.689> decorations
