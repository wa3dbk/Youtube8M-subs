anyways<00:00:51.239> let's<00:00:51.719> begin<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.879> first<00:00:53.879> you're

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
anyways let's begin so first you're

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.880 
anyways let's begin so first you're
going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.420> start<00:00:54.719> by<00:00:54.840> setting<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.469> curling

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
going to start by setting your curling

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.880 
going to start by setting your curling
iron<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.430> low<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.660> recommend<00:00:58.020> using<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
iron to low and I recommend using like a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.189 
iron to low and I recommend using like a
curling<00:00:59.370> iron<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.660> set<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
curling iron that you can set the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.470 
curling iron that you can set the
temperature<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> low<00:01:03.270> or

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
temperature to or you have like a low or

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.109 
temperature to or you have like a low or
high<00:01:03.629> kind<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.019> option<00:01:04.439> because<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.880> don't

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
high kind of option because if you don't

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.690 
high kind of option because if you don't
like<00:01:06.420> say<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> curling<00:01:07.140> wand<00:01:07.439> which<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.430> also

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
like say a curling wand which I also

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.719 
like say a curling wand which I also
have<00:01:09.500> but<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.680> gets<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.460> 400

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
have but that gets up to like 400

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.880 
have but that gets up to like 400
something<00:01:12.270> degrees<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> doesn't<00:01:13.560> have

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
something degrees and if it doesn't have

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.370 
something degrees and if it doesn't have
like<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> temperature<00:01:14.820> gauge<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:16.110> can

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
can melt and also I do recommend doing

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.350 
can melt and also I do recommend doing
this<00:01:49.340> on<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:50.060> doll<00:01:50.330> whose<00:01:51.290> hair<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:51.740> already

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
this on a doll whose hair is already

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.390 
this on a doll whose hair is already
somewhat<00:01:53.360> dry<00:01:53.720> because<00:01:54.080> it<00:01:54.560> does<00:01:54.860> dry<00:01:55.340> the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
somewhat dry because it does dry the

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.850 
somewhat dry because it does dry the
ends<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:56.110> your<00:01:57.110> doll's<00:01:57.560> hair<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:58.630> lot<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.229> that's

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
ends of your doll's hair a lot so that's

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.940 
ends of your doll's hair a lot so that's
why<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.310> decided<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.850> do<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.420> on<00:02:02.720> Molly<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.410> also

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
why I decided to do it on Molly and also

iron<00:02:38.570> is<00:02:39.400> okay<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.670> then<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.209> let<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.600> go

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.430 

and<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.270> kind<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.540> want<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.900> gentle<00:02:49.230> with

it<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:52.170> should<00:02:52.410> leave<00:02:52.740> kind<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.280> ring

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
it and it should leave kind of a ring

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.920 
it and it should leave kind of a ring
with<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.790> sort<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.480> curl<00:02:54.750> like<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.910> it

with a sort of curl like that and it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.660 
with a sort of curl like that and it
depends<00:02:57.930> if<00:02:58.080> your<00:02:58.230> doll<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.620> pretty<00:02:59.250> straight

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
hair then it's probably going to take a

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.740 
hair then it's probably going to take a
couple<00:03:02.370> tries<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:04.730> but<00:03:05.730> Molly's<00:03:06.450> hair<00:03:06.660> is

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
couple tries so but Molly's hair is

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.770 
couple tries so but Molly's hair is
pretty<00:03:06.990> wave<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.700> already<00:03:08.700> kind<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.030> wavy<00:03:09.390> so

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
pretty wave is already kind of wavy so

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.340 
pretty wave is already kind of wavy so
it<00:03:10.080> works<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.560> little<00:03:10.800> bit<00:03:11.070> better<00:03:11.840> but<00:03:12.840> I'll

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
it works a little bit better but I'll

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:23.530 
it works a little bit better but I'll
just<00:03:13.410> speed<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.040> up<00:03:14.250> now

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540
