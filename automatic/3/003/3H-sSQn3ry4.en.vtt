 world market are produced in guandong province 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.560
 it is in this region that many young workers from rural areas 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.760
 poor moves to earn money to support their families 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.680
 the report is based on the study of a number of toy manufacturers 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.240
 in guangdong province who sell their products to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.020
 Swedish companies 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.080
 when am douati began to investigate the making of toys 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.120

 one hundred days off or contract 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.530
 the report indicated that by putting pressure on toy manufacturers the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.310
 situation seemed to be improving 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.220
 in the new Swedish standard report indicate that some of its factories 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.430
 have reduced the hours of work today employees are working 70 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.500
 hours a week and at least one day off 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.020
 yes and to be classified at least this weekend yes and and she assumes the afp 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.280
 the bill is to roanne my mother as Swedish consumers we 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.820
 get a lot of things on it for a second 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.200
 many of our products not just toys but electronics 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.380
 without made in the Chinese factories and if we have conscience 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.509
 conditions of work problems of the Chinese they can also set 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.220
 requirements to exchange methods of purchase in ways that the 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.909
 suppliers can offer better working conditions to 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.130
 workers did not break it should fit this laziness 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.600
 the tail with 16 points in front of the press it's hard for customers to 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.840
 know the conditions in which the days and weeks that is 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.259
 made here 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:13.889
 for this device 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.060
 school it is very very difficult 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.420
 for Swedish consumers to know I did not mark on them 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.040
 products themselves there is no one in the store to vote receive 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.340
 few weeks but not trained in this area and on the websites 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.010
 retailers although very little information very information 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.540
 vague about what they do such a requirement they have on the prefecture one 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.719
 hopes that Chinese workers will have more and more rights 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.299
 in the times to come 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.480
 each can be abrupt site by site companies that produce the 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.809
 best player in Japan and later their smiles during the draw on 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:50.700
 a lot because people buy another item the return that those who do not 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.480
