00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.059
 little bit trying to get us on 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.299
 curious; excited 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.860
 ask number one from which country came 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.860

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.910

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.180
 Nicholas comes from Russia Siberia 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.680
 Somehow something like Russia can do 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.110

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.869
 Actually everything comes without christians 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.580
