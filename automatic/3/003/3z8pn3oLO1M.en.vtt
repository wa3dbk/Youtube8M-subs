00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
choosing the condition would really slow

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.270 
choosing the condition would really slow
you<00:02:40.870> down<00:02:41.079> so<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.379> can<00:02:41.500> turn<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.799> off<00:02:42.010> the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
you down so you can turn that off the

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
notes based on condition so if you list

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.629
