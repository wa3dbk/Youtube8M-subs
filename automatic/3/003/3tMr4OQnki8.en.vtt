00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
okay I'm just going to show a little

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.539 
okay I'm just going to show a little
video<00:00:02.610> here<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.060> how<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.389> wire<00:00:03.929> up<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.520> pair<00:00:05.520> of

amplifiers and a strap configuration

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.940 
amplifiers and a strap configuration
it's<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.059> pretty<00:00:09.450> simple<00:00:09.750> thing<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.200> do<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.559> lot

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
it's a pretty simple thing to do a lot

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.990 
it's a pretty simple thing to do a lot
of<00:00:10.980> manufacturers<00:00:11.670> will<00:00:11.940> provide<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:14.000> diagram

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
of manufacturers will provide a diagram

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.490 
of manufacturers will provide a diagram
that<00:00:15.059> will<00:00:15.389> show<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.630> how<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.199> some

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
that will show you how to do this some

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.599 
that will show you how to do this some
with<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.770> paperwork<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.279> comes<00:00:17.400> with

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
with the paperwork that comes with

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.880 
with the paperwork that comes with
amplifiers<00:00:18.029> make<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.960> does<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.350> for

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
amplifiers make you does this for

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.700 
amplifiers make you does this for
example<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.699> also<00:00:21.359> went<00:00:21.720> ahead<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.050> drew<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
example I also went ahead and drew up a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.410 
example I also went ahead and drew up a
diagram<00:00:23.220> that's<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.699> little<00:00:23.850> bit<00:00:24.029> easier<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
diagram that's a little bit easier to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.620 
diagram that's a little bit easier to
follow<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.109> little<00:00:25.289> bit<00:00:25.410> bigger<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.630> as

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
follow and a little bit bigger to see as

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.529 
follow and a little bit bigger to see as
you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.930> see<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:28.730> have<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.789> picture<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> the

connect them together with a gauge cable

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.000 
connect them together with a gauge cable
preferably<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.049> two<00:01:13.229> pieces<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.770> here

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
preferably you can do two pieces in here

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.770 
preferably you can do two pieces in here
like<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.850> drawn<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.330> picture<00:01:15.689> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
like I have drawn in this picture and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.719 
like I have drawn in this picture and
I'll<00:01:15.930> show<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.439> my<00:01:16.590> amplifiers<00:01:17.520> as

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
I'll show you that on my amplifiers as

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.840 
I'll show you that on my amplifiers as
well<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.170> take<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.740> positive<00:01:20.310> from

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
well and then you take the positive from

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.550 
well and then you take the positive from
the<00:01:21.030> master<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.630> goes<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> positive

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the master that goes to the positive

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.850 
the master that goes to the positive
side<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:23.009> your<00:01:23.130> voice<00:01:23.310> coil<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:25.500> take<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
side of your voice coil and you take the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.319 
side of your voice coil and you take the
negative<00:01:26.310> from<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> slave<00:01:28.790> actually<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:30.119> me

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
negative from the slave actually see me

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.990 
negative from the slave actually see me
take<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> positive<00:01:31.079> from<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> slave<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.340> use

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
take the positive from the slave and use

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.380 
take the positive from the slave and use
that<00:01:33.150> as<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.570> negative<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> voice<00:01:34.650> coil

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
that as the negative to the voice coil

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.460 
that as the negative to the voice coil
most<00:01:36.390> amplifiers<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.200> strap

it's<00:02:17.040> doing<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:17.490> getting<00:02:17.670> signal<00:02:18.210> from

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
it's doing is just getting signal from

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.090 
it's doing is just getting signal from
this<00:02:18.570> amplifier<00:02:19.080> over<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> other<00:02:19.680> one<00:02:19.890> so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
this amplifier over to the other one so

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.870 
this amplifier over to the other one so
that<00:02:20.250> way<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.490> have<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.850> complete<00:02:21.360> circuit<00:02:21.800> and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
that way you have a complete circuit and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.260 
that way you have a complete circuit and

here here's the speaker readings I don't
know<00:02:33.450> if<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.660> can<00:02:33.840> make<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.230> out<00:02:34.560> or<00:02:34.710> not<00:02:34.890> but

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
know if you can make that out or not but

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.610 
know if you can make that out or not but
this<00:02:35.700> one<00:02:35.910> here<00:02:36.210> is<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.020> slave<00:02:37.380> amp

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
this one here is this is the slave amp

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.260 
this one here is this is the slave amp
this<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.340> positive<00:02:38.520> here

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
this is the positive here

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.380 
this is the positive here
it<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.810> going<00:02:39.990> to<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.320> negative<00:02:40.710> voice<00:02:40.920> coil

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
it is going to the negative voice coil

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.680 
it is going to the negative voice coil
it's<00:02:42.390> two<00:02:42.540> pieces<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:43.020> eight<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.470> just<00:02:43.680> going

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
it's two pieces of eight and just going

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.270 
it's two pieces of eight and just going
twisted<00:02:45.690> together<00:02:45.990> into<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> four<00:02:46.770> gauge<00:02:46.980> ring

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
twisted together into a four gauge ring

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.650 
twisted together into a four gauge ring
and<00:02:47.520> then<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> positive<00:02:49.410> side<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:50.100> have<00:02:50.970> two

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
and then on the positive side I have two

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.000 
and then on the positive side I have two
pieces<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.050> eight<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.890> link<00:02:53.280> across<00:02:54.680> over<00:02:55.680> to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
pieces of eight that link across over to

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.000 
pieces of eight that link across over to
the<00:02:56.400> other<00:02:56.580> negative<00:02:57.290> excuse<00:02:58.290> me<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.800> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
the other negative excuse me this is the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.580 
the other negative excuse me this is the
negative<00:02:59.220> side<00:02:59.730> I<00:03:00.030> said<00:03:00.690> positive<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:01.320> it's<00:03:01.440> a

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
negative side I said positive but it's a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.520 
negative side I said positive but it's a
negative<00:03:01.800> side<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.430> well<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:04.170> can<00:03:04.200> get<00:03:04.470> a

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
negative side as well it can get a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.010 
negative side as well it can get a
little<00:03:04.680> confusing<00:03:05.510> that's<00:03:06.510> why<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:06.810> helpful

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
little confusing that's why it's helpful

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.630 
little confusing that's why it's helpful
to<00:03:07.140> have<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.560> diagram<00:03:08.010> when<00:03:08.310> you're<00:03:08.459> wiring

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
to have the diagram when you're wiring

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.000 
to have the diagram when you're wiring
it<00:03:08.910> up<00:03:09.060> but<00:03:09.450> if<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.200> take<00:03:10.380> your<00:03:10.530> time<00:03:10.740> with<00:03:10.980> it

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
it up but if you take your time with it

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.410 
it up but if you take your time with it
it's<00:03:11.250> really<00:03:11.430> not<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.820> difficult

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
it's really not that difficult

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.480 
it's really not that difficult
just<00:03:13.230> make<00:03:13.380> sure<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.800> connect<00:03:14.160> both

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
just make sure that you connect both

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.640 
just make sure that you connect both
negatives<00:03:15.030> together<00:03:15.240> with<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> link<00:03:16.470> cable

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
negatives together with the link cable

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.130 
negatives together with the link cable
the<00:03:17.490> positive<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.209> master<00:03:18.630> goes<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:19.019> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
the positive of the master goes to the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.820 
the positive of the master goes to the
positive<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.769> voice<00:03:19.920> coil<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.489> then<00:03:21.420> the

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
positive of the voice coil and then the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.050 
positive of the voice coil and then the
positive<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.070> slave<00:03:23.459> goes<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
positive of the slave goes to the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.540 
positive of the slave goes to the
negative<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.750> voice<00:03:24.870> coil<00:03:25.310> that's<00:03:26.310> pretty

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
negative of the voice coil that's pretty

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.880 
negative of the voice coil that's pretty
much<00:03:26.670> about<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.360> then<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.110> just<00:03:28.320> set<00:03:28.709> all

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
much about it and then you just set all

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.710 
much about it and then you just set all
your<00:03:29.010> gains<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.550> everything<00:03:29.970> accordingly<00:03:30.390> on

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
your gains and everything accordingly on

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.240 
your gains and everything accordingly on
the<00:03:31.620> master<00:03:31.980> side<00:03:32.540> also<00:03:33.540> another<00:03:34.019> thing<00:03:34.800> that

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
the master side also another thing that

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.949 
the master side also another thing that
I've<00:03:35.370> noticed<00:03:35.550> some<00:03:36.239> people<00:03:36.360> have<00:03:36.570> questions

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
I've noticed some people have questions

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.390 
I've noticed some people have questions
about<00:03:37.230> is<00:03:37.940> does<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.360> knob<00:03:40.010> on<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.040> aq

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
about is does this knob on the aq

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.699 
about is does this knob on the aq
amplifiers<00:03:41.970> control<00:03:42.630> bass<00:03:42.810> boost<00:03:43.140> gain<00:03:43.440> what

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
amplifiers control bass boost gain what

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.740 
amplifiers control bass boost gain what
does<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:43.890> do<00:03:44.100> has<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.610> work

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
does it do has it work

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.920 
does it do has it work
it<00:03:45.989> all<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.350> controls<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:47.040> gain<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.900> a

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
it all it controls is gain and it is a

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.650 
it all it controls is gain and it is a
fine<00:03:49.470> adjustment<00:03:50.370> for<00:03:50.519> gain<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.239> actual
