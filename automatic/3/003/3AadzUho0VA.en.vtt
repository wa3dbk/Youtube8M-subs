the gravitational fist and i'll save
that<00:02:43.220> one<00:02:43.430> for<00:02:43.489> later<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.269> they<00:02:44.450> each<00:02:44.570> come

something<00:02:51.350> I'm<00:02:51.470> not<00:02:51.620> too<00:02:51.890> happy<00:02:52.070> about<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:52.550> you

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
something I'm not too happy about is you

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.759 
something I'm not too happy about is you
cannot<00:02:53.060> crafter<00:02:53.780> them<00:02:53.900> which<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.440> think<00:02:54.620> that

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
cannot crafter them which I think that

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:55.840 
cannot crafter them which I think that
should<00:02:54.890> definitely<00:02:55.250> be<00:02:55.310> added<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.670> game

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
should definitely be added to the game

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.880 
should definitely be added to the game
for<00:02:56.180> these<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.450> definitely<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.410> spawn

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
for these you definitely have to spawn

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.650 
for these you definitely have to spawn
them<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.220> could<00:02:58.489> not<00:02:58.610> find<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:59.060> recipe<00:02:59.420> how<00:02:59.600> to

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
them it I could not find a recipe how to

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.259 
them it I could not find a recipe how to
craft<00:02:59.989> them<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:01.730> leads<00:03:02.000> me<00:03:02.120> to

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
craft them and so that that leads me to

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.910 
craft them and so that that leads me to
believe<00:03:02.300> they<00:03:02.630> do<00:03:02.690> have<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.170> spawn<00:03:03.650> them<00:03:03.769> in

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
believe they do have to spawn them in

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.920 
believe they do have to spawn them in
which<00:03:04.070> is<00:03:04.220> disappointing<00:03:04.400> them<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.900> say

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
which is disappointing them just to say

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.290 
which is disappointing them just to say
that<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.890> really<00:03:07.580> like<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.910> if<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.090> could

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
that I really like it if you could

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.810 
that I really like it if you could
definitely<00:03:08.660> craft<00:03:09.230> them<00:03:09.530> because<00:03:10.220> then<00:03:10.730> you

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
definitely craft them because then you

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.130 
definitely craft them because then you
can<00:03:10.970> use<00:03:11.090> in<00:03:11.209> survival<00:03:11.630> without<00:03:11.690> having<00:03:12.080> to

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
can use in survival without having to

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.259 
can use in survival without having to
spawn<00:03:12.320> them<00:03:12.410> in<00:03:12.560> but<00:03:12.890> that's<00:03:13.880> besides<00:03:14.180> the

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
spawn them in but that's besides the

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.270 
spawn them in but that's besides the
point<00:03:14.330> so<00:03:15.019> you<00:03:15.470> can<00:03:15.620> make<00:03:15.769> some<00:03:15.920> really<00:03:16.040> cool

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
point so you can make some really cool

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.710 
point so you can make some really cool
things<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:16.730> would<00:03:16.850> imagine<00:03:17.000> with<00:03:17.269> this<00:03:17.420> if<00:03:17.600> you

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
things I would imagine with this if you

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.960 
things I would imagine with this if you
guys<00:03:17.840> are<00:03:18.019> like<00:03:18.080> map<00:03:18.320> makers<00:03:18.799> or<00:03:19.100> whatnot<00:03:19.280> cuz

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
guys are like map makers or whatnot cuz

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.320 
guys are like map makers or whatnot cuz
like<00:03:20.290> but<00:03:21.290> like<00:03:21.890> it's<00:03:22.160> so<00:03:22.340> much<00:03:22.700> easier<00:03:22.910> to

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
like but like it's so much easier to

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.960 
like but like it's so much easier to
like<00:03:24.140> push<00:03:24.410> blocks<00:03:24.740> farther<00:03:25.010> or<00:03:25.430> do<00:03:25.640> anything

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
like push blocks farther or do anything

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.620 
like push blocks farther or do anything
what

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
what

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.870 
what
these<00:03:26.810> types<00:03:27.050> of<00:03:27.170> Pistons<00:03:27.590> because<00:03:28.040> they<00:03:28.640> go

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
these types of Pistons because they go

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.970 
these types of Pistons because they go
farther<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.540> can<00:03:29.690> have<00:03:30.110> more<00:03:30.290> customization

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
farther you can have more customization

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.560 
farther you can have more customization
with<00:03:31.070> them<00:03:31.220> like<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.700> want<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:31.940> go<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.270> far

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
with them like you want to go that far

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.870 
with them like you want to go that far
you<00:03:32.630> can<00:03:33.140> go<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.410> far<00:03:33.650> may<00:03:34.220> flex<00:03:34.430> custom

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
you can go that far may flex custom

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.580 
you can go that far may flex custom
staircases<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.960> can<00:03:36.080> do<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.170> bunch<00:03:36.410> of<00:03:36.530> stuff

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
staircases you can do a bunch of stuff

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.050 
staircases you can do a bunch of stuff
and<00:03:36.920> I'm<00:03:37.010> pretty<00:03:37.160> much<00:03:37.220> just<00:03:37.310> showing<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:37.820> off

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
and I'm pretty much just showing you off

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.280 
and I'm pretty much just showing you off
this<00:03:38.270> mod<00:03:38.480> because<00:03:38.660> there's<00:03:38.900> not<00:03:38.990> too<00:03:39.170> much

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
this mod because there's not too much

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.840 
this mod because there's not too much
with<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:39.650> mod<00:03:39.860> but<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.640> the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
with this mod but this is the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.120 
with this mod but this is the
gravitational<00:03:41.510> piston<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.530> pretty<00:03:42.950> much<00:03:43.010> you

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
gravitational piston and pretty much you

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.370 
gravitational piston and pretty much you
launch<00:03:43.460> it<00:03:43.610> up<00:03:43.730> it'll<00:03:44.030> launch<00:03:44.420> any<00:03:44.720> gravid

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
launch it up it'll launch any gravid

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.710 
launch it up it'll launch any gravid
gravitational<00:03:46.250> block<00:03:46.430> up<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:46.910> fall<00:03:47.540> back

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
gravitational block up and fall back

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.940 
gravitational block up and fall back
down<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.230> can<00:03:48.380> also<00:03:48.500> do<00:03:48.770> this<00:03:48.890> with

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
down and you can also do this with

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.290 
down and you can also do this with
yourself<00:03:49.490> so<00:03:49.640> if<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.790> want<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:49.940> use<00:03:50.060> as<00:03:50.150> like

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
yourself so if you want to use as like

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.690 
yourself so if you want to use as like
an<00:03:50.420> elevator<00:03:50.720> we<00:03:51.050> go<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.040> second<00:03:52.370> floor<00:03:52.460> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
an elevator we go the second floor and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.580 
an elevator we go the second floor and
land<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.180> if<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:54.050> were<00:03:54.110> in<00:03:54.170> survival<00:03:54.380> we

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
land and if you were in survival we

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.650 
land and if you were in survival we
would<00:03:54.770> have<00:03:54.950> falling<00:03:55.430> damage<00:03:55.610> but<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.210> do<00:03:56.390> not

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
would have falling damage but I do not

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.170 
would have falling damage but I do not
because<00:03:57.020> I'm<00:03:57.140> not<00:03:57.320> in<00:03:57.500> survival<00:03:58.040> but<00:03:59.000> that's

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
because I'm not in survival but that's

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.760 
because I'm not in survival but that's
pretty<00:03:59.330> much<00:03:59.450> all<00:03:59.660> this<00:03:59.870> mud<00:04:00.080> is<00:04:00.290> if<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.590> enjoy
