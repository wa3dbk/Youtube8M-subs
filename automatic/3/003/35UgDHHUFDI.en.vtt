steampunk<00:00:18.750> ish<00:00:20.029> as<00:00:21.080> you<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.170> see

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.910 

what<00:00:36.220> I've<00:00:36.370> done<00:00:36.400> is<00:00:38.130> added<00:00:39.130> a<00:00:39.670> custom<00:00:40.920> barrel

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
what I've done is added a custom barrel

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.590 
what I've done is added a custom barrel
to<00:00:42.730> give<00:00:42.850> it<00:00:42.940> more<00:00:43.330> of<00:00:43.390> a<00:00:43.600> sniper<00:00:44.700> gun<00:00:45.700> feel<00:00:46.330> to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
to give it more of a sniper gun feel to

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.979 
to give it more of a sniper gun feel to
it<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:48.280> does<00:00:48.520> need<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.730> be<00:00:48.820> shortened<00:00:49.360> probably

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
it it does need to be shortened probably

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.490 
it it does need to be shortened probably
about<00:00:50.140> three<00:00:51.010> inches<00:00:51.309> because<00:00:52.300> when<00:00:53.170> I<00:00:53.199> fire

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
about three inches because when I fire

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.660 
about three inches because when I fire
it<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:55.239> dark<00:00:55.870> doesn't<00:00:56.140> fly<00:00:56.410> that<00:00:56.559> far<00:00:56.830> and<00:00:57.160> it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
it the dark doesn't fly that far and it

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.869 
it the dark doesn't fly that far and it
kind<00:00:57.910> of<00:00:57.970> like<00:00:58.540> waffles<00:00:59.220> like<00:01:00.220> a<00:01:00.250> fish<00:01:00.520> pretty

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
kind of like waffles like a fish pretty

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.060 
kind of like waffles like a fish pretty
much<00:01:01.090> when<00:01:01.660> I<00:01:01.690> show<00:01:01.870> you<00:01:01.930> that<00:01:02.110> so<00:01:02.920> I'm

probably gonna shave off probably about

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.749 
probably gonna shave off probably about
three<00:01:07.180> inches<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:08.200> it<00:01:08.229> matches<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.979> front

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
three inches so it matches the front

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.780 
three inches so it matches the front
guns<00:01:10.450> length<00:01:11.110> I<00:01:12.479> did<00:01:13.479> that<00:01:13.600> on<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.869> other<00:01:13.930> gun

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.020 
guns length I did that on the other gun
my<00:01:15.790> other<00:01:16.509> longshot<00:01:17.020> cs-6<00:01:17.229> and<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:18.790> still

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
my other longshot cs-6 and it still

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.010 
my other longshot cs-6 and it still
fires<00:01:19.830> even<00:01:20.830> with<00:01:20.950> this<00:01:21.070> front<00:01:21.759> barrel<00:01:22.000> but<00:01:22.720> I

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
fires even with this front barrel but I

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.410 
fires even with this front barrel but I
did<00:01:23.710> shave<00:01:23.979> it<00:01:24.100> off<00:01:24.220> but<00:01:24.880> i<00:01:24.910> haven't<00:01:25.180> done<00:01:25.240> on
