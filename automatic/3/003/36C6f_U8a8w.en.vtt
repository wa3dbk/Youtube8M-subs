00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
strike Kelvin combination the ball have

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.840 
strike Kelvin combination the ball have
to<00:01:58.060> rebound<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.409> we're<00:01:59.590> going<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.830> do<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.520> take

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
to rebound so we're going to do is take

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.300 
to rebound so we're going to do is take
it<00:02:00.909> out<00:02:01.119> of<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.299> norm<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.890> we've<00:02:02.890> been<00:02:03.009> carry

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
it out of the norm and we've been carry

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.669 
it out of the norm and we've been carry
through<00:02:03.610> with<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:05.220> seven<00:02:06.220> punch<00:02:06.430> combination

through with a seven punch combination
where<00:02:08.679> am<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:08.830> supposed<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.220> let<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.429> ball<00:02:09.610> come

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
where am I supposed to let the ball come

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.030 
where am I supposed to let the ball come
back<00:02:10.780> we're<00:02:11.080> not<00:02:11.110> going<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.500> come<00:02:11.680> backwards

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
back we're not going to come backwards

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:21.680 
back we're not going to come backwards
I'll<00:02:12.220> follow<00:02:12.430> through<00:02:15.209> see<00:02:16.209> I'll<00:02:17.200> do<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.440> again

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.240 

it<00:02:22.690> looks<00:02:22.870> like<00:02:23.050> an<00:02:23.200> eight<00:02:23.350> punch<00:02:23.590> combination

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
it looks like an eight punch combination

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.790 
it looks like an eight punch combination
but<00:02:24.580> it's<00:02:24.760> not<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:26.019> trick<00:02:26.319> here<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:26.709> I'll

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
but it's not so I trick here so I'll

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.640 
but it's not so I trick here so I'll
count<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.160> out<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:29.760> 737<00:02:30.760> punches<00:02:31.650> but

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
count it out to you 737 punches but

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.590 
count it out to you 737 punches but
that's<00:02:33.489> another<00:02:33.819> way<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.030> do<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.360> here's<00:02:34.540> a

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
that's another way to do and here's a

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.259 
that's another way to do and here's a
one<00:02:35.220> combination<00:02:36.220> i<00:02:36.489> really<00:02:36.790> like<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> most

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
one combination i really like the most

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.479 
one combination i really like the most
is<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.510> five<00:02:37.840> punch<00:02:38.140> combination<00:02:38.739> is<00:02:38.890> going

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
is that five punch combination is going

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.819 
is that five punch combination is going
this<00:02:39.670> partner<00:02:40.180> strike<00:02:40.810> elbow<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.590> now

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
this partner strike elbow and now

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.440 
this partner strike elbow and now
strikeout<00:02:42.280> was<00:02:42.489> really<00:02:42.730> hard<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.150> do<00:02:43.239> anything

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
strikeout was really hard to do anything

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.479 
strikeout was really hard to do anything
with<00:02:43.630> strike<00:02:43.840> elbow<00:02:44.230> because<00:02:44.739> much<00:02:45.070> of<00:02:45.100> a

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
with strike elbow because much of a

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.610 
with strike elbow because much of a
double<00:02:45.790> hit<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.150> God<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.930> come<00:02:47.170> back<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:48.400> again

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
double hit is God to come back so again

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.940 
double hit is God to come back so again
