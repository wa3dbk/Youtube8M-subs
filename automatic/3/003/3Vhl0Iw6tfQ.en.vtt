00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello friends with you constantin earlier on 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.150
 channel overclocking 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.240
 we carried out instrumental measurements 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.730
 ford focus 2 generation with a motor of 2 liters 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.520
 EU motor 1 6 liters to this company 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.070
 version 18 is asking for this form 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.860
 measure today overclocking dynamics 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.110
 as usual la sticheness also 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.770
 check how deteriorating the dynamics 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.059
 overclocking with air conditioning turned on and so 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.670
 motor 18 is structurally close 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.609
 the two-liter engine here is also a chain 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.379
 Drive timing is the same compression ratio and 10 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:47.640
 8 differences only in the diameter of the cylinder but 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.890
 according to the characteristics of power 125 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.839
 horsepower torque 165 engine 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.059
 closer still to version 16 because 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.579
 here since the two-liter no 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.929
 variable valve timing here 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.269
 ford focus sedan 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:04.170
 wheels are factory 195 65 r15 two 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.360
 human salon 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.360
 19 degrees overboard 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.650
 starting from the ground as an entity we will include 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.040
 I managed to write off and right away I want 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.040
 to try 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.909
 if a 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:55.950
 so we look at the result from 0 to 50 38 from 0 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:02:01.679
 to 111 5 to 150 twenty five and three 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.679
 402 meters 18 and 0 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:54.280
 watch the result from 0 to 53 seconds to 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.100
 111 0 that is, here we are three tenths 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.880
 played here five-tenths played so 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:07.890
 to 150 2504 100 meters now look 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.890
 402 even meters by two meters 17 7 seconds 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.080
 so friends that we have 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.840
 blog results got interesting 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.300
 interesting because they are 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.900
 Acceleration to 100 is exactly the same as that 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.560
 versions 16 11 0 both there and there until 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.340
 Fifty -two seconds better than 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.090
 mercedes 625 against 27 seconds but 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.290
 two-liter focus away there 23 to 159 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.590
 and 7 to 100 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.850
 that is, the conclusion can be drawn such that 18 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.390
 liter version if not to say 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.250
 but she rides exactly the same as 1 and 6 she 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.130
 a bit heavier by the way than 1 6 liter 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.040
 focus but still energy supply 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.430
 here 97 michelin and all there 92 horse 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.220
 strength 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.470
 let's see what shows 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.810
 elasticity can be there 1 8 liter 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.810
 still get back in front of 1 out of 6 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.350
 elasticity measurement 80 120 min on the fifth 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.350
 transfer 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.920
 3000 and we have a stopper from spoons 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.370
 23,750 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.060
 80 120 for 5 14 0 seconds 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.819
 now at 4 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.830
 4100 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.460
 we have 45 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.050
 so 6280 120 in third gear 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.060
 but 3 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.060
 now 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.190
 60100 7 and 2 80100 2077 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.900
 and 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.900
 so 3070 by 3 before the transfer 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.460
 so the result is 3070 for 3 7 and 6 seconds 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.680
 from 3070 to 2 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.510
 so 3070 for 2 5 0 seconds 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:14.030
 so friends from 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:18.150
 from elasticity surprised 80 120 differences with 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:20.580
 1 and 6 liter 14 seconds versus 20 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.710
 seconds here 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.140
 Gears on numbers are the same as on one of 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.300
 6 i.e. fifth gear short as on 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.970
 one of 6 is shorter than the two-liter 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.640
 due to this 14 seconds it seemed 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:37.280
 even better than the two-liter showed 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:40.410
 focus on longer 5 but than 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.620
 gear lower and higher respectively 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.710
 the momentum is leveled the greater the difference 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.060
 between 1 and 6 liter and 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.620
 18 meter version that is, it speaks of 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:54.720
 the fact that the engine 18 at high speeds 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.910
 rides about the same as 1 of 6 but on 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.130
 low shows just jealous 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.560
 elasticity is very good traction with low 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.300
 turnovers on this i want with you 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.710
 say goodbye friends with you was constantin 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.710
 to meet in overclocking
