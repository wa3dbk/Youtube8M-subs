00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.770 

and<00:00:37.620> yet<00:00:38.620> splattered<00:00:39.309> by<00:00:39.610> it<00:00:39.670> and<00:00:40.149> it<00:00:40.360> says<00:00:40.600> I

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
and yet splattered by it and it says I

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.330 
and yet splattered by it and it says I
splattered<00:00:41.350> him<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.969> also<00:00:43.239> fun<00:00:43.449> part<00:00:43.780> is

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
splattered him and the also fun part is

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.430 
splattered him and the also fun part is
knowledge<00:00:45.340> TLC<00:00:45.820> is<00:00:46.090> that<00:00:46.690> you<00:00:47.019> can<00:00:47.170> just<00:00:47.350> keep

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
knowledge TLC is that you can just keep

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.160 
knowledge TLC is that you can just keep
going<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.879> that's<00:00:49.149> why<00:00:49.360> we<00:00:49.540> put<00:00:49.750> all<00:00:50.019> the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
going so that's why we put all the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.780 
going so that's why we put all the
equipment<00:00:50.680> in<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:50.949> mongooses<00:00:51.519> and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
equipment in the mongooses and

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.060 
equipment in the mongooses and
flamethrowers<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.620> everything<00:00:53.920> else

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
flamethrowers and everything else

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.680 
flamethrowers and everything else
because<00:00:54.370> it's<00:00:54.519> a<00:00:54.610> lot<00:00:54.760> of<00:00:54.879> fun<00:00:55.059> just<00:00:55.360> going

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
because it's a lot of fun just going

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.470 
because it's a lot of fun just going
back<00:00:56.019> and<00:00:56.079> forth

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
back and forth

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.520 

could<00:00:59.480> you<00:00:59.570> actually<00:00:59.870> might<00:01:00.050> hit<00:01:00.230> someone

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
could you actually might hit someone

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.180 
could you actually might hit someone
with<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.800> Mongoose<00:01:01.280> never<00:01:02.210> now

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.920 

and

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.930 

and<00:01:10.260> sometimes<00:01:10.980> you'll<00:01:11.160> mess<00:01:11.370> up<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.730> that's

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
and sometimes you'll mess up but that's

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.390 
and sometimes you'll mess up but that's
when<00:01:12.120> you<00:01:12.300> just<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:13.110> whatever<00:01:13.400> but

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
when you just get out or whatever but

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.000 
when you just get out or whatever but
you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.910> also<00:01:15.060> throw<00:01:15.360> radar<00:01:16.050> jammers<00:01:16.530> belt

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
it'll all show up on the other side well

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.710 
it'll all show up on the other side well
most<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.720> will

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.510 

see<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.680> then<00:01:30.800> you<00:01:30.860> can<00:01:31.130> do<00:01:31.280> like<00:01:31.460> a

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
see and then you can do like a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.780 
see and then you can do like a
protection<00:01:31.970> thing

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.580 

and<00:01:35.300> there's<00:01:35.480> other<00:01:35.630> one<00:01:36.020> thing<00:01:36.290> that<00:01:36.410> you<00:01:36.500> can

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
and there's other one thing that you can

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.110 
and there's other one thing that you can
do<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:36.920> can<00:01:37.070> make<00:01:37.280> make<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.520> whole<00:01:37.790> bunch<00:01:38.000> of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
do you can make make a whole bunch of

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.240 
do you can make make a whole bunch of
traps<00:01:38.390> by<00:01:38.690> putting<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.260> lot<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:41.950> landmines<00:01:42.950> in

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
traps by putting a lot of landmines in

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.160 
traps by putting a lot of landmines in
there

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
there

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.219 
there
and<00:01:45.619> then<00:01:45.950> it's<00:01:46.250> pretty<00:01:46.820> much<00:01:46.939> ego<00:01:47.900> in<00:01:48.049> there

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
and then it's pretty much ego in there

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.320 
and then it's pretty much ego in there
you're<00:01:48.439> dead<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.549> course<00:01:52.610> Tyler's<00:01:53.180> going

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
and then there's a I turret that I'm

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.310 
and then there's a I turret that I'm
going<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.670> place<00:02:59.910> right<00:03:00.210> here<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:01.140> tie

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
going to place right here and tie

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.420 
going to place right here and tie
there's<00:03:01.560> going<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.740> come<00:03:01.770> over<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.370> side

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
there's going to come over on this side

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.110 
there's going to come over on this side
and<00:03:02.760> get<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.180> it

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120

so just place a machine gun turret

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.589 
so just place a machine gun turret
doesn't<00:03:08.340> matter<00:03:08.459> which<00:03:08.640> way<00:03:08.819> it's<00:03:08.970> facing<00:03:09.450> let

you pick it up you just put in the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.520 
you pick it up you just put in the
gravity<00:03:21.209> lift<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.540> let<00:03:21.629> go<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:22.349> may<00:03:22.500> look

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
gravity lift and let go it may look

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.940 
gravity lift and let go it may look
normal<00:03:23.030> but<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.150> isn't<00:03:24.620> sunny<00:03:25.620> starts

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
normal but it isn't sunny starts

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.750 
normal but it isn't sunny starts
spinning<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:27.560> that's<00:03:28.560> what<00:03:28.709> matters

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.179

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.750 

and<00:03:39.550> it's<00:03:40.550> a<00:03:40.730> lot<00:03:41.170> maybe<00:03:42.170> easier<00:03:42.770> they<00:03:43.129> could

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
and it's a lot maybe easier they could

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.089 
and it's a lot maybe easier they could
have<00:03:43.849> to<00:03:44.060> flame<00:03:44.300> throwers<00:03:44.780> /<00:03:44.989> map<00:03:45.200> because<00:03:45.620> i

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
have to flame throwers / map because i
