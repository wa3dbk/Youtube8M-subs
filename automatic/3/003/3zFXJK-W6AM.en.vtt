game actually had a couple of problems
especially<00:00:41.059> positioning<00:00:41.960> a<00:00:42.139> lot<00:00:42.469> of<00:00:42.589> times

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
especially positioning a lot of times

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.289 
especially positioning a lot of times
people<00:00:42.889> would<00:00:43.069> stand<00:00:43.399> still<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.909> could<00:00:44.059> drive

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:44.299 
people would stand still you could drive

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:45.819 
people would stand still you could drive
through<00:00:44.539> the<00:00:44.629> lane<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:45.049> the<00:00:45.079> basket<00:00:45.170> without

through the lane to the basket without
even<00:00:46.129> being<00:00:46.249> contested<00:00:46.909> this<00:00:47.719> time<00:00:48.019> around

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
even being contested this time around

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.199 
even being contested this time around
you<00:00:48.499> actually<00:00:48.829> find<00:00:49.069> player<00:00:49.370> sliding<00:00:49.819> to

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:50.209 
you actually find player sliding to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:52.180 
you actually find player sliding to
actually<00:00:50.539> do<00:00:51.319> their<00:00:51.499> assignments<00:00:51.979> or<00:00:52.069> their

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
actually do their assignments or their

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.069 
actually do their assignments or their
checks<00:00:52.489> people<00:00:53.209> will<00:00:53.299> contest<00:00:53.719> you<00:00:53.869> if<00:00:53.989> you

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
checks people will contest you if you

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.449 
checks people will contest you if you
try<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:54.379> drive<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.679> open<00:00:54.889> lane<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:55.369> they'll

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:55.459 
try and drive the open lane and they'll

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:56.859 
try and drive the open lane and they'll
actually<00:00:55.609> change<00:00:56.089> their<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:56.479> their<00:00:56.600> tactics

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:56.869 
actually change their to their tactics

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:58.989 
actually change their to their tactics
so<00:00:57.319> you<00:00:57.709> have<00:00:57.889> to<00:00:58.039> sometimes<00:00:58.249> dish<00:00:58.639> out<00:00:58.789> to<00:00:58.819> the

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:58.999 
so you have to sometimes dish out to the

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:00.879 
so you have to sometimes dish out to the
perimeter<00:00:59.239> if<00:00:59.629> somebody<00:01:00.260> is<00:01:00.440> playing<00:01:00.739> you

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:00.889 
perimeter if somebody is playing you

really<00:01:01.129> close<00:01:01.369> on<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:01.729> other<00:01:01.909> side<00:01:02.179> another

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
really close on the other side another

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.749 
really close on the other side another
changes<00:01:03.469> for<00:01:03.649> me<00:01:03.769> it<00:01:03.889> is<00:01:04.010> in<00:01:04.219> the<00:01:04.369> shooting

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
changes for me it is in the shooting

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.520 
changes for me it is in the shooting
mechanic<00:01:05.210> now<00:01:05.539> the<00:01:05.600> visuals<00:01:06.049> of<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.200> shooting

mechanic<00:01:06.890> haven't<00:01:07.189> changed<00:01:07.520> still<00:01:07.820> has<00:01:07.969> the

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
mechanic haven't changed still has the

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.849

shot but the timing of the mechanic has

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.840 
shot but the timing of the mechanic has
actually<00:01:12.409> been<00:01:12.560> improved<00:01:13.009> you<00:01:13.399> now<00:01:13.549> have<00:01:13.729> to

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
actually been improved you now have to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.969 
actually been improved you now have to
anticipate<00:01:14.469> pressing<00:01:15.469> the<00:01:15.560> button<00:01:15.829> to

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
anticipate pressing the button to

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.459 
anticipate pressing the button to

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
accelerate the meter along the the color

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.770 
accelerate the meter along the the color
path<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.100> if<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:19.460> wind<00:01:19.820> up<00:01:19.909> using<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:20.570> same

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
path and if you wind up using the same

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.779 
path and if you wind up using the same
timing<00:01:21.259> for<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.469> ps2<00:01:21.740> version<00:01:21.890> for<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.460> ps3

you're<00:01:23.479> gonna<00:01:23.600> miss<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.170> lot<00:01:24.469> of<00:01:24.530> shots<00:01:24.920> and

you're gonna miss a lot of shots and

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.349 
you're gonna miss a lot of shots and
wind<00:01:25.369> up<00:01:25.460> having<00:01:25.609> to<00:01:25.850> play<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.090> lot<00:01:26.329> more

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
wind up having to play a lot more

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:29.440 
wind up having to play a lot more
defense<00:01:27.049> than<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.320> anticipated<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.070> MBO<00:01:28.999> 7

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
defense than you anticipated it MBO 7

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
the most part you're gonna want to rely

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.819 
the most part you're gonna want to rely

on that right analog thumb stick because

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.200 
on that right analog thumb stick because
they<00:01:39.979> don't<00:01:40.130> have<00:01:40.219> the<00:01:40.490> sensitivity<00:01:40.880> that

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
they don't have the sensitivity that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.270 
they don't have the sensitivity that
you'd<00:01:41.359> like<00:01:41.570> spins<00:01:42.439> on<00:01:42.679> the<00:01:42.799> other<00:01:42.950> hand

you'd like spins on the other hand

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.679 
you'd like spins on the other hand
actually<00:01:43.490> makes<00:01:43.909> you<00:01:43.999> feel<00:01:44.210> like<00:01:44.359> you're<00:01:44.539> on
