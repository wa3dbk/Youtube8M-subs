00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
what's left is hold on a second now

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.830 
what's left is hold on a second now
what's<00:04:28.500> left<00:04:28.620> as<00:04:29.160> a<00:04:29.190> wada<00:04:30.150> copper<00:04:33.950> actually

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
what's left as a wada copper actually

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.110 
what's left as a wada copper actually
this<00:04:36.840> this<00:04:37.380> isn't<00:04:37.830> copper<00:04:38.310> this<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.670> actually

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
this this isn't copper this is actually

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.830 
this this isn't copper this is actually
steal<00:04:40.430> computer<00:04:41.430> wiring<00:04:42.320> all<00:04:43.320> right<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:44.840> then

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
steal computer wiring all right and then

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.410 
steal computer wiring all right and then
we<00:04:46.260> got<00:04:47.210> still<00:04:48.210> in<00:04:48.600> here<00:04:49.820> you<00:04:50.820> got<00:04:51.000> a<00:04:51.030> couple

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
we got still in here you got a couple

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.550 
we got still in here you got a couple
aluminum<00:04:52.290> heat<00:04:52.500> sinks<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.720> then<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:55.410> little

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
aluminum heat sinks and then a little

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.850 
aluminum heat sinks and then a little
bit<00:04:56.250> more<00:04:56.460> copper<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.270> then<00:04:58.200> a<00:04:58.230> low-grade

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
bit more copper and then a low-grade

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.400 
bit more copper and then a low-grade
board<00:04:59.280> which<00:04:59.880> I<00:05:00.150> only<00:05:00.330> get<00:05:00.600> five<00:05:00.630> cents<00:05:01.320> a

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
board which I only get five cents a

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.650 
board which I only get five cents a
pound<00:05:01.560> for<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:01.980> little<00:05:02.190> gray<00:05:02.340> boards<00:05:02.880> so

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
pound for the little gray boards so

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.020 
pound for the little gray boards so
they're<00:05:03.840> not<00:05:03.990> worth<00:05:04.230> of<00:05:04.520> all<00:05:05.520> right<00:05:07.790> let's<00:05:08.790> see

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
they're not worth of all right let's see

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.610 
they're not worth of all right let's see
what<00:05:09.240> else<00:05:09.270> I<00:05:09.660> can<00:05:09.690> join<00:05:10.050> nick<00:05:11.630> so<00:05:12.630> far<00:05:13.020> this<00:05:13.290> I

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
what else I can join nick so far this I

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.650 
what else I can join nick so far this I
found<00:05:14.160> three<00:05:14.550> screws<00:05:15.120> holding<00:05:15.630> us<00:05:15.840> in

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:30.450 

I<00:05:26.210> don't<00:05:27.210> know

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.689 

let's<00:05:31.460> try<00:05:31.909> this<00:05:32.560> there's<00:05:33.560> some<00:05:33.860> wires<00:05:34.129> going

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
let's try this there's some wires going

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:40.089 
let's try this there's some wires going
from<00:05:35.120> the<00:05:35.300> board<00:05:35.659> to<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:38.409> you<00:05:39.409> know<00:05:39.560> metal

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
from the board to the you know metal

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.300 
from the board to the you know metal
housing<00:05:40.550> so<00:05:41.360> I'm<00:05:42.169> thinking<00:05:42.680> maybe<00:05:42.860> that's

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
housing so I'm thinking maybe that's

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.929 
housing so I'm thinking maybe that's
holding<00:05:44.300> it<00:05:44.419> in<00:05:44.919> so<00:05:45.919> I'll<00:05:46.039> take<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.430> flat<00:05:46.699> head

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:46.939 
holding it in so I'll take the flat head

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.809 
holding it in so I'll take the flat head
screwdriver<00:05:47.680> and<00:05:48.680> i'm<00:05:48.889> just<00:05:49.039> going<00:05:49.159> to<00:05:49.310> jam<00:05:49.580> it

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:49.819 
screwdriver and i'm just going to jam it

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:52.390 
screwdriver and i'm just going to jam it
in<00:05:49.939> there<00:05:50.120> and<00:05:50.180> pry<00:05:51.139> up<00:05:51.169> and<00:05:51.770> see<00:05:52.009> what<00:05:52.219> i<00:05:52.340> can

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
in there and pry up and see what i can

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:02.649 
in there and pry up and see what i can
find<00:05:56.620> later<00:05:57.620> we<00:05:57.830> don't<00:05:59.800> all<00:06:00.800> right<00:06:01.009> now<00:06:01.659> you

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
find later we don't all right now you

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.830 
find later we don't all right now you
got<00:06:02.840> your<00:06:03.310> casing<00:06:04.310> this<00:06:04.759> is<00:06:04.939> just<00:06:05.150> metal<00:06:05.539> throw

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
got your casing this is just metal throw

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.689 
got your casing this is just metal throw
it<00:06:05.960> in<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.139> scrap<00:06:06.500> bin<00:06:06.879> and<00:06:08.590> then<00:06:09.590> you<00:06:10.310> got<00:06:10.490> you

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
it in the scrap bin and then you got you

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:15.580 
it in the scrap bin and then you got you
bored<00:06:11.029> with<00:06:11.719> your<00:06:12.020> aluminum<00:06:12.919> heat<00:06:13.400> sinks<00:06:14.590> now

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
bored with your aluminum heat sinks now

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:22.110 
bored with your aluminum heat sinks now
to<00:06:16.430> get<00:06:16.580> the<00:06:16.789> heat<00:06:17.000> sinks<00:06:17.449> off<00:06:17.689> I<00:06:19.389> guess<00:06:20.389> just

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
to get the heat sinks off I guess just

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:31.940 
to get the heat sinks off I guess just
break<00:06:23.120> them

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.760 

well<00:06:32.950> that<00:06:33.250> don't<00:06:33.460> work<00:06:33.700> out<00:06:33.880> as<00:06:34.120> planned<00:06:34.770> all

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
well that don't work out as planned all

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.530 
well that don't work out as planned all
right<00:06:36.300> but<00:06:37.300> yeah<00:06:37.930> you<00:06:37.990> get<00:06:38.410> the<00:06:38.590> point<00:06:39.540> yeah

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
right but yeah you get the point yeah

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.360 
right but yeah you get the point yeah
what<00:06:40.870> you<00:06:40.990> need<00:06:41.200> to<00:06:41.320> do<00:06:41.470> is<00:06:41.500> take<00:06:41.950> one<00:06:42.130> of<00:06:42.250> them

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
what you need to do is take one of them

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.390 
what you need to do is take one of them
sold<00:06:42.730> airing<00:06:43.090> guns<00:06:43.330> and<00:06:43.900> just<00:06:44.860> solder<00:06:45.370> that

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
sold airing guns and just solder that

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.570 
sold airing guns and just solder that
off<00:06:45.820> and<00:06:46.530> then<00:06:47.530> the<00:06:47.680> aluminum<00:06:48.130> will<00:06:48.250> come<00:06:48.430> out

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
off and then the aluminum will come out

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.850 
off and then the aluminum will come out
otherwise<00:06:49.360> you<00:06:49.720> can<00:06:49.870> just<00:06:49.900> take<00:06:50.260> a<00:06:50.290> really<00:06:50.560> big

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
otherwise you can just take a really big

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.370 
otherwise you can just take a really big
hammer<00:06:51.190> to<00:06:51.580> it<00:06:51.610> and<00:06:51.880> break<00:06:52.180> it<00:06:52.440> so<00:06:55.110> it<00:06:56.110> just

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
hammer to it and break it so it just

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.310 
hammer to it and break it so it just
took<00:06:56.560> me<00:06:56.770> about<00:06:57.010> nine<00:06:57.550> minutes<00:06:57.910> to<00:06:58.900> do<00:06:59.080> this

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
took me about nine minutes to do this

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.210 
took me about nine minutes to do this
and<00:07:01.290> you<00:07:02.290> know<00:07:02.410> I've<00:07:02.500> never<00:07:02.680> done<00:07:02.950> it<00:07:03.100> before

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
and you know I've never done it before

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.950 
and you know I've never done it before
if<00:07:03.640> you<00:07:03.790> know<00:07:03.910> how<00:07:04.090> to<00:07:04.120> do<00:07:04.390> it<00:07:04.570> then<00:07:04.750> it<00:07:04.870> will

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
if you know how to do it then it will

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.890 
if you know how to do it then it will
probably<00:07:05.170> take<00:07:05.350> three<00:07:05.800> or<00:07:05.950> four<00:07:06.220> minutes<00:07:06.900> and

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
probably take three or four minutes and

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.640
