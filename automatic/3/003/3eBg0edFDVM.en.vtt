00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:21.920
 good morning today with this video vi 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:26.529
 I want to present an ancient system for 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.820
 make popular ones by hand then these 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.399
 small objects 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.260
 it is also called Terinese and allow for 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.530
 make moral virtue with the blades a little 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.530
 big and we can make them do too 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.260
 children because it is a very simple thing 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.910
 and now we show you how to do it 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.880
 inside the package we have 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:52.310
 several pieces the base of the small caterinetta la 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.880
 part that goes upstairs to work 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.460
 a long wool needle and a hook that 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.660
 serves to move the woman there now 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.660
 ai mountain was read 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.030
 these are the four pieces that 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.670
 make up the caterinetta the base this 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.640
 flown where obviously will pass the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.460
 the tubular wool the base above this is 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.280
 the cat feeds bigger and therefore 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.560
 we'll make a bigger tube go 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.330
 inserted in this point this and not 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.240
 chino is this a nago that can serve 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:37.720
 then to work then we start 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:42.000
 inserting a wool thread inside and 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:47.140
 we hold it with the hand below 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.060
 we turn the wool this way that 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.900
 around the teeth making movement 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:02:00.150
 circular we turn neither caterinetta e 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.150
 we get to the starting point 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.479
 we lower the points 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:14.100
 we repeat second of all on all 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:18.590
 teeth in this way always pulling the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.590
 caterinetta and turning around the born 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.130
 circular movement 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:33.470
 on all teeth have 2 points then 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:36.070
 began to take the point below with 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.070
 crochet it and let it fall over 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.070
 other 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:48.070
 I take it under the pick up step 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.070
 the point above and I drop it when 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:58.490
 point below the face falling over 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:01.180
 the other the same for this is the same 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.180
 for this 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.500
 then again 1 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.450
 which is the beginning one so I'll do it 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.450
 carefully pull up starting 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:18.320
 this is the beginning of my work I 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:23.230
 low I take the thread with which I was 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.600
 working and repeating the same turns 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:32.750
 always with a circular movement around 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:36.860
 to the teeth I do the same thing again 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.300
 takes a point below and I do it 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.300
 slip over first 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.720
 not this way 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.750
 sa times better you block the last one 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.750
 because so thread does not start 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.519
 so here we still have one 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.519
 the work goes down inside this 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:18.180
 caterinetta then I will continue to do 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:21.359
 always the same job to shoot the 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.340
 point the teeth in this way 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.650
 now I'll show you a little cat 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:33.090
 that I had already started here was this 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:36.510
 already a job started earlier and 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.729
 see the tubular that comes out from below 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.210
 sometimes to facilitate the work you can 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.130
 take a weight at the base then points 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.950
 fall better and hold more than one 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.729
 work and in any case here it continues 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:56.700
 always the same way I turn around the 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:59.570
 I take wool and teeth right under with 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.570
 crochet and let it fall over 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.570
 other 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.150
 this is what the people grow 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:28.630
 so this is a nice cord of one 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.670
 the caterinetta also exists 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.850
 slightly smaller to always do 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:37.330
 tubular by hand with more wool 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:42.160
 subtle of this is the procedure 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.860
 however it looks like this from the and catherine 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.840
 body so in plastic are found 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.979
 in my wedding merchandise comes in 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:54.280
 our streamers may also have 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:57.340
 other sizes also wood colors 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.500
 I know of all of them 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.960
 types and is a fast system for making i 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.960
 cordoni thanks and have a nice day
