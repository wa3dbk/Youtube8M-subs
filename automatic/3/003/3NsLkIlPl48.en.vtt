00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
think he did that good of a job but i

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.659 
think he did that good of a job but i
think<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.500> was<00:05:29.560> almost<00:05:29.710> like<00:05:29.889> he<00:05:30.070> was<00:05:30.190> too<00:05:30.430> tall

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
think it was almost like he was too tall

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.300 
think it was almost like he was too tall

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
many moments where you could tell that

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.969 
many moments where you could tell that
he<00:05:36.250> was<00:05:36.419> figuring<00:05:37.419> out<00:05:37.600> how<00:05:38.110> to<00:05:38.140> pick<00:05:38.680> her<00:05:38.830> up
