00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.690 
could be very useful and you can plot
them<00:01:48.509> route<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.320> then<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.040> could<00:01:50.220> decide<00:01:50.520> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
them route and then you could decide to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.219 
them route and then you could decide to
say<00:01:50.850> let's<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.299> biking<00:01:52.140> directions<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:54.229> then

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
say let's do biking directions and then

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.020 
say let's do biking directions and then
go<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.610> will<00:01:56.670> give<00:01:56.850> us<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
go and we can see it will give us the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.230 
go and we can see it will give us the
full<00:01:57.420> directions<00:01:57.860> here<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:02:00.030> in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
full directions here and you can in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
full directions here and you can in
addition<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.750> go<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.380> map<00:02:02.250> view<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:03.860> see

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
addition to that go to map view and see

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.059 
addition to that go to map view and see
the<00:02:04.950> map<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.399> now<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.640> last<00:02:06.090> button<00:02:06.509> over<00:02:06.810> here

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
the map so now the last button over here

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.710 
the map so now the last button over here
it<00:02:08.069> allows<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.420> various
