the parts for the big masks on the right
they're<00:02:07.740> cut<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.610> all<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> way<00:02:08.940> around<00:02:09.360> it

slots cut them a little small and then

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.110 
slots cut them a little small and then
test<00:02:16.440> them<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.650> make<00:02:16.740> sure<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.250> put<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:17.970> up<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
out I'm okay and adjust them a little

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.750 
out I'm okay and adjust them a little
bit<00:02:21.600> if<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.720> need<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.280> if<00:02:23.280> you're<00:02:23.489> gonna<00:02:23.580> hang

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
bit if you need to if you're gonna hang

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.890 
bit if you need to if you're gonna hang
it<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:23.970> wall<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.270> don't<00:02:24.390> have<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.690> adjust

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
it on the wall you don't have to adjust

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.699 
it on the wall you don't have to adjust
them<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.980> now<00:02:26.100> put<00:02:26.640> two<00:02:26.850> make<00:02:27.510> two<00:02:27.660> balls<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.050> of

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
them so now put two make two balls of of

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.430 
them so now put two make two balls of of
newspaper<00:02:29.459> or<00:02:29.790> tape<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.569> do<00:02:31.020> them<00:02:31.140> like<00:02:31.230> this

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
newspaper or tape and do them like this

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.930 
newspaper or tape and do them like this
this<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.069> kind<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.280> important<00:02:32.700> because

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
this is kind of important because

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.750 
this is kind of important because
getting<00:02:33.420> those<00:02:33.690> nice<00:02:34.170> rounded<00:02:34.709> eye<00:02:35.040> holes<00:02:35.340> a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
getting those nice rounded eye holes a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.550 
getting those nice rounded eye holes a
little<00:02:36.180> bit<00:02:36.390> tricky<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.200> what<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> did

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
little bit tricky and this is what I did

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.160 
little bit tricky and this is what I did
it<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.980> put<00:02:38.459> down<00:02:38.580> two<00:02:39.180> balls<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.570> newspaper

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
it I put down two balls of newspaper

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.229 
it I put down two balls of newspaper
that's<00:02:41.160> kind<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.550> base<00:02:41.760> for<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.120> whole

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
that's kind of like a base for the whole

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.400 
that's kind of like a base for the whole
thing<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.480> work<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.780> we're<00:02:43.050> gonna<00:02:43.140> make<00:02:43.320> the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
thing you work on we're gonna make the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.550 
thing you work on we're gonna make the
whole<00:02:43.500> mask<00:02:43.709> right<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.070> top<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:46.380> then

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
whole mask right on top of this and then

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.430 
whole mask right on top of this and then
flesh<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.519> all<00:02:47.640> out<00:02:47.880> with<00:02:48.540> crumpled<00:02:49.019> balls<00:02:49.260> of

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
flesh it all out with crumpled balls of

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.410 
flesh it all out with crumpled balls of
newspaper<00:02:49.830> or<00:02:50.130> paper<00:02:50.280> or<00:02:50.610> anything<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.150> this

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
newspaper or paper or anything like this

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.900 
newspaper or paper or anything like this
and<00:02:51.780> you'll<00:02:52.110> see<00:02:52.260> how<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.470> get<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.819> know

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
and you'll see how I get it you know

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.040 
and you'll see how I get it you know
just<00:02:54.120> flush<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.330> all<00:02:54.480> out<00:02:54.630> it's<00:02:54.750> kind<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.930> like

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
just flush it all out it's kind of like

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.330 
just flush it all out it's kind of like
a<00:02:55.110> flattened<00:02:55.470> Aspen<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.160> pay<00:02:56.310> attention

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
a flattened Aspen but pay attention

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.220 
a flattened Aspen but pay attention
around<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.000> eye<00:02:57.060> holes<00:02:57.360> I'll<00:02:57.959> show<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.200> little

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
around the eye holes I'll show a little

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.580 
around the eye holes I'll show a little
bit<00:02:58.410> more<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.830> little<00:02:58.950> bit<00:02:59.100> later<00:03:00.590> I'll

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
bit more of that a little bit later I'll

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.830 
bit more of that a little bit later I'll
take<00:03:01.769> your<00:03:01.890> time<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:06.330> know<00:03:06.360> more<00:03:06.630> tape

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
take your time you know more tape

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.990 
take your time you know more tape
eventually<00:03:07.829> almost<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.280> whole<00:03:08.370> mask<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.820> just

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
eventually almost the whole mask is just

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.850 
eventually almost the whole mask is just
pretty<00:03:09.120> much<00:03:09.209> taped<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.620> get<00:03:10.739> the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
pretty much taped so you can get the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.289 
pretty much taped so you can get the
shape<00:03:11.070> nice<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.459> try<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.730> out<00:03:14.940> put<00:03:15.269> your

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
shape nice so you try it out put your

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.390 
shape nice so you try it out put your
extra<00:03:15.930> piece<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.410> there<00:03:16.650> like<00:03:16.829> this<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.250> see

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
extra piece on there like this to see

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.020 
extra piece on there like this to see
what<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:17.610> looks<00:03:17.790> like

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
what it looks like

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.870 
what it looks like
adjust<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.989> as<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.200> need<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.530> started<00:03:20.160> like

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
adjust it as you need it started like

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.990 
adjust it as you need it started like
that<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:23.519> wanted<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.790> show<00:03:23.940> you

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
inside those eye sockets so a little bit

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.560 
inside those eye sockets so a little bit
tricky<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.310> know<00:03:26.340> use<00:03:26.579> small<00:03:26.820> pieces<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.480> a

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570
