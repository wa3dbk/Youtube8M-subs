00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
one of these ah there she is

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.260 
one of these ah there she is
High<00:05:00.919> Priestess<00:05:01.550> has<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.390> Pernell<00:05:03.550> so<00:05:04.550> anyway

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
High Priestess has the Pernell so anyway

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.610 
High Priestess has the Pernell so anyway
yeah<00:05:05.390> there's<00:05:05.600> a<00:05:05.660> lot<00:05:05.810> of<00:05:05.930> symbolism<00:05:06.290> there's

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
yeah there's a lot of symbolism there's

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.800 
yeah there's a lot of symbolism there's
a<00:05:06.680> lot<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:06.950> animals<00:05:07.400> like<00:05:07.640> there's<00:05:08.120> fish<00:05:08.419> and

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
a lot of animals like there's fish and

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.950 
a lot of animals like there's fish and
foxes<00:05:09.560> and<00:05:10.010> butterflies<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:13.630> owls<00:05:14.630> and

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
foxes and butterflies and owls and

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.780 
foxes and butterflies and owls and
turtles<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.740> so<00:05:16.160> it<00:05:16.280> seems<00:05:16.490> like<00:05:16.610> the

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
turtles and so it seems like the

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.400 
turtles and so it seems like the
symbolism<00:05:17.240> that<00:05:17.540> you<00:05:17.630> could<00:05:17.810> pick<00:05:17.930> up<00:05:18.080> off<00:05:18.260> of

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
symbolism that you could pick up off of

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.670 
symbolism that you could pick up off of
these<00:05:18.560> cards<00:05:18.950> would<00:05:19.160> just<00:05:19.400> be<00:05:20.140> outstanding<00:05:21.140> as

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
these cards would just be outstanding as

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.860 
these cards would just be outstanding as
opposed<00:05:22.220> to<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.669> other<00:05:22.850> ones<00:05:23.120> which<00:05:23.540> I'm<00:05:23.780> not

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
opposed to the other ones which I'm not

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.940 
opposed to the other ones which I'm not
saying<00:05:24.080> that<00:05:24.260> there's<00:05:24.440> not<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.650> lot<00:05:24.919> of

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
saying that there's not a lot of

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.180 
saying that there's not a lot of
symbolism<00:05:25.400> in<00:05:25.669> them<00:05:25.790> but<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:27.740> color<00:05:27.980> is<00:05:28.160> a

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
symbolism in them but the color is a

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.159 
symbolism in them but the color is a
very<00:05:28.460> monotone<00:05:28.790> you<00:05:29.270> know<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.570> faces<00:05:29.990> like<00:05:30.140> I
