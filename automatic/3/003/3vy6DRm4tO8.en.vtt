00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:22.130
 yes very often overlooked now this year is CDU today is the first yellow 

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:23.349
 Wearing a jersey 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:24.470
 in the area 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.150
 let's leave the gates I had a court in New York and I did 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.319
 actually that I start a new series 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.700
 he% of Hechinger um 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.340
 to gain the knowledge with let there be in the 1 the theater 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.030
 the Dillinger I'll add in the description I'll do some 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.370
 have asked 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 refute mostly offers both that can do 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.340
 and yes pretty much the same cash register come to know the class already out 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.840
 the intuition 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.620
 I have a lot more or less 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.070
 they come 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.010
 that's why i'm always short so i'm playing here a team deathmatch purchase 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.170
 deen de 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.240
 with the MP 5 k or in the FIFA 11 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.840
 Asked about the smelting fire was a sect of the injured 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.070
 all over 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.370
 so Kuster utilization I've played with the SENSEX with the just around 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.150
 Mini dress measurement 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.960
 and my practice was, I believe lightweight 9 9 attacks 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.590
 I've never played this constellation myself 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.710
 and her husband little Feli digestible I shot and shot him 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.480
 Year involved come 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.480
 further processed Mackie knife visited more time 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.490
 Trier yes counted dead I played and were towed 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.860
 with the Cobra and with percent not only the best "We are 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.780
 no longer the best choice Wagner 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.380
 because the product is protected I had been bad but the crown of the more 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.249
 Love 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.000
 Königssee where the opponents are 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.020
 and the way with Netscape Rommel r cup before Saladin went stupid because I'm on 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.070
 the Copa reached Verde air was polemic but not above 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.180
 but is it really that this value is not committed to 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.629
 I'm not so good at PR there is certainly no own for the rascal 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.950
 and she yes Tepco was still pretty good year I found 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.240
 Not my best but I still wanted the first one as soon as possible 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.159
 Game lives 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.339
 and upload this series 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.399
 and her real through 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:28.540
 so and then 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.399
 Next, I have the break from where it is now cracked 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.449
 Ahlen thinks I've got 5 out there or so I've always looked 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.289
 just a little bit more 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:43.249
 Of course, now some questions Inka Bodmann Stallone will do everything and turn 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.829
 so that first time nothing is too early to be said 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.849
 I invite the training for the first time afterwards with instructions for her 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.060
 and then I will now I want the top earners like Halles 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.219
 percent 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.059
 The highest altitude I've had for so long 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.239
 but to get some car show because it's just too big 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.069
 and I'm still in favor of doing this upload 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.209
 Fertilization all ready 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.409
 where they were still uploading some were already there 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.289
 already Erwin Heyer 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.289
 I would apologize but partly quite big celebration with Meier 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.099
 Ladder us is not the best either 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.099
 but I have found something not program can 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.639
 That's why we were looking forward to the days 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:31.199
 but generally with their knowledge of the class give that was something new 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.989
 to me 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.459
 I have not played LB counterfeit money so much yet 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.689
 I've only pressed most of them at the beginning just for those 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:41.169
 Zotter played previous 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.569
 the statements of the essay so Michelle fire Giegerich good 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.739
 Primar Werner Tigges Ehling Herbst on diversity 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:52.219
 from there court 200 played land on this area out here 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.180
 But I have to say that I sometimes find the straight better than the 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.699
 Delivery is u 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.979
 by Stephan Roth 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.729
 for the TMB counterfeit money a bit better 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:07.309
 I would also be interested in you also someone knows how collected calm 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.559
 Hand stayed finite there better - respect 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.509
 Do not make it yourself just with the hoe pipes with the same 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.429
 less 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:18.739
 Matthias Mauksch wants his ass and some experience 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.870
 with it the Sisters of Life 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.960
 Last year Petrik Sander also okay with me 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.960
 but as I said, went well and build program 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.580
 to do in the market 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.630
 Funny painters point out that here at the blind video leave a number 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:38.830
 should be between 1 and 5 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.889
 I believe two or three people left on the jump in the first place 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.279
 of the state »is called the number 4 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:48.969
 It should be close to the procedure first 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.529
 then the four are not possible and more easily done annually 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.089
 is not made easy because he has the video already in Appenzell the class 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.120
 alternately warned 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.580
 and yes Bessenich today are video on 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.909
 a load of Hoya's comment 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.360
 about three percent 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.360
 the kind I imagine a place 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.069
 so probably that's what I had so discussed so far 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.199
 There they will not forget 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.379
 I always have to come up with how long the game integrates 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.650
 Remember a minute 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.680
 Weinfelden 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.379
 Pölten bring Landau 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.979
 yes what I want to say I will soon cover a small Senel 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.629
 do 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.899
 I'm going to add a playlist now I do not even know about them 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:42.909
 said in a video 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.639
 but if the kind 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.749
 a plus is again 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:50.159
 and yes I already have some pictures of friends relatives he has 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.740
 Saxon Hirschfelde Photoshop 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.740
 several leaves set amazonas region left 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.620
 and promptly I can say it will of course also here the 4 MS 6 and 7 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.620
 clarify the bite of a bull trap he's got bite 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:06.759
 but 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.229
 that will come out then 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:14.659
 So high were Konrad 4 7 percent before your loud 38 to 6 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:20.110
 I was not completely satisfied because two goals were superfluous but before 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.500
 the 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.449
 Adult costs mostly okay Fonda 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.990
 I hope you like it and see you next time
