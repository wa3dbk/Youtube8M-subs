00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.290 

hey<00:00:02.070> everyone<00:00:02.669> I've<00:00:02.790> been<00:00:02.939> playing<00:00:03.120> around

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hey everyone I've been playing around

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.090 
hey everyone I've been playing around
with<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.629> instant<00:00:04.080> wire<00:00:04.350> and<00:00:04.620> first<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:04.980> all

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
with the instant wire and first of all

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.089 
with the instant wire and first of all
all<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.460> credit<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.910> that<00:00:05.940> has<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.569> go<00:00:06.720> to

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:07.099 
all the credit to that has to go to

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.799 
all the credit to that has to go to
tabby<00:00:08.099> right<00:00:08.370> oh<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.550> shrug<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.300> know<00:00:09.540> there's

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
tabby right oh and shrug I know there's

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.540 
tabby right oh and shrug I know there's
other<00:00:09.960> people<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.380> have<00:00:10.590> worked<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.190> but

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
other people that have worked on it but

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.820 
other people that have worked on it but
they're<00:00:12.240> on<00:00:12.360> my<00:00:12.570> subscriber<00:00:13.110> list<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.679> they

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
they're on my subscriber list so they

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.510 
they're on my subscriber list so they
get<00:00:14.009> all<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> credit<00:00:14.460> that's<00:00:15.299> how<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.509> works

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
get all the credit that's how it works

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.760 
get all the credit that's how it works
so<00:00:17.600> basically<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:18.720> we've<00:00:18.990> done<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.199> adapted

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
so basically all we've done is adapted

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.740 
so basically all we've done is adapted
an<00:00:19.859> old<00:00:20.039> memory<00:00:20.369> unit<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:24.119> reason<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.539> did

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
an old memory unit the the reason I did

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.220 
an old memory unit the the reason I did
this<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:25.080> just<00:00:25.350> because<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.740> was<00:00:25.890> curious<00:00:26.189> and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
this is just because I was curious and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.919 
this is just because I was curious and
the<00:00:28.230> conclusion<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.510> wire<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the conclusion is that it's a wire is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.720 
the conclusion is that it's a wire is
not<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.410> greatest<00:00:31.679> thing<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.279> use<00:00:32.489> from

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
not the greatest thing to use from

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.170 
not the greatest thing to use from
memory<00:00:34.010> for<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> couple<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.309> reasons<00:00:35.489> but

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
memory for a couple of reasons but

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.830 
memory for a couple of reasons but
anyway<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.370> current<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> two<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:39.600> i'm

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
anyway so current we have a two here i'm

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.360 
anyway so current we have a two here i'm
using<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.200> small<00:00:40.469> display<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:41.040> because

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
using a small display just because

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.150 
using a small display just because
there's<00:00:41.550> no<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.420> much<00:00:42.450> delay<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.100> if

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
there's no not as much delay on it so if

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100 
there's no not as much delay on it so if
you<00:00:44.250> write<00:00:44.430> something<00:00:44.730> else<00:00:45.059> it'll<00:00:45.660> show<00:00:45.930> up

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
you write something else it'll show up

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.650 
you write something else it'll show up
and<00:00:46.440> it'll<00:00:46.770> show<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.250> same<00:00:47.390> it<00:00:48.390> will<00:00:48.480> take

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
and it'll show up the same it will take

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.709 
and it'll show up the same it will take
just<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:49.170> much<00:00:49.289> time<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.950> any<00:00:50.390> row<00:00:51.390> here

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
just as much time from any row here

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.880 
just as much time from any row here
which<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.110> great<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:54.110> problems<00:00:55.110> with

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
which is great and the problems with

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.799 
which is great and the problems with
using<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.610> some<00:00:56.820> player<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.360> memory<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
using in some player for memory is

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.020 
using in some player for memory is
mainly<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:01.020> we're<00:01:01.379> only<00:01:01.590> sending<00:01:02.039> single

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
mainly because we're only sending single

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.100 
mainly because we're only sending single
signals<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.549> would<00:01:05.820> plunk<00:01:06.450> down<00:01:06.540> we're

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
signals so if we would plunk down we're

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.070 
signals so if we would plunk down we're
currently<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.220> written<00:01:08.520> down<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.119> so

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
currently have one written down here so

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.830 
currently have one written down here so
if<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.909> just<00:01:11.909> show<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> torch<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
if we just show the torch on one of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.429 
if we just show the torch on one of
these<00:01:12.960> lines<00:01:13.229> right<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:15.110> this<00:01:16.110> will<00:01:16.320> be

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
these lines right and this will be

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.499 
these lines right and this will be
written<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.640> won't<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:17.939> written<00:01:18.330> on

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
written here but it won't be written on

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.270 
written here but it won't be written on
the<00:01:18.780> other<00:01:18.900> ones<00:01:19.110> it'll<00:01:19.380> only<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.799> sent<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the other ones it'll only have sent a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.700 
the other ones it'll only have sent a
signal<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:21.270> means<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> did<00:01:22.200> change<00:01:22.470> to

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
signal which means that it did change to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.710 
signal which means that it did change to
a<00:01:22.740> five<00:01:23.009> now<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:26.850> means<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.689> have

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
a five now but that means that we have

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.109 
a five now but that means that we have
to<00:01:28.880> have<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> way<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.259> catch<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.920> signal<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.970> can

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to have a way to catch the signal we can

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.690 
to have a way to catch the signal we can
do<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.420> through<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.659> various<00:01:34.079> amount<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.439> ways

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
do that through a various amount of ways

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.210 
do that through a various amount of ways
but<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:36.659> will<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.900> an<00:01:36.990> inherit<00:01:37.439> delay<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.950> I

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
but there will be an inherit delay of I

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.240 
but there will be an inherit delay of I
don't<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.520> three<00:01:38.970> or<00:01:39.060> four<00:01:39.360> tix<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.130> then<00:01:41.130> of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
don't know three or four tix and then of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.590 
don't know three or four tix and then of
course<00:01:41.340> well<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> display<00:01:42.390> which

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
course well this is a display which

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.319 
course well this is a display which
means<00:01:42.810> there's<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.229> more<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
means there's going to be more but and

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.780 
means there's going to be more but and
if<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.960> ever<00:01:46.079> want<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:46.710> use<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
if you ever want to actually use the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.170 
if you ever want to actually use the
signal<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.450> much<00:01:48.689> you'd<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.970> save<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
signal for much you'd have to save it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.899 
signal for much you'd have to save it
which<00:01:51.689> means<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.890> only<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.310> useful<00:01:53.790> if

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
which means it's only really useful if

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.510 
which means it's only really useful if
you<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.450> lot<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.320> memory<00:01:55.860> you'd<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
you have a lot of memory you'd have to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.609 
you have a lot of memory you'd have to
have<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.880> know<00:01:56.969> won't<00:01:57.799> so<00:02:00.500> obviously<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
have you know won't so obviously a

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.980 
have you know won't so obviously a
bigger<00:02:02.430> point<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.030> not<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.840> actually

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
bigger point of it is not to actually

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.780 
bigger point of it is not to actually
use<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.829> display<00:02:05.100> something<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
use it to display something like this

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.260 
use it to display something like this
it's<00:02:06.030> use<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:06.659> logic

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
it's use it for logic

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.250 
it's use it for logic
and<00:02:08.590> send<00:02:09.590> signals<00:02:10.010> against<00:02:10.280> each<00:02:10.460> other<00:02:11.260> so

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
and send signals against each other so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.650 
and send signals against each other so
if<00:02:13.070> we<00:02:13.340> look<00:02:13.610> at<00:02:13.700> like<00:02:13.880> these<00:02:14.060> torches<00:02:14.480> right

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
if we look at like these torches right

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.470 
if we look at like these torches right
here<00:02:15.250> these<00:02:16.250> torches<00:02:16.610> will<00:02:16.790> go<00:02:16.970> off<00:02:17.150> one

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
here these torches will go off one

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.750 
here these torches will go off one
signal<00:02:17.990> after<00:02:18.200> this<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.770> red<00:02:19.040> or<00:02:19.310> one<00:02:19.520> tick

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
signal after this is red or one tick

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.660 
signal after this is red or one tick
after<00:02:20.120> it's<00:02:20.240> red<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.890> you'll<00:02:21.890> see<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.250> even

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
after it's red and you'll see that even

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.590 
after it's red and you'll see that even
that<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.330> still<00:02:24.340> way<00:02:25.340> before<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.270> actual

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
that is still way before the actual

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.360 
that is still way before the actual
display<00:02:27.080> pops<00:02:27.350> up<00:02:27.560> because<00:02:27.950> there's<00:02:28.130> about<00:02:28.310> a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
display pops up because there's about a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.520 
display pops up because there's about a
five<00:02:28.670> technically<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:30.250> despite<00:02:32.530> because

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
five technically to the despite because

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.920 
five technically to the despite because
of<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.770> RS<00:02:33.950> nor<00:02:34.070> latch<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:35.330> using<00:02:35.840> it

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
of the RS nor latch it is so using it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.020 
of the RS nor latch it is so using it
from<00:02:36.050> memory<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:37.750> it's<00:02:38.750> okay<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:40.250> does<00:02:40.790> limit

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
from memory and it's okay it does limit

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.180 
from memory and it's okay it does limit
you<00:02:41.300> though<00:02:41.480> because<00:02:41.810> we<00:02:42.170> have<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.860> use<00:02:42.980> this

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
you though because we have to use this

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.310 
you though because we have to use this
ancient<00:02:43.610> technique<00:02:44.300> that<00:02:44.660> I've<00:02:44.780> made<00:02:44.960> you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
ancient technique that I've made you

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.710 
ancient technique that I've made you
know<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.830> month<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:46.580> Africa<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:49.240> with<00:02:50.240> pistons

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
know a month in Africa and with pistons

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.060 
know a month in Africa and with pistons
because<00:02:50.990> we<00:02:51.110> need<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.350> block<00:02:51.590> off<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.860> signal

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
because we need to block off the signal

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.590 
because we need to block off the signal
because<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.490> signal<00:02:52.670> s<00:02:52.910> always<00:02:53.270> beyond

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
because the signal s always beyond

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.690 
because the signal s always beyond
rather<00:02:53.870> than<00:02:54.020> sending<00:02:54.440> signals<00:02:54.890> we<00:02:55.490> could

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
rather than sending signals we could

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.100 
rather than sending signals we could
also<00:02:55.850> send<00:02:56.150> signals<00:02:56.570> but<00:02:56.660> then<00:02:56.840> we're<00:02:56.960> going

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
also send signals but then we're going

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.750 
also send signals but then we're going
to<00:02:57.170> have<00:02:57.320> another<00:02:57.590> tick<00:02:57.950> delay<00:02:58.310> in<00:02:58.460> between

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
to have another tick delay in between

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.530 
to have another tick delay in between
each<00:02:58.850> of<00:02:59.030> them<00:02:59.180> which<00:02:59.330> is<00:02:59.360> weird<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:01.540> think

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
each of them which is weird I think

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.560 
each of them which is weird I think
maybe<00:03:03.530> maybe<00:03:04.190> we<00:03:04.400> can<00:03:04.550> do<00:03:04.670> both<00:03:04.880> but<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.390> could

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
maybe maybe we can do both but you could

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.010 
maybe maybe we can do both but you could
end<00:03:05.690> up<00:03:05.810> with<00:03:05.870> much<00:03:06.290> more<00:03:06.440> space<00:03:06.710> either<00:03:07.010> way

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
end up with much more space either way

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.120 
end up with much more space either way
but<00:03:09.020> I've<00:03:09.170> just<00:03:09.350> been<00:03:09.470> playing<00:03:09.710> around<00:03:09.830> for<00:03:10.070> a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
but I've just been playing around for a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.890 
but I've just been playing around for a
bit<00:03:10.160> I've<00:03:10.490> done<00:03:10.820> too<00:03:10.970> much<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.450> there's

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
bit I've done too much so there's

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.330 
bit I've done too much so there's
probably<00:03:11.990> better<00:03:12.380> ways<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.620> do<00:03:12.860> things<00:03:13.070> as

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
probably better ways to do things as

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.110 
probably better ways to do things as
usual<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.700> yeah<00:03:18.340> I'll<00:03:19.340> probably<00:03:19.490> go<00:03:19.790> back<00:03:19.940> to

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
usual so yeah I'll probably go back to

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.580 
usual so yeah I'll probably go back to
making<00:03:20.240> dumb<00:03:20.540> games<00:03:20.840> now<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:22.310> see<00:03:22.490> you
