00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.429
 Now our city is the best city 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.259
 Accumulated here I have a question of rights like 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.320
 here it pushes 1 at rallies prizes 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.420
 films as far as i know such tests 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.590
 passed for example a former addict 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.370
 abdullah second part plan I'm not very 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.570
 I understand the prices why the percentage of lens 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.820
 continue at the same time power then 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.439
 hands enter syringes 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.269
 rather strange job selection but 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.369
 apparently made it clean to 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.039
 to shock the gambler what in principle 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.060
 right 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.029
 but I think it's not so difficult. 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.159
 lower 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.219
 a hand 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:35.789
 push services read accordingly if 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:36.980
 especially you saw 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.160
 Moscow pushes us let's say stations from 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 work of stock exchanges at csso of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.570
 scary is not something that he could miss a 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.590
 just go but basically the picture than 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.770
 it is similar but believe us 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.080
 two or three times worse so also pay 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.980
 it is necessary for 20 30 rubles well, we are watching 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.720
 hint a damn do not understand 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.150
 k basically it's pretty easy 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.539
 I went out in Vienna 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.460
 but the attacks got that did not understand what it did 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.990
 the conclusion that it is necessary to lower it again 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.260
 point in hand 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.860
 in general, so I kiss the minute hand point and sasol 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.060
 I haven't figured it out yet 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.660
 retired but I also put where it is necessary and marina 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.020
 who wears a t-shirt over the top 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.670
 secondly for what i hate him 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.040
 konrad saved thanks to us 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.270
 thanks to our sacrifice 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.960
 yes we leave the visa accordingly 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.950
 oak rooms 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.320
 says that accident glass is broken everywhere 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.090
 in principle, of course it will be like him 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.410
 it hurts but he is so cool that he won't give up 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.430
 us our shoes despite the fact that we 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.200
 saved his life 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.040
 awesome 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.680
 still there is a fight but control during 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.460
 fights and I hope that in the future would be gray 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.030
 companies still because management 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.050
 absolutely wildest uncomfortable 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.690
 and me what that Ossetian 4 year old 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.280
 the fact that, in principle, it is not surprising if 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.740
 consider that I play but in the end all the same 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.890
 I found the armature 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.640
 but also eao reveals the plot 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.700
 who is in this edition of all 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.909
 practical note about the fact that she was 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.380
 killed our banned 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.989
 and only in this case are you capable 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.209
 the British 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.909
 sort of safe and sound from this 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:15.600
 building 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.120
 which is how I understood 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.189
 abandoned hospital 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.629
 so well and naturally 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.339
 constantly burst my head everything explodes 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:24.669
 on your way 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.809
 and your task is just to solve 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:28.419
 puzzle successfully 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.989
 puzzles themselves anyway start 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.519
 games are not particularly difficult is this game scary 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.249
 no but she is very dark you even have 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.999
 lighter that gdp Russia that means here 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:39.849
 3 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.099
 but apparently I had to press the number 3 in 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.799
 it did not tear the plow but the polina on these 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.659
 buttons they are in no games ever 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.439
 cycling why all this forgot 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.440
 assign to 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.899
 grown one there is no movement there 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.819
 well what other buttons in 1 2 3 when 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.299
 your hand is lying 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.219
 under the figure local appears 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.329
 the keyboard here is constantly sharp 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.359
 imagine how not the most convenient 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.509
 classes 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.989
 working for it this labor labors wandering 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.260
 these corridors rub 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.249
 topic sure what's going on 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.619
 generally scary i wouldn't say but we 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:14.819
 definitely the atmosphere 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.919
 present in principle the same as 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.949
 and in the film 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.899
 According to the author, what to scare by the fact that in 2 2 that 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:24.299
 explodes obama spicy dig into 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.299
 the club 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.029
 but the worst thing in this game is not even 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:30.469
 the percentage as if these are the subject right away on 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.859
 the place I do not know when else to explain now 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.179
 see for yourself 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:36.989
 no matter how hard I tried, when I myself played 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.010
 a friend was near who was also m 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.200
 but both were first when I was huddled with me 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.810
 hugged like a brother 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.299
 ohh he also tried to send this crap 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.549
 but it's just 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.459
 just the mass of all time 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.609
 turned out once at the same time note that 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.749
 son face is not where you 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.349
 will please 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.459
 ssf here going on npo chips 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.609
 like this father 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:00.479
 beams 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.639
 chigoev meters I do not know got up and everything 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.149
 time is needed after each death 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:06.589
 run it over again it's pretty 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:07.510
 annoying 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.420
 how frustrating to watch this screensaver 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.089
 those already falling on the field 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:12.189
 percent 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.109
 and we can not throw it with us he 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.799
 probably fell 25 times and each time a hint 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.930
 and we read the complete set of principle 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.880
 did everything as it is written there Islam 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.880
 pass the percentage of fell we got out once a 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.409
 55 reason just look 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.889
 springboard poison i'm just here i always have 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.889
 such a problem I can not describe in words 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.780
 m bad governance yes but to understand what 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.770
 she has to play bad herself 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.650
 try then you will understand how it is 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.370
 awful how awkward it is even 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.479
 Meters can not pass immediately falls down 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.479
 damn how we give the room again 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.370
 try again looked tips 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.629
 street 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.629
 husband let's go 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.430
 yes he succeeded he went no 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.400
 why 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.379
 it's just unfair this 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.899
 club and the percentage is idiocy why do 

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:05.839
 such an awkward crap that practically 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.629
 impossible to pass 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.839
 percent i'm already tired with everything else 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:13.539
 pennies I saw yes it's there literally puzzles 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.909
 for a third grader but these are not even tasks 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.749
 it's just a stick that lies on the floor 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.550
 This is exactly the case when the decree to do 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.899
 something more complicated than real life individuals 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:24.849
 Fish bought where tear tears 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.480
 stale passed quietly 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.800
 as the highlight writes when I was a kid I got along 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.919
 buildings never failed 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.169
 but cmo 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.210
 let's be careful I'm just barely able to mouse 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.730
 mind 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.830
 poison gas 15 fell finally it just went 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.060
 what a miracle is probably easier for 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.029
 water learn to walk and and god 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:44.939
 Okay, let's go ahead, let's hope that 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:46.669
 This is the only Sochi in this game where we 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.119
 will have to go through Bakhty search 

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:50.240
 Sina 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.310
 I don't know who thought it up 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.330
 it will be fun possible consoles to do it 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.810
 lighter but i cant sorry sorry 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.589
 a game 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:59.439
 not so good
