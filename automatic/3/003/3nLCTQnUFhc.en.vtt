00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 I was away from love the other day 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.370
 asked if I'm already on the silver 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.170
 second book of dreams rejoice and me 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.230
 think it's time for my feelings 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.230
 talk 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.190
 yes, my feelings are getting more and more 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.410
 control for the second part of this 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.750
 beautiful book silver the first book of the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.190
 dreams come out in about 20 days and 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.779
 It's the time has passed so fast 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.000
 Last year, a year ago, I thought 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.040
 one more year until then the next 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.879
 comes and now consciously only 20 days left 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.980
 that is really incredible for the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.900
 who do not know what silver is all about 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.610
 I would not recommend my 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.489
 to look at the review because I am in mine 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.800
 A small wheel had something off 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.100
 maybe that was because of me 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.960
 just got a vacation 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.580
 Past is difficult I can 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.430
 Tell you very briefly what it is about 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.870
 she goes to live in a new city 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.540
 with her family 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.390
 because her mother is a new one there 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.670
 job and has a new friend 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.340
 They also move with this friend 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.560
 one and he also has two children 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.049
 one of these kids is grayson and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.390
 grace and type from a clique of 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.789
 school to which also belong 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.710
 from jasper henry and and these four guys 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.960
 they're pretty cool and so 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.810
 pretty and so are the girls raving about 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.549
 but they all have such a small one 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.060
 secret and somehow it stops 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.799
 to 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.570
 the lif slides into it and that 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.789
 Silver is the first book of dreams 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.710
 So you can see from that that 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.560
 also a little bit about dreams is and is 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.289
 it's a bit spooky and so 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.390
 fantasy moderately and it's great 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.219
 is from kerstin greed and for the people 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.320
 which are now so on the hose 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.320
 kerstin greed has also around him and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.299
 written and so the whole series and 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.049
 Also a lot of women's books 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.210
 funny and kerstin greed is one of the 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.179
 Greatest authors I know 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.920
 So I adore as in principle and 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.990
 I loved the first book and me 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.780
 I am incredibly looking forward to the second one 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.160
 I can hardly stand it anymore and if 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.330
 I think about it then I start to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.610
 tremble and I 'm so happy about that 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.180
 second book of dreams will be published on 26 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.720
 june will have 416 pages and 19 eur 99 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.020
 costs 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.300
 and yes is from the fisherman 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.340
 jugendbuchverlag and julia I'm glad 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.230
 me pretty much 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.570
 Let me have your feelings for the book in 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.550
 the comments and what I still have 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.890
 Wanted to ask you have already 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.230
 there is some suspicion of the tigris 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:51.960
 Because then I have such a small one 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:55.140
 suspected jasper because I think he 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.680
 can know a lot because of this 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.290
 he has an incredible dream 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.830
 know about everyone in principle only with 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.900
 grayson and oats and yes he is 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.200
 maybe very much has many 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.810
 sources that tell something and so 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.570
 only perhaps doing the soloist extra one 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.090
 girl s or so and he just writes 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.750
 never had that really negative about it 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.400
 that's why I do not know but 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.680
 maybe I'm totally wrong too 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.460
 Let me your guess in the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.200
 comments to 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.780
 I think it's cool when we feel like it 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.970
 could talk about it a bit and 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.430
 then yes, probably in a year 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.780
 then comes the resolution of who secrecy is 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.040
 and that would be even more cool if a 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.630
 from you in the comments 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.520
 somehow it is already known correctly 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.020
 and that would be correct 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.030
 Do not cool this book yet 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.050
 that should definitely do that 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.360
 because it is unbelievably great and besides 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.490
 or there is this too 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.800
 beautiful cover what synonymous with the 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.360
 second so i am trying this for you 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.280
 but sometimes it is here 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.440
 It stupid because I'm the biggest of the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.280
 imagination of not Display to 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.010
 can adjust 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.010
 but I 'll give you this one 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.960
 dazzle like that and yes it is beautiful 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.820
 The turquoise is my favorite color 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.070
 which I am a bit irritating 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.139
 here is just this eye on it 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.789
 and so what and if you have the protection and 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.979
 then this is the door 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.350
 and the second book is just like that 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.110
 say that door so that's it 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.240
 in principle, it looks like that 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.039
 only in turquoise and a few more 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.130
 Strengthen me and I would have it 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.100
 found more beautiful 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.139
 maybe I do not know if it is 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.539
 Black would have stayed outside with one 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.970
 few changes and then underneath 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.919
 turquoise or if it has been completely turquoise 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.080
 would be with then in the eye and decrypt 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.400
 and so maybe she has herself too 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.419
 what thinking has perhaps the 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.940
 to do something 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.949
 and yes I am incredibly happy 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.009
 I'm really curious how it with further lift 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.410
 goes and yes, how the whole thing 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.539
 I like the characters 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.400
 also incredibly good and how is that 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.199
 whole developed with the dear apple 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.490
 I'm really looking forward to that 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.590
 I think it's not over yet 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.520
 you can already read an excerpt 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.840
 receive 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.410
 you can on the phone 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.960
 download or read through the internet 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.210
 I'll pack you the link in the infobox 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.979
 and otherwise that's it for today 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.360
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:25.310
 Hope this is his question answered 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.320
 and how he we have such a little 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.460
 anticipation new release video that 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.060
 I have last year already to 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.460
 made this book and if you want 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.409
 that I will read it again like that 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.430
 go with update and that's because of that 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.199
 me that's also for this book 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.220
 then you can do that to me too 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.530
 to write the comments 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.270
 but i think i have the book on that 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.550
 day where I will buy it still finish 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.120
 because my 400 pages I will 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.699
 then just read it off so fast and so on 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.770
 or maybe not read quickly away 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.880
 but simply kerstin I can give yes 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.840
 I do not have a long one 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.610
 read the period 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.289
 I just can not relax 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.789
 I had to devour immediately and one 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.060
 I love books that I have to 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.620
 anyway immediately read away and yes because of it 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.880
 I do not know if that is so useful 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.919
 but if that's what you wanted 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.750
 small updates in between then give 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.340
 write me that in the comments and 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.940
 that 's it then I hope we see each other 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.639
 here on Saturday again with a day with 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.900
 the botox day and there you can 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.919
 already looking forward to it and otherwise 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.090
 I wish you a nice day 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.090
 and see you on saturday
