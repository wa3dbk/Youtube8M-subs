00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.770
 Hello, today I want 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.850
 tell show how it feels 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.850
 our tomato itself 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:18.250
 we made another spin 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.610
 on the trellis on the splits of tomato because 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:28.860
 tomatoes grows tomato 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:34.870
 At the beginning I started the ring nitre 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:37.510
 calcium nitrate and it gave us a start and 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.750
 grows well now the tomato can be seen that 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.070
 there he has a normal growth point 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.010
 thick trunk 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.649
 feed her more nitrogen don't ask no 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.660
 we will give it some how many 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:55.289
 sulphate form on tomatoes already with us 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.090
 3 4 brush starts to bloom 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:03.750
 lower cysts rushed ass tied 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.750
 you can see such here they are 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.930
 There is which generally the first brush on 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:15.000
 all have large tomatoes, I have 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.000
 I think that soon night fees 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.750
 very bad weather we have here 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.810
 we are now in a greenhouse on the street 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.630
 rain all of our closed yesterday 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.720
 the day before yesterday is very hot today 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.470
 cold well a little temperature sb 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.560
 It was conducted on the principle of a good idea for a tomato 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.210
 because it will not need to produce 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.340
 event for 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:46.420
 and according to the suit there is dusting when large 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.940
 the hole becomes pollen sterile and 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.460
 Tomato is not tied and has to 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.890
 do artificial pollination but now 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.020
 the temperature dropped though i think us 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.170
 will contribute to calmly tie up 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.640
 top and fucked up which is above 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.979
 without any particular problems there is on 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.560
 one bone we have a problem here 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.130
 such appeared you do not dream this big 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.430
 most likely some virus well I 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.519
 now processed greenhouse form iodine 4 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.350
 we had a bush on the greenhouse three bushes 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.940

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.579
 big problems took them and just 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.730
 threw out neatly tore completely 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:36.690
 let her put a plastic bag and 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.690
 delivered for the territory of my site and 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:46.000
 throwing it burned it just in case 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.239
 I will process the farm with iodine and I 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.370
 I think that we will have a problem of ours 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.760
 disappear altogether it is not very big 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.060
