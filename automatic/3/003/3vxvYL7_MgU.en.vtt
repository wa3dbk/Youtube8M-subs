00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.940
 become on cooking and fast 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.500
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.920
 make chicken donuts very easy 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.549
 let's go for the recipe 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.379
 chicken donuts 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.500
 we will need a tablespoon 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.170
 of sugar 2 tablespoons flour 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.199
 oil for frying three whites 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.650
 2 he was not turning turmeric a spoon 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.090
 coffee salt two chicken fillets and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.090
 a few drops of lemon juice 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.579
 I start with key word to zero 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.579
 heat there I need to reach a 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:47.309
 temperature of 180 degrees so 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:51.090
 temperature 180 degrees here I put 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.690
 the equivalent of 500 grams of oil 1 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.690
 no more 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.550
 in the bowl I put my white 2g 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:10.940
 but also a few drops of juice 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:13.700
 of lemon and a little bit of salt and there 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.479
 we will beat all that to get 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.479
 white 2 well mounted 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.230
 I put all my sugar for tight 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.230
 but white 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.940
 so once we got a pretty 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:51.090
 meringue poured over our 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:53.610
 flour and turmeric the curcumin will us 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.730
 bring a nice color then with 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.070
 my whip I am going to incorporate the flour 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.540
 and mocking cum in my white 2 for 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:11.250
 givet delicately here again in 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:14.100
 below and we get up we'll take care 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.840
 chicken so I'll spoil the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.900
 cut into slices in culinary terms 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.630
 we call it needles is a game 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.070
 do long sticks here we did not 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.270
 you do not need to be super regular on 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.530
 not too big 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.130
 otherwise they will put a lot more 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.130
 cooking time 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.410
 and I do the same thing with my 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.030
 second son and so I do not eat 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.030
 remove the greasy parts 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.260
 no I pour my chicken fillets so 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.720
 cut into sticks directly on my 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.790
 salad bowl I'll put a little bit 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.459
 of flour 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:18.090

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:22.010

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.010

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.459
 so I take a piece of chicken that 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.459

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.989

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:44.140
