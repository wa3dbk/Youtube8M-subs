00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.330

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.920
 a crossfire video that this time I 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.240
 I 'm not bringing a gameplay of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.670
 Live comment today I'm bringing 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.480
 an ex who have long since not bring 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.369
 This link for you, I think I think 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.199
 Yes, I 'm fine, I think it already does. 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.869
 some time I do not do things that 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.789
 Can I comment then if I lose myself? 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.590
 Sorry for the Italian, I still have the flu. 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.870
 For those who do not know I do not know the rest of the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.980
 country but in são paulo the friaca do 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.050
 damn it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.020
 although it's winter if I'm not mistaken it 's 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.350
 so it's obvious that he 's already in the whole country 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.750
 Anyway, in the whole country, I just have one. 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.230
 ease in losing the way of things 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.360
 huh 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.340
 I 'm doing it for you, it's that micro. 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.280
 twig or micro there I do not know how 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.899
 sure to say but it's a boring weapon 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.059
 year simply that I have to 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.980
 stop commenting not to buy but 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.500
 it 's not a cool weapon she does not have a 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.409
 recall bacano giving it is cool does not have 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.640
 no cool thing is cool to hold like 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.100
 if you were holding her baby 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.560
 doing is not a pretty your car staying 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.790
 slow my god, that boring success said 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.450
 who tried to talk about the micro gaga is a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.729
 boring she james it is not so 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.390
 ridiculous while using mp seven 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.100
 but it's boring for the outlets o 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.280
 joking talking shit but it's lucky 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.250
 anger is her god is poop of the elder 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.770
 It's like it's a type of weapon that nuno júdice 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.930
 if you still know if you will 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.479
 want to be a sunshine girl the copyright 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.939
 So the thing I tell you is 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.409
 I did not buy the face, I guess. 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.170
 It was almost that I could not get it. 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.970
 this is it and I think it already makes a 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.979
 time I was playing not that I 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.600
 I'm better now more lately. 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.280
 played more cruise we can 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.149
 improve a little more skills to 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.060
 itown and I was seeing that I took the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.430
 gameplay I 'm seeing pretty much everything else 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.479
 but anyway, it's something that has 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.369
 what talk to you are wanting 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.920
 start a series of crossfire that more 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.079
 an epic series even the series of 100 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.390
 Only pounds I need a name 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.280
 Geez, I need a name for this thing. 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.120
 this phenomenon knows this phenomenon of 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.750
 say I need a knot 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.879
 just an example nuno lopes 2 when you 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.700
 take 30 you died nuclear name 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.670
 When you get the 25 you used 24 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.950
 the numbers neither w3 is moby I do not know not 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.900
 I remember exactly now that there is 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.790
 definition of how life acronym is 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.010
 put what we will put only 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.709
 This and I need the name now. 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.620
 Nice thing seems to kill know what I do not 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.180
 I wanted to put it, we only felt there if not 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.220
 I think it's going to be just as soon as the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.829
 months but it will be the following will be 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.569
 basically I'm picking up without qiu ziming 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.640
 random maps in part of two 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.890
 minutes or less goes from the level of 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.900
 I had difficulty on day 6 if I 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.109
 have a bit more hardcore between 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.150
 smaller parties and I want to pick up and 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.819
 I will not talk to all the guns that 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.400
 It's really hard to get this with a gun. 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.099
 Bad I've already picked up box 87 to 74 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.989
 with wm 4 to 1 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.909
 There is someone on beretta I could already get 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.109
 The only cell phone I did not record is 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.280
 It's still recorded but I believe that I 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.049
 I did not have much difficulty just picking up 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.299
 so then probably I would put 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.489
 record and then there are not five or six 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.099
 Attempts already out so I wanted 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.590
 you to suggest without names but 60 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.799
 mezzanine will put this is there banana 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.410
 banana without legacy that you saw 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.079
 it was ridiculous that you suggest names 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.150
 Nice times and who suggested a name 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.250
 This is the best I put here in the video that 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.739
 it was your idea and everything else puts your 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.389
 name and that's it then abuse the 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.730
 you remember that your 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.919
 I just do not like the name of any of the 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.290
 names and I will not put anything put 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.569
 only without the same video name and 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.500
 basically this is the end of the 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.760
 gameplay for coming is my brake with 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.370
 ends will not give me my brake anymore 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.650
 It was not the spectacular thing, but it is. 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.569
 This is the way you like the joy match. 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.549
 Favorite scale channel to track 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.810
 work and thank you for the audience 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.810
 so I went
