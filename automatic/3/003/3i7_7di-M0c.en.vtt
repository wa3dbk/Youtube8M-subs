00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the game if that makes sense like some

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.929 
the game if that makes sense like some
areas<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:25.470> brighter<00:00:25.680> some<00:00:26.460> areas<00:00:26.820> you're

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.449 
I just think if they took the time to
fix<00:03:42.930> some<00:03:43.170> things<00:03:43.200> honestly<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.160> would<00:03:44.340> be

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.350 
gunner show you're not wasting it I do
turn<00:04:35.760> my<00:04:35.910> sensitivity<00:04:36.360> down<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.990> medium<00:04:37.680> and

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
turn my sensitivity down the medium and

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.920 
turn my sensitivity down the medium and
now<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.419> reason<00:04:39.630> why<00:04:39.810> I<00:04:39.840> do<00:04:39.960> that<00:04:40.200> is<00:04:40.380> because

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
now the reason why I do that is because

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.270 
now the reason why I do that is because
Vince<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.140> magician<00:04:43.620> which<00:04:43.800> was<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.130> guy

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
Vince the magician which was the guy

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.950 
Vince the magician which was the guy
that<00:04:44.310> uploaded<00:04:44.820> a<00:04:44.940> video<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.390> my<00:04:45.570> channel<00:04:45.930> a

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
that uploaded a video to my channel a

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.719 
that uploaded a video to my channel a
while<00:04:46.140> back<00:04:46.349> he<00:04:46.800> said<00:04:46.979> to<00:04:47.130> do<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.340> so<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.490> tried

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
while back he said to do it so I tried

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.460 
while back he said to do it so I tried
it<00:04:47.909> out<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:48.030> it's<00:04:48.360> really<00:04:48.810> good<00:04:48.960> I'm

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
it out and it's really good I'm

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.920 
it out and it's really good I'm
especially<00:04:49.740> with<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.099> FPS<00:04:50.460> freeks<00:04:50.930> it's

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
especially with the FPS freeks it's

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.320 
especially with the FPS freeks it's
still<00:04:52.229> really<00:04:53.010> you<00:04:53.310> can<00:04:53.550> still<00:04:53.820> turn<00:04:53.970> pretty

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
still really you can still turn pretty

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.620 
still really you can still turn pretty
fast<00:04:54.599> and<00:04:54.950> but<00:04:55.950> it's<00:04:56.070> a<00:04:56.669> lot<00:04:56.760> at<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.300> lot<00:04:57.510> more

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
fast and but it's a lot at a lot more

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.890 
fast and but it's a lot at a lot more
accurate<00:04:58.080> um<00:04:58.849> you<00:04:59.849> can<00:05:00.030> hold<00:05:00.210> it<00:05:00.390> at<00:05:00.539> a<00:05:00.570> steady

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
accurate um you can hold it at a steady

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.960 
accurate um you can hold it at a steady
position<00:05:01.140> a<00:05:01.590> lot<00:05:01.770> laughs<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.159> lot<00:05:02.310> easier<00:05:02.550> if

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
position a lot laughs a lot easier if

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.740 
position a lot laughs a lot easier if
you<00:05:03.539> change<00:05:03.870> if<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.260> lower<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.740> sensitivity

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
you change if you lower the sensitivity

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.180 
you change if you lower the sensitivity
but<00:05:06.750> that's<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.169> end<00:05:07.320> of<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.470> game<00:05:07.500> we<00:05:08.039> were
