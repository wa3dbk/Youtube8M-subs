00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
which one you think has more calories I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.149 
which one you think has more calories I
would<00:01:15.030> say<00:01:15.240> probably<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.930> sugar<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.950> most

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
would say probably the sugar and most

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
would say probably the sugar and most
people<00:01:17.369> would<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.729> turns<00:01:18.450> out<00:01:18.600> honey

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
people would think that turns out honey

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.890 
people would think that turns out honey
actually<00:01:19.680> has<00:01:19.979> more<00:01:20.189> calories<00:01:20.400> oh<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:21.840> I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
actually has more calories oh so if I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
actually has more calories oh so if I
put<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.110> there<00:01:22.409> honey<00:01:22.830> has<00:01:23.040> about<00:01:23.310> 22<00:01:23.670> calories

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
put up there honey has about 22 calories

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.630 
put up there honey has about 22 calories
per<00:01:24.450> teaspoon<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.799> regular<00:01:26.400> oil<00:01:26.430> sugar

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
per teaspoon and your regular oil sugar

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.910 
per teaspoon and your regular oil sugar
has<00:01:26.820> 16<00:01:27.210> calories<00:01:27.420> both<00:01:27.930> that's<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.829> know

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
has 16 calories both that's you know

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.020 
has 16 calories both that's you know
pretty<00:01:29.070> reasonable<00:01:29.430> numbers<00:01:29.700> by<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.909> way

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
pretty reasonable numbers by the way

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.880 
pretty reasonable numbers by the way
which<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.720> why<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.290> get<00:01:31.380> away<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
which is why you can get away with it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.800 
which is why you can get away with it
but<00:01:32.250> here's<00:01:32.670> although<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.210> sugar<00:01:33.659> is

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
but here's although you think sugar is

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.990 
but here's although you think sugar is
the<00:01:33.869> winner<00:01:34.110> turns<00:01:35.009> out<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the winner turns out that it's not and

you<00:01:40.500> only<00:01:40.619> need<00:01:40.770> half<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:41.220> much<00:01:41.729> it's

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
you only need half as much it's

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.490 
you only need half as much it's
literally<00:01:42.299> twice<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.659> sweet<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.049> put<00:01:43.229> half<00:01:43.350> as

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
literally twice as sweet you put half as

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.960 
literally twice as sweet you put half as
much<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.860> there<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.340> ends<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.579> being<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.820> better

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
much in there so ends up being a better

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
away with a lot less calories by just

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
away with a lot less calories by just
replacing<00:01:51.990> honey<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.829> your<00:01:52.979> sugar<00:01:53.159> wow

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.719 

folks<00:02:01.869> who<00:02:02.020> watch<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.380> show<00:02:02.409> try<00:02:03.369> to<00:02:03.430> avoid

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
folks who watch the show try to avoid

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.429 
folks who watch the show try to avoid
processed<00:02:04.360> foods<00:02:04.420> are<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.840> in<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:05.080> camp

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
processed foods are you in that camp

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.580 
processed foods are you in that camp
I<00:02:05.470> try<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.009> yes<00:02:06.939> I<00:02:07.210> think<00:02:07.540> it's<00:02:07.720> it's<00:02:08.020> better<00:02:08.289> to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
I try to yes I think it's it's better to

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.330 
I try to yes I think it's it's better to
avoid<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.670> cans<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.599> avoid<00:02:11.380> eating<00:02:11.560> out<00:02:11.830> you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
avoid the cans and avoid eating out you

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.949 
avoid the cans and avoid eating out you
know<00:02:12.489> cooking<00:02:13.270> at<00:02:13.390> home<00:02:13.510> they<00:02:13.660> go<00:02:13.780> ahead<00:02:13.870> and

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
know cooking at home they go ahead and

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.080 
know cooking at home they go ahead and
pull<00:02:14.170> out<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.290> spoon<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.280> show<00:02:15.700> me<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.970> other

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
pull out the spoon and show me the other

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.430 
pull out the spoon and show me the other
reason<00:02:16.480> cuz<00:02:16.600> you'll<00:02:16.750> be<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> fan<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.290> for

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
reason cuz you'll be a fan of it for

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.280 
reason cuz you'll be a fan of it for
this<00:02:17.530> reason<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.670> less<00:02:18.970> processed<00:02:19.540> honey

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
this reason it's less processed honey

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.350 
this reason it's less processed honey
compared<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.040> sugar<00:02:21.280> okay<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.150> big

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
compared to sugar okay this is a big

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.699 
compared to sugar okay this is a big
deal<00:02:22.569> because<00:02:22.780> we<00:02:22.989> don't<00:02:23.170> think<00:02:23.290> about<00:02:23.440> that

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
deal because we don't think about that

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.710 
deal because we don't think about that
processing<00:02:24.220> right<00:02:24.880> United<00:02:25.239> sugar<00:02:25.510> it's

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
processing right United sugar it's

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.750 
processing right United sugar it's
called<00:02:25.959> refining<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.680> sugar<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.430> seems<00:02:27.640> like

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
called refining the sugar it seems like

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.860 
called refining the sugar it seems like
it's<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:27.940> good<00:02:28.060> thing<00:02:28.120> who<00:02:28.390> wants<00:02:28.569> we<00:02:28.630> all<00:02:28.720> want

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
it's a good thing who wants we all want

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.559 
it's a good thing who wants we all want
to<00:02:28.900> be<00:02:28.989> refined<00:02:29.440> don't<00:02:29.890> 305<00:02:30.790> let<00:02:31.150> me<00:02:31.300> show<00:02:31.510> you

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
to be refined don't 305 let me show you

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.600 
to be refined don't 305 let me show you
so<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.140> start<00:02:32.470> off<00:02:32.620> for<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.950> natural<00:02:33.280> product

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
so you start off for the natural product

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.340 
so you start off for the natural product
right<00:02:33.700> sugar<00:02:34.000> cane<00:02:34.209> for<00:02:34.630> example<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.260> know

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
right sugar cane for example you know

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.600 
right sugar cane for example you know
beats<00:02:35.560> other<00:02:35.769> sources<00:02:36.069> so<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.220> get<00:02:36.340> sugar

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
beats other sources so you get sugar

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.580 
beats other sources so you get sugar
cane<00:02:36.880> here<00:02:37.090> natural<00:02:37.510> source<00:02:37.810> then<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.290> sugars

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
cane here natural source then the sugars

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.400 
cane here natural source then the sugars
extracted<00:02:39.250> from<00:02:39.370> these<00:02:39.610> plants<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.810> it's<00:02:41.140> put

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
extracted from these plants and it's put

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.680 
extracted from these plants and it's put
into<00:02:41.560> these<00:02:41.920> big<00:02:42.340> vats<00:02:42.760> these<00:02:43.450> they're

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
into these big vats these they're

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.330 
into these big vats these they're
bleaching<00:02:44.170> agents<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.739> are<00:02:44.799> then<00:02:44.950> added<00:02:45.310> to

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
bleaching agents that are then added to

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.460 
bleaching agents that are then added to
it<00:02:45.549> it<00:02:45.730> produces<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.299> white<00:02:46.750> crystal

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
it it produces that white crystal

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.680 
it it produces that white crystal
material<00:02:48.069> we<00:02:48.430> know<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> sugar<00:02:49.030> just<00:02:49.330> like<00:02:49.450> that

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
material we know a sugar just like that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.120 
material we know a sugar just like that
and<00:02:50.049> of<00:02:50.290> course<00:02:50.440> when<00:02:50.560> they<00:02:50.650> packaged<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.040> up

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
and of course when they packaged it up

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.800 
and of course when they packaged it up
and<00:02:51.310> boxed<00:02:51.549> up<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.790> finally<00:02:52.299> comes<00:02:52.450> your<00:02:52.630> home

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
and boxed up it finally comes your home

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.140 
and boxed up it finally comes your home
like<00:02:53.019> this<00:02:53.230> but<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.100> processing<00:02:54.850> actually

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
like this but that processing actually

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.289 
like this but that processing actually
strips<00:02:56.049> out<00:02:56.400> vitamins<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.610> minerals<00:02:58.090> and

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
strips out vitamins and minerals and

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.330 
strips out vitamins and minerals and
proteins<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.049> horse<00:02:59.230> all<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.440> fiber<00:02:59.739> that

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
proteins and horse all the fiber that

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.130 
proteins and horse all the fiber that
was<00:03:00.459> naturally<00:03:00.880> present<00:03:01.120> in<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.870> sweet

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
was naturally present in this sweet

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.770 
was naturally present in this sweet
stuff<00:03:02.410> but<00:03:02.890> not<00:03:03.040> become<00:03:03.340> sugar<00:03:03.579> that's<00:03:04.510> why<00:03:04.660> we

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
stuff but not become sugar that's why we

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.539 
stuff but not become sugar that's why we
call<00:03:04.959> these<00:03:05.079> empty<00:03:05.410> calories<00:03:05.920> that's<00:03:06.430> what

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
call these empty calories that's what

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.800 
call these empty calories that's what
undermines<00:03:06.970> your<00:03:07.060> more<00:03:07.299> than<00:03:07.359> anything<00:03:07.510> else

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
undermines your more than anything else

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.900 
undermines your more than anything else
now<00:03:08.049> honey<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.500> also<00:03:08.920> processed<00:03:09.130> in<00:03:09.579> fairness

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
now honey is also processed in fairness

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.110 
now honey is also processed in fairness
but<00:03:10.630> guess<00:03:10.840> what<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.019> processors<00:03:11.500> are<00:03:11.970> we<00:03:12.970> are

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
but guess what the processors are we are

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.680 
but guess what the processors are we are
the<00:03:13.209> processors<00:03:13.780> no<00:03:14.019> B's<00:03:14.440> obese<00:03:15.299> okay<00:03:16.299> folks

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
the processors no B's obese okay folks

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.300 
the processors no B's obese okay folks
in<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.870> audience<00:03:17.170> said<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:17.950> honeybees

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
in the audience said so the honeybees

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.380 
in the audience said so the honeybees
are<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.489> processors<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.150> for<00:03:19.269> that<00:03:19.329> reason

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
are the processors and for that reason

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.789 
are the processors and for that reason
they're<00:03:19.690> very<00:03:19.870> careful<00:03:20.320> in<00:03:20.380> how<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.530> do<00:03:20.680> it

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
they're very careful in how to do it

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.199 
they're very careful in how to do it
they<00:03:20.920> don't<00:03:21.010> strip<00:03:21.250> out<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.489> nutrients<00:03:21.910> so

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
they don't strip out the nutrients so

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.970 
they don't strip out the nutrients so
here's<00:03:22.359> what<00:03:22.480> happens<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.930> bee<00:03:23.230> starts<00:03:23.799> out

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
here's what happens the bee starts out

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.770 
here's what happens the bee starts out
and<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.400> finds<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.910> nice<00:03:25.060> plant<00:03:25.359> for<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.600> likes

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
and it finds a nice plant for the likes

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.539 
and it finds a nice plant for the likes
right<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.410> sex<00:03:26.680> all<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:26.950> nectar<00:03:27.160> out<00:03:27.280> there

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
right and sex all the nectar out there

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.819 
right and sex all the nectar out there
gorges<00:03:28.090> itself<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.750> returns<00:03:29.170> after<00:03:29.739> it's

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
gorges itself that it returns after it's

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.890 
gorges itself that it returns after it's
done<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.130> into<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.760> hive<00:03:30.970> when<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.630> goes<00:03:31.750> in

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
done that into the hive when it goes in

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.930 
done that into the hive when it goes in
the<00:03:31.989> hive<00:03:32.140> it<00:03:32.500> actually<00:03:32.859> finds<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.519> wels<00:03:33.700> it

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
the hive it actually finds the wels it

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.000 
the hive it actually finds the wels it
converts<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.690> honey<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.109> nectar<00:03:35.859> and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
converts it the honey that nectar and

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.620 
converts it the honey that nectar and
you<00:03:36.070> now<00:03:36.370> know<00:03:36.519> its<00:03:36.730> moist<00:03:37.030> what<00:03:37.420> do<00:03:37.480> they<00:03:37.570> do

you now know its moist what do they do

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.479

you otherwise might expect to be in the
place<00:03:53.530> that's<00:03:54.220> why<00:03:54.459> honey<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.819> think<00:03:54.970> has<00:03:55.209> a<00:03:55.239> lot

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
place that's why honey I think has a lot

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.720 
place that's why honey I think has a lot
of<00:03:55.510> additional<00:03:55.660> benefits<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.370> like

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
of additional benefits and and I like

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.090 
of additional benefits and and I like
dark<00:03:58.000> honey<00:03:58.209> because<00:03:59.139> dark<00:03:59.470> honey<00:03:59.620> has<00:03:59.889> a<00:03:59.920> lot

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
dark honey because dark honey has a lot

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.979 
dark honey because dark honey has a lot
of<00:04:00.220> these<00:04:00.730> antioxidants<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.569> we<00:04:01.660> you<00:04:01.959> know

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
Chevron II it looks like this I don't

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.759 
Chevron II it looks like this I don't
know<00:04:16.150> thicker<00:04:16.420> it's<00:04:16.840> much<00:04:17.080> thicker<00:04:17.290> so<00:04:17.560> Wow

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
know thicker it's much thicker so Wow

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.070 
know thicker it's much thicker so Wow
actually<00:04:18.280> that<00:04:19.120> thickness<00:04:19.390> is<00:04:19.630> an<00:04:19.720> important

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
actually that thickness is an important

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.509 
actually that thickness is an important
issue<00:04:20.170> for<00:04:20.350> some<00:04:20.620> people<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:20.980> it<00:04:21.070> important<00:04:21.430> to

you okay you take the regular honey I'll
take<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.530> rod<00:04:23.770> yeah<00:04:24.070> I<00:04:24.100> think<00:04:24.400> that<00:04:24.550> is

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
take the rod yeah I think that is

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.260 
take the rod yeah I think that is
important

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270
