00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
a style of training requires more rest

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.630 
a style of training requires more rest
so<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.810> is<00:04:52.840> what<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.169> is<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:54.070> I'm<00:04:54.160> going<00:04:54.190> to<00:04:54.430> rest

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
pounds remember I talked about inch by

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.760 
pounds remember I talked about inch by
inch<00:05:09.760> life<00:05:10.150> is<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.360> cinch<00:05:10.660> yard<00:05:10.990> by<00:05:11.169> yard<00:05:11.200> life

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
inch life is a cinch yard by yard life

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.320 
inch life is a cinch yard by yard life
is<00:05:11.919> hard<00:05:12.100> so<00:05:12.400> we're<00:05:12.820> just<00:05:12.850> making<00:05:13.120> those

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
is hard so we're just making those

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.150 
is hard so we're just making those
incremental<00:05:14.080> jumps<00:05:14.470> each<00:05:14.680> week<00:05:14.950> and<00:05:15.070> that's

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
incremental jumps each week and that's

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.710 
incremental jumps each week and that's
how<00:05:15.370> we're<00:05:15.520> going<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.700> get<00:05:15.790> this<00:05:15.970> up<00:05:16.150> to<00:05:16.240> 300

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
for a strength-based workout I basically

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.390 
for a strength-based workout I basically
do<00:07:11.570> singles<00:07:12.080> and<00:07:12.320> increase<00:07:12.650> the<00:07:12.890> load<00:07:13.100> about

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
do singles and increase the load about

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.610 
do singles and increase the load about
ten<00:07:13.700> to<00:07:13.820> twenty<00:07:14.150> percent<00:07:14.480> and<00:07:14.750> how<00:07:14.900> I<00:07:14.930> top<00:07:15.350> off

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:15.620

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 
and then I go for my first work set and

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.960 
and then I go for my first work set and
I<00:07:18.500> take<00:07:18.710> as<00:07:18.830> many<00:07:19.040> rehearsal<00:07:19.670> sets<00:07:19.850> as

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:19.970 
I take as many rehearsal sets as

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.910 
I take as many rehearsal sets as
possible<00:07:20.570> so<00:07:20.750> for<00:07:21.290> some<00:07:21.500> of<00:07:21.620> you<00:07:21.710> might<00:07:21.860> be

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:21.920 
possible so for some of you might be

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.710 
possible so for some of you might be
three<00:07:22.280> sets<00:07:22.610> for<00:07:22.850> some<00:07:23.000> of<00:07:23.120> you<00:07:23.240> most<00:07:23.450> likely

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720 
three sets for some of you most likely

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.780 
three sets for some of you most likely
will<00:07:23.840> be<00:07:23.960> closer<00:07:24.320> to<00:07:24.470> six<00:07:24.830> or<00:07:25.010> seven<00:07:25.370> warm<00:07:25.640> up

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:25.790 
will be closer to six or seven warm up

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.410 
will be closer to six or seven warm up
sets<00:07:26.060> before<00:07:26.480> getting<00:07:27.110> into<00:07:27.260> a<00:07:27.380> first<00:07:27.710> work

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.420
