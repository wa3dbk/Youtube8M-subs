there<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> bit<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.649> fatigue<00:00:47.039> involved

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
there was a bit of a fatigue involved

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.810 
there was a bit of a fatigue involved
it's<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.270> united<00:00:48.960> sound<00:00:49.170> ninth<00:00:49.350> game<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.730> I

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
it's a united sound ninth game and I

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.279 
it's a united sound ninth game and I
think<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.210> started<00:00:51.600> poorly<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.140> think

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
think we started poorly and I think

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.750 
think we started poorly and I think
Australia<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.829> started<00:00:53.190> very<00:00:53.340> very<00:00:53.579> well

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
Australia have started very very well

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
Australia have started very very well
but<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.480> got<00:00:54.510> our<00:00:54.660> rhythm<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.170> second<00:00:55.500> half

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
but we got our rhythm in the second half

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.470 
but we got our rhythm in the second half
we<00:00:55.829> put<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> lot<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.160> pressure<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.640> them<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.000> got

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
we put a lot of pressure on them I got

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.080 
we put a lot of pressure on them I got
back<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> 31<00:00:58.140> try<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> chase<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> game<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.879> best

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
back to 31 try to chase the game as best

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.970 
back to 31 try to chase the game as best
we<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:01.289> thought<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.559> put<00:01:01.710> enormous

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
we can and I thought we put enormous

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.799 
we can and I thought we put enormous
pressure<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.430> Australia<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
pressure on Australia and it was for a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:04.910 
pressure on Australia and it was for a
while<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.170> could<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.500> been<00:01:04.559> anyone's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
while there it could have been anyone's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
while there it could have been anyone's
match<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:06.420> look<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:06.630> came<00:01:06.869> away<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
match but look they came away the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.990 
match but look they came away the
stronger<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.979> has<00:01:08.280> been<00:01:08.400> pushed<00:01:08.610> before<00:01:08.700> they

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
stronger and has been pushed before they

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.760 
stronger and has been pushed before they
got<00:01:09.119> another<00:01:09.360> goal<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.780> all<00:01:10.380> credit<00:01:10.590> to

the two two parts to it it really is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.690 
the two two parts to it it really is
accessible<00:01:32.729> teams<00:01:32.970> good<00:01:33.329> teams<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.700> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
accessible teams good teams that are a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.719 
accessible teams good teams that are a
constant<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.829> getting<00:01:37.829> momentum<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.430> have

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
constant and getting momentum going have

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.950 
constant and getting momentum going have
the<00:01:38.790> opportunity<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.689> way<00:01:39.780> right

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the opportunity going all the way right

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.889 
the opportunity going all the way right
through<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:41.009> were<00:01:41.100> very<00:01:41.250> consistent<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.450> won

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
through we were very consistent we won

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.859 
through we were very consistent we won
the<00:01:42.990> matches<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.500> need<00:01:43.710> them<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.920> win<00:01:44.869> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the matches what we need them to win and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.170 
the matches what we need them to win and
look<00:01:46.079> at<00:01:46.259> all<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.040> no<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.399> knows<00:01:47.579> what<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
look at all so no one knows what the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.580 
look at all so no one knows what the
standard<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.290> had<00:01:49.439> our

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
standard is going to be like we had our

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260 
standard is going to be like we had our
high<00:01:49.770> hopes<00:01:50.009> coming<00:01:50.399> here<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.119> just

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
high hopes coming here but we just

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.179 
high hopes coming here but we just
didn't<00:01:51.600> know<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.500> soon<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.890> started

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
didn't know but as soon as we started

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.370 
didn't know but as soon as we started
playing<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.729> recognized<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:55.170> could<00:01:55.320> get

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
playing and recognized that we could get

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.080 
playing and recognized that we could get
on<00:01:55.530> top<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.740> teams<00:01:56.040> I've<00:01:56.520> always<00:01:56.729> got<00:01:56.939> very

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.999 
on top of teams I've always got very
excited<00:01:57.180> about<00:01:57.600> playing<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.500> think<00:01:58.920> they

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
excited about playing and I think they

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.500 
excited about playing and I think they
express<00:01:59.340> themselves<00:01:59.520> really<00:02:00.000> well<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.149> the
