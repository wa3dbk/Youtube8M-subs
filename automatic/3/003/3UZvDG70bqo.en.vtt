00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
think it was the Scout that was up there

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.229 
think it was the Scout that was up there
but<00:00:43.829> not<00:00:44.250> really<00:00:44.460> sure<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.850> coulda<00:00:45.000> been<00:00:45.030> one

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
but not really sure that coulda been one

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.049 
but not really sure that coulda been one
or<00:00:45.329> two<00:00:45.360> more<00:00:45.570> people<00:00:46.070> but<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.700> said<00:00:47.760> we're
