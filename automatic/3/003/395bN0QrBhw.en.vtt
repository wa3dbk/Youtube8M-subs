00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.069
 hi how are you all good today as you 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.280
 I said in the last tutorial let's see 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.740
 circular tissue to start if not 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.959
 let's do a huge thing already but 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.390
 let's start with the techniques of 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:19.870
 assembled the points so that they can 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.390
 choose the one that suits them the most 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.800
 agree on what you are going to do 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.870
 rapporteur is one prefers one over another 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.260
 because good because it 's easier 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.410
 so let's see that there are two types 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.680
 of assembled points one that is from 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.770
 of chains yes and another that is with the 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.510
 magic ring person and those are two 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.820
 ways and apart there are two ways to 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.610
 start with a closed circle or with a 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.110
 open circle so let's see those 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.360
 four ways surely I'm going to 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.100
 split into various videos so go 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.850
 following the numbers so you do not 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.370
 lose any good let's start 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.879
 As I told you, it can be mounted 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.519
 closed or openly see if here 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.140
 this one has two turns the part of the 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.810
 center is well closed and this one is 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.050
 open these are the two ways in how 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.840
 you will see the tissues but there are also 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.450
 different ways of doing this and of 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.590
 do this there are two ways to ride like 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:25.760
 I said there are with chains or with ring 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.290
 magical the two can do these two 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.299
 ways can be done with any of 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.310
 the two techniques so they can choose 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.680
 the one that they like the most 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.380
 agree to those that are comfortable 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.230
 or the skin being because the other one 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.120
 I hate and are not going to go well I'm going to 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.740
 show first what is with chain and 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.860
 who are already familiar with the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.500
 chains 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.710
 well to do the circle closed with 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.780
 assembled chain is made the following 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.370
 obviously and we will do every good thing is 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.810
 First 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:01.770
 the knot and from here we are going to knit 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.439
 two chains up 1 2 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.299
 the first chain is going to be the place 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.149
 where we are going to leave all the points 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.560
 now they will see it and the second account 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.110
 as a string of height like that then 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.400
 in this place we are going to weave for example 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.400
 six points and 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.090
 one 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.070
 2 this is similar as when they are done 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.870
 the increases and they teach them in the 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.170
 video past always weave in the same 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.170
 place 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.240
 4 come and go 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.900
 as for all the little girl 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900
 5 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.160
 once we arrived here 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.780
 can pull a little bit of the video from 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.990
 behind 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.720
 and in the first point see this is the 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.670
 first pin I'll try to 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.720
 approach as much as possible this is the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.760
 first spike there will weave what is 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.319
 dwarf point flame ensure that always 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.030
 I told them the point of nothing, not the 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.580
 point of nothing not good this is erc a 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.230
 summer for this reason I never taught it 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.500
 because it is necessary for moments of 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.930
 close but here we have one that is done 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.390
 a loop is taken and nothing is done 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:27.450
 simply pass it directly is a 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.450
 past point and see is closed 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.600
 one of them usually does not want 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.880
 well closed come here 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.080
 You can pass your finger a little bit but 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.000
 you can usually hide that is the 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.120
 phase that has this technique I prefer 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.120
 the magic ring technique if I want 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.910
 that is extremely closed 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.910
 then from here I will continue 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.860
 weaving the circle yes 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.100
 that now I'm not going to show you because 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.150
 so I can show you other techniques 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.270
 this we will see in a video 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.170
 next good then I think it has 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.690
 this technique is that I simply have 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.850
 the chains and yew on the string like this 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.650
 I do not have to do anything in the air on 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.830
 magic ring is like more in the air 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.410
 but it's much more verbose then no 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.240
 have to see last can one 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.400
 practice the magic ring until you 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.320
 go out to achieve prolixity or use 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.660
 this technique is not so bad but 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.140
 good as you see leaves a lot of times 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.940
 wish let's see now then how 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.940
 do it with the magic ring 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.350
 he disarmed it like that and we're going to make the ring 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.289
 magical 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.900
 and I said go and things like that 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:51.070
 Like how we will do 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:54.010
 the opening point of the beginning 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.180
 we get here if they want to come back to one 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.720
 of the first videos of the text 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.530
 explained and instead of throwing and that 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.480
 would generate the sliding point let's 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.630
 do the following 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.470
 we do that we weave and we're going to 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.180
 leave so open if this the beginning 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.660
 when you do not know much how to handle yourself 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.820
 with your hands it tends to deform and 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:22.090
 knotting or not knowing one where you have 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.800
 to put your fingers but after a 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.360
 practice time one managed to understand 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.180
 What is the position where it has to 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.930
 be the idea is that the work always goes 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.460
 to stay on the left side if in the 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.100
 if they are left-handed guadiaro del 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.360
 right side the thread that goes towards the 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.310
 Ball has to be left behind 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.860
 as always and here they will have this 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.440
 Sarita not pull eye see here 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.660
 because this will get rid easier 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.880
 then to work it out a little we are going to 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.930
 hold so they see their I have a ring 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.850
 we hold 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.699
 and we are going to make a good chain 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.449
 adjusted if this will no longer ensure us 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.039
 a little but a little and now we're going to 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.470
 weave about this ring hopes to say 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.850
 but that's very big we're going to have to 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.220
 cover all this and there's going to be a 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.350
 hole what the ring has is that it is 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.690
 magically just and then it closes 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.490
 only now will they see it then we are going to 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.630
 ride the same amount of six points 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.820
 points and one see that yew hugging everything 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.320
 the ring as if it were wrapping 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.320
 the two 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.110
 yes and I'm knitting on the thread 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.160
 also of the ring and the strand 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.120
 4 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.120
 5 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.580
 6 we got up to 6 points which is what 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.530
 same as we had before and what are we going to 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.220
 do let's take the remaining thread 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:48.199
 here and carefully without doing too much 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:52.000
 we're not going to shoot and look at what 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:53.980
 what happens closes on itself 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.040
 and once we have this we do what 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.530
 same as before we passed the needle by the 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.610
 first point and the first spike is 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.320
 there we took an armful and we closed with 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.660
 what is called dwarf point and they see that 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.520
 this is tightly closed you do not see 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.520
 absolutely nothing through 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:20.119
 now in the next video we will see 

00:07:16.549 --> 00:07:23.509
 how to make this structure so be it 

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:26.629
 based on chains or based on ring 

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:29.209
 magic you can do this circle with 

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:31.669
 the gap in the middle yes and from 

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:33.979
 this continue weaving obviously good 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:37.959
 follow the other tutorial so you can see 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:37.959
 how to do it until then
