of<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> best<00:00:19.289> hunting<00:00:19.770> guts<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.070> I've<00:00:20.279> boned

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
of the best hunting guts that I've boned

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.390 
of the best hunting guts that I've boned
it's<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> next<00:00:21.660> factor<00:00:22.020> gut<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.439> took<00:00:23.160> six

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
it's the next factor gut that took six

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.820 
it's the next factor gut that took six
months<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.699> break<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:25.080> not<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.289> deep<00:00:25.619> well

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
months to break in it's not a deep well

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.980 
months to break in it's not a deep well
broke<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.279> gut<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.820> semi<00:00:27.210> broken<00:00:27.599> gut<00:00:27.779> so

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
broke in gut it's a semi broken gut so

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.750 
broke in gut it's a semi broken gut so
it's<00:00:28.560> easier<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.949> run<00:00:29.099> during<00:00:29.279> hunting<00:00:29.670> you

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
it's easier to run during hunting you

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.189 
it's easier to run during hunting you
can<00:00:29.849> get<00:00:29.939> those<00:00:30.060> different<00:00:30.449> notes<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.960> got

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
can get those different notes it's got

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.139 
can get those different notes it's got
good<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> transition<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.610> very<00:00:32.790> smooth

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
good on the transition it's very smooth

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.720 
good on the transition it's very smooth
yet<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.590> deep<00:00:34.800> broken<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.399> takes<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
yet it's not so deep broken that takes a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.580 
yet it's not so deep broken that takes a
lot<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.969> air<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> going<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
lot of air so this is going to be the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.170 
lot of air so this is going to be the
dead<00:00:37.800> end<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.250> said<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.640> got<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.910> speeds

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
dead end like I said it's got the speeds

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.430 
dead end like I said it's got the speeds
got<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> high<00:00:39.690> pitch<00:00:39.930> we're<00:00:40.140> going<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.320> give

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
got the high pitch we're going to give

00:00:40.440 --> 00:01:10.640 
got the high pitch we're going to give
you<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> little<00:00:40.800> sound<00:00:41.040> bite<00:00:41.219> here<00:01:09.650> good

ones we're coming out with is one of our

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.320 
ones we're coming out with is one of our
flute<00:01:19.710> style<00:01:20.040> calls<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> little<00:01:21.240> bit

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
flute style calls it's a little bit

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.820 
flute style calls it's a little bit
different<00:01:21.509> cuz<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> blows<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> short<00:01:22.650> Reed

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
different cuz it blows like a short Reed

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.620 
different cuz it blows like a short Reed
it's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.549> little<00:01:23.729> bit<00:01:23.820> shorter<00:01:24.180> than<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.390> lot<00:01:24.600> of

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
it's a little bit shorter than a lot of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.080 
it's a little bit shorter than a lot of
the<00:01:24.840> flutes<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.460> shortened<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the flutes out there we shortened up the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.120 
the flutes out there we shortened up the
insert<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.600> tighten<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> bore<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
insert we tighten the bore and then the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.440 
insert we tighten the bore and then the
barrel<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:29.579> we<00:01:29.670> did<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.030> barrels<00:01:30.329> we

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
barrel what we did with the barrels we

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.850 
barrel what we did with the barrels we
experimented<00:01:30.900> open<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.530> little<00:01:31.710> what<00:01:31.829> we

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
experimented open up a little what we

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
experimented open up a little what we
call<00:01:31.979> gloto<00:01:32.640> which<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.090> more<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.390> an<00:01:33.479> opening

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
call gloto which is more of an opening

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.170 
call gloto which is more of an opening
around<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> guts<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.579> give<00:01:35.729> them<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.970> more

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
around the guts to give them a more

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.940 
around the guts to give them a more
hollow<00:01:36.420> system<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.470> we're<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> pick

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
hollow system now we're going to pick

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
hollow system now we're going to pick
this<00:01:38.100> thing<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:39.420> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> operate

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
this thing up it's going to operate

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780 
this thing up it's going to operate
pretty<00:01:40.380> much<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> same<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> short<00:01:41.400> read<00:01:41.579> but

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
pretty much the same as a short read but

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.130 
pretty much the same as a short read but
I'm<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.909> open<00:01:42.210> my<00:01:42.329> throat<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:42.869> bit<00:01:42.960> more

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
I'm I open my throat a little bit more

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.260 
I'm I open my throat a little bit more
by<00:01:43.649> opening<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.070> throat<00:01:44.430> allowing<00:01:44.970> more<00:01:45.149> of

by opening that throat allowing more of
the<00:01:45.420> vocalization<00:01:45.899> voice<00:01:46.860> inflection<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.729> my

both great calls just different
