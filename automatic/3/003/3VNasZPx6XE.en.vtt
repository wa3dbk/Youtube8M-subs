00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.180

 wait less than a big scene is a 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.650
 carnivore with an insatiable appetite and a 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.840
 unfortunate reflection of noises 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.020
 untimely 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.330
 he believes himself invincible but soon he 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.150
 mind that it is not 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.470
 or maybe it's not a little the heat of 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.660
 desert and the use of the failed 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.460
 technology in addition to the stubborn 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.130
 insistence on the exclusive use of

 acme corporation as a supplier 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.730

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.070
 inexperience putting himself and a 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.780
 very risky situation intelligence 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.370
 is tested his ability is 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.290
 questioned in a desperate attempt 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.449
 for catching the fastest bird in the 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.100
 desert what was supposed to be a mere challenge 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.870
 it shoots like a spiral out of 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.210
 control and it becomes a fight of 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.210
 survival and survive 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.869
 Coyote has planned his attack to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.610
 finally catch its prey 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.740
 find behind the fastest bird and 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.740
 elusive of the world the roadrunner 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.670
 the desert is in the southwest 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.130
 american the plan is to place glue 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.870
 in the middle of the interstate 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.850
 605 the favorite place to run from 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.400
 roadrunners but what the coyote does not 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.230
 know is that its remote location far 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.820
 of civilization is an invitation 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.820
 to run for truckers 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.350
 in these instants the brain of the coyote 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.270
 is going through what the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.340
 specialists call concussion 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.259
 but for some miraculous reason its 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.000
 bloodstream shoots a substance 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.920
 unknown that causes your brain 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.290
 come back to reality with a simple 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.140
 head shake 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.819
 or me who is preparing your next attack is 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.859
 sure that with his new skates 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.260
 Acme brand rocket that ordered by mail 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:22.290
 and a string will finally reach its 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.290
 objective 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.770
 the thorns embedded in the buttocks 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.170
 of color cause you what the doctors 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.910
 they call adrenaline on steroids the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.830
 thorns send a stream of blood to the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.050
 head that allows him to survive what 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.090
 happens afterwards in an attempt by 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.660
 get rid of the train just do things 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.660
 worse 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.110
 after several attempts to catch 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.120
 when you accelerate and between lived the temple and 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.540
 the patience of the coyote begin to 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.540
 wear out 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.860
 inside the stomach of the coyote his 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.620
 muscles contract repeatedly 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.210
 asking him to eat something because of 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.310
 state of malnutrition in which 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.300
 finds only one hour left before 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.300
 that he starts hallucinating 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.100
 his stubborn determination to catch 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.870
 the roadrunner is only surpassed by 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.560
 his unalterable faith towards the corporation 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.560
 acne 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.180
 after 360 days of hard hunting the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.980
 coyote and finally finds himself at 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.980
 reach of your delicious goal 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.380
 but when you do your approximation your level 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.510
 of hunger is so intense that hardly 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.730
 have energy to move the muscles of 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.830
 his fingers becoming unable to 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.160
 capture or even squeeze your 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.160
 dam 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.530
 i 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.940
 the coyote has not given up on 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.220
 his mission to catch the roadrunner 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.139
 in fact it returns every day to 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.819
 desert that put his determination and his 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.280
 hungry to test or as one would say 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:45.280
 colloquially here we go again
