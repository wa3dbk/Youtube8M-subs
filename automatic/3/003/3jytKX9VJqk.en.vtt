00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.880
 and the sound of the radio 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:10.000
 it has been for me and it will continue to be 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.420
 forever 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.410
 the shortest way to understand the 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:21.110
 path of friendship 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:24.890

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.080

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.000
 I want to earn my bread kill others 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.980

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.480
 charlatans who want to earn their bread 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.270
 with the sweat of my brow not of his 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:13.140
 in front of other commitments already have 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.070
 quite with returning his presence to the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.250
 mediocrity but us and us if 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.390

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.490
 as you also know about my little 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.360
 condition and that the doctor recommended 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.550
 a few days of rest 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.260
 and that's why once 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:43.590
 once again I'm paying attention and I want 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.710

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:24.030

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:28.140
