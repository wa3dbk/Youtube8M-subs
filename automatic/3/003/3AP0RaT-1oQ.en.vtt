00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.290
 So the decision to leave more since then has several reasons 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.349
 the first reason and the most important reason is that that counts 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.349
 fix authorities my brother's illness 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.160
 but of course we had no information 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.880
 we just had this information the weather is going to be bad 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.599
 we had to somehow under 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.019
 We had a red cigarette and no other information 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.949
 Number two we knew 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.170
 I knew now also the most difficult passages in the opera 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.719
 Quandt 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.719
 from the last camp pilgrimage were not insured 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.470
 because I had before over an insured Gupta alone under 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.560
 My brother and he has power 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.730
 had promised this track too safe with 200 meters freestyle 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.420
 This has not happened in the most difficult passages and we are in spite of it 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.890
 this fact 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.600
 continued in personal responsibility after we met 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.160
 at the top of the tipping everything because my brother is weak and not more 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.819
 familiar 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.469
 to go down over this band and with it is already the first piece in 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:07.710
 the one on the wall 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.870
 but always with the small hopes 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.680
 under Merkel Scharte that is, so to speak, on the edge between the applied and 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.550
 propaganda 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.130
 but up to there we are not on the ascent route but over one 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.880
 other route descended 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.040
 to call for help because for me was also clear bad weather collection 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.320
 a very short, fair weather window that can still be used no one is coming 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.200
 to 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.960
 that's why my acceptance as someone who can always be whoever that was before 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 at the beginning yes not the only come because of us 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.840
 and when these two tracks and Scholz could not climb to us because the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.950
 Distance between them and us was too difficult 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.600
 too dangerous was too steep 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.420
 we had no choice 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.020
 there is no other solution. "Of course we would have ARD West 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.720
 Shoulder over the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.040
 over the southwest has appeared later or can descend though 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.910
 someone knows something 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.800
 luckily it did not do that who else is not here 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.700
 because we could also have descended on the route a which has nine goals 78th 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.769
 Solo had done that would have been easier and probably will 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.319
 associated with less risks but not recognizable from above from above 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.339
 is there because descent to single abyss 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:21.930
 it was just conceivable just to go down and hope somehow 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.590
 on this American Pie to come from Berit knew from the history and 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.080
 Where Mama climbed in 1895 I did not believe Gartner even without the equipment 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.759
 Equipment can do its text 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:38.839
 It has also proven itself and shown but we will never 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:40.940
 descended on the applied 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.269
 if we did not absolutely have just this appearance 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.950
 No and the other two would be 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.339
 by virtue of 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.549
 the equipment came down 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.069
 "We others not only had equipment very much, it has one and all 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.660
 With 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.659
 Great 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.510
 Percent higher RÃ¶thlin Rest prepared that did not have the problem 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.440
 accept 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.380
 I have a last good weather window should they knew the weather 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.389
 stays fine 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.399
 and got up and had one behind 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:13.399
 Percent deer team the the most difficult passages in the markets 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:17.529
 If you have assured that they know that they are fixed on the descent is a find 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:22.169
 Get into the last camp, which we basically wanted to do but with us it has 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.139
 my brother did not make the decision if you did 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.619
 imitate what he is allowed to do why not even the 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.739
 Making a decision I'm not going to let this summit and Metal not 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:32.329
 escape
