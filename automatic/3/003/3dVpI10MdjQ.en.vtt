00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 all beaver dear friends with you wendy and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.500
 today we will talk about the page on 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.440
 the site 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.870
 indie db scott himself created this page 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.190
 the fact that scott himself created this page 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.349
 can be identified by nick 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.900
 they go as stated on his website 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.379
 is his official nickname on indie 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.869
 db 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.670
 usually there is an interesting game 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.189
 chip firstly the fact of creation 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.130
 pages on go db proves the site 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.380
 was not hacked by anyone and that the whole teaser on 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.000
 Scott's website hints at fnaf 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.009
 4 on any films 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.719
 Well, I will immediately say a little bit interesting 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.640
 information was such a rumor 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.340
 that he will develop the fourth 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.800
 part of the new engine is not written here 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.140
 game engine and this is multimedia fusion 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.719
 the same as always so expect 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.200
 Something 4 parts in terms of graphic not 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.610
 it will still be 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.989
 point-n-click game by the way if suddenly 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.910
 someone interesting can go to 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.370
 the description of the link there I talked about 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.469
 possible gameplay so here 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.109
 Usually this page is created for the game. 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.850
 five nights at freddy's much later he 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.220
 never created it so early 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.930
 the game is essentially only just the tee back 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.939
 and he has already created a page on which 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.280
 usually puts out a haze if we 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.260
 remember after about five 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.360
 nights at freddys 3 on this page 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.729
 five nights at herself soon appeared 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.650
 freddys 3 as a game I certainly do not undertake 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.659
 argue that this page means what 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.970
 the game is actually released before the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.030
 more than that , the date itself is written here 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.890
 fourth quarter of 2015 but it's like 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.619
 it seems strange scott just thought 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.540
 why not at the end 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.820
 Iâ€™m an adult man can do what 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.009
 I want to create a page I want to do 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.680
 the game is basically nothing special 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.950
 there is no new one the same pictures 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.920
 same nightmare but one interesting 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.149
 thing still has an icon 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.670
 you say you are a beaver nafs a fool 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.399
 A member of this icon chip is that the game 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.710
 called five nights at freddy's in 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.590
 the third part he specifically so moved away from 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.020
 of the name of the old on the icons of the bath 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.630
 but personally it seems to me that after 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.610
 days of the part he should do 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.769
 the hero freddie so personally i 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.750
 guess the nightmare of this 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.769
 ikonochka says that this nightmare 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.530
 is freddie 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.720
 maybe I'll screw up taxes a little more 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.489
 facts in this money box and maybe in 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.980
 a short video with you to talk about it yet 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.769
 One interesting fact is the name of the game five 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.140
 nights at freddy's 4 to financial chapter in 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.420
 translating the final chapter so apparently 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.060
 despite the fact that we were all hoping that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.269
 this is not the last this chapter 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.730
 is final right officially 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.739
 confirmed in the title even though 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.110
 In fact, he most likely created this page. 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.079
 due to the fact that there is a lot 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.690
 fakes and therefore considered what it costs 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.390
 create a page now because then 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.160
 it may take some fake so 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.950
 that I would not look for any deep 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.720
 sense in this event but enough 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.790
 interesting fact on this is all expensive 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.810
 friends all thanks for watching bye 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.810
 bye bye good luck
