money in our budget to spend and it was

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.780 
money in our budget to spend and it was
very<00:04:55.210> cost<00:04:55.510> effective<00:04:56.020> we<00:04:56.400> we<00:04:57.400> didn't<00:04:57.610> want<00:04:57.760> to

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
very cost effective we we didn't want to

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.220 
very cost effective we we didn't want to
get<00:04:57.940> rid<00:04:57.970> of<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.270> vines<00:04:58.480> we<00:04:58.810> didn't<00:04:59.020> want<00:04:59.170> to

get rid of the vines we didn't want to
put<00:04:59.410> in<00:04:59.560> new<00:04:59.770> trellising<00:05:00.370> so<00:05:00.670> it<00:05:01.270> worked<00:05:01.840> very

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
put in new trellising so it worked very

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.260 
put in new trellising so it worked very
well<00:05:02.170> for<00:05:02.350> us<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.920> biggest<00:05:03.520> problem<00:05:03.970> we<00:05:04.090> had

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
well for us the biggest problem we had

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.920 
well for us the biggest problem we had
was<00:05:04.420> sunburn<00:05:04.870> on<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.380> on<00:05:05.920> the<00:05:06.190> fruit<00:05:06.490> and<00:05:06.930> it's

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
was sunburn on the on the fruit and it's

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.930 
was sunburn on the on the fruit and it's
actually<00:05:08.320> made<00:05:08.500> it<00:05:08.650> a<00:05:08.710> lot<00:05:08.860> easier<00:05:09.220> for<00:05:09.400> us<00:05:09.520> to

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
actually made it a lot easier for us to

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.680 
actually made it a lot easier for us to
put<00:05:10.870> our<00:05:11.050> wires<00:05:11.290> in<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:12.060> take<00:05:13.060> them<00:05:13.240> down<00:05:13.450> at

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
put our wires in and take them down at

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.240 
put our wires in and take them down at
pruning<00:05:14.410> time<00:05:14.910> very<00:05:15.910> easy<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.300> use<00:05:17.040> many<00:05:18.040> rods
