00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.220
 hello friends today we will learn to make a 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.299
 cushion cited in heart - shaped 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:15.799
 materials are felt red 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:19.640
 fill a scissors down a pistol 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:23.449
 of silicon and a white sheet 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:28.300
 As a first step we will take the sheet 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.300
 white color we will fold it in half 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.379
 and we will draw half of a heart 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.850
 once marked to our heart 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.850
 we will continue to cut it 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.750
 once finished trimming 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.170
 we will open and we will see that we have our 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.810
 heart 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:06.150
 then we will take a piece of felt 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:10.490
 and we will cut our mold 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.100
 we must cut two hearts 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.970
 once finished trimming our 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.870
 hearts will remain like this 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:24.010
 what follows is that we will start to put 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.700
 silicon what are the edges of the 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.700
 of the heart 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.960
 let's get together the two 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.510
 so that it is not as soon as it is 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.780
 can so that our 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.730
 silicone is a small opening for 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.730
 enter what is the stuffing 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.899
 we will introduce what we create 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.039
 necessary or the size they want 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.039
 be your heart 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.740
 since we introduce everything that is the 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.310
 filling we will stick the opening that 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.310
 we leave 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.200
 in the end 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.250
 finally we finished hitting everything 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.550
 we will have our cushion quoted from 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:28.280
