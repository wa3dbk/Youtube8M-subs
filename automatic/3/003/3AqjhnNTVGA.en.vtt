00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
nervous as well I'm excited to see what

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.610 
nervous as well I'm excited to see what
it<00:00:43.469> finished<00:00:43.770> got<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.070> store<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.309> us<00:00:45.620> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it finished got in store for us the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.290 
it finished got in store for us the
first<00:00:46.860> challenge<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:47.520> face<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.090> what

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
first challenge that they face is what

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.930 
first challenge that they face is what
we<00:00:48.420> call<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> psychometric<00:00:49.500> test<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:50.520> had<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
we call a psychometric test we had a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.990 
we call a psychometric test we had a
team<00:00:51.449> deliberation<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.590> design<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> factory<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
team deliberation to design a factory I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.340 
team deliberation to design a factory I
think<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> biggest<00:00:54.480> challenge<00:00:54.899> was<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
think the biggest challenge was there to

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.510 
think the biggest challenge was there to
work<00:00:55.500> together<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.039> don't<00:00:56.160> really<00:00:56.340> know

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
work together but you don't really know

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.189 
work together but you don't really know
each<00:00:56.550> other<00:00:56.730> strengths<00:00:57.210> or<00:00:57.329> weaknesses<00:00:57.360> we

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
each other strengths or weaknesses we

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.299 
each other strengths or weaknesses we
can<00:00:58.350> actually<00:00:58.620> observe<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:59.039> kind<00:00:59.219> of

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
can actually observe what kind of

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.010 
can actually observe what kind of
leadership<00:00:59.609> skills<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.180> they<00:01:00.270> present<00:01:00.750> what

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
leadership skills can they present what

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.450 
leadership skills can they present what
kind<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.230> ideas<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:01.890> bring<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.309> table

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
kind of ideas do they bring to the table

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.130 
kind of ideas do they bring to the table
the<00:01:02.789> second<00:01:03.120> task<00:01:03.300> was<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.840> build<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140

tremendously<00:01:08.729> difficult<00:01:09.000> initially<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:10.020> had

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
tremendously difficult initially we had

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.660 
tremendously difficult initially we had
to<00:01:10.200> figure<00:01:10.320> out<00:01:10.560> how<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.860> support<00:01:11.460> the
