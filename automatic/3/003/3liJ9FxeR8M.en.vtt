00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
hi this is tim from latest VDS games and

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.379 
hi this is tim from latest VDS games and
i<00:00:09.710> had<00:00:09.890> another<00:00:10.130> chance<00:00:10.400> to<00:00:10.610> get<00:00:10.910> my<00:00:11.059> hands<00:00:11.330> on

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
i had another chance to get my hands on

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.100 
i had another chance to get my hands on
a<00:00:11.450> nintendo<00:00:12.050> 3ds<00:00:12.080> XL<00:00:12.790> so<00:00:13.790> I<00:00:13.820> took<00:00:14.330> along<00:00:14.420> my<00:00:14.719> 3ds

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
a nintendo 3ds XL so I took along my 3ds

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.840 
a nintendo 3ds XL so I took along my 3ds
and<00:00:15.350> did<00:00:15.469> a<00:00:15.500> little<00:00:15.770> bit<00:00:15.950> of<00:00:15.980> comparison<00:00:16.490> so

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
and did a little bit of comparison so

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.870 
and did a little bit of comparison so
you<00:00:16.940> can<00:00:17.090> see<00:00:17.300> the<00:00:17.450> size<00:00:18.020> difference<00:00:18.050> I<00:00:18.890> tried

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
you can see the size difference I tried

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.640 
you can see the size difference I tried
to<00:00:20.030> cover<00:00:20.270> as<00:00:20.420> much<00:00:20.660> as<00:00:20.810> I<00:00:20.870> could<00:00:21.140> but<00:00:21.380> I<00:00:21.410> was

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
to cover as much as I could but I was

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.280 
to cover as much as I could but I was
limited<00:00:22.160> on<00:00:22.280> time<00:00:22.550> so<00:00:23.450> there<00:00:23.660> you<00:00:23.780> go<00:00:23.960> with<00:00:24.110> my

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
limited on time so there you go with my

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.190 
limited on time so there you go with my
3ds<00:00:24.740> on<00:00:24.980> top<00:00:25.310> of<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:25.610> red<00:00:25.970> one<00:00:26.200> unfortunately

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
3ds on top of the red one unfortunately

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.360 
3ds on top of the red one unfortunately
they<00:00:27.320> didn't<00:00:27.680> have<00:00:27.830> all<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.070> colors

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.370 
they didn't have all the colors

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.210 
they didn't have all the colors
available<00:00:29.140> now<00:00:30.140> I<00:00:30.170> took<00:00:30.350> a<00:00:30.500> few<00:00:30.710> other<00:00:30.860> shots

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
available now I took a few other shots

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.180 
available now I took a few other shots
as<00:00:31.970> you<00:00:32.119> can<00:00:32.360> see<00:00:32.599> so<00:00:33.260> there's<00:00:33.469> a<00:00:33.530> comparison

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
as you can see so there's a comparison

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.090 
as you can see so there's a comparison
of<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:34.489> width<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.149> actually<00:00:36.110> appears<00:00:36.500> almost

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
of the width and actually appears almost

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.450 
of the width and actually appears almost
identical<00:00:37.879> but<00:00:37.910> I<00:00:38.210> haven't<00:00:38.510> got<00:00:38.629> any<00:00:38.749> exact

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
identical but I haven't got any exact

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.889 
identical but I haven't got any exact
dimensions<00:00:40.460> in<00:00:40.579> this<00:00:40.730> video<00:00:41.030> but<00:00:41.269> I<00:00:41.300> will<00:00:41.390> do

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
dimensions in this video but I will do

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.720 
dimensions in this video but I will do
that<00:00:42.019> in<00:00:42.109> another<00:00:42.199> video<00:00:42.530> again<00:00:43.249> another

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
that in another video again another

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.799 
that in another video again another
comparison<00:00:44.469> so<00:00:45.469> there's<00:00:45.679> not<00:00:45.829> really<00:00:46.100> any

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
comparison so there's not really any

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.950 
comparison so there's not really any
huge<00:00:47.809> difference<00:00:48.260> obviously<00:00:48.589> is<00:00:48.739> is<00:00:49.460> bigger

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
huge difference obviously is is bigger

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.369 
huge difference obviously is is bigger
it's<00:00:51.010> surprisingly<00:00:52.010> lightweight<00:00:52.550> though<00:00:52.789> and

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
it's surprisingly lightweight though and

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.950 
it's surprisingly lightweight though and
it<00:00:54.379> has<00:00:54.559> got<00:00:54.890> matte<00:00:55.219> finish<00:00:55.670> again<00:00:56.629> here's<00:00:56.899> the

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
it has got matte finish again here's the

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.799 
it has got matte finish again here's the
other<00:00:57.219> side<00:00:58.219> reversed<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.300> then<00:00:59.449> here's<00:00:59.749> a

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
other side reversed so then here's a

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.630 
other side reversed so then here's a
quick<00:01:00.019> look<00:01:00.229> at<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.530> actual<00:01:00.859> wear<00:01:01.159> front<00:01:01.429> face

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
quick look at the actual wear front face

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.450 
quick look at the actual wear front face
and<00:01:01.909> it<00:01:02.749> looks<00:01:02.960> quite<00:01:03.199> nice<00:01:03.319> in<00:01:03.559> red<00:01:03.739> still

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
and it looks quite nice in red still

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.010 
and it looks quite nice in red still
thinking<00:01:04.909> I<00:01:04.940> might<00:01:05.089> like<00:01:05.269> lean<00:01:05.510> towards<00:01:05.930> the

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
thinking I might like lean towards the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.399 
thinking I might like lean towards the
blue<00:01:07.210> but<00:01:08.210> as<00:01:08.479> I<00:01:08.630> said<00:01:08.690> it's<00:01:08.930> got<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:09.140> nice

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
blue but as I said it's got this nice

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.950 
blue but as I said it's got this nice
matte<00:01:09.800> finish<00:01:09.830> on<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:10.689> although<00:01:11.689> it<00:01:11.840> is

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
matte finish on it and although it is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.780 
matte finish on it and although it is
surprisingly<00:01:12.439> lightweight<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:13.250> does<00:01:13.520> feel

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
surprisingly lightweight it does feel

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.209 
surprisingly lightweight it does feel
really<00:01:14.119> nice<00:01:14.450> in<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.750> hand<00:01:14.950> it's<00:01:15.950> kind<00:01:16.159> of

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
really nice in the hand it's kind of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.709 
really nice in the hand it's kind of
been<00:01:16.399> rounded<00:01:16.820> off<00:01:16.939> at<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.210> edges<00:01:17.509> here's

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
been rounded off at the edges here's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.069 
been rounded off at the edges here's
another<00:01:17.930> view<00:01:18.229> of<00:01:18.759> another<00:01:19.759> side<00:01:20.210> of<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.750> 3ds

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
another view of another side of the 3ds

another view of another side of the 3ds
XL<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:21.829> s-sorry<00:01:22.579> some<00:01:22.850> of<00:01:22.939> these<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:23.090> bit

XL and s-sorry some of these a bit

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.859 
XL and s-sorry some of these a bit
blurry<00:01:23.600> it's<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.810> bit<00:01:23.960> difficult<00:01:24.320> balancing

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
blurry it's a bit difficult balancing

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.580 
blurry it's a bit difficult balancing
and<00:01:26.869> here's<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.770> close-up<00:01:28.399> shot<00:01:28.579> of<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:29.590> the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
and here's a close-up shot of the the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.539 
and here's a close-up shot of the the
thumb<00:01:31.250> pad<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.789> cross<00:01:31.969> pad<00:01:32.619> d-pad<00:01:33.649> and<00:01:33.829> again

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
thumb pad and cross pad d-pad and again

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.359 
thumb pad and cross pad d-pad and again
of<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.759> buns<00:01:35.000> which<00:01:35.270> felt<00:01:35.649> very<00:01:36.649> similar

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
of the buns which felt very similar

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.590 
of the buns which felt very similar
although<00:01:37.640> again<00:01:38.000> they've<00:01:38.149> got<00:01:38.299> a<00:01:38.329> matte

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
although again they've got a matte

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.090 
although again they've got a matte
finish<00:01:38.750> they<00:01:39.049> do<00:01:39.109> feel<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.530> little<00:01:39.950> bit

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
finish they do feel a little bit

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.520 
finish they do feel a little bit
different<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.609> the<00:01:40.700> original<00:01:41.200> 3dsxl

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
different to the original 3dsxl

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.310 
different to the original 3dsxl
so<00:01:42.950> that's<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.280> back<00:01:43.520> here<00:01:43.880> in<00:01:44.210> my<00:01:44.750> video<00:01:45.049> and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
so that's the back here in my video and

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.800 
so that's the back here in my video and
just<00:01:45.680> showing<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.430> around<00:01:46.490> very<00:01:47.450> quickly

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
just showing you around very quickly

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.910 
just showing you around very quickly
around<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.229> sides<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:51.380> know<00:01:51.500> it's<00:01:51.710> got<00:01:51.890> a

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
around the sides and you know it's got a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.130 
around the sides and you know it's got a
slightly<00:01:52.549> more<00:01:52.820> plasticky<00:01:53.450> feel<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:53.990> is

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
slightly more plasticky feel it is

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.819 
slightly more plasticky feel it is
actually<00:01:54.579> surprisingly<00:01:55.579> well<00:01:55.880> built<00:01:56.210> and

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
actually surprisingly well built and

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.749 
actually surprisingly well built and
although<00:01:57.829> it's<00:01:58.039> got<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:58.219> different<00:01:58.369> build

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
although it's got a different build

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.219 
although it's got a different build
quality<00:01:58.939> to<00:01:59.359> the<00:01:59.450> original<00:01:59.780> 3ds

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
quality to the original 3ds

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.730 
quality to the original 3ds
it<00:02:00.920> feels<00:02:01.579> pretty<00:02:01.759> sturdy<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.689> know<00:02:03.200> it

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
it feels pretty sturdy and you know it

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
you can honestly see although it looks

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.260 
you can honestly see although it looks

together when playing a game Mario I've

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.340 
together when playing a game Mario I've
got<00:03:01.400> at<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.640> end<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.000> video<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:03.050> they've

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
got at the end of this video and they've

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.470 
got at the end of this video and they've
done<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.530> remarkable<00:03:04.280> job<00:03:04.340> really<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:05.120> still

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
done a remarkable job really it still

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.160 
done a remarkable job really it still
looks<00:03:05.690> just<00:03:05.900> as<00:03:06.080> good<00:03:06.260> as<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.340> original<00:03:07.430> 3ds

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
looks just as good as the original 3ds

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.020 
looks just as good as the original 3ds
and<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.320> think<00:03:09.500> they've<00:03:09.620> got<00:03:09.740> like<00:03:10.030> an

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
and I think they've got like an

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.730 
and I think they've got like an
anti-glare<00:03:11.540> screen<00:03:11.660> on<00:03:12.110> there<00:03:12.230> now<00:03:12.380> which<00:03:12.590> is

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
anti-glare screen on there now which is

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.280 
anti-glare screen on there now which is
great<00:03:12.950> news<00:03:13.490> especially<00:03:14.390> for<00:03:14.570> videoing<00:03:15.050> if

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
great news especially for videoing if

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.160 
great news especially for videoing if
you<00:03:15.440> have<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.650> do<00:03:15.800> it<00:03:15.920> late<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.780> day<00:03:17.930> time

you have to do it late in the day time
for<00:03:18.560> my<00:03:18.830> purposes<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.430> it's<00:03:19.550> gonna<00:03:19.820> be
