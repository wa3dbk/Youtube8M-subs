00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.640
 Tome is studying for the tests in 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.490
 weekend he will spend a fifth 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.460
 the weekend studying what fraction of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.759
 weekend take take is going to spend studying 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.410
 for each of the four materials to be 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.119
 spend the same amount of time 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.859
 studying for each one 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.630
 the total time he will spend 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.449
 studying is a fifth of the weekend and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.369
 you have to divide it into four parts 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.679
 equal this is the time that Tommy will 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.770
 spend on each subject so it goes 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.500
 divide this by four 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.070
 we have already seen that dividing by a number 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.430
 is equal to multiplying for your reason 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.390
 inverse which is the inverse ratio of 4 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:55.170
 just remember that four is 4 out of 11 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:01:00.960
 about 5/4 on one equals 1 on 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:04.199
 five times one out of four and we can 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.360
 see this as a quarter of a fifth or 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.790
 one-fifth of a quarter is so much more 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.460
 We multiply the numerators expected to arrive 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.310
 to one after we multiply the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.220
 denominators four times five of the 20 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.350
 then he will spend a twentieth of the end 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.840
 study week for each subject 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.689
 Let's try to visualize this let's go 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.070
 imagine that this is the whole weekend 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.530
 Tommy shares in five equal parts 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.329
 We already know he's going to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.659
 total one fifth of the weekend 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.240
 studying the total time of study is a 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.430
 fifth of the weekend he has to 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.939
 divide it into four equal parts 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.189
 he has four subjects and will dedicate the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.180
 same time for each one then goes 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.579
 divide it into four equal parts 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.820
 how much time does it spend for each story 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.899
 good for every matter he spends this area 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.680
 which fills here and what is this and this 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.360
 is one about how many equal parts they have 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.869
 same size on the weekend 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.510
 I draw on the grid five lines and four 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.560
 columns five lines times four 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.280
 columns of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.010
 20 equal parts once more 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.690
 visually it will pass a twentieth 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.420
 from the weekend studying for each 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.470
 between the four subjects at the end 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.170
 of week 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.480
 take should spend a fifth of the time 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.610
 studying but the answer of the question is 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.269
 that he will spend a twentieth of the end of 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.269
 study week
