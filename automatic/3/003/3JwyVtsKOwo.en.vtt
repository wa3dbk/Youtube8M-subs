00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.330
 sweat 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.330
 222 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.820
 Hi, the nose casting allergies today but I have to scout 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.240
 I want you to know about the basic stopping method for those who do not know 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.240
 I'll do it 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:34.260
 I want to scout, but I do not know what's going to happen. 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.519
 Let a single pinch of a bit retaining unit up by one species Sarah claim 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.550
 Basically 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:42.960
 I have the ability to scan the Gaichong sarong. 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.809
 When you can see immediately the hand of the map if you want jasigo million Mana anywhere 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.799
 It is the advantage of scanning ability 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.420
 The downside is that now we have to wait for the cartoon to launch. 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:56.490
 The advantage now is to compensate to some extent by taking written by several love-minute opening 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.360
 can 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:05.700
 Photos can also be seen in a paranormal 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:09.480
 That is the most unusual public fast movement speed, one of Phoenix doing the other side of the base, 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.540
 It does not take a few seconds until the two of you peek out . 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:17.670
 There is no loss because it is reflected and lost 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:22.140
 One disadvantage is the extra nature of the illusion that spits out damage 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.200
 If the world 's people are attacked by Jung Yoon-hee , 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.580
 It is better not to see the unit 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:33.110
 2 Onion is also part of the Arabic diet. 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.100
 Oh, that is, there are two ways 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:41.870
 A speedy juggling'll find out a person's power, mainly 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.760
 On the other hand, the surveillance problem is transformed through the state transformation. 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:50.660
 If you do not like a lot of one villain is not a higher level than the villain 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:54.770
 It is too early to break down the base, but the power of life is very great 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:59.630
 It 's a disadvantage that you can not last for a long time . 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.340
 If you can stretch as the party base should be improved significantly before take-out 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.600
 Is it advantageous to be able 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.530
 Ah, if it once melts or kige to go faster processing than juggling 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.530
 It's a disadvantage. 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.349
 It must be the most under-built reconnaissance sure what the other buildings 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.019
 I have to check 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.290
 If we are taking the wheels . 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.909
 So now it wheels into beginners who can take you to drink again 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.140
 I will. 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:33.240
 In this way, the policy sweat is not exactly fixed, but the person's intention 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:38.130
 I want I need to know now is the time to send us scout 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:42.800
 The second thing you need to check is your opponent's multi 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:48.510
 The next thing to do is to see where you are eating and how much you are eating. 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:51.250
 Know that just took the other side of the multi-own garden the Agency containment 5 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:56.290
 The attack is full and what is a surcharge 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.300
 Third, the last thing to check is the size of the enemy's troops, 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.160
 Is a combination 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:07.240
 The combination of the definitions need to make sure that any career is how big 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.660
 I can think first of what kind of battle it will lead to with my troops. 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.660
 I know. 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.930
 I had friends who abandoned based scout for beginners 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:20.900
