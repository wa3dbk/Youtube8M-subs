get to the box the top and then keep

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.389 
get to the box the top and then keep
that<00:00:52.980> angle<00:00:53.750> into<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> shot<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.950> that<00:00:56.070> keeps

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
that angle into the shot and that keeps

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.130 
that angle into the shot and that keeps
me<00:00:56.610> connected<00:00:57.000> with<00:00:57.450> my<00:00:57.780> cut<00:00:58.290> off<00:00:58.500> and<00:01:00.140> just

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.870 
me connected with my cut off and just
give<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.590> give<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.309> less

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.520 

I<00:01:07.049> get<00:01:08.049> over<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.380> ball<00:01:08.560> nice<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:09.040> comfortable

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
I get over the ball nice and comfortable

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.469 
I get over the ball nice and comfortable
neutral<00:01:11.530> position

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
neutral position

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:22.999 
neutral position
easy<00:01:13.479> back<00:01:13.930> keep<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.200> box<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.430> off<00:01:18.549> you<00:01:18.700> go

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.609 

and<00:01:24.009> when<00:01:24.100> you<00:01:24.159> keep<00:01:24.369> that<00:01:24.609> angle<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.320> I<00:01:26.439> will

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
and when you keep that angle and I will

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.880 
and when you keep that angle and I will
always<00:01:26.799> talk<00:01:27.070> about<00:01:27.130> keeping<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.149> spine<00:01:28.450> angle

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
always talk about keeping a spine angle

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.230 
always talk about keeping a spine angle
so<00:01:29.890> when<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.069> keep<00:01:30.189> this<00:01:30.429> angle<00:01:30.759> you<00:01:30.850> stay<00:01:31.060> in

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
so when you keep this angle you stay in

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.240 
so when you keep this angle you stay in
a<00:01:31.329> shot<00:01:31.569> longer<00:01:31.869> is<00:01:32.649> when<00:01:32.859> you<00:01:32.950> straighten

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
a shot longer is when you straighten

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.940 
a shot longer is when you straighten
this<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:34.149> when<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.479> get<00:01:34.600> out<00:01:34.810> of<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.049> shot<00:01:35.319> I'm

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
this is when you get out of the shot I'm

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.949 
this is when you get out of the shot I'm
going<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.219> keep<00:01:36.399> that<00:01:36.609> angle<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.479> that<00:01:37.719> keeps

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
going to keep that angle and that keeps

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.169 
going to keep that angle and that keeps
you<00:01:38.079> in<00:01:38.319> the<00:01:38.350> shot<00:01:38.709> there<00:01:39.700> at<00:01:39.789> all<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:39.969> great

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
you in the shot there at all the great

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
stagger the wall in the shot and I think

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:53.460 
stagger the wall in the shot and I think
