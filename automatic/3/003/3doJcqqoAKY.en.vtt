00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.540
 Hello dear friends and lovers 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.359
 creativity and modeling of polymer clay 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.150
 today will be a lesson on realistic 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.660
 modeling food and in this video I'll show you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.699
 how to make a mini copy of this pizza with 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.590
 mushrooms and bell pepper 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.860
 let's start making pizza of course with 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.649
 dough cakes we take a piece of beige 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.030
 clay and roll it into reservoir 4 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.000
 millimeter thick 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.079
 take a round frame and cut out 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.780
 beige circle I took qatar with a diameter of 4 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.570
 centimeter is exactly the same as for 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.460
 Cakes further finger weed 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.120
 circle surface inward 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.059
 everywhere except the edges of the edge of the pizza should 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.820
 remind rollers to be higher than all 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.309
 the surface of the pizza is sharp cut 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.670
 corners along the edges also need to round out 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.790
 fingers now let's touch up the dough 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.159
 pizza dry pastel use yellow and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.229
 orange and brown shades for 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.920
 giving pizza baked 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.920
 and ruddy look as usual we start with 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.360
 the lightest shade of the bed for example 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.220
 yellow us hard bed knife and 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.450
 we paint a dough with a soft brush 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.600
 top and bottom texture dough give with 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.939
 crumpled piece of foil 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.979
 further tint protruding with 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.470
 using darker pastels 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.189
 for example light brown and orange 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.030
 and this can no longer be done 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.939
 tassels and just a finger and the final 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.820
 dark brown color we use it 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:01.200
 just a little bit to imitate toasted 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.869
 crust now the dough is ready proceed to 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.930
 filling pizza with delicious pieces of food 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.690
 but first you need to spread the pizza crust 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.460
 tomato sauce mix liquid 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.710
 polymer 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.380
 clay with ordinary pieces of clay and 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.680
 stir thoroughly before getting here 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.020
 This cream and grease the cake on top 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.420
 additionally you can add liquid 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.760
 plastics on top of tomato sauce to 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.780
 our slices of vegetables and mushrooms are better 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.780
 stuck on a cake 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.320
 to imitate spices on the plate in them 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.860
 a little brown bed on top of the sauce 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.600
 this should be the basis and 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.450
 now proceed to the more complex 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.870
 making ingredients for 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.870
 pizza start with salami sausages we take 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.500
 white dirty pink and dirty red 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.810
 color the clay and cut into pieces the blade so 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.260
 do until it works out 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.890
 such a mass of colored dots this 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.210
 and our salami sausage will roll out 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.420
 from this mass cylinder and tint 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.100
 red brown pastel on all sides 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:45.890
 cut the sausage into pieces and 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:48.050
 spread on the surface of the pizza here 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.560
 the pizza starts to get delicious 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.950
 view now do mushrooms mushrooms 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.960
 take the gray clay and roll it in 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.880
 cylinder 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.160
 we tint it with pastel 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.130
 gray-brown along the edges we cut 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.310
 on round plates and the tip of a knife 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.550
 cut off the excess so that the mushroom comes out 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.410
 in a section with a round awl 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.549
 hat closer to the leg 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.640
 here is ready a piece of champignon put it on 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.020
 im several such mushrooms and 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.920
 spread on pizza for free 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:34.520
 plots with 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:37.670
 and we are not busy with sausage, then we do 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.700
 black olives cut into black sausage and 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.100
 we roll small balls we make 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.830
 balls little hole here to you and 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.590
 a piece of olive 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.780
 put them on the pizza now let's 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.170
 make green bell pepper 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.500
 take two small pieces of clay one 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.420
 dark green and the other more 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.090
 light green fold them friend 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.760
 on each other and roll into one 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.090
 a thin two-layer cake 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:12.110
 millimeter thick and now a knife 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.840
 we cut off a very thin striped if 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.050
 look at the side then it will be seen that she 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.340
 double so here's the light color this 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.320
 the inside of the pepper and dark is the rind 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.080
 we bend this striped in the form of different 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.980
 bright side inside and 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.290
 we get pieces of bell pepper 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.220
 put them on the pizza 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.940
 get drunk is all there is not enough 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.210
 of course cheese 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:44.270
 we mix cheese just like tomato 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.330
 sauce take the yellow clay add to it 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.880
 liquid plastic and knead cream cheese 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.030
 now neatly and slightly 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.750
 grease cheese pizza do it all 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.820
 a little bit 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.820
 so as not to bar all of our previous 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.940
 sausage mushrooms and vegetables 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.720
 try to get between them in the empty 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:09.410
 places if you notice the cheese is not quite 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.060
 bright yellow and the pizza is not bright all colors 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.790
 slightly muffled 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.850
 and natural suppress in bright colors 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.190
 dry pastel dark colors or vice versa 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.310
 add white to dilute 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.430
 brightness of polymer clay and bring it closer 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.110
 to natural muted shades 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.040
 on top of the cheese you can put a couple more 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:33.890
 pieces of mushrooms and sausages add 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.000
 spices and black pepper crumbled on top 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.460
 bed 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.450
 a little touch up the texture of mint foil 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.060
 and you can cut the pizza into pieces 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.370
 cut it and into eight pieces like 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.010
 a cake but I will cut off just one piece 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.400
 since i'm doing a puppet miniature 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.710
 and I am not going to leave the furniture cut 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.230
 very carefully we try not to crush 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.960
 ingredients for even more 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:04.160
 Realism do loose texture on 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:07.820
 slices of the dough with a needle and on the 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.580
 pizza and cut pieces add 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.380
 on the sides are streams of cheese and finally pizza 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:17.930
 can be send oven for baking 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:20.600
 for half an hour after baking can be covered 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:24.080
 pizza glossy varnish but only yellow 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.590
 cheese and sausage after all our efforts 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.940
 we get excellent almost edible pizza 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.940
 with almost edible mushrooms 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.310
 if you like my lesson you can 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:42.919
 rate it under the video as well 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:45.550
 lay out your work to my group 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:50.919
 VKontakte in a special album 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.919
 that's all for now
