00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.450
 dvd critic and now mine 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.730
 German movie go out in the middle of July 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.559
 expected in theaters and to the trailer 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.110
 check I was not particularly pleased 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.089
 but then was better taught 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.210
 and that's about system errors now 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.920
 Wenning dancing will be better my biggest 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.420
 dream coal girls who really understands 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.310
 the whole show and then I'm close 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.180
 now the bad thing happened 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.180
 I start best of them 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.100
 Now that's it for yourself 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.629
 learning disabled amoeba understand it 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.680
 this song will not be here anymore 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.680
 play which song 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.880
 I have to play him as a support too 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.370
 but he seems to be behind now 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.350
 We only have to go to the tourists 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:04.610
 It may be terrible in the future 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.380
 Another choice is I'm easy at it 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.979
 coughed up, of course it falls my 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.420
 conditions 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.950
 we are allowed and some do not dance 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.300
 felt that is a stand alone 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:20.840
 first conditions when we enter 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:23.740
 nothing to lose i even have one 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.740
 testifies that was good 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.659
 that's the extra width I had completely 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.659
 on 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:41.020
 which must be necessarily with their so 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.430
 only a few dance rehearsals south 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.700
 promised that you will dance a few tomorrow 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.700
 plays 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.710
 that always comes sometime where 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.420
 you have to decide is a hit 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.590
 even if you hurt someone with it 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.590
 because you really live 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.840
 systemfehler if they going dancing 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.960
 103 minutes is from six years 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.850
 Released and launched on 11 July 2013 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.310
 in german cinemas history 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.890
 played by max by tim oliver schultz 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.020
 max is a band called your band 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.520
 The error in the neat rotting 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.740
 train properly said that you with 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.660
 one of her songs called when he's dancing 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.160
 even in the radio is played with it 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.660
 get the attention of 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.580
 a higher plate life and 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.320
 maybe a record deal in 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.600
 at least they should be made outlook 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.820
 playing in front of a big gig from madsen 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.680
 and that is a whole lot for every young band 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.900
 big dream maybe even one 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.940
 jump board and so is max and his 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.590
 ribbon course extremely pleased them so 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.970
 like the whole school just that I'm on 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.800
 once the guitarist at a gig 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.660
 injured and this must be replaced 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.330
 and there is only the possibility for it 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.940
 will increase total since the song when 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.930
 Angel dance since then so successful 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.580
 is at school all the time 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.290
 fucked but she is the only one 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.060
 a really good guitarist is and the 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.860
 band error could still save and 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.050
 So all this sounds totally here 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.050
 it is also deformed and tini 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.430
 but it is totally funny 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.810
 Systematic agile dance is a film 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.280
 in which when the trailer itself 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.500
 you look already knows how the film 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.510
 Developer will land where it ends up 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.310
 a kind of teen comedy but pretty much 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.410
 well done with incredible humor 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.640
 and a whole lot of cool I have 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.840
 the trailer check scary about it 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.970
 excited that tim oliver schultz 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.489
 as well as paula kalenberg constantin 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.019
 by jascheroff tino mewes and some 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.160
 Fairy tales are too old for the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.930
 fact that they are actually the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.459
 but I have to 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.410
 quite frankly they say that 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.260
 all so good and so cool and so on 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.370
 Slightly covered like a comedy 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.660
 attached is that I have to say that 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.220
 but then I do not bother 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.230
 over there see system errors 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.519
 Wenning danced properly cool flow 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.900
 a whole lot of gags that are not 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.250
 necessarily under the belt 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.610
 takes himself very happy on the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.650
 shovel 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.330
 has a really good peter 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.709
 freaky as a pop singer, too 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.780
 about his own past right 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.970
 good laugh can cast a strong and 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.080
 an unusually neat soundtrack 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.030
 for a German movie almost 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.769
 consistently cool music and the one 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.540
 or other complete nude scene with 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.310
 a naked pool party and thats me 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.479
 from German film just so 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.130
 not used to the show value 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.830
 tunes the music and the flea city and 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.910
 103 minutes just so fit around the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.410
 film not too long 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.850
 that means for me that's the topic 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.710
 venting done now she is not a movie 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.570
 you have to see it and the 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.160
 but is extremely great after the 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.840
 trailer I have much worse 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.640
 expected and was therefore on whole 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.930
 positively surprise line that means 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.180
 from me that this movie whose 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.160
 film music, by the way, for the most part too 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.560
 by helmut zerlett actually comes from 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.210
 really great seven and a half out of 10 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.190
 possible points as a comedy 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.870
 Slash teen comedy gets and 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.160
 a total of seven of me 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.230
 possible points even if rather 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.910
 predictable he is so beautiful fine 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.290
 made and left and right in the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.850
 stripes , there are many funny gags 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.290
 and especially because of him 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.330
 twentieth century fox and the other with 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.500
 loser sunshine the budget was also 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.150
 here a few more elaborate 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.950
 Camera settings to make the find 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.690
 I'm really fun and really cool 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.830
 I'll start with the trailer 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.780
 has to watch the movies and 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.310
 German and so should should the 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.530
 definitely look at that is a lot 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.460
 better than you think and that was it from 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.630
 me and I are happy times 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.460
 to be able to admit if mine 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.960
 assessment was completely wrong so 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.850
 but it is the more beautiful it is yours 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.890
 The cinema would be okay to be surprised 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.270
 watch film if so why because yours 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.650
