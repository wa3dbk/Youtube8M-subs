using it for a herb bed and certainly

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.740 
using it for a herb bed and certainly
you<00:00:44.710> got<00:00:44.860> around<00:00:45.160> about<00:00:45.430> just<00:00:46.180> under<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.450> metre

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
you got around about just under a metre

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.610 
you got around about just under a metre

that's<00:00:47.980> roughly<00:00:48.370> three<00:00:48.700> railway<00:00:49.180> sleepers

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
that's roughly three railway sleepers

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.250 
that's roughly three railway sleepers
pinned<00:00:50.260> together<00:00:50.739> in<00:00:51.280> situ<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.270> giving<00:00:53.140> us

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
pinned together in situ and giving us

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.250

that<00:00:53.290> real<00:00:53.620> natural<00:00:54.220> feel<00:00:54.520> you<00:00:55.510> can<00:00:55.660> also<00:00:55.809> use

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
that real natural feel you can also use

vertically inserted into the ground such
as<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.520> one<00:01:00.670> behind<00:01:00.820> this<00:01:01.450> bed<00:01:01.719> and<00:01:02.260> that<00:01:02.559> sort

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
as the one behind this bed and that sort

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.319 
as the one behind this bed and that sort
of<00:01:02.829> does<00:01:03.010> away<00:01:03.160> with<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.520> need<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.790> have<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.089> go

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
of does away with the need to have to go

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.179 
of does away with the need to have to go
out<00:01:04.509> and<00:01:04.689> buy<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:05.259> whole<00:01:05.590> myriad<00:01:05.979> of<00:01:06.040> different

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
out and buy a whole myriad of different

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.480 
out and buy a whole myriad of different
types<00:01:06.549> of<00:01:06.729> fencing<00:01:07.320> looks<00:01:08.320> natural<00:01:08.920> it<00:01:09.220> gives

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
types of fencing looks natural it gives

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.880 
types of fencing looks natural it gives
a<00:01:09.610> range<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:10.090> heights<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.840> they<00:01:11.200> age<00:01:11.440> all

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
a range of heights and they age all

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.920 
a range of heights and they age all
independently<00:01:12.729> so<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.060> get<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.210> great<00:01:13.510> mixture

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
independently so you get a great mixture

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.250 
independently so you get a great mixture
of<00:01:14.110> hues<00:01:14.409> and<00:01:14.560> tones<00:01:14.650> coming<00:01:15.370> through<00:01:16.260> to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
of hues and tones coming through to

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.920 
of hues and tones coming through to
create<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.770> simple<00:01:18.100> but<00:01:18.729> effective<00:01:18.930> climbing

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
create a simple but effective climbing
