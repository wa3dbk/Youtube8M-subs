well hello there all you have you
trekkers<00:00:07.400> yeah<00:00:08.400> Doug's<00:00:09.170> roped<00:00:10.170> me<00:00:10.440> into

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
trekkers yeah Doug's roped me into

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.310 
trekkers yeah Doug's roped me into
another<00:00:10.679> one<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.099> these<00:00:11.190> things<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.200> let's<00:00:13.200> get

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
another one of these things so let's get

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.109 
another one of these things so let's get
started<00:00:16.100> okay<00:00:17.100> we're<00:00:17.400> talking<00:00:17.550> about<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
started okay we're talking about the

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.810 
started okay we're talking about the
work<00:00:18.300> be<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:19.160> thinking<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.340> little<00:00:20.550> craft

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
work be here thinking of a little craft

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.210 
work be here thinking of a little craft
that<00:00:21.029> would<00:00:21.150> buzz<00:00:21.600> around<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.230> dry<00:00:22.590> dock<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
that would buzz around the dry dock and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.769 
that would buzz around the dry dock and
create<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> lot<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.910> visual<00:00:24.269> activity<00:00:26.660> once<00:00:27.660> I

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
create a lot of visual activity once I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.330 
create a lot of visual activity once I
came<00:00:27.990> up<00:00:28.109> with<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> idea<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:28.949> what

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
came up with the idea it's like what

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.310 
came up with the idea it's like what
would<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.699> little<00:00:29.970> craft<00:00:30.269> do<00:00:30.570> would<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.109> be

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
would this little craft do would it be

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
would this little craft do would it be
the<00:00:31.470> front<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.070> shuttle<00:00:32.460> would<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the front of a shuttle would it be a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.780 
the front of a shuttle would it be a
pushing<00:00:33.540> device<00:00:33.870> would<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.489> manipulate<00:00:35.489> stuff

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
pushing device would it manipulate stuff

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.200 
pushing device would it manipulate stuff
or<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:37.190> starting<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> cab<00:00:38.670> being<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
or what starting with the cab being a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.139 
or what starting with the cab being a
two-person<00:00:39.840> maybe<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.140> three-person<00:00:41.149> vehicle

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
two-person maybe a three-person vehicle

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.930 
two-person maybe a three-person vehicle
by<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.360> size<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> door<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.940> started

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
by the size of the door I started

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
by the size of the door I started
thinking<00:00:45.270> maybe<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.840> would<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:45.989> better<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
thinking maybe it would be better if it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.160 
thinking maybe it would be better if it
was<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.980> one-person<00:00:47.670> craft<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.480> i<00:00:48.750> scaled

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
was just a one-person craft so i scaled

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.920 
was just a one-person craft so i scaled
it<00:00:49.350> down<00:00:50.239> coming<00:00:51.239> up<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.690> drawing

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it down coming up with this drawing

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
it down coming up with this drawing
which<00:00:52.230> looked<00:00:52.469> all<00:00:52.620> good<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> everything<00:00:53.460> but

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
which looked all good and everything but

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.869 
which looked all good and everything but
it's<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.449> well<00:00:54.809> how<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.379> into<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.920> so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
it's like well how do you get into it so

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.189 
it's like well how do you get into it so
then<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.960> produced<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.530> drawing<00:00:58.829> and<00:01:00.199> let

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
then that produced this drawing and let

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.630 
then that produced this drawing and let
me<00:01:01.289> clean<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.190> without<00:01:02.340> there

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
me clean that up for you without there

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.240 
me clean that up for you without there
we<00:01:02.760> go<00:01:02.879> produce<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.049> drawing<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.619> basically

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
we go produce this drawing and basically

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.010 
we go produce this drawing and basically
what<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.640> see<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.970> an<00:01:06.090> operator<00:01:06.420> getting<00:01:06.810> into

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
what you see is an operator getting into

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.469 
what you see is an operator getting into
a<00:01:07.049> dark<00:01:07.409> twerk<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
a dark twerk be and you can see the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.090 
a dark twerk be and you can see the
control<00:01:09.930> panel<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.439> open<00:01:11.270> being<00:01:12.270> zero<00:01:12.630> gravity

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
control panel is open being zero gravity

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.620 
control panel is open being zero gravity
little<00:01:14.100> craft<00:01:14.610> would<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> little<00:01:15.180> too<00:01:15.360> small

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
little craft would be a little too small

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.520 
little craft would be a little too small
for<00:01:15.960> artificial<00:01:16.740> gravity<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:19.170> operator

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
for artificial gravity the operator

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.399 
for artificial gravity the operator
would<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.860> set<00:01:20.040> themselves<00:01:20.189> down<00:01:20.670> pull<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
would just set themselves down pull the

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.620 
would just set themselves down pull the
lap<00:01:22.409> belt<00:01:22.590> across<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.460> other<00:01:23.580> controls<00:01:24.090> hook

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
lap belt across and other controls hook

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.320 
lap belt across and other controls hook
their<00:01:24.810> feet<00:01:25.020> under<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> tow<00:01:25.619> bar<00:01:25.970> tow<00:01:26.970> bar<00:01:27.210> as

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
their feet under the tow bar tow bar as

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.260 
their feet under the tow bar tow bar as
you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.840> robots<00:01:28.259> fell<00:01:28.530> backwards<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
you know is robots fell backwards and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.340 
you know is robots fell backwards and
they're<00:01:30.270> ready<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> go<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:32.360> then<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.720> started

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
they're ready to go so then I started

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.280 
they're ready to go so then I started
focusing<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:35.009> these<00:01:35.159> work<00:01:35.430> sleds<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.140> came<00:01:37.140> up

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
focusing on these work sleds and came up

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.870 
focusing on these work sleds and came up
with<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.950> grabber<00:01:38.990> lifter

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
with this kind of a grabber lifter

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.130 
with this kind of a grabber lifter
manipulators<00:01:42.140> combination<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:44.899> in<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.079> I

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
manipulators combination and in that I

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.560 
manipulators combination and in that I
thought<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:47.759> would<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.090> good<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
thought that this would be good for the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.440 
thought that this would be good for the
first<00:01:48.810> Flynn<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:50.130> second<00:01:50.520> idea<00:01:50.880> was<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
first Flynn the second idea was a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.600 
first Flynn the second idea was a
combination<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.850> a<00:01:53.850> pushing<00:01:54.720> device<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
combination of a pushing device and

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.310 
combination of a pushing device and
coupled<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.950> sonic<00:01:58.950> welder<00:01:59.600> a<00:02:00.600> laser

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
coupled with a sonic welder a laser

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.660 
coupled with a sonic welder a laser
cutter<00:02:01.740> type<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.880> tool<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:04.770> miniature<00:02:05.219> itself

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
cutter type of tool the miniature itself

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.830 
cutter type of tool the miniature itself
was<00:02:05.939> actually<00:02:06.590> built<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> scale<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.840> two

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
was actually built on a scale of two

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.660 
was actually built on a scale of two
inches<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.319> foot<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.129> like<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> GI<00:02:11.580> Joe

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
inches to the foot so it's like a GI Joe

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.270 
inches to the foot so it's like a GI Joe
figure<00:02:12.629> size

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
figure size

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.820 
figure size
and<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.300> can<00:02:14.450> see<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:14.690> they've<00:02:14.990> replaced<00:02:15.500> my

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and you can see that they've replaced my

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.480 
and you can see that they've replaced my
foot<00:02:16.610> restraints<00:02:17.209> with<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> control<00:02:17.840> panel<00:02:18.490> my

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
foot restraints with a control panel my
