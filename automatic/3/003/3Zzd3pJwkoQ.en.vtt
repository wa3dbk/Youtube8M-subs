into the area and then you can kind of
go<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.790> you're<00:01:56.790> gonna<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.149> like

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
GU doesn't go underneath not what I do

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.870 
GU doesn't go underneath not what I do
is<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.870> always<00:02:30.989> always<00:02:31.470> let<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.069> dry<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:32.459> a

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
is I always always let it dry for a

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.600 
is I always always let it dry for a
little<00:02:33.180> bit<00:02:33.360> right<00:02:34.230> here<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.160> give<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.430> a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
little bit right here you just give it a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.420 
little bit right here you just give it a
few<00:02:35.640> minutes<00:02:36.060> because<00:02:36.450> when<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.500> first<00:02:37.800> put

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
few minutes because when you first put

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.300 
few minutes because when you first put
it<00:02:38.459> out<00:02:38.730> it's<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.150> super<00:02:39.750> sticky<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.769> anytime

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
it out it's like super sticky so anytime

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.370 
it out it's like super sticky so anytime
you<00:02:41.459> touch<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.810> sticks<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.230> your

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
you touch it it just sticks to your

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.110 
you touch it it just sticks to your
fingers<00:02:43.800> but<00:02:44.190> if<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.430> let<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.610> dry<00:02:44.880> for<00:02:44.910> a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
fingers but if you let it dry for a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.150 
fingers but if you let it dry for a
couple<00:02:45.150> minutes<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:46.410> can<00:02:46.620> kind<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.950> start

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
couple minutes you can kind of start

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.440 
couple minutes you can kind of start
molding<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.420> down<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:50.580> what<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> do<00:02:50.850> here<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.330> I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
molding it down so what I do here is I

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.270 
molding it down so what I do here is I
take<00:02:51.690> my<00:02:51.870> finger<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:53.269> just<00:02:55.069> put<00:02:56.069> it

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
take my finger and I I just put it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.430 
take my finger and I I just put it
around<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:57.060> edges<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.819> it's<00:03:00.000> like<00:03:00.269> that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.710 

you<00:03:04.440> don't<00:03:04.709> want<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.790> mess<00:03:06.000> with<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.299> middle

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
you don't want to mess with the middle

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.860 
you don't want to mess with the middle
of<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.989> too<00:03:07.380> much<00:03:08.239> but<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.360> definitely<00:03:09.720> want

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
of it too much but you definitely want

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.539 
of it too much but you definitely want
to<00:03:09.930> get<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.200> edges<00:03:12.500> nice<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.530> smoothed<00:03:14.250> out

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
to get the edges nice and smoothed out

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.470 
to get the edges nice and smoothed out
so<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.239> doesn't<00:03:15.540> peel<00:03:16.049> off<00:03:16.470> or<00:03:16.890> come<00:03:17.100> off

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
so that it doesn't peel off or come off

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.360 
so that it doesn't peel off or come off
there's<00:03:18.480> some<00:03:18.690> pretty<00:03:18.900> tough<00:03:20.060> tough<00:03:21.060> material

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
there's some pretty tough tough material

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:31.010 
there's some pretty tough tough material
the<00:03:23.370> sugar

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.020 

and<00:03:31.560> once<00:03:31.740> you<00:03:31.860> have<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.130> edges<00:03:32.490> smooth<00:03:32.760> out

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
and once you have the edges smooth out

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.850 
and once you have the edges smooth out
you<00:03:33.330> can<00:03:33.510> kind<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.750> just<00:03:33.960> go<00:03:34.230> over<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.590> top<00:03:34.830> of

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
you can kind of just go over the top of

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:43.790 
you can kind of just go over the top of
it<00:03:35.750> like<00:03:36.750> so

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.790 

so<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.520> gotta<00:03:44.820> they<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.140> can<00:03:46.350> get

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
so you gotta they so that you can get

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.960 
so you gotta they so that you can get
kind<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.100> a<00:03:47.190> nice<00:03:47.990> smooth<00:03:48.990> surface<00:03:49.500> on<00:03:49.650> there

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
kind of a nice smooth surface on there

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.580 
kind of a nice smooth surface on there
now<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.030> don't<00:03:51.480> want<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.720> make<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.990> too<00:03:52.230> smooth

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
now you don't want to make it too smooth

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.410 
now you don't want to make it too smooth
because<00:03:52.830> this<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.460> part<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:53.940> your<00:03:54.150> shoe

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
because this is the part of your shoe

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.060 
because this is the part of your shoe
that's<00:03:54.630> gonna<00:03:54.870> actually<00:03:55.080> be<00:03:55.380> like<00:03:55.530> gripping

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
that's gonna actually be like gripping

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.660 
that's gonna actually be like gripping
onto<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.520> board<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:57.780> as<00:03:58.080> its<00:03:58.470> drying<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.640> can

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
onto the board so as its drying you can

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.120 
onto the board so as its drying you can
kind<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.120> go<00:04:00.270> over<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.870> just<00:04:00.990> rough<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:01.980> out

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
kind of go over it and just rough it out

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.650 
kind of go over it and just rough it out
a<00:04:02.160> little<00:04:02.400> bit<00:04:02.670> as<00:04:02.910> soon<00:04:03.180> as<00:04:03.300> you<00:04:03.390> start

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
a little bit as soon as you start

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.400 
a little bit as soon as you start
skating<00:04:03.990> on<00:04:04.460> this<00:04:05.460> shoe<00:04:05.700> again<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.570> will<00:04:06.960> get

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
skating on this shoe again this will get

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.680 
skating on this shoe again this will get
roughed<00:04:07.710> out<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.250> you'll<00:04:08.970> be<00:04:09.150> back<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.390> like

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
roughed out and you'll be back to like

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.120 
roughed out and you'll be back to like
your<00:04:09.870> normal<00:04:10.370> your<00:04:11.370> normal<00:04:12.770> roughness<00:04:13.770> of<00:04:13.950> the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
your normal your normal roughness of the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.390 
your normal your normal roughness of the
shoe<00:04:15.020> this<00:04:16.020> is<00:04:16.140> why<00:04:16.230> I<00:04:16.260> like<00:04:16.530> suede<00:04:16.860> shoes<00:04:17.190> by

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
shoe this is why I like suede shoes by

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.070 
shoe this is why I like suede shoes by
the<00:04:17.459> way<00:04:17.670> is<00:04:17.730> because<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.239> suede<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:18.810> rough

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
the way is because the suede is rough

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.780 
the way is because the suede is rough
and<00:04:19.410> it's<00:04:19.560> rough<00:04:19.799> on<00:04:19.950> your<00:04:20.040> grip<00:04:20.250> tape<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:20.670> it

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
and it's rough on your grip tape so it

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.490 
and it's rough on your grip tape so it
sticks<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.360> it<00:04:21.480> can<00:04:21.660> flick<00:04:22.020> your<00:04:22.230> board

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
sticks and it can flick your board

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.850 
sticks and it can flick your board
really<00:04:22.860> well<00:04:23.570> another<00:04:24.570> thing<00:04:25.410> that<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.650> can

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
really well another thing that you can

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.770 
really well another thing that you can
do<00:04:25.980> is<00:04:26.100> you<00:04:26.220> can<00:04:26.310> put<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.580> sock<00:04:26.940> underneath<00:04:27.510> here

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
do is you can put a sock underneath here

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.560 
do is you can put a sock underneath here
to<00:04:28.200> just<00:04:28.440> hold<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:29.010> out<00:04:29.190> because<00:04:29.940> he<00:04:30.090> like<00:04:30.420> I

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
to just hold it out because he like I

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.940 
to just hold it out because he like I
said<00:04:30.810> before<00:04:30.960> you<00:04:31.290> don't<00:04:31.500> want<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.770> sugar

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
said before you don't want the sugar

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.160 
said before you don't want the sugar
dripping<00:04:32.550> underneath<00:04:32.940> there<00:04:33.240> which<00:04:33.960> is

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
dripping underneath there which is

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.500 
dripping underneath there which is
pretty<00:04:34.380> easy<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:35.100> do<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.700> it's<00:04:35.910> more<00:04:36.390> than

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
pretty easy to do and it's more than

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.930 
pretty easy to do and it's more than
likely<00:04:36.720> not<00:04:37.080> going<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.380> drip<00:04:37.620> underneath<00:04:38.040> but

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
likely not going to drip underneath but

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.850 
likely not going to drip underneath but

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
before you get a hole which might be the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.570 
before you get a hole which might be the
best<00:05:02.040> time<00:05:02.280> to<00:05:02.310> do<00:05:02.610> this<00:05:02.640> is<00:05:04.460> you're<00:05:05.460> just

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
best time to do this is you're just

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.970 
best time to do this is you're just
gonna<00:05:05.820> coat<00:05:06.390> a<00:05:06.420> little<00:05:07.050> bit<00:05:07.230> of<00:05:07.350> that<00:05:07.530> shoe<00:05:07.800> goo

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980

gonna coat a little bit of that shoe goo
on<00:05:08.190> there<00:05:08.430> then<00:05:09.420> you're<00:05:09.570> just<00:05:09.690> gonna<00:05:09.930> kind<00:05:10.200> of

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
on there then you're just gonna kind of

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.160 
on there then you're just gonna kind of
rub<00:05:10.500> it<00:05:10.530> around<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:12.210> can<00:05:12.360> even<00:05:12.390> do<00:05:12.810> just<00:05:13.080> like

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
rub it around you can even do just like

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.930 
rub it around you can even do just like
a<00:05:13.230> real<00:05:13.620> thin<00:05:14.550> layer<00:05:14.940> of<00:05:14.970> it

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.150 

you<00:05:19.510> can<00:05:19.660> do<00:05:19.780> that<00:05:19.930> every<00:05:20.230> week<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.650> then<00:05:20.770> your

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
you can do that every week and then your

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.100 
you can do that every week and then your
shoes<00:05:21.400> will<00:05:21.610> never<00:05:21.820> actually<00:05:22.090> get<00:05:22.540> a<00:05:22.570> hole<00:05:25.110> but

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
shoes will never actually get a hole but

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.320 
shoes will never actually get a hole but
I<00:05:26.140> said<00:05:26.350> this<00:05:26.560> particular<00:05:27.490> type<00:05:27.760> of<00:05:27.790> shoe<00:05:28.180> goo

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
I said this particular type of shoe goo

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.170 
I said this particular type of shoe goo
is<00:05:28.510> clear<00:05:29.080> so<00:05:29.650> shoe<00:05:29.890> goo<00:05:30.040> comes<00:05:30.310> in<00:05:30.520> both<00:05:30.670> clear

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
is clear so shoe goo comes in both clear

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.550 
is clear so shoe goo comes in both clear
and<00:05:31.210> black<00:05:31.840> I<00:05:32.550> probably<00:05:33.990> would<00:05:34.990> use<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.350> black

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
and black I probably would use the black

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.610 
and black I probably would use the black
one<00:05:35.770> if<00:05:35.920> I<00:05:36.040> was<00:05:36.160> just<00:05:36.870> doing<00:05:37.870> this<00:05:38.020> on<00:05:38.230> just<00:05:38.470> the

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
one if I was just doing this on just the

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.290 
black suede part but I actually don't
have<00:05:40.480> any<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.260> black<00:05:41.500> stuff<00:05:41.800> so<00:05:42.450> yeah<00:05:45.300> the
