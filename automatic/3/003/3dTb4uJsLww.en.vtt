00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
you design your build you build

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.979 
you design your build you build
specifically<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.360> attack<00:02:17.480> at<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.840> specific

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
going to be at in the process so you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.780 
going to be at in the process so you
know<00:02:24.590> you'll<00:02:24.739> see<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> zerg<00:02:25.190> rush<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.670> might

this<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:33.890> pretty<00:02:34.100> rare<00:02:34.310> but<00:02:34.519> like<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.910> hatch

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
this is pretty rare but like a to hatch

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.740 
this is pretty rare but like a to hatch
lurker<00:02:35.480> build<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:37.400> rush<00:02:37.700> lurkers<00:02:38.269> before<00:02:38.630> the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
lurker build to rush lurkers before the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.690 
lurker build to rush lurkers before the
opponent<00:02:39.200> can't<00:02:39.470> properly<00:02:39.980> get<00:02:40.280> up<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.610> know

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
opponent can't properly get up you know

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.699 
opponent can't properly get up you know
turrets<00:02:41.150> or<00:02:41.360> get<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> scan<00:02:42.110> or<00:02:42.440> something<00:02:42.650> like

turrets or get a scan or something like

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.110 
turrets or get a scan or something like
that<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.100> they're<00:02:43.310> left<00:02:43.519> without<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.790> scan

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
that and so they're left without a scan

map wonderful for being able to get your

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.559 
map wonderful for being able to get your
a<00:03:54.980> quick<00:03:55.980> second<00:03:56.310> expansion<00:03:56.640> although

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
a quick second expansion although

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.420 
a quick second expansion although
interestingly<00:03:57.870> on<00:03:58.349> this<00:03:58.500> map<00:03:58.739> rarely<00:03:59.160> do<00:03:59.370> I

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
interestingly on this map rarely do I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.040 
interestingly on this map rarely do I
actually<00:03:59.580> see<00:03:59.849> people<00:04:00.150> getting<00:04:00.390> that<00:04:00.720> quick

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
actually see people getting that quick

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.750 
actually see people getting that quick
second<00:04:01.380> expansion<00:04:01.680> they<00:04:02.010> tend<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.489> get<00:04:02.610> the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
second expansion they tend to get the

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.340 
second expansion they tend to get the
other<00:04:03.000> expansion<00:04:03.720> for<00:04:03.930> every<00:04:04.170> reason<00:04:04.760> now

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
other expansion for every reason now

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.990 
other expansion for every reason now
this<00:04:07.350> will<00:04:07.440> be<00:04:07.560> an<00:04:07.680> interesting<00:04:07.770> game<00:04:08.280> because

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
this will be an interesting game because

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.120 
this will be an interesting game because
the<00:04:09.150> players<00:04:09.390> are<00:04:09.810> going<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.319> be<00:04:10.500> next<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:10.980> each

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
the players are going to be next to each

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.440 
the players are going to be next to each
other<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.550> there<00:04:11.700> is<00:04:11.819> a<00:04:11.850> shorter<00:04:12.330> distance

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
other so there is a shorter distance

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.650 
other so there is a shorter distance
between<00:04:12.959> them<00:04:13.140> um<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.819> know<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.269> lot<00:04:15.600> of

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
between them um it you know a lot of

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.629 
between them um it you know a lot of
times<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.560> tends<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.130> make<00:04:17.310> for<00:04:17.579> a

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
times that that tends to make for a

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.370 
times that that tends to make for a
shorter<00:04:18.150> all<00:04:18.329> around<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.810> game<00:04:18.989> just<00:04:19.230> because

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
shorter all around the game just because

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.129 
shorter all around the game just because
they<00:04:19.889> don't<00:04:20.070> have<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.250> travel<00:04:20.459> as<00:04:20.700> far<00:04:21.139> they

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
they don't have to travel as far they

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.330 
they don't have to travel as far they
can<00:04:22.169> go<00:04:22.320> for<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.680> kind<00:04:22.889> of<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.040> little<00:04:23.130> more

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
can go for a kind of a little more

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.820 
can go for a kind of a little more

third<00:05:14.430> hatchery<00:05:15.000> so<00:05:15.300> calm<00:05:16.050> getting<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.530> layer

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
third hatchery so calm getting the layer

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.830 
third hatchery so calm getting the layer
already<00:05:17.310> i<00:05:17.430> think<00:05:17.669> is<00:05:17.760> what<00:05:17.850> they<00:05:17.940> showed<00:05:18.270> so

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
already i think is what they showed so

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.390 
already i think is what they showed so
calm<00:05:19.080> might<00:05:19.350> be<00:05:19.500> going<00:05:19.770> for<00:05:19.950> some<00:05:20.100> sort<00:05:20.310> of

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
calm might be going for some sort of

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.969 
calm might be going for some sort of
fast<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.789> hatch<00:05:20.970> build<00:05:21.380> maybe<00:05:22.380> maybe<00:05:22.710> going

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
fast to hatch build maybe maybe going

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.380 
fast to hatch build maybe maybe going
for<00:05:23.130> like<00:05:23.220> a<00:05:23.280> quick<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.700> hatch<00:05:23.850> muta<00:05:24.150> list<00:05:24.300> or

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390

through the other units that are
attacking<00:06:21.090> it<00:06:21.330> that's<00:06:21.840> actually<00:06:22.110> because<00:06:22.590> the

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:22.920 
attacking it that's actually because the

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.470 
attacking it that's actually because the
person<00:06:23.160> my<00:06:23.430> crowing<00:06:23.700> it<00:06:23.820> is<00:06:23.910> clicking<00:06:24.360> that

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
person my crowing it is clicking that

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.870 
person my crowing it is clicking that
unit<00:06:24.780> on<00:06:24.960> minerals<00:06:25.470> so<00:06:26.340> if<00:06:26.430> you<00:06:26.550> click<00:06:26.760> a

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
unit on minerals so if you click a

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.940 
unit on minerals so if you click a
worker<00:06:27.180> on<00:06:27.420> minerals<00:06:27.900> it<00:06:28.170> automatically<00:06:28.710> goes

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
worker on minerals it automatically goes

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.160 
worker on minerals it automatically goes
through<00:06:29.280> any<00:06:29.460> units<00:06:29.730> that<00:06:29.850> it<00:06:29.910> encounters<00:06:30.360> so

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
through any units that it encounters so

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.440 
through any units that it encounters so
so<00:06:32.040> that's<00:06:32.190> actually<00:06:32.640> just<00:06:33.030> kind<00:06:33.180> of<00:06:33.210> a<00:06:33.300> little

so that's actually just kind of a little

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.020 
so that's actually just kind of a little
tip<00:06:33.600> there<00:06:33.860> it's<00:06:34.860> kind<00:06:35.400> of<00:06:35.550> tough<00:06:35.730> to<00:06:35.790> do

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
tip there it's kind of tough to do
