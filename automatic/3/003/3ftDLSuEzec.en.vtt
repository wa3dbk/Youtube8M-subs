in<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.680> video<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.189> want<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.490> show<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.730> what

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
in this video I want to show you what

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.580 
in this video I want to show you what
the<00:00:21.150> ice<00:00:21.330> smart<00:00:21.960> tech<00:00:22.430> LCD<00:00:23.430> polymer<00:00:24.529> sort<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the ice smart tech LCD polymer sort of

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.140 
the ice smart tech LCD polymer sort of
it<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.949> like<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:29.150> not

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
it is like so what we have here it's not

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.820 
it is like so what we have here it's not
marinated<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:30.869> glass<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.500> can<00:00:31.650> see<00:00:31.679> I

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
marinated on glass and as you can see I

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.400 
marinated on glass and as you can see I
can<00:00:31.920> bend<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.850> quite<00:00:33.149> easily<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.809> my<00:00:33.960> fingers

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
can bend it quite easily with my fingers

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.709 
can bend it quite easily with my fingers
now<00:00:34.590> when<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.309> ship<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.510> cannot

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
now when we ship it to you we cannot

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.700 
now when we ship it to you we cannot
roll<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.590> must<00:00:37.890> ship<00:00:38.160> flat<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.710> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
roll it up but must ship flat and so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.970 
roll it up but must ship flat and so
that<00:00:40.890> will<00:00:41.070> increase<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.790> package<00:00:42.450> size

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
that will increase the package size

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.610 
that will increase the package size
depending<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.000> overall<00:00:45.480> sizes<00:00:46.020> yeah

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
depending on what the overall sizes yeah

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.360 
depending on what the overall sizes yeah
so<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.329> there<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.370> you

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
so you can see that there and you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.500 
so you can see that there and you
obviously<00:00:50.460> can't<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.180> through<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:53.510> this

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
obviously can't see through it and this

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.010 
obviously can't see through it and this
is<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.899> he's<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> piece<00:00:56.270> not<00:00:57.270> applied<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
is a he's a piece not applied to the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.380 
is a he's a piece not applied to the
glass<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.370> would<00:00:59.550> remove<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.090> his

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
glass and so we would remove that his

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.080 
glass and so we would remove that his
appeal<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.859> very<00:01:02.070> clean<00:01:02.489> environment

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
appeal and in a very clean environment

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.289 
appeal and in a very clean environment
then<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:04.140> would<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.409> placed<00:01:04.920> onto<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:06.000> window

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
then it would be placed onto the window

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.270 
then it would be placed onto the window
the<00:01:06.810> air<00:01:06.930> bubble<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.290> removed<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.010> forth

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the air bubble was removed and so forth

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.270 
the air bubble was removed and so forth
so<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.420> things<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.560> aware<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.860> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
so the things to be aware of is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340 
so the things to be aware of is
obviously<00:01:11.790> cleanliness<00:01:12.299> no<00:01:12.689> fingerprints

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
obviously cleanliness no fingerprints

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.600 
obviously cleanliness no fingerprints
and<00:01:13.760> that's<00:01:14.760> how<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.210> ship<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> for

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
and that's how we ship it for

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.820 
and that's how we ship it for
do-it-yourself<00:01:17.610> type<00:01:17.850> applications<00:01:18.840> now<00:01:19.500> if

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
do-it-yourself type applications now if

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.550 
do-it-yourself type applications now if
you<00:01:20.040> were<00:01:20.280> wanting<00:01:21.270> sheets<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.990> glass<00:01:22.170> that

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
you were wanting sheets of glass that

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.920 
you were wanting sheets of glass that
you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.009> switch<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:24.090> were<00:01:24.299> able<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> supply

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you can switch them were able to supply

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.070 
you can switch them were able to supply
that<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.350> well<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.250> range<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.670> sizes<00:01:27.080> could

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
that as well and a range of sizes could

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.410 
that as well and a range of sizes could
be<00:01:28.170> curved<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.860> different<00:01:29.310> shape<00:01:29.579> not<00:01:30.119> just

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
be curved and different shape not just

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.530 
be curved and different shape not just
square<00:01:30.810> or<00:01:30.990> rectangular<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.579> quite<00:01:33.509> a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
square or rectangular and so quite a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.370 
square or rectangular and so quite a
remarkable<00:01:33.900> technology<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.549> now<00:01:36.380> adding

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
remarkable technology that is now adding

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.960 
remarkable technology that is now adding
further<00:01:38.009> intelligence<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.509> glass

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
further intelligence to glass

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.460 
further intelligence to glass
installations<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.450> course<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:43.049> makes<00:01:43.320> a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
installations and of course it makes a

00:01:43.470 --> 00:02:13.530 
installations and of course it makes a
perfect<00:01:44.329> projector<00:01:45.329> screen<00:01:46.110> surface<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.310> well

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.599 

you
