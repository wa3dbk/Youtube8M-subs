00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
call the rear of the machine so if you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.260 
call the rear of the machine so if you
do<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.479> pins<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> back<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.119> would

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
do have pins in the back and you would

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
do have pins in the back and you would
like<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.750> run<00:01:19.640> apart<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.659> left<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.229> then
