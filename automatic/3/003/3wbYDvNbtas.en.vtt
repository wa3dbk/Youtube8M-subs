00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:02.900
 on foot 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.900
 he imagines 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.560
 Half a year ago 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.119
 we received a lot of letters from 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.849
 readers it is not very much 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.890
 warmth his stories about what represents 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.900
 of yourself after this device 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.460
 finally we got access to 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.120
 this role finished from the room 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.120
 sentimental question right now 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.620
 GDP 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.480
 at first glance the train is resolved and there 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.780
 learned a lot from her 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.120
 predecessor of the classic pi es bi 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.050
 the body is made of pleasant to the touch 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.360
 plastic 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.580
 in the size of the console did not add much 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.600
 and the thickness is even insignificant 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.930
 decreased 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.780
 most of the front panel is just like 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.270
 formerly occupy the screen 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.380
 whose diagonal has grown in four and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.340
 three tenths to five prisons 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.630
 matrix with the usual introduced the day 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.990
 changed to oled capacitive sensor 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.579
 like 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.139
 and the resolution is four hundred 

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:24.440
 eighty by 272 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.300
 doubled to 960 and by 540 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.560
 Pao sides of the screen in addition to the standard 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.870
 The keypad of the main buttons are located 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.500
 two analog sticks 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.650
 recall that in principle he was only 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.310
 one on the left 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.860
 very nice to play thanks to the texture 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.729
 which will not let your fingers jump off 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.120
 them in the heat of battle 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.130
 next to the left hook is a button 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.780
 the train is resolved and one of the speakers is about 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.210
 right button start and select the second speaker and and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.210
 front-camera 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.479
 in the new reincarnation of its portable 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.860
 playstation console made a gift for 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.300
 left-handed so much as a bracelet strap 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.000
 now there is not only on the left but also on the right 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.230
 charger socket which 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.830
 it was here before changed and 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.430
 moved to the bottom on his new 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.700
 the spot we found and the standard connector 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.700
 headphone 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.319
 chef that the changes did not affect how 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.560
 sat themselves on the sides of the upper bound and and 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.430
 But there are buttons between them 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.969
 switch and adjust 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.590
 volume and two plugs under the left 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.099
 nothing unusual simple card slot 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.549
 memory but from under the other on the masses 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.380
 collapsed not clear interface 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.230
 apparently he serves to withdraw 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.280
 screen images in demo 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.419
 version 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.109
 according to official information from sony 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.759
 the console will not support such 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:58.480
 function 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.409
 and under the plug will be a slot for 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.180
 new gaming media one more 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.309
 interesting fact 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.099
 separate brightness control key 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.049
 we did not find the screen 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.870
 Probably they either did not fit into the hull either 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.870
 this function is implemented in the menu 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:18.999
 back panels are the most unexpected 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.449
 the solution is something indentations for 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.359
 fingers is located at the edges 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.499
 capacitive sun panel itself in size 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.639
 equal screens with it you can 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.019
 boil for example alone 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.269
 or such 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.359
 and even that 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.449
 she settled down the main camera 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.479
 which also gives room for fantasy 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.479
 developers 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.289
 Popov before the internal filling on this 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:48.669
 only moment is known 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.399
 that they are working four core 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:52.919
 cortex processor right on 9 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:53.809
 and discrete graphic 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.029
 processor to navigate in 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:57.849
 space and help triaxial 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.809
 gyro accelerometer and compass 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:01.579
 the console will be issued in two 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.139
 modifications with the 3g module life without 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:04.879
 of legal 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.739
 unfortunately on demo 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.900
 samples was blocked 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.849
 operating system exit function 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.360
 so we could not look at it but 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.629
 once 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.250
 well, you understand
