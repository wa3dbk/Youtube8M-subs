00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.440
Hello, friends!

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.300
Today is the 24th of November, the 54th...

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.680
...or 55th day of our expedition.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.920
Here, in Cappadocia the cold weather caught up with us.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.320
Yesterday we enjoyed the first snow.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.400
It had rained for a few days before that.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.560
It’s not great for us, because it’s impossible to cycle when it rains or snows.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.780
Here, in Ürgüp we stayed at Hülya’s.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.840
She let us stay at her apartment for as long as we wanted.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.000
So we stayed for 3 days, waiting for the rain to stop.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.820
We recorded songs, rested

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.360
and wandered around beautiful Cappadocia.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.920
For those who haven’t been here yet, make sure to come.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.620
It’s like a fairy tale.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.020
It’s about zero degrees Celsius now.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.500
You can see snow covered mountains behind.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.980
They’ve been covered for 3 days now.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.860
This means that it’s definitely below zero there.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.780
We are headed to the city of Kayseri, 65 km away.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.820
This is going to be our first journey in real winter weather.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.900
We’ll see how we can deal with this cold adventure.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.060
Just a few days ago, we were practically wearing t-shirts,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.440
it was quite summery in western Turkey.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.640
Here, in Cappadocia it’s winter, New Year’s coming.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.880
We just have to push through it.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:17.320
I think for the next couple hundred kilometres we’ll have real winter.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.080
Volodia has almost recovered, by the way.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.280
Now I have a congested nose and a sore throat.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.080
I have a feeling that he passed those things on to me.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.420
Now he will have to take care of me.
