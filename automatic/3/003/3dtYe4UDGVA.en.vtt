00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.500 
blue hair to try get behind this red if
not<00:03:39.110> have<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:40.040> ply<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.280> played<00:03:41.240> the<00:03:41.360> previous

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
not have to ply it played the previous

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.270 
not have to ply it played the previous
woman<00:03:42.050> with<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:42.920> rest<00:03:43.660> well<00:03:45.010> tried<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.130> bounce

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
woman with the rest well tried to bounce

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.860 
woman with the rest well tried to bounce
behind<00:03:46.730> and<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.000> think<00:03:47.180> it's<00:03:47.270> cut<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.510> too<00:03:47.660> much

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
behind and I think it's cut it too much

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.590 
behind and I think it's cut it too much
that's<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.500> end<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.740> break<00:03:49.150> unless<00:03:50.150> he<00:03:50.420> plays

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
that's the end the break unless he plays

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.960 
that's the end the break unless he plays
the<00:03:50.780> double<00:03:52.510> double<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.660> on<00:03:53.840> but<00:03:54.820> very<00:03:55.820> very

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
the double double is on but very very

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.590 
the double double is on but very very
dangerous

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
dangerous

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.390 
dangerous
yeah<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.320> slow<00:03:57.530> door<00:03:57.740> is<00:03:57.890> not<00:03:58.010> too<00:03:58.220> bad

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
yeah the slow door is not too bad

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.530 
yeah the slow door is not too bad
actually<00:03:58.580> because<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:58.970> can<00:03:59.060> play<00:03:59.209> around<00:03:59.360> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
actually because you can play around the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.600 
actually because you can play around the
back<00:03:59.690> of<00:03:59.870> the<00:03:59.959> black<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.950> with<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.130> red<00:04:01.370> being

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
back of the black and with the red being

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.890 
back of the black and with the red being
where<00:04:01.820> it<00:04:01.850> is<00:04:01.970> near<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.209> cue<00:04:02.480> ball<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:02.810> just

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
where it is near the cue ball is just

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.600 
where it is near the cue ball is just
looking<00:04:03.200> now<00:04:03.350> if<00:04:03.410> he<00:04:03.530> plays<00:04:03.680> around<00:04:03.800> it<00:04:03.950> even

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
looking now if he plays around it even

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.370 
looking now if he plays around it even
if<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.790> red<00:04:04.940> stop<00:04:05.209> right<00:04:05.420> on<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.630> pocket<00:04:06.050> he

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
if the red stop right on the pocket he

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.600 
if the red stop right on the pocket he
could<00:04:06.530> almost<00:04:06.680> cover<00:04:07.070> it<00:04:07.190> with<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.340> other<00:04:07.370> red

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
could almost cover it with the other red

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.830 
could almost cover it with the other red
I<00:04:07.640> think<00:04:07.940> there's<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.120> bit<00:04:08.240> of<00:04:08.270> value<00:04:08.570> in<00:04:08.690> this

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
I think there's a bit of value in this

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.390 
I think there's a bit of value in this
double<00:04:09.080> not<00:04:09.290> usually<00:04:09.650> you'd<00:04:09.770> say<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.190> about

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
double not usually you'd say that about

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.640 
double not usually you'd say that about
a<00:04:10.459> double<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:17.510> place<00:04:17.720> he<00:04:17.930> played<00:04:18.169> it<00:04:18.350> look<00:04:18.530> at

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
a double the place he played it look at

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:26.280 
a double the place he played it look at
the<00:04:18.709> place

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.220 

all<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.860> problems<00:04:27.310> there<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:28.230> realizes

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
all the problems there and realizes

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.020 
all the problems there and realizes
value<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:29.950> almost<00:04:30.130> has<00:04:30.490> shot<00:04:30.640> to<00:04:30.790> nothing

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
value and it almost has shot to nothing

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:42.899 
value and it almost has shot to nothing
that<00:04:31.120> where<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.360> cue<00:04:31.540> balls<00:04:31.750> finish
