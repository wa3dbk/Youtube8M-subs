Rhino<00:02:42.950> what<00:02:43.950> why<00:02:44.190> does<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.489> violate<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.879> Rhino

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
Rhino what why does it violate the Rhino

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.309 
Rhino what why does it violate the Rhino
have<00:02:45.300> blood<00:02:45.540> on<00:02:45.569> them<00:02:45.810> do<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.930> think<00:02:45.989> we<00:02:46.170> put

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
have blood on them do you think we put

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.229 
have blood on them do you think we put
mud<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.530> them<00:02:46.800> let<00:02:47.610> anything<00:02:47.760> go<00:02:47.909> right<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.180> is

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
mud on them let anything go right on is

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.530 
mud on them let anything go right on is
mud<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:48.480> yeah<00:02:49.370> flew<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.550> cool<00:02:50.760> off<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.300> also

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
mud on yeah flew to cool off and also

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.380 
mud on yeah flew to cool off and also
applies<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.440> mosquitoes<00:02:53.099> these<00:02:53.610> guys<00:02:53.909> hate

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
applies the mosquitoes these guys hate

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.000 
applies the mosquitoes these guys hate
and<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:54.930> what<00:02:55.050> they<00:02:55.170> do<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.379> they<00:02:55.470> roll<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.860> mud

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
and so what they do is they roll in mud

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.470 
and so what they do is they roll in mud
and<00:02:56.190> that's<00:02:56.580> kind<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:56.879> like<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.090> natural

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
and that's kind of like a natural

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.630 
and that's kind of like a natural
insecticide<00:02:57.750> for<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.620> flies<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.159> mosquitoes

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
insecticide for the flies and mosquitoes

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.100 
insecticide for the flies and mosquitoes
so<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.150> works<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.540> cool<00:03:00.750> them<00:03:00.900> down

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
so it works to cool them down

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.050 
so it works to cool them down
it<00:03:01.379> works<00:03:01.650> for<00:03:01.830> sunblock<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.519> protect<00:03:02.909> them

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
it works for sunblock to protect them

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.180 
it works for sunblock to protect them
from<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.480> Sun<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.870> also<00:03:04.500> for<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.769> flies<00:03:04.980> and

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
from the Sun and also for the flies and

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.670 
from the Sun and also for the flies and
mosquitoes<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.329> mud<00:03:06.599> is<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.930> really

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
mosquitoes so it's the mud is a really

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.100 
mosquitoes so it's the mud is a really
cool<00:03:07.920> thing

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
cool thing

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.600 
cool thing

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
the main reasons why rhinos are have

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.930 
the main reasons why rhinos are have
gone<00:03:24.170> endangered<00:03:24.740> is<00:03:24.890> because<00:03:25.370> of<00:03:25.520> poaching
