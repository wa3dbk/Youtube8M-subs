00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
trick where if you manage to figure out

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.160 
trick where if you manage to figure out
how<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.159> deal<00:02:07.430> with<00:02:07.520> one<00:02:07.909> single<00:02:08.209> enemy<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
how to deal with one single enemy the

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.649 
how to deal with one single enemy the
rest<00:02:09.379> of<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.679> stage<00:02:09.950> would<00:02:10.399> pretty<00:02:11.120> much<00:02:11.239> just

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
rest of the stage would pretty much just

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.110 
rest of the stage would pretty much just
fall<00:02:11.930> into<00:02:12.140> place<00:02:12.489> while<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.639> beginning<00:02:13.969> of

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
fall into place while the beginning of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.269 
fall into place while the beginning of
lolo<00:02:14.480> 2<00:02:14.659> is<00:02:14.840> similar<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.469> that<00:02:15.499> it<00:02:15.650> starts<00:02:16.099> off

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:16.279 
lolo 2 is similar in that it starts off

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.830 
lolo 2 is similar in that it starts off
extremely<00:02:16.760> easy<00:02:17.209> as<00:02:17.540> well<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.200> gets

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
extremely easy as well it gets

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.410 
extremely easy as well it gets
more<00:02:18.989> difficult<00:02:19.530> much<00:02:19.830> more<00:02:20.129> quickly<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.790> Lolo

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
more difficult much more quickly in Lolo

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.479 
more difficult much more quickly in Lolo
