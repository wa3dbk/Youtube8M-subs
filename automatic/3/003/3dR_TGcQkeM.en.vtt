00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.519
 hi my name is ivan and i decided to do 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.809
 small series of videos purely by 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.219
 planetary battles on interesting maps 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.630
 This card is interesting because it is 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:23.570
 passes very quickly but if it 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.460
 passes but mostly not the first time 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.160
 yes that there are mostly far from 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.380
 first time 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.890
 in general, first we try to capture the bases 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.649
 in general, this card is more lucky than 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.870
 on some tactic in general here 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.629
 we seize immediately in a quick base 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.780
 and now we need to rely only on 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:52.890
 the fact that the red blue will be among themselves 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.020
 much and persistently destroy each other we 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.250
 take about this configuration 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.989
 robots in principle here you can 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:09.140
 use bombs but you need to be able to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.720
 I unfortunately do not really know how 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.840
 we actually hire and try not to 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.020
 lean out that is to red blue 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.659
 fought each other ie tactics 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.800
 quite simple 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.500
 she is 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.760
 I hope someone will be interested then 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.690
 there is a principle on this card is nothing 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.760
 there is no difficult I capture a little 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.530
 factories to build more robots 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:42.009
 once that because of this plus you can probably 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:46.690
 build a few cannon flare guns 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:49.119
 making life more difficult for our enemies 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.380
 as it is, as soon as we are attacked 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:56.160
 blue we depart we go somewhere 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.160
 over here 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.450
 we have another base 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:18.510
 now we can only hope 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.250
 what blue will turn back how long is it here 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.580
 my 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:29.610
 beat the idols and that's actually 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:32.400
 red here is already beginning to dominate 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.110
 on the map it's bad so let's 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.410
 try to discourage at least one 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.410
 the base 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.560
 action approximately according to this scheme 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.990
 we move forward we seize the base 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:58.940
 red forward when the red would kill 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.940
 and myself and blue 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.250
 we hope that we will succeed 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.689
 although we already have very few robots 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.480
 there is little chance there is a chance now 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.209
 the main thing is to seize the base and we will rivet 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.930
 new robots 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.989
 rivet and rivet resources on this map 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.579
 just Nemer just Nemer just 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.219
 It means two idlers I think 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.420
 send here that is how 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:35.129
 dummy normal robots 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.299
 seize the factories so that you can 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.849
 build more robots 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:43.739
 most quietly settle closer to 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:46.650
 center to try at any moment 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:52.260
 grab one of the bases which will 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:58.440
 one of the most vulnerable 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:01.020
 dynamic maps in my opinion so 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.370
 that is, what we expected from us 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.660
 In principle, it was completely realized so 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.770
 someone has little health 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:17.790
 so out of order went to grab for 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:21.660
 like this now red blue in principle 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.730
 myself and beat me this makes me very happy 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.500
 I think that now we will succeed 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.800
 i actually ate this card 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.880
 write down now the first time and 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.210
 It turned out to pass it from the first time but 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.470
 it's just because i know hers 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.440
 play more or less 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.750
 and I think now is the right decision 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.150
 what I went exactly at the beginning on red 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:47.700
 because he's a little stronger now 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:52.640
 than blue therefore capturing it we already 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:58.760
 we will definitely dominate the map 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:05:01.560
 consolidate our superiority so and 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:09.110
 fine great but now the matter of technology 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:14.480
 We are still building a certain number of robots and 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:16.870
 we seize blue everything I think you can already 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.870
 to attack 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.199
 7 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.449
 plus the very structure of the robots that is 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:31.180
 dischargers in on this card they are all the same 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:35.129
 I think Mast Hev without them much 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:39.099
 much more difficult well, that's all 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:42.550
 we won this card hope that 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:45.250
 it was useful and interesting to someone with 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.960
 you have been ivan of all good to see you 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.990
 passage may be others 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.990
 planetary battles yet
