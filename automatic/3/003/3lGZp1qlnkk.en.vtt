00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
the pictures though he has like a

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.470 
the pictures though he has like a
rubberized<00:04:11.959> suit<00:04:12.320> underneath<00:04:12.709> him<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:14.060> it's

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
not like a sideshow star wars type suit

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.360 
not like a sideshow star wars type suit
that's<00:04:17.660> like<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.900> cloth<00:04:18.290> it's<00:04:18.919> actually<00:04:19.100> like<00:04:19.310> a

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
that's like a cloth it's actually like a

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.890 
that's like a cloth it's actually like a
rubbery<00:04:19.760> suit<00:04:20.030> like<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.390> Spartans<00:04:20.810> would

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
rubbery suit like the Spartans would

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.690 
rubbery suit like the Spartans would
wear<00:04:21.109> so<00:04:22.010> that's<00:04:22.160> probably<00:04:22.400> gonna<00:04:22.580> be<00:04:22.640> pretty

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
wear so that's probably gonna be pretty

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.060 
cool it might be hard to pose him I'm
kind<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.160> thinking<00:04:25.340> but<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:26.960> don't<00:04:27.740> think<00:04:27.860> it'd

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
kind of thinking but I don't think it'd

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.150 
kind of thinking but I don't think it'd
make<00:04:28.730> too<00:04:28.970> much<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.330> problem<00:04:29.980> but<00:04:30.980> if<00:04:31.100> you
