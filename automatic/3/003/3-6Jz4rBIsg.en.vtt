it<00:04:41.300> or<00:04:41.510> if<00:04:41.630> somebody<00:04:41.930> else<00:04:42.080> needs<00:04:42.320> wide<00:04:42.500> all

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.470 
it or if somebody else needs wide all
that<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:42.830> can<00:04:42.950> give<00:04:43.040> it<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.220> them<00:04:43.340> but<00:04:43.850> yeah<00:04:44.330> it's

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
that I can give it to them but yeah it's

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.610 
that I can give it to them but yeah it's
one<00:04:44.570> of<00:04:44.600> those<00:04:44.690> that<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:44.930> just<00:04:45.169> go<00:04:45.290> like<00:04:45.320> that

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
one of those that you just go like that

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.140
