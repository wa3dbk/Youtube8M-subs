00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
because the length of it is a little

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.199 
because the length of it is a little

got the three strikes with like the
intergalactic<00:03:46.709> interstellar<00:03:47.709> print<00:03:48.160> right

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
intergalactic interstellar print right

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.849 
intergalactic interstellar print right
in<00:03:48.489> there<00:03:48.780> then<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.870> says<00:03:50.049> flagship<00:03:50.560> across

11<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.060> Roman<00:03:58.269> numerals<00:03:58.599> and<00:03:58.810> then<00:03:59.250> terminus

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
11 and Roman numerals and then terminus

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.069 
11 and Roman numerals and then terminus
so<00:04:00.489> those<00:04:00.730> are<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:00.940> pieces<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.359> he<00:04:01.569> sent<00:04:01.900> me

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
so those are the pieces that he sent me

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.500 
so those are the pieces that he sent me
