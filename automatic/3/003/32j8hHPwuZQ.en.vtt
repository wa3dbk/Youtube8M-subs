00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710

definitely<00:00:28.710> won<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> fight<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> thought<00:00:29.699> he

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
definitely won the fight I thought he

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.279 
definitely won the fight I thought he
won<00:00:30.119> pretty<00:00:30.300> much<00:00:30.570> every<00:00:30.810> single<00:00:30.990> round

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
won pretty much every single round

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.170 
won pretty much every single round
except<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:31.710> maybe<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:32.160> round<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.700> thought<00:00:33.120> it

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
except for maybe one round I thought it

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.660 
except for maybe one round I thought it
was<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.510> round<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.040> no<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.340> argue<00:00:35.640> that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
was one round that no you can argue that

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.450 
was one round that no you can argue that
Brian<00:00:36.030> Vera<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.559> but<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.829> pretty<00:00:38.070> much<00:00:38.219> a

a<00:00:44.010> couple<00:00:44.280> rounds<00:00:44.520> where<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.180> pretty

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
a couple rounds where it was just pretty

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.880

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
down and he was able to get up and he

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.479 
down and he was able to get up and he
was<00:02:46.209> able<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.510> score<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:47.200> stoppage<00:02:48.010> victory

after going down then the second one I

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.259 
after going down then the second one I
think<00:02:50.560> was<00:02:50.739> Brandon<00:02:51.250> Adams<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.970> return<00:02:52.209> of
