00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.290
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.990
 essentials hardware software reviews 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.830
 Today I want to compare you 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.640
 present 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.710
 between intel and amd yes why do 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.240
 me such a comparison video since me 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.599
 very often asked 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.410
 hey what are you recommending for cpu it currently 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.059
 and today I want to give you the 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.630
 performance between a dual core of 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.309
 intel and a quad core near amd 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.379
 lie 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.469
 So what do we have here for cpu s us 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.379
 have an i3 32 20 and a poor one here 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:52.890
 10 58 00 the e3 is a dual core of 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:55.670
 a10 is a quad core at i3 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.480
 the base clock is at 3.2 ghz as well 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.030
 amd to 38 gg 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.050
 especially important here is again 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.340
 the tdp of 55 watts in the intel and 100 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.280
 watt at the 10 o'clock 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:17.190
 the gpu is stated at inter with 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.470
 the hd 2500 and the a10 with the 7660 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.390
 d graphic here again the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.250
 memory support as well as the socket 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.960
 and now we come to the general 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.990
 information about the test systems here 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.760
 we have the test systems 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.090
 Here we have the internet system 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.370
 an i3 as I said a p 8a 77 mm 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.880
 Mainboard from asus 8 GB RAM 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.640
 as well as a seagate hard disk with 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.690
 windows 7 professional 64 bit and one 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 enermax triathlon 385 watt power supply up 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.580
 on the cpu's memory and that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.280
 mainboard amounts still the same 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.240
 on the amd systems of the poor this 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:05.180
 calculator here has a few 10 58 00 ksf 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:08.550
 2a 85 mm mainboard and one 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.610
 memory capacity of 8 Gigabyte 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.230
 of kingston of course so what comes 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.469
 I want you in this test 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.520
 here only briefly suggest the pure 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:22.220
 CPU power on the graphics performance 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.850
 I do not go now because that's it 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.080
 whole would blow up the frame 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.530
 and I would say we start now 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.660
 with the first comparison to these 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.660
 both cpu s 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.659
 that's how it should have been for this one 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.150
 benchmark comparison between 3 and 10 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.219
 I think we all now see how 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.549
 strong but such a small adecco 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:38.810
 processors over one 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.000
 full-grown quad core processor with 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.250
 high timing 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.379
 I think but the amd must be yes 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.510
 Do not hide with his performance 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:51.680
 such a good processor to recommend 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.629
 Can for a battle pc's on office 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.060
 and internet applications 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:00.019
 and there he can also score points 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.870
 its integrated graphics unit 7660 de 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.359
 only a negative point is above all 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.659
 the current consumption of the 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:11.840
 overall system you have seen but yes 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:16.720
 on as I would say is the e3 too 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.680
 of course very suitable for games 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.000
 mediocre but also set 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.550
 other applications such as office etc 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.240
 and I think both are processors 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.490
 absolutely recommendable 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.880
 now it is up to you what you for 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.530
 a cpu you want to afford and me 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.970
 think this is the place that has been 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.199
 its again the description looks 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.120
 pure but there there now 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:41.840
 information and yes different 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.419
 internet links to these products and 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.750
 that would have been it until today 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.750
 next
