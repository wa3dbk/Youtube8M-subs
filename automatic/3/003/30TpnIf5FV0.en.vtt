00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.819

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.040

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.650
 nothing playing a video game and it's going to be 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.679
 as such very short yesterday I could not climb 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.540
 I was in the hospital all day 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.460
 Thanks Achilles, so I can comment on it 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.949
 twitter that I was already in that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.100
 better sense and how many have you 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.019
 asked then through the social network 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.430
 I'm fine right now I'm fine 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.470
 I spent all day in the emergency room because 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.070
 I was a whole day with a lot of fever 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.540
 vomiting and malaise and good to me 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.000
 I spent all day in the emergency room making myself 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.219
 tests and I have left a few 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.520
 things wrong the blood tests of 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.100
 urine 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.840
 and on ultrasound it can be more or 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.030
 less looking do not know for sure 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.950
 what can it be and I'm under a little 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.530
 medical surveillance tomorrow I have to 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.410
 go back to the doctor and do not know if what 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.360
 I have is something to operate or is not that of 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.900
 moment I can not say much more 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.030
 I'm the same so that does not mean 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.210
 that I will be for the moment without uploading 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.550
 videos if it had to be a while 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.830
 without being able to do it, I will perform but 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.440
 maybe I can not do videos 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.360
 newspapers but one and I will not be able to 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.280
 follow the schedule now I upload pokemon 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.020
 Now I am an independent that touches me 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.520
 but more or less I will try to do it 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.649
 depending on how I can be 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.720
 speaking or of my state at that time 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.610
 right now I'm much better I'm with 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.369
 a lot of medicines that look like 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.850
 that I am totally drugged by my mother and 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.610
 and other good or right now 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.020
 I'm fine but a little weak though 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.270
 then tomorrow I think I'll be better 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.610
 because basically when it bothers me the most 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.860
 is when I 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.510
 I get here I did not feel touched 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.220
 medication while I'm here that 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.640
 good not to dance but 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.130
 good something another movement yes good 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.740
 basically that I do not have much more 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.650
 that good here they treated me very well in 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.300
 the hospital and others and I have the body 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.729
 full of chopped because my 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.590
 Veins are horrible they are very thin they are not 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.030
 I know if it happens to you but whoever has 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.530
 the fine veins will know what I'm talking about 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.180
 every time you go to the doctor you a 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.670
 blood test or something similar is 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.430
 horrible is like a quack then 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.959
 that they're going to prick you like suckling pig 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.030
 lucky to see if they puncture you well to the 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.440
 first if you break the vein or if you 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.870
 it's time to think of another silicon 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.090
 basically that 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.590
 and nothing because I said that you do not 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.120
 worry in that sense because of 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.799
 moment in addition there is nothing there either 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.690
 to worry and I am very well 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.150
 I am very animated and tired but not 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.500
 I had enough strength today to be able 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.880
 record because I'm all day in the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.040
 bed in vague plan with the 3ds 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.960
 and the truth that I was more comfortable to warn 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.300
 through a video that by twitter more or 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.440
 Less commenting to several is easier 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.760
 talk that being with the mobile is 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.130
 cristian and that what I do not like is in 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.690
 this kind of videos but I prefer that 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.060
 before you continue to feed the 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.820
 things for twitter or that people 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.430
 then you can stay some other 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.900
 little without knowing very well what happens I the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.340
 year I can not say anything else because I do not 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.520
 I know I know that certain things that are 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.520
 wrong 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.180
 can be several things and for the moment 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.820
 better not to sit down for any 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.500
 Well, basically that is already something else 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.450
 I'll tell you but good yet 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.800
 bad so up the mood and start and 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.040
 I will say start the week well but 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.720
 We are on Wednesday and today is not Tuesday 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.220
 tomorrow, tomorrow, do not wait tomorrow 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.470

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.490
