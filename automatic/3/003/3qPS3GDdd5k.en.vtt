00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 there all right guys I wanna show 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.570
 How are you guys going to recover the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.509
 id apple password if someday you 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.780
 forget about it has received some 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.140
 messages from blog visitors 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.020
 they ask the green lit and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.900
 apple need to create another has a lot 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.849
 There's no point in asking questions. 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.480
 It's very easy for you to recover this 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.279
 password 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.219
 But there are people who do not know how to do it. 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.649
 so I'm thinking of inventing a lot 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.860
 of history but in fact the answer is 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.450
 It's okay for me to get back to you now. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:50.600

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:55.289

 You will click on next will warn you 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.380
 Why did you forget your password? 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 time and then apple will send instructions 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.950
 Please , email me to retrieve this. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.619

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.810
 there is another way also wants to cooperate 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 with your safety tips 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.729
 so we'll see this in the next 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.320
 in the next step, you only have these 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.990
 two options or receive an email with 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.570
 information on how you are going to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.220
 change the password or answer the questions 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.560
 of security 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.329
 let's say you do not even remember which 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.439
 are the security questions have a lot 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.600
 people who do not even remember 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.450
 let's go straight to middle authentication 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.950
 so next step 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.680
 the email was sent ok what happens 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.259

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.870

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.879

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.269
 recently you indicated lala in a 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:28.150
 button here is reset now you go 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.690

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.870
 that apple website with fields for you 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.010
 so reset and here you will write 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.700
 the following new password and will repeat this 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.890
 new password below is the last step 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.030
 will be connect reset the password I 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.370
 I will not do it, I like my 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.370
 password I do not want to change but here the tip is 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:56.410
 the following must have at least eight 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.079
 characters being that a letter needs 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.720
 be capital lettered and must be at least 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:05.409
 also a number so you must create 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.239
 a password with letters and numbers and that 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.319
 a letter will still have to be letter 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.840
 uppercase 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.720
 so do not forget the next one and if you 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.000
 forget again how to recover 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.549
 the apple password will always be there 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.950
 this possibility does not have to create 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.720
 another and from and ends up losing the purchases 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.419
 that you have already paid 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.419
 beauty is that there have even such
