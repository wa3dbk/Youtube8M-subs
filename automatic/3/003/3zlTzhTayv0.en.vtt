00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
see what it looks like this stuff works

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.770 
see what it looks like this stuff works
good<00:01:12.860> poison<00:01:13.860> ivy<00:01:13.979> poison<00:01:14.159> oak<00:01:14.670> 240<00:01:15.659> different

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
good poison ivy poison oak 240 different

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.850

types<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.350> weeds

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
types of weeds

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.490 
types of weeds
it's<00:01:17.400> got<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.820> heads<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> label<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.170> mean<00:01:19.350> if

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
it's got go heads on the label I mean if

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.620 
it's got go heads on the label I mean if
it's<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.159> broadleaf<00:01:20.610> weed<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.060> got<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> killer

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it's a broadleaf weed it's got a killer

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.660 
it's a broadleaf weed it's got a killer
so<00:01:21.840> broadleaf<00:01:22.740> weeds<00:01:23.009> would<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.400> anything

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
so broadleaf weeds would be anything

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.760 
so broadleaf weeds would be anything
with<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> actual<00:01:24.810> leaf<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.320> not<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> grass

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
with a actual leaf on it not a grass

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.870 
with a actual leaf on it not a grass
that's<00:01:26.280> right

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that's right

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
that's right
so<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:27.930> am<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> use<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
so what am I going to use this is it

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.530 
so what am I going to use this is it
