because I I think I can feel it always
stronger<00:02:46.530> in<00:02:46.620> my<00:02:46.769> arms<00:02:47.129> that<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:50.340> was<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:50.579> a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
stronger in my arms that it was like a

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.340 
stronger in my arms that it was like a
stream<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.860> something<00:02:52.970> right<00:02:53.970> go<00:02:54.209> down<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:55.139> my

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
stream of something right go down to my

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.960 
stream of something right go down to my

the area and then it actually I think I
maybe<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:21.329> energy<00:03:22.109> found<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:23.010> way<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:24.180> in

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
maybe this energy found a way like in

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.979 
maybe this energy found a way like in
the<00:03:24.930> other<00:03:25.049> place<00:03:25.470> mm-hmm<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.760> then<00:03:26.970> okay<00:03:27.720> here

the other place mm-hmm so then okay here

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.860 
the other place mm-hmm so then okay here
was<00:03:28.169> like<00:03:28.560> getting<00:03:28.769> stronger<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.750> I

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
was like getting stronger and then I

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.809 
was like getting stronger and then I
could<00:03:31.079> feel<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:31.950> back<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.190> my<00:03:32.549> head

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
mm-hmm and then I could feel it in my

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:43.550 
mm-hmm and then I could feel it in my
ears<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:40.099> in<00:03:41.239> at<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.540> end<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.989> was<00:03:43.200> actually
