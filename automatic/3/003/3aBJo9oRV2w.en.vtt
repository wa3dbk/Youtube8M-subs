00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.330
 one of the toughest days comes but 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.480
 most exciting of the trekking of 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.740
 acclimatization through the valley of Khumbu 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.700
 Carlos Soria and members of his 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.070
 expedition 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.430
 this is Carlos MartÃ­nez Luis Miguel 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.010
 lopez and danny halls tackle a demanding 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.920
 promotion to peace is a question of 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.170
 Col of more than 5 thousand 300 meters nor 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.449
 much less one of the highest of a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.610
 stretch in which the mountains over 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.879
 six thousand and seven thousand meters are 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.640
 frequent and even some eight thousand as 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.160
 the everest and the lhotse are outlined in the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.620
 horizon has also changed the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.629
 temperature there is no place for 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.090
 thermal shirts or any garment 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.610
 smaller coat but the jackets are 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.230
 essential for the cold hitting of 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.200
 integrated into the discovered faces 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.050
 both from Carlos Soria and the rest of 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.570
 his teammates have to take care of all 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.080
 body ends and good boots 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.390
 some gloves and a cap seem to be now 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.090
 as essential for this ascent 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.230
 that without much height constitutes without 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.670
 everything 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.610
 a challenge for this period of 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.980
 acclimation the companion canes 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.290
 inseparable during this trekking no longer 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.900
 they dig into the ground but they find 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.420
 again and again the snow of the himalayas and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.340
 some laborious slopes that require 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.240
 a great effort both physically and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.820
 mental 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.100
 but Carlos Soria and his colleagues 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.140
 they forget everything because they know that this 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.540
 day can be crucial for the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.549
 the development of the expedition 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.130
 feelings that accumulate and demonstrate 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.899
 will be key to face something very 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.420
 superior as is the Kanchenjunga and its 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.710
 8,586 meters high but the effort 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.960
 gets its reward the rise has been 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.950
 perfect and the physicist has responded without 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.480
 problems 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.610
 or peace 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.800
 new and important milestone in the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.290
 acclimatization of Carlos Soria that he 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.840
 same explains good 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.050
 we just arrived at the lapels I have not 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.240
 made a magnificent ascension and this year 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:21.540
 2013 for the first time and we are at 5 thousand 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.580
 330 250 meters let's see if we have 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.250
 luck is seeing us very well these 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.190
 days but tomorrow makes everything great 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.860
 go and from midday it gets cloudy but 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.290
 we are having a lot of luck and we are 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.290
 going very well magnificent day 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.870
 I let you see it
