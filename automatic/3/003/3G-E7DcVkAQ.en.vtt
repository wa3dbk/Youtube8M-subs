it needs to move from that point and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.819 
it needs to move from that point and
then<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:29.240> put<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.479> back<00:01:29.600> on<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:29.960> reprove<00:01:30.320> it

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
and you proof until you get what's

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.520 
and you proof until you get what's
called<00:01:35.179> a<00:01:35.810> vit

called a vit
a<00:01:36.710> bone<00:01:36.979> on<00:01:37.100> TV<00:01:37.490> which<00:01:38.060> means<00:01:38.299> like<00:01:38.509> good<00:01:38.810> to

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
a bone on TV which means like good to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.289 
a bone on TV which means like good to
pull<00:01:39.219> and<00:01:40.219> that<00:01:40.369> means<00:01:40.549> that<00:01:40.729> that's<00:01:40.850> your

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
pull and that means that that's your

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.639 
pull and that means that that's your
sort<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.689> standard<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.289> you're<00:01:42.409> going<00:01:42.590> to

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
sort of standard that you're going to

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.319 
sort of standard that you're going to
print<00:01:42.799> off<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:42.950> every<00:01:43.610> other<00:01:43.729> print<00:01:44.090> should

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
print off of every other print should

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:51.070 
print off of every other print should
look<00:01:44.539> like<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:44.929> one<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.500> ba<00:01:46.069> t<00:01:46.219> print

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.440 

what<00:01:52.080> it<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.350> letterpress<00:01:53.040> does<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.270> so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
what it is that letterpress does it's so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.860 
what it is that letterpress does it's so
different<00:01:54.720> from<00:01:55.130> offset<00:01:56.130> printing<00:01:56.460> from<00:01:56.940> for

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
different from offset printing from for

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.780 
different from offset printing from for
most<00:01:58.080> things<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.560> find<00:01:58.770> today<00:01:59.450> is<00:02:00.450> that

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
most things that you find today is that

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.670 
most things that you find today is that
one<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:02.940> a<00:02:03.030> lot<00:02:03.150> more<00:02:03.300> personal<00:02:03.510> and<00:02:03.960> two<00:02:04.290> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
one it's a lot more personal and two I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.650 
one it's a lot more personal and two I
think<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.400> just<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.910> higher<00:02:06.090> quality<00:02:06.570> of

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
think it's just a higher quality of

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.380 
think it's just a higher quality of
printing<00:02:07.080> what<00:02:08.070> happens<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:08.640> letterpress<00:02:09.030> is

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
printing what happens in letterpress is

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.930 
printing what happens in letterpress is
that<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:10.619> actually<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> lot<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.670> pressure

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that it's actually a lot of pressure

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.450 
that it's actually a lot of pressure
being<00:02:12.270> exerted<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.170> paper<00:02:13.380> which<00:02:14.040> causes

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
being exerted on the paper which causes

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.640 
being exerted on the paper which causes
an<00:02:14.610> indentation<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.570> when<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.380> run<00:02:16.500> your

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
an indentation so when you run your

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.990 
an indentation so when you run your
hands<00:02:16.860> across<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.220> paper<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.670> can<00:02:17.820> actually

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
hands across the paper you can actually

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.030 
hands across the paper you can actually
feel<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.930> there's<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.530> little<00:02:19.650> bit<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.890> an

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
feel that there's a little bit of an

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.340 
feel that there's a little bit of an
impression<00:02:20.310> there<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.850> think<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:22.050> that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
impression there I think that that

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.820 
impression there I think that that
little<00:02:22.740> physical<00:02:23.340> reminder<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:25.140> enough<00:02:25.500> to

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
little physical reminder is is enough to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.980 
little physical reminder is is enough to
say<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.100> know<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.820> this<00:02:27.420> took<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.720> little<00:02:27.900> bit

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
say you know that this took a little bit

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.470 
say you know that this took a little bit
of<00:02:28.080> extra<00:02:28.320> time<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.550> know<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.120> there

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
of extra time and that I know that there

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.230 
of extra time and that I know that there
was<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.630> human<00:02:30.930> behind<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:32.060> really<00:02:33.060> love

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
was a human behind this I really love

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.580 
was a human behind this I really love
the<00:02:33.450> human<00:02:33.720> aspect<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.230> printing

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.320 

this<00:02:37.920> thing<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.220> really<00:02:38.400> happy<00:02:41.180> what<00:02:42.180> you're

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
this thing is really happy what you're

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.790 
this thing is really happy what you're
looking<00:02:42.630> at<00:02:42.690> actually<00:02:43.140> right<00:02:43.290> now<00:02:43.440> is

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
looking at actually right now is

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.210 
looking at actually right now is
something<00:02:44.010> called<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.790> boxcar<00:02:45.540> base<00:02:46.069> it's<00:02:47.069> a

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
something called a boxcar base it's a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.110 
something called a boxcar base it's a
metal<00:02:47.459> base<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:48.540> allows<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.650> use<00:02:50.120> what's

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
metal base that allows you to use what's

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.540 
metal base that allows you to use what's
called<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.480> photopolymer<00:02:52.040> plastic<00:02:53.040> plate<00:02:53.280> and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
called a photopolymer plastic plate and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.570 
called a photopolymer plastic plate and
this<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.720> really<00:02:54.959> revolutionary<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:56.220> terms<00:02:56.459> of

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
this is really revolutionary in terms of

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.390 
this is really revolutionary in terms of
letterpress<00:02:56.940> technology<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:58.260> don't<00:02:59.130> like<00:02:59.280> it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
letterpress technology I don't like it

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.199 
letterpress technology I don't like it
as<00:02:59.489> much<00:02:59.520> as<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.390> metal<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.020> wood<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:02.040> lot<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.060> a

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
as much as a metal of wood a lot of a

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.900 
as much as a metal of wood a lot of a
lot<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.600> older<00:03:03.959> older<00:03:04.230> generation<00:03:05.220> would

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
lot of the older older generation would

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.390 
lot of the older older generation would
probably<00:03:06.360> agree<00:03:06.510> with<00:03:06.780> me<00:03:06.930> but<00:03:07.220> unless<00:03:08.220> you

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
probably agree with me but unless you

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.430 
probably agree with me but unless you
have<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.580> lot<00:03:08.819> of<00:03:08.850> money<00:03:09.120> or<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.510> lot<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.170> space

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
have a lot of money or a lot of space

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.280 
have a lot of money or a lot of space
it's<00:03:11.130> really<00:03:11.370> hard<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.760> have<00:03:11.940> an<00:03:12.269> only<00:03:13.050> led

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
it's really hard to have an only led

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
it's really hard to have an only led
lead<00:03:14.190> type<00:03:14.459> shop<00:03:17.090> in<00:03:18.090> some<00:03:18.330> ways<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.720> feel<00:03:18.930> like

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
lead type shop in some ways I feel like

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.100 
lead type shop in some ways I feel like
you<00:03:20.310> know<00:03:20.430> if<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.850> don't<00:03:20.910> do<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.360> or<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> few

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
you know if I don't do it or a few

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.710 
you know if I don't do it or a few
people<00:03:22.200> don't<00:03:22.530> do<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.730> know<00:03:23.850> who<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.300> like

people don't do it you know who is like

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.009 
people don't do it you know who is like
it's<00:03:25.260> very<00:03:25.319> much<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> dying<00:03:26.069> trade<00:03:27.019> granted

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
it's very much a dying trade granted

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.070 
it's very much a dying trade granted
there<00:03:28.170> have<00:03:28.350> have<00:03:28.769> been

in the past 15 years or so there's been
a<00:03:32.840> little<00:03:33.230> spike<00:03:33.530> in<00:03:33.860> terms<00:03:34.100> of<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.310> number<00:03:34.520> of

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
a little spike in terms of the number of

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.730 
a little spike in terms of the number of
people<00:03:34.910> interested<00:03:35.300> in<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:35.990> trying<00:03:36.530> to

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
people interested in it and trying to

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.920 
people interested in it and trying to
learn<00:03:36.860> how<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.040> do<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.520> which<00:03:38.330> is<00:03:38.360> great<00:03:38.690> you

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930

learn how to do it which is great you
know<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.200> more<00:03:39.350> printers<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.890> better<00:03:40.480> but

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
know the more printers the better but

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.880 
know the more printers the better but
originally<00:03:41.990> it<00:03:42.080> started<00:03:42.170> out<00:03:42.470> as<00:03:42.620> like<00:03:42.740> a<00:03:42.800> very

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
originally it started out as like a very

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.490 
originally it started out as like a very
democratic<00:03:43.310> media<00:03:43.880> you<00:03:44.240> know<00:03:44.360> it<00:03:45.080> was<00:03:45.290> a

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
democratic media you know it was a

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.440 
democratic media you know it was a
really<00:03:45.860> fast<00:03:46.220> way<00:03:46.460> to<00:03:46.490> get<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:47.060> lot<00:03:47.300> of

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
really fast way to get a lot of

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.160 
really fast way to get a lot of
multiples<00:03:47.900> out<00:03:48.080> there<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:48.850> distribute<00:03:50.170> words

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
multiples out there and distribute words

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.470 
multiples out there and distribute words
or<00:03:51.320> images<00:03:51.710> to<00:03:51.740> the<00:03:51.920> masses<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.390> know

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
or images to the masses and so you know

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.860 
or images to the masses and so you know
I<00:03:53.510> really<00:03:53.930> like<00:03:54.110> I<00:03:54.380> really<00:03:54.950> like<00:03:55.160> its<00:03:55.310> origins

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
I really like I really like its origins

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.150 
I really like I really like its origins
and<00:03:56.870> I'm<00:03:56.990> thrilled<00:03:57.290> about<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:57.860> know<00:03:57.950> where

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
it's going now I'm just really happy to

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.780 
it's going now I'm just really happy to
be<00:04:00.170> a<00:04:00.260> part<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:03.650> this<00:04:03.920> is<00:04:04.070> where<00:04:04.250> we<00:04:04.430> mix

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
be a part of it so this is where we mix

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.730 
be a part of it so this is where we mix
up<00:04:04.940> our<00:04:05.060> inks<00:04:05.360> before<00:04:05.690> we<00:04:05.810> put<00:04:06.410> them<00:04:06.530> on<00:04:06.650> the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
up our inks before we put them on the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.920 
up our inks before we put them on the
press<00:04:06.950> there's<00:04:07.760> two<00:04:07.970> different<00:04:08.120> kinds<00:04:08.870> of

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
press there's two different kinds of

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.870 
press there's two different kinds of
inks<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.290> we<00:04:09.350> normally<00:04:09.470> use<00:04:09.710> rubber<00:04:10.640> base

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
inks that we normally use rubber base

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.880 
inks that we normally use rubber base
and<00:04:11.210> oil<00:04:11.480> base<00:04:11.720> okay<00:04:12.140> so<00:04:12.320> you<00:04:12.380> skim<00:04:12.710> off<00:04:12.860> the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
and oil base okay so you skim off the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.230 
and oil base okay so you skim off the
top<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.490> you're<00:04:13.670> going<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.820> want<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.030> take<00:04:14.210> a

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
top and you're going to want to take a

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.970 
top and you're going to want to take a
little<00:04:14.510> bit<00:04:14.630> of<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.840> sink<00:04:15.110> and<00:04:15.680> you're<00:04:15.830> just

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
little bit of the sink and you're just

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.770 
little bit of the sink and you're just
going<00:04:16.100> to<00:04:16.130> put<00:04:16.340> it<00:04:16.430> out<00:04:16.520> like<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.330> then

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
going to put it out like this and then

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.620 
going to put it out like this and then
what<00:04:18.200> I<00:04:18.230> normally<00:04:18.350> do<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:19.100> I<00:04:20.030> just<00:04:20.060> take<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.450> out

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
what I normally do is I just take it out

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.040 
what I normally do is I just take it out
and<00:04:21.580> I<00:04:22.580> work<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.030> little<00:04:23.060> bit<00:04:23.420> just<00:04:23.720> so<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:23.930> can

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
and I work it a little bit just so I can

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.230 
and I work it a little bit just so I can
make<00:04:24.170> sure<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.530> there's<00:04:24.890> no<00:04:25.100> like<00:04:25.520> dry<00:04:25.850> spots

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
make sure that there's no like dry spots

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.150 
make sure that there's no like dry spots
of<00:04:26.420> ink<00:04:26.630> that<00:04:26.840> are<00:04:27.020> going<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.650> stick<00:04:27.920> on<00:04:28.040> the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
of ink that are going to stick on the

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160 
of ink that are going to stick on the
press<00:04:28.400> anything<00:04:28.910> like<00:04:29.060> that<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.870> I'm<00:04:29.990> just

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
press anything like that and I'm just

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.690 
press anything like that and I'm just
going<00:04:30.290> to<00:04:30.350> distribute<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:30.950> evenly<00:04:31.160> right

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
going to distribute it evenly right

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:46.000 
going to distribute it evenly right
across<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.330> top<00:04:32.570> and<00:04:32.840> little<00:04:33.230> dots<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.740> now

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
across the top and little dots so now

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.350 
across the top and little dots so now
that<00:04:46.130> I've<00:04:46.280> done<00:04:46.310> that<00:04:46.520> I'm<00:04:46.880> going<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.120> lower

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
that I've done that I'm going to lower

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.720 
that I've done that I'm going to lower
my<00:04:47.480> form<00:04:47.960> rollers<00:04:48.290> back<00:04:48.770> onto<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.190> track<00:04:49.460> so

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
my form rollers back onto the track so

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.860 
my form rollers back onto the track so
that<00:04:49.880> they're<00:04:50.030> hitting<00:04:50.360> this<00:04:50.480> cylinder

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
that they're hitting this cylinder

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.530 
that they're hitting this cylinder
roller<00:04:51.200> and<00:04:51.500> then<00:04:51.950> inking<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:52.970> form<00:04:53.240> with<00:04:53.510> the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
roller and then inking the form with the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.750 
roller and then inking the form with the
ink<00:04:53.810> that<00:04:53.960> we've<00:04:54.140> just<00:04:54.410> added<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.950> can<00:04:55.370> print

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
ink that we've just added you can print

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.760 
ink that we've just added you can print
things<00:04:55.910> digitally<00:04:56.480> and<00:04:56.750> offset<00:04:57.260> that<00:04:57.500> are<00:04:57.620> so

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
things digitally and offset that are so

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.840 
things digitally and offset that are so
much<00:04:57.890> cheaper<00:04:58.480> in<00:04:59.480> terms<00:04:59.540> of<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:01.670> production

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
much cheaper in terms of the production

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.510 
much cheaper in terms of the production
cost<00:05:02.390> so<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:02.840> definitely<00:05:03.020> understand<00:05:03.680> you<00:05:04.400> know

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
cost so I definitely understand you know

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.150 
cost so I definitely understand you know
why<00:05:04.790> that<00:05:05.090> progression<00:05:05.450> happened<00:05:06.130> but<00:05:07.130> I

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
why that progression happened but I

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.980 
why that progression happened but I
think<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.730> you<00:05:07.880> know<00:05:08.000> if<00:05:08.150> for<00:05:08.540> any<00:05:08.720> special

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
think that you know if for any special

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.189 
think that you know if for any special
occasion<00:05:09.230> for<00:05:09.770> any

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
occasion for any

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.050 
occasion for any
that's<00:05:10.469> you<00:05:10.919> know<00:05:11.039> something<00:05:11.279> that<00:05:11.520> you<00:05:11.849> want

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
that's you know something that you want

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.600 
that's you know something that you want
to<00:05:12.240> last<00:05:12.419> you<00:05:12.930> know<00:05:13.050> why<00:05:13.229> wouldn't<00:05:13.499> you<00:05:13.830> do

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
to last you know why wouldn't you do

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.519 
to last you know why wouldn't you do
something<00:05:15.120> that's<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.629> little<00:05:15.719> bit<00:05:15.990> more<00:05:16.139> human

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:16.529 
something that's a little bit more human

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.080 
something that's a little bit more human
that<00:05:16.800> has<00:05:17.219> a<00:05:17.249> little<00:05:17.490> bit<00:05:17.580> more<00:05:17.789> creative

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
that has a little bit more creative

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.939 
that has a little bit more creative
creativity<00:05:19.020> behind<00:05:19.139> em<00:05:23.300> for<00:05:24.300> this<00:05:24.419> project

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
creativity behind em for this project

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.279 
creativity behind em for this project
it's<00:05:25.949> a<00:05:26.069> wedding<00:05:26.340> invitation<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:27.150> we<00:05:28.139> knew

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
it's a wedding invitation and we knew

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.469 
it's a wedding invitation and we knew
that<00:05:28.319> we<00:05:29.099> are<00:05:29.129> modeling<00:05:29.490> it<00:05:29.729> after<00:05:29.879> some

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
that we are modeling it after some

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.379 
that we are modeling it after some
old-school<00:05:30.900> boxing<00:05:31.110> posters<00:05:32.300> normally<00:05:33.300> you

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
old-school boxing posters normally you

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.480 
old-school boxing posters normally you
print<00:05:33.659> from<00:05:33.719> white<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.080> dark<00:05:34.259> so<00:05:34.949> I<00:05:34.979> printed

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
print from white to dark so I printed

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.209 
print from white to dark so I printed
the<00:05:36.150> silver<00:05:36.509> layer<00:05:36.870> first<00:05:37.199> then<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.800> red<00:05:37.949> and

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
the silver layer first then the red and

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.459 
the silver layer first then the red and
then<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.490> block<00:05:38.639> this<00:05:39.419> is<00:05:39.629> our<00:05:39.779> silver<00:05:40.259> layer

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
then the block this is our silver layer

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.839 
then the block this is our silver layer
and<00:05:41.599> so<00:05:42.599> once<00:05:42.960> I<00:05:43.080> did<00:05:43.259> the<00:05:43.349> design<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:44.099> had<00:05:44.729> to

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
and so once I did the design I had to

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.269 
and so once I did the design I had to
decide<00:05:45.180> what<00:05:45.599> color<00:05:45.839> would<00:05:46.080> be<00:05:46.259> what<00:05:46.499> and<00:05:46.800> then

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:47.279 
decide what color would be what and then

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.600 
decide what color would be what and then
in<00:05:48.560> Illustrator<00:05:49.560> I<00:05:49.770> separated<00:05:50.339> out<00:05:50.550> the

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
in Illustrator I separated out the

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.209 
in Illustrator I separated out the
layers<00:05:52.069> this<00:05:53.069> is<00:05:53.370> red<00:05:54.289> so<00:05:55.289> the<00:05:55.589> red<00:05:55.770> that's

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
layers this is red so the red that's

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:57.679 
layers this is red so the red that's
printed<00:05:56.490> on<00:05:56.610> top<00:05:56.729> of<00:05:56.879> the<00:05:56.939> silver<00:05:57.240> is<00:05:57.419> right

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
printed on top of the silver is right

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.179 
printed on top of the silver is right
here<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.259> then<00:05:58.409> it<00:05:58.529> said<00:05:58.680> it's<00:05:58.830> actually<00:05:59.159> a

00:05:59.179 --> 00:05:59.189 
here and then it said it's actually a

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:01.159 
here and then it said it's actually a
little<00:05:59.339> bit<00:05:59.430> lighter<00:05:59.729> than<00:05:59.849> the<00:06:00.210> red<00:06:00.960> right

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
little bit lighter than the red right

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.200 
little bit lighter than the red right
here<00:06:01.469> it's<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.009> same<00:06:02.069> color<00:06:02.460> red<00:06:02.729> it's<00:06:02.969> just

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
here it's the same color red it's just

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.909 
here it's the same color red it's just
when<00:06:03.360> you<00:06:03.449> layer<00:06:03.689> layer<00:06:04.139> it<00:06:04.349> on<00:06:04.439> top<00:06:04.650> of<00:06:04.710> a

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
when you layer layer it on top of a

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.189 
when you layer layer it on top of a
different<00:06:05.219> take<00:06:05.310> it<00:06:05.550> changes<00:06:06.150> in<00:06:06.300> tonality<00:06:06.629> so

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
different take it changes in tonality so

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.670 
different take it changes in tonality so
this<00:06:07.770> is<00:06:07.919> our<00:06:08.159> last<00:06:08.460> run<00:06:08.819> this<00:06:09.479> is<00:06:09.689> the<00:06:10.469> black

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
this is our last run this is the black

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.700 
this is our last run this is the black
run<00:06:10.949> and<00:06:11.249> it's<00:06:12.029> our<00:06:12.180> key<00:06:12.389> image<00:06:12.749> it<00:06:13.259> locks<00:06:13.499> in

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
run and it's our key image it locks in

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:24.660 
run and it's our key image it locks in
most<00:06:13.919> of<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.099> information

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.450 

so<00:06:25.670> this<00:06:26.000> is<00:06:26.150> our<00:06:26.300> last<00:06:26.510> run<00:06:26.810> and<00:06:27.160> this<00:06:28.160> is<00:06:28.310> what

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
so this is our last run and this is what

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.890 
so this is our last run and this is what
it<00:06:28.580> ended<00:06:28.730> up<00:06:28.880> looking<00:06:29.060> like

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.650 

I<00:06:33.960> love<00:06:34.740> what<00:06:34.889> I<00:06:34.949> do<00:06:35.009> because<00:06:35.400> even<00:06:36.330> if<00:06:36.479> only

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
I love what I do because even if only

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.189 
I love what I do because even if only
you<00:06:37.290> know<00:06:37.410> 150<00:06:38.250> people<00:06:38.580> or<00:06:38.970> 250<00:06:39.780> people<00:06:39.960> are

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
you know 150 people or 250 people are
