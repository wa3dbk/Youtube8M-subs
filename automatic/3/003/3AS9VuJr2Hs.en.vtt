00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.540 

next<00:02:38.140> I'll<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.530> draw<00:02:38.739> two<00:02:38.769> eyes<00:02:39.040> on

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550

next I'll have to draw two eyes on
either<00:02:39.730> side<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.330> handle<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.959> found<00:02:41.620> it

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
either side of the handle I found it

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.559 
either side of the handle I found it
best<00:02:41.950> if<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.310> look<00:02:42.519> up<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.790> picture<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.180> Tripp

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
shaped the hardest part is getting them

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.040 
shaped the hardest part is getting them
at<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.860> exact<00:02:48.220> same<00:02:48.430> size<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.180> at<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.870> same

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.440 
at the exact same size and at the same
level<00:02:50.440> then<00:02:51.370> you'll<00:02:51.550> draw<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.760> mouth<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.360> make
