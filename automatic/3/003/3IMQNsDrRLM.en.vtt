00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.939
 we talk a lot about polyurethane prostheses 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:11.300
 it's a plant that I personally 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.630
 really like it and I have to say that above all 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.700
 abroad in the united states in brazil 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:20.029
 a lot in australia is a plant 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.730
 that is taking more and more ground and is 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.980
 convincing more and more surgeons is done 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.590
 a lot of talk about polyurethane can 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.240
 be carcinogenic or not silicone 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.830
 may be cancerous or not 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.410
 etc. let's try to do some 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.659
 clarity on this topic 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.299
 all prostheses also coated 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:39.549
 of polyurethane are in the cohesive gel of 

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:42.830
 silicone all of the last ones 

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:44.930
 generating silicone that fit 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.960
 liquid in the past has given problems 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.180
 today it is in the form of crystals in the form of 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.869
 100% cohesive and bio-compatible gel 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.970
 percent 

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:54.830
 the same can be said of the polyurethane the 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.170
 polyurethane is used in the form 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.659
 of crystals today the prosthesis is not 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.510
 completely made of polyurethane is one 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.760
 coverage that some types of plant 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.590
 year the polyurethane prosthesis has of the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.100
 features that make it a 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.900
 exceptional plant is so true that 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.380
 latest certifications of food and 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.090
 American drug administration sees it 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.710
 probably like the plant more 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.470
 cutting edge of the world hold 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.440
 present that Daniel Fleming in Australia 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.080
 that perhaps today the surgeon who puts more 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.180
 breast implants in the world now uses from 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.310
 ten years only polyurethane prosthesis 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.520
 polyurethane to start with not 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.670
 it can rotate so it guarantees in all 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.320
 those patients who have a poor one 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.510
 tissue retention for example patients 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.820
 who have breastfed several times 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.530
 skin is very relaxed one 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.630
 very large plant one 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.460
 great stability and so yes 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.800
 can use in those patients in 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.930
 which only prostheses were used before 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.460
 round you can use the system a 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.630
 drop with a much more natural effect 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.729
 and then the polyurethane gave results 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.700
 extraordinary in terms of contracture 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.220
 capsular is a plant that never gives 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.700
 some capsular contracture exist 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.670
 patients who may be more subjects 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.580
 of others to the capsular contracture the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.040
 polyurethane solves 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.510
 but in addition to having a lifetime guarantee 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.600
 against breakages like all the others 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.700
 latest generation prosthesis also has 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.390
 ten years warranty against the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.390
 capsular contracture
