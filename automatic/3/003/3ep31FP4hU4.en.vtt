health by about 260 also offer my 800 I
think<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.650> have<00:02:24.829> but<00:02:25.790> it's<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.090> 1300<00:02:27.019> capacity

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500

shield<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.609> on<00:02:28.910> increase<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.599> shield

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
shield so on increase that shield

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.009 
shield so on increase that shield
capacity<00:02:30.349> by<00:02:30.769> but<00:02:31.010> fifteen<00:02:31.730> percent<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.450> I

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
capacity by but fifteen percent and I

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.440 
capacity by but fifteen percent and I
regenerate<00:02:33.620> two<00:02:34.099> percent<00:02:34.579> of<00:02:34.790> my<00:02:35.150> health

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
regenerate two percent of my health

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.180 
regenerate two percent of my health
while<00:02:35.750> my<00:02:35.870> shields<00:02:36.260> are<00:02:36.349> full

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
turn that will help would be a tank so I

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.750 
turn that will help would be a tank so I

I<00:03:39.379> was<00:03:40.129> thinking<00:03:40.400> building<00:03:40.730> down<00:03:40.909> this<00:03:41.150> way
