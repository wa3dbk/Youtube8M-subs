and one E and A two and three and a four
and<00:01:26.119> you<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.540> how<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.869> might<00:01:28.049> work

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
and you can see how that might work

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:46.700 
and you can see how that might work
better<00:01:28.650> than<00:01:28.920> counting<00:01:29.520> them<00:01:29.670> all<00:01:44.930> in<00:01:45.930> those

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
better than counting them all in those

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.429 
better than counting them all in those
