 it really does a good to our 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.350
 organism and that really is a food 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.029
 nutritious we know that reality is 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.340
 another and that nutrition is something else 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.140
 complicated and delicate and while we kill 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.930

 all the meat that was subjected to 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.960
 extreme industrial processes for 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.820
 get the final product the most

 of these foods contain a

 by extreme heat conditions and 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.120
 pressure that completely destroys the

 trans fats that are added to 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.290

 sure you think because if it says it's 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.240
 enriched with vitamins and minerals and 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.310
 is valid but you knew that the true 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.890
 reason for this fortification is because 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.080
 without it the cereals would be so little 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.690
 nutritious that nobody would want to buy them 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.360

 that are a healthy meal when they turn out 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.170
 be the opposite 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.120
 this illusion leads people to 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.100
 eat more of these bars thinking that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.620
 they are doing good to your body 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.840

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.490
 a large dose of corn syrup high in 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.140
 fructose trans fats and a lot of sodium 7

 perfectly healthy salad with one 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.810
 of those processed dressings the best that 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.150
 you can do is prepare yours from 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.370
 homemade way the nutritional content 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.650
 of these condiments can convert a 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.060
