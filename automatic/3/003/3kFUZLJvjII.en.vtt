00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.860
 First of all, the car on the race track 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.480

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.840
 however, now have a little 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.020

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.100
 why that was last week friday but 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.230
 found that we do not have brake pressure 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.680
 we can suspect that build 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.680
 seal that we'll take a look at it now 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.390
 if that does not work the lunch break 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.760
 took care of tomorrow that would be the now 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.199
 Brake replaced and now have to 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.120

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:07.030

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:15.520
 that we do not catch the exhibition 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:28.539

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:35.020
 Still getting the car again 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:38.789
 from the workshop brake cylinder and here 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.789
 the list is drawn up 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.850
 yesterday we is about 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:57.110

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.790
 yes already worked 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.480
 if things go well then three 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.480
 delayed hours 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.140
 After that eleven is almost finished too 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.210
 a matter attach the bumper there 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.270
 we are at it now and then always 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:24.490

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:26.640

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.640

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.349
 now in belgium spa and 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.349
 Let's see what it brings 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.480
 I hope to drive over without error 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.240
 and can this be the last problems 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.330
 sort out and finally came afford 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.470
 we hope he runs and if ours 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.920
 program can rewind a bit 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.330
 what can learn 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.160
 actually have a successful day 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.160
 had time to press thumb 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.910
 okay but we have no performance missing 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.740
 I think so genuine 100 ps for straight 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.180
 and 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.439
 sobering 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.299
 but once again'm a little time 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.049
 I have complete confidence in the boys 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.049
 made 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.070
 Mr. must have an expression because with 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.600
 nobody has a muffler today 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.720
 blanket and he will probably be too loud 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.720
 his 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.260
 on 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.239
 beautiful weather here in belgium 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.980
 Today I think they are quite good 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.750
 caught cars got stuck autoliv 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.300
 actually very good and mechanically 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.340
 Suspension was great with the engine power 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.320
 you have to work a bit but me 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.310
 think that sounds in the handle in two 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.780
 weeks is already long-distance trophy 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.040
 nÃ¼rburgring until then 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.380

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.190

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.190
