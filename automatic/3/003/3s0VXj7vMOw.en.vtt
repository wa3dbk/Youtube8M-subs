00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
major minor and bluesy we're gonna

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.720 
major minor and bluesy we're gonna
figure<00:00:49.620> out<00:00:49.739> how<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> tell<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> difference

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
figure out how to tell the difference

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.500 
figure out how to tell the difference
between<00:00:50.789> them<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.510> by<00:00:51.629> using<00:00:51.780> our<00:00:52.079> ears<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
between them just by using our ears and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.380 
between them just by using our ears and
then<00:00:54.890> we're<00:00:55.890> gonna<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:57.170> groups<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.350> notes<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
then we're gonna have groups of notes to

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.310 
then we're gonna have groups of notes to
choose<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.690> use<00:01:02.390> for<00:01:03.390> whatever<00:01:03.750> key<00:01:03.989> we're<00:01:04.170> in

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
choose to use for whatever key we're in

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.480 
choose to use for whatever key we're in
for<00:01:04.710> whatever<00:01:05.010> style<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.460> music<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:10.490> then

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
since you know the layout of the C

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.120 
since you know the layout of the C
harmonica<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.670> choose<00:01:14.909> those<00:01:15.180> notes<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
harmonica you can choose those notes and

if you want one note lower than C you

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.890 
if you want one note lower than C you
would<00:03:08.620> get<00:03:08.829> deep<00:03:09.299> remember<00:03:10.299> there's<00:03:10.480> no<00:03:10.659> black

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
would get deep remember there's no black

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.030 
would get deep remember there's no black
key<00:03:11.169> in<00:03:11.349> between<00:03:11.439> C<00:03:12.219> and<00:03:12.250> B<00:03:12.659> well<00:03:14.040> because

key in between C and B well because

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.420 
key in between C and B well because
there's<00:03:15.310> only<00:03:15.430> one<00:03:15.819> note<00:03:16.060> between<00:03:16.329> C<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.049> B<00:03:17.430> B

there's only one note between C and B B

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.240 
there's only one note between C and B B
is<00:03:18.699> also<00:03:18.939> one<00:03:19.659> half<00:03:20.019> step<00:03:20.259> lower<00:03:20.439> than<00:03:21.189> C<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:24.069> it

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
is also one half step lower than C so it

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.009 
is also one half step lower than C so it
doesn't<00:03:24.639> matter<00:03:24.819> if<00:03:25.090> you're<00:03:25.269> moving<00:03:25.569> from<00:03:25.900> a

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
between E and F and B and C so yes there

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.690 
between E and F and B and C so yes there
is

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
is

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.630 
is

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
so black key D sharp then that was one

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.470 
so black key D sharp then that was one
note<00:04:26.880> then<00:04:27.870> E<00:04:28.140> is<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.010> second<00:04:29.370> note<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:29.820> from<00:04:30.060> D

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
note then E is the second note so from D

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.950 
note then E is the second note so from D
up<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:30.900> whole<00:04:31.080> step<00:04:31.350> d<00:04:32.250> sharp<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.700> eat<00:04:32.940> he<00:04:33.600> is<00:04:33.780> the

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
up a whole step d sharp to eat he is the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.010 
up a whole step d sharp to eat he is the

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
whole step higher than D what is a whole

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.360 
whole step higher than D what is a whole
step<00:04:37.290> higher<00:04:37.500> than<00:04:37.710> e<00:04:38.150> well<00:04:39.890> there's<00:04:40.890> no<00:04:41.130> black

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
step higher than e well there's no black

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.640 
step higher than e well there's no black
key<00:04:41.610> between<00:04:41.790> E<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.270> F<00:04:42.480> so<00:04:42.540> one<00:04:43.140> note<00:04:43.380> higher

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
key between E and F so one note higher

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.880 
key between E and F so one note higher
would<00:04:44.070> be<00:04:44.220> F<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:45.110> one<00:04:46.110> note<00:04:46.290> higher<00:04:46.470> than<00:04:46.710> that

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
would be F and one note higher than that

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.670 
would be F and one note higher than that
remember<00:04:47.220> we<00:04:47.490> need<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.760> go<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:47.940> notes<00:04:48.360> is

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
remember we need to go to notes is

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.610 
remember we need to go to notes is
f-sharp<00:04:49.680> or<00:04:50.340> g-flat<00:04:50.840> so<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.870> whole<00:04:52.200> step<00:04:52.440> higher

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
than E is f-sharp or g-flat you need to

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.659 
than E is f-sharp or g-flat you need to
understand<00:04:58.410> this<00:04:58.650> stuff<00:04:58.950> if<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.250> if<00:04:59.520> you

don't understand this stuff it's kind of

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.620 
don't understand this stuff it's kind of
like<00:05:02.400> learning<00:05:02.700> higher<00:05:03.030> math<00:05:03.330> without
