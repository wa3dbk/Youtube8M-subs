00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello all welcome one more day to me 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.809
 channel today I will share with you 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.730
 this second tutorial with 3m and today we are going 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.910
 to try to get with the waves 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.480
 truffles good as you see this is the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.760
 result and I'll show you step by step 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.250
 how can you do it too? 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.279
 well then we go with the first step 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.580
 the simplest is undoubtedly to wash and 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.920
 condition the hair with the shampoo and with 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.989
 the 3m conditioner because it is 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.780
 important either the other day in the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.030
 first video and I repeat it is because 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.360
 this shampoo and this conditioner does not 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.370
 contain silicones is super important 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.610
 so as not to lose volume and that the hair 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.950
 later I did not think I do not know how to look once 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.410
 that we already have the hair washed with nando 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.480
 There is still wet hair that only 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.200
 we have dried with the towel we apply 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.840
 surfer waves of 3 hunger 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.270
 simply provide that texture to which 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.580
 they left to fear to the touch 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.130
 that feeling from beach classrooms 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.770
 true but for which we have the hair 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.450
 smooth we still have something more than 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.590
 do now we just have to 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.590
 brush the heat 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090
 two 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.759
 remember the trick to hide from the 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.340
 services without a ball for the one that most 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.280
 lack the hair does not break us and it 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.280
 get much better 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.900
 I'll leave the link below the video 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.380
 any fabric again, if you want 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.200
 buy 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.659
 and now we are going with a very important step 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.270
 what is the hair drying in this case 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.280
 it's so important because because you have to 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.680
 leave it with a little moisture there is no 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.110
 to get 100% out I would say that there is 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.780
 take it out the instructions say that 180 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.090
 if you allow me my personal advice I 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.860
 I would say a 90 that hair looks like 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.439
 it is dry you know why it touches you 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.770
 he dismounted because that is the point that 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.770
 we like 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.190
 and now we go with another one of the points 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.440
 important from the tutorial that is 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.630
 divide the hair into three sections what 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.040
 normal the easiest and I think what 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.040
 better that you do surely 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.580
 in the front on one side and from 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.520
 other 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.020
 I for example as I side as the side 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.020
 right but 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.170
 if you want you can help with this but 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.620
 I think this time is very simple and 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.620
 I need 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.270
 this 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.020
 the right side and pyrid the whole part 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.260
 from behind 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:07.050
 what are we going to do now we take each 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.050
 section and we're going to do muÃ±oz 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.540
 two 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.600
 for me there is always much better 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.000
 we look outward on each side is 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.240
 say here we will do it from this side 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.640
 to the left from here towards the 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.010
 right so that we always have the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.700
 but 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.700
 outward 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.019
 and now we hold 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.019
 now 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.020
 and again, asia 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.060
 the outside 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.560
 Well, when we have to come back from 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.880
 go ahead, we just have to 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.880
 do the same in the back 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.269
 now simply because it remains to wait for 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.980
 that you finish drying your hair if you do not 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.109
 you are doing nothing it means to have 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.760
 hurry to go out to the street you can 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.489
 leave the bows and do what you have 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.739
 what to do at home and if you have to leave 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.730
 to the street as we move forward with the dryer 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.730
 Y 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.200
 now that quickly our minutes 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.350
 to see the results of the zones 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.350
 sojeras 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.260
 once we have touched him with the 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.590
 dryer to one as I told you we have 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.590
 waited a while 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.770
 now we just have to play with 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.770
 fingers combing the we 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.720
 to ride them 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.469
 and we let letters 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.260
 as you see already after we have 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.180
 released our bows but it's ready 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.610
 and we just have to put a little bit 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.160
 our taste then stretch the green wave 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.740
 be a little with your hands I do it 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.960
 always with your hands and to get 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.960
 an extra volume and especially about 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.860
 all much longer 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.860
 the final spray 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:42.060
 fixative 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:44.750
 and I always apply it with my head 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.750
 upside down 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:54.340
 Well, you have seen something super easy 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.760
 which is to get some spheres I do not know 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.650
 If you have the same thing that I hallucinate 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.470
 result because it's really like I was 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.870
 they stay but after a long day in 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.270
 the beach so I hope that I have 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.820
 liked this second tutorial that like 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.620
 you see a little bit has to do with the waves 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.920
 gentle we did the other day is a lot 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.570
 more carefree much cooler and like 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.610
 want it was ours as it comes but 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.180

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.800
 cured 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.020
 Let's be honest weeks between 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.450

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.930
