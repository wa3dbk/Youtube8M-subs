00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.580
 today's challenge consists of a career 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.969
 of relays on an obstacle course 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.090
 with shooting stations all along 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.370
 they will be divided into four couples to me 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.410
 signal 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.850
 the first couple will get under the 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.010
 barbed wire until you reach the 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.090
 first station where you will find the 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.620
 springfield in 1903 the longest rifle 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.660
 of the four you will have to 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.670
 shoot the two explosive targets 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.670
 the first will be 45 meters 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.690
 the second target was 92 meters 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.129
 once they have impacted both 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.170
 whites the second pair will start 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.790
 move around its corresponding obstacle 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.559
 which will consist of bushes made of 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.989
 wooden sticks at the end of this 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.059
 obstacle will see the s 2040 the rifle 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.989

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.989
 they will have two targets 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.810
 once it hits them in the third pair 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.300
 You can start the obstacle with the rope 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.250
 perhaps the most difficult of the four in the 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.250

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.550
 you can crawl in the mud until 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.920
