of the post these are the second two
strands<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:36.070> we<00:01:36.340> need<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:37.229> work<00:01:38.229> through

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
strands that we need to work through

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.630 
strands that we need to work through
here<00:01:40.659> you<00:01:40.869> can<00:01:41.080> see<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.439> first<00:01:41.770> pair<00:01:42.190> strands

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
here you can see the first pair strands

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.090 
here you can see the first pair strands
and<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.149> second<00:01:43.720> two<00:01:43.959> strands<00:01:44.350> insert<00:01:44.860> the
