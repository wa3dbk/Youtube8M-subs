00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.279
 a new video of me in this 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.839
 video 's then really cool again 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.839
 the bike path is a lot of fun 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.400
 the first, of course, is called lok bar 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.070
 settings sorry and is like name already 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.150
 say a tip for the lockscreen and with 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.880
 This trick has a few 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.529
 shortcuts on the lockscreen and that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.539
 I have the whole as activations 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.510
 Method selected in the me here 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.200
 double in this slider here's a hint 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.620
 I already have a few 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.469
 Choices I can 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 example here on the right make the vegan 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.980
 or again 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.320
 then this whole thing will turn blue or me 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.360
 can turn on the flashlight here 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.570
 Maybe you can see background here 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.000
 Also a flashlight is on bluetooth 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.629
 and then I can still use the flight mode 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.890
 once on or off so if 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.719
 I double thank you again 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.940
 It's normal and I can do that 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.850
 Otherwise I can intrigue 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.409
 that's just how it works better then I go 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.549
 now just in the settings 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.619
 because you can indeed a few 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.369
 still make settings and indeed 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.920
 we have here then 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.590
 if I just go up there once 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.530
 then you can already see that here 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.290
 all the way up to personalize 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.909
 as I said I'm up here twice from 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.509
 the whole thing works with one 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.009
 smiley here you can see these different 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.710
 select shortcuts airplane mode 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.960
 bluetooth as the pickpockets or wifi 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.850
 Here there's the whole 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.710
 possibilities then you go there 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.409
 I can find a lot to adjust 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.220
 Practical trick so he has a few 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.750
 schott makes a guest appearance on the lockscreen 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.540
 come already equal to the second 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.860
 trick this is called mini player and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.409
 maybe you have already seen that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.869
 I 've got a little silver or something here 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.210
 white line one side when i hit the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.920
 So far, first to get up here 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.460
 then you can see this little mini 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.530
 player at the moment is play when I do that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.190
 Once on the bank we have play here 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.080
 break and forward and next song 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.330
 if I am the whole but make me 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.480
 press times then we see 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.180
 already starts 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.640
 automatically the music and here will be 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.530
 also the album cover displayed when 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.950
 now once on the album 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.440
 fag 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.500
 then automatically the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.500
 but you can also open music app in 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.019
 then select the settings like 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.370
 you would just like to want to work 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.110
 really good for me here 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.209
 nice practical mini player directly 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.010
 on the homescreen if you have it in 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.470
 the apps then go in here is the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.900
 also still further indicated and so has 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.060
 you have everywhere on the iphone then with 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.220
 where you are right now this mini player 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.319
 is very convenient as I think and the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.810
 next trick is a trick to the 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.910
 news app and me really very much 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.920
 In practice, maybe you know tweet 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.599
 board there is also the feature and 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.670
 although if you upload a picture now 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.730
 If you want jackpot then you can there 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.590
 choose to be the last 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.810
 you can easily select a shot picture 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.510
 because now if I am here in the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.120
 news app if I go now times 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.500
 Click on this photo symbol below left 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.269
 then I have another one 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.239
 I can choose yes 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.530
 the last shot or last photo 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.750
 hall what they did with the iphone 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.310
 I then choose here that comes for 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.530
 me too , that I just kinda 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.639
 send a screenshot from ufa 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.130
 want and then it is essential 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.410
 that is simple about this symbol 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.200
 easy to do here and no 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.370
 occurs easier and will be mine here 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.160
 last picture just in this send 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.190
 field added the next goal 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.590
 Sat 1 develops and there it is 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.560
 a zero must pay attention 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.359
 yes it is also available for free in sweeter 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.669
 and then you have some here 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.709
 Quick access to the apps I had 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.840
 set activation code or selected 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.030
 that i like about the status bar here 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.120
 to the left and then we see on 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.790
 Right edge I have some apps 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.900
 selected I then very often use 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.239
 and for one, it's the one here 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.609
 attitude or my app you see 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.199
 some apps have their name here 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.449
 and down or some even if I'm to 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.120
 example you have no names here now 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.400
 you can say that as one 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.949
 young then adjust which room 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.840
 the setting symbols then type 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.479
 you already open the immediately 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.130
 Settings app we go under s 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.010
 and here you have it all 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.190
 or you can do it all the same once 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.110
 activate 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.000
 and down here you can see the individual 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.070
 select apps around and is on 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.860
 activation method the whole thing is running 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.290
 about activator and here you can do that 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.660
 whole stop just choose depending on 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.720
 as one might have the yes and here at 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.490
 the apps just have to be named 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.990
 Enter and then you can here the icon 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.250
 Select or which doctors unit 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.570
 should open 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.520
 in this case I have her iphone 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.010
 manager selected so my app has 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.320
 but given nothing and yes that 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.240
 works as I said without that 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.580
 one here that one gives the next 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.370
 ticket is better and costs 99 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.139
 dollar sense in cydia is the money though 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.360
 Definitely worth it as I think they are 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.610
 really nice design is and indeed 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.160
 I have 43 unread messages 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.289
 and I have now as activation with 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.300
 the peaceful trick selected that 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.650
 just the icon down vision 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.169
 must and then we come already 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.300
 see if the message has sent 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.310
 about the figure and what in the message 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.599
 contact is here has all the news 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.190
 displayed in this case 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.840
 I have not read yet 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.289
 the whole thing works through synonymous with e 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.139
 mails with the memories and with 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.970
 report and so on very nice and that 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.450
 whole is also compatible with the 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.699
 There are trickboxx in the settings 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.620
 also a few more activations 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.690
 possibilities some possibilities and 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.510
 so here below that none 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.400
 all around to activate here no animation 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.849
 choose how the whole look then 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.760
 should 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.930
 and here I can do that too 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.090
 Select activation method 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.430
 that was the last one 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.169
 of course, as always, if you have the video 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.240
 celebrated and if you have a few more 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.010
