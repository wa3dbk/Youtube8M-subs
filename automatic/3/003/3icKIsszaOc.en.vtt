 download and I will open the page there 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:01:02.219
 where there is the software so google does not 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.219
 faster 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.340

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.680
 and it is compatible 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:47.360
 there is no problem and so here is a 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:50.190

 to go looking for me when that way 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.729
 it's wasting time intel appup 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.729
 center 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.070
 what comes to was a top 5 so there 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.769
 you can see on the intel interface 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.850

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.690
 there are already applications to 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.280

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.680
 free shares and one that are paying 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.320
 and I advise you the htv is not 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.180
 all expensive then next then 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.090
 then and you arrive on this 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.570
 page so intel appup that i'm going to 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.670

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.220
 software directly 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.120
 it takes a few seconds of his 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.410

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.850
