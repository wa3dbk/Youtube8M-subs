00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.039 

so<00:00:09.700> occasionally<00:00:10.150> when<00:00:10.629> you're<00:00:10.780> painting

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.049 
so occasionally when you're painting

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.009 
so occasionally when you're painting
you'll<00:00:11.440> see<00:00:11.709> kind<00:00:12.039> of<00:00:12.190> weird<00:00:12.519> artifacts<00:00:13.330> pop

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
you'll see kind of weird artifacts pop

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.170 
you'll see kind of weird artifacts pop
up<00:00:14.289> and<00:00:14.619> I'll<00:00:15.250> go<00:00:15.309> ahead<00:00:15.519> and<00:00:15.639> delete<00:00:15.940> this

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
up and I'll go ahead and delete this

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.480 
up and I'll go ahead and delete this
layer<00:00:16.360> and<00:00:16.750> we<00:00:17.470> can<00:00:17.650> make<00:00:17.800> a<00:00:17.829> new<00:00:18.039> layer<00:00:18.220> we'll

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
layer and we can make a new layer we'll

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.920 
layer and we can make a new layer we'll
make<00:00:18.610> it<00:00:18.640> much<00:00:18.970> smaller<00:00:19.150> say<00:00:19.960> 256<00:00:20.829> by<00:00:21.279> 256

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
make it much smaller say 256 by 256

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.200 
make it much smaller say 256 by 256
select<00:00:22.930> add<00:00:23.110> color<00:00:23.410> and<00:00:23.739> see<00:00:24.580> now<00:00:24.820> when<00:00:25.060> we

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
select add color and see now when we

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.839 
select add color and see now when we
paint<00:00:25.570> we're<00:00:26.140> seeing<00:00:26.470> a<00:00:26.560> very<00:00:26.859> pixelated

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
paint we're seeing a very pixelated

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.820 
paint we're seeing a very pixelated
image<00:00:28.179> here<00:00:28.480> but<00:00:28.660> also<00:00:29.109> you'll<00:00:29.500> see<00:00:29.679> these

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
image here but also you'll see these

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.829 
image here but also you'll see these
kind<00:00:29.890> of<00:00:30.130> weird<00:00:30.369> little<00:00:30.699> artifacts<00:00:31.300> and<00:00:31.599> stuff

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
kind of weird little artifacts and stuff

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.560 
kind of weird little artifacts and stuff
pop<00:00:32.169> up<00:00:32.379> when<00:00:32.559> you<00:00:32.619> try<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:32.830> paint<00:00:33.129> the<00:00:33.640> UV<00:00:34.329> map

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
pop up when you try to paint the UV map

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.119 
pop up when you try to paint the UV map
which<00:00:35.290> is<00:00:35.320> kind<00:00:36.190> of<00:00:36.250> a<00:00:36.370> 2d<00:00:37.180> mesh<00:00:37.839> which<00:00:38.500> defines

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
which is kind of a 2d mesh which defines

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.000 
which is kind of a 2d mesh which defines
where<00:00:39.640> all<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.420> paint<00:00:40.840> is<00:00:41.050> going<00:00:41.320> on<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.739> is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
where all the paint is going on to is

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.900 
where all the paint is going on to is
too<00:00:42.969> large<00:00:43.420> for<00:00:43.719> the<00:00:44.440> small<00:00:44.920> resolution<00:00:45.520> and

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
too large for the small resolution and

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.790 
too large for the small resolution and
as<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.059> side<00:00:46.449> effect<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.930> kind<00:00:47.260> of<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.440> bleed

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
as a side effect the kind of the bleed

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.959 
as a side effect the kind of the bleed
from<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:49.090> paint<00:00:49.449> strokes<00:00:49.899> will<00:00:50.890> end<00:00:51.340> up<00:00:51.579> like

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
from the paint strokes will end up like

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.930 
from the paint strokes will end up like
ink<00:00:52.210> bleeding<00:00:52.750> over<00:00:53.039> into<00:00:54.039> an<00:00:54.219> area<00:00:54.579> that<00:00:54.760> it's

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
ink bleeding over into an area that it's

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.759 
ink bleeding over into an area that it's
not<00:00:55.149> supposed<00:00:55.660> to<00:00:55.780> be<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:58.449> typically<00:00:59.170> making<00:00:59.649> a

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
not supposed to be so typically making a

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.040 
not supposed to be so typically making a
larger<00:01:00.100> resolution<00:01:00.370> sized<00:01:00.879> image<00:01:01.329> will<00:01:01.660> help

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
larger resolution sized image will help

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.460 
larger resolution sized image will help
with<00:01:02.230> that<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:03.489> also<00:01:03.820> under<00:01:04.539> options<00:01:05.170> here

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
with that but also under options here

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.130 
with that but also under options here
you<00:01:06.009> see<00:01:06.220> we<00:01:06.369> can<00:01:06.520> set<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.910> bleed<00:01:07.149> and<00:01:07.450> so<00:01:07.960> if

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
you see we can set the bleed and so if

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.389 
you see we can set the bleed and so if
you're<00:01:08.289> working<00:01:08.440> with<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.679> really<00:01:09.130> small

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
you're working with a really small

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.940 
you're working with a really small
resolution<00:01:10.060> size<00:01:10.270> say<00:01:10.570> like<00:01:10.690> a<00:01:10.780> 256<00:01:11.500> by<00:01:11.619> 256

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
resolution size say like a 256 by 256

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.339 
resolution size say like a 256 by 256
map<00:01:12.550> which<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.179> don't<00:01:13.660> know<00:01:13.840> anything<00:01:14.319> that

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:14.349 
map which I don't know anything that

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:15.990 
map which I don't know anything that
would<00:01:14.619> use<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.800> map<00:01:15.069> that<00:01:15.310> small<00:01:15.580> these<00:01:15.789> days

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
would use a map that small these days

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.779 
would use a map that small these days
it's<00:01:16.270> like<00:01:16.330> Nintendo<00:01:16.899> 64<00:01:17.530> days<00:01:17.709> but<00:01:18.610> if<00:01:18.670> you're

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
it's like Nintendo 64 days but if you're

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.669 
it's like Nintendo 64 days but if you're
working<00:01:18.970> with<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.209> really<00:01:19.539> small<00:01:19.599> map<00:01:20.050> you're

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
working with a really small map you're

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:21.749 
working with a really small map you're
typically<00:01:21.009> going<00:01:21.160> to<00:01:21.220> want<00:01:21.399> to<00:01:21.490> have<00:01:21.640> your

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
typically going to want to have your

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.830 
typically going to want to have your
bleed<00:01:22.030> down<00:01:22.270> very<00:01:23.020> low<00:01:23.500> because<00:01:24.190> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
bleed down very low because the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.190 
bleed down very low because the
probability<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:26.280> your<00:01:27.280> strokes<00:01:28.200> bleeding

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
probability of your strokes bleeding

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.169 
probability of your strokes bleeding
over<00:01:29.380> into<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:30.069> part<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.489> UV<00:01:30.819> map<00:01:31.000> that's

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
over into a part of the UV map that's

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.930 
over into a part of the UV map that's
not<00:01:31.330> supposed<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.810> is<00:01:32.229> pretty<00:01:32.770> high<00:01:33.069> now<00:01:33.670> when

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
not supposed to is pretty high now when

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.309 
not supposed to is pretty high now when
you're<00:01:34.060> working<00:01:34.420> with<00:01:34.450> much<00:01:34.810> larger

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
you're working with much larger

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.740 
you're working with much larger
resolution<00:01:35.950> images<00:01:36.759> like<00:01:36.970> say<00:01:37.179> we<00:01:37.330> bump<00:01:37.569> this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
resolution images like say we bump this

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.699 
resolution images like say we bump this
up<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:40.050> 4096<00:01:41.050> here<00:01:41.259> let's<00:01:41.440> go<00:01:41.500> ahead<00:01:41.560> and

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
up to 4096 here let's go ahead and

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.820 
up to 4096 here let's go ahead and
delete<00:01:41.800> that<00:01:42.099> layer<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:43.020> add<00:01:44.789> this<00:01:45.789> one<00:01:46.119> here

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
delete that layer and add this one here

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.199 
delete that layer and add this one here
when<00:01:47.830> you're<00:01:47.950> working<00:01:48.250> with<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.399> larger<00:01:49.030> layer

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
when you're working with a larger layer

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.389 
when you're working with a larger layer
kind<00:01:49.539> of<00:01:49.599> the<00:01:49.690> opposite<00:01:50.289> problem<00:01:50.590> can<00:01:51.009> happen

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
kind of the opposite problem can happen

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.940 
kind of the opposite problem can happen
where<00:01:52.000> your<00:01:52.660> bleed<00:01:53.020> will<00:01:53.289> be<00:01:53.700> too<00:01:54.700> small<00:01:55.209> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
where your bleed will be too small and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.029 
where your bleed will be too small and
the<00:01:56.950> paint<00:01:57.729> stroke<00:01:58.090> actually<00:01:58.660> won't<00:01:58.989> reach<00:01:59.709> to

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
the paint stroke actually won't reach to

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.669 
the paint stroke actually won't reach to
the<00:02:00.129> edges<00:02:00.729> of<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.420> UV<00:02:01.720> map<00:02:01.869> as<00:02:02.259> you<00:02:02.379> can<00:02:02.500> see

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
the edges of the UV map as you can see

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.460 
the edges of the UV map as you can see
here<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.099> bleed<00:02:03.310> jumped<00:02:03.729> up<00:02:03.849> to<00:02:04.000> 16<00:02:04.569> when<00:02:05.289> we

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
here the bleed jumped up to 16 when we

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.339 
here the bleed jumped up to 16 when we
created<00:02:06.039> a<00:02:06.160> 40<00:02:06.729> by<00:02:06.849> 96<00:02:07.330> map<00:02:07.539> that's<00:02:07.810> because<00:02:08.110> 0

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
created a 40 by 96 map that's because 0

brush has built into it a bleed fixing

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.070 
brush has built into it a bleed fixing
algorithm<00:02:12.370> which<00:02:13.030> increases<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.720> size<00:02:13.900> of

bleeder there we typically will don't
have<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.049> worry<00:02:45.230> about<00:02:45.290> setting<00:02:45.889> that<00:02:46.010> that

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
have to worry about setting that that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.640 
have to worry about setting that that
will<00:02:46.519> automatically<00:02:47.030> increase

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
will automatically increase

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.129 
will automatically increase

appropriately to the size of your map
okay<00:02:51.139> so<00:02:51.200> let's<00:02:51.530> go<00:02:51.680> ahead<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.920> delete<00:02:52.430> that

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
okay so let's go ahead and delete that

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.030 
okay so let's go ahead and delete that
map<00:02:52.909> and<00:02:53.269> I'm<00:02:53.840> going<00:02:54.109> to<00:02:54.400> enter<00:02:55.400> value<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:57.040> 1024

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
map and I'm going to enter value of 1024

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.670 
map and I'm going to enter value of 1024
just<00:02:58.939> to<00:02:59.030> make<00:02:59.180> another<00:02:59.419> standard<00:03:00.290> one<00:03:00.439> here

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
just to make another standard one here

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.280 
just to make another standard one here
when<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.370> paint<00:03:01.760> over<00:03:02.000> like<00:03:02.569> this<00:03:02.870> you'll<00:03:03.200> see

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
when I paint over like this you'll see

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.349 
when I paint over like this you'll see
that<00:03:03.439> it<00:03:04.159> didn't<00:03:04.430> entirely<00:03:04.790> get<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.239> edge

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
that it didn't entirely get the edge

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.530 
that it didn't entirely get the edge
there<00:03:05.689> and<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.379> actually<00:03:06.530> has<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.219> do<00:03:07.540> with

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
there and that actually has to do with

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.589 
there and that actually has to do with
this<00:03:08.780> value<00:03:09.200> here<00:03:09.590> which<00:03:09.919> tells<00:03:10.340> blender<00:03:10.939> to

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
this value here which tells blender to

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.080 
this value here which tells blender to
what<00:03:11.870> extent<00:03:12.439> of<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.859> horizon<00:03:13.489> of<00:03:13.669> the<00:03:13.819> face

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
what extent of the horizon of the face

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.690 
what extent of the horizon of the face
that<00:03:14.780> we're<00:03:14.959> painting<00:03:15.200> on<00:03:15.439> do<00:03:15.739> we<00:03:15.919> want<00:03:16.219> it<00:03:16.459> to

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
that we're painting on do we want it to

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.599 
that we're painting on do we want it to
go<00:03:16.849> past<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:17.870> 80<00:03:18.079> is<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.590> pretty<00:03:18.919> good<00:03:19.129> default

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
go past so 80 is a pretty good default

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.699 
go past so 80 is a pretty good default
value<00:03:20.090> is<00:03:20.359> it<00:03:20.510> gives<00:03:20.659> us<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.959> little<00:03:21.200> bit<00:03:21.469> of<00:03:21.620> a

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
value is it gives us a little bit of a

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.339 
value is it gives us a little bit of a
blur<00:03:21.950> on<00:03:22.310> our<00:03:22.909> horizon<00:03:23.150> instead<00:03:23.989> of<00:03:24.079> just<00:03:24.229> like

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
blur on our horizon instead of just like

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.280 
blur on our horizon instead of just like
a<00:03:24.379> sharp<00:03:24.829> nasty<00:03:25.459> edge<00:03:25.699> so<00:03:26.299> we<00:03:26.419> can<00:03:26.569> just<00:03:26.780> kind

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
a sharp nasty edge so we can just kind

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.550 
a sharp nasty edge so we can just kind
of<00:03:27.349> rotate<00:03:27.709> around<00:03:28.069> and<00:03:28.579> paint<00:03:28.940> like<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:29.560> so

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
of rotate around and paint like that so

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.199 
of rotate around and paint like that so
right<00:03:30.739> now<00:03:30.859> we<00:03:30.919> have<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.220> subdivision<00:03:31.849> surface

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
right now we have a subdivision surface

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.080 
right now we have a subdivision surface

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.939 
dealing with the base low poly mesh here
there's<00:03:59.150> lots<00:03:59.569> of<00:03:59.780> little<00:03:59.959> areas<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.739> the

you can afford it resources why is

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.249 
you can afford it resources why is

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.690 
so I'm going to go ahead and delete that
and<00:04:24.470> just<00:04:25.400> add<00:04:25.699> another<00:04:26.000> simple<00:04:26.449> one<00:04:26.599> here<00:04:26.990> and

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
and just add another simple one here and

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.820

switch this back over to tools and go

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.320 
switch this back over to tools and go

color over to something that will be

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.550 
color over to something that will be
easy<00:05:50.840> to<00:05:50.930> find<00:05:51.050> like<00:05:51.440> red<00:05:51.710> and<00:05:52.539> I<00:05:53.539> can<00:05:54.050> paint

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560
