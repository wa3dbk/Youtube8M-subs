00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.670
 yes 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:17.490
 a dream come true with a m6 bmw in 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.020
 the nÃ¼rbÃ¼rgring circuit 412 kilowatts 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.600
 of power a huge torque 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.840
 Rear-wheel drive all makes driving 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.280
 this car towards a singular experience 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.080
 but in reality what brings me here does not 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.789
 is to walk with the current m6 in this 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.630
 circuit but a unique encounter 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.630
 family 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.489
 here the m6 meets with its ancestor the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:47.629
 bm w 3.0 csl with which in 1972 began 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.629
 the history of BMW motorsport and BMW m 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.700
 in a bubbling stage of history 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.930
 shake hands two generations of 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.250
 cars one of 1972 and the other of 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.480
 2012 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.480
 low and wide 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.219
 instead of narrow and high 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.500
 the kidney was left but its shape is today 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.500
 much more dominant 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.150
 a side air inlet as in the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.820
 m6 current existed already then with 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.190
 abundant chrome is also understood in 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.510
 the rearview mirrors today twice 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.500
 higher 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.170
 crouched to split the current m6 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.840
 straight lines in its predecessor 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.439
 also the saga is now wider and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.439
 muscular 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.760
 It's nice to compare the two cars like this 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.640
 but even more beautiful would be to give 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.610
 turns with this one so let's try 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.090
 the words 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.090
 i 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:12.570
 the 3.0 csl competed six years in 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.160
 racing circuits from 1972 to 1978 and 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.360
 at the beginning without major modifications 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.070
 in the engine equally with its light weight 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.560
 He won many successes too 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:28.470
 after being presented his successor the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:32.640
 bm w it would be 6 you have to imagine that with 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.610
 this car of the 3.0 csl they ran and 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.730
 they won numerous races not bad 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.110
 for this, courage and capacity are needed 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.890
 so much value 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.890
 I have not 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.200
 for the current times it does not behave 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.770
 like a race car not like a 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.480
 truly sporty car 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.480
 the steering wheel has a lot of game 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.480
 and it's also pretty thin here it does not 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.019
 It has the feeling of current cars 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.599
 that is going to be safe with a lot of sheet 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.480
 around and all the elements of 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.030
 security this is actually another 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.010
 thing 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:33.190
 the following model m based on a car 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:36.430
 of series was the m 635 csi of 1984 with 55 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:41.950
 kilowatts more power than the 635 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:46.030
 Normal csi when we found motorsport in 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.470
 May 1972 I never thought I was going to have 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.200
 to success until today we have developed 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:57.100
 built and sold more than 400 thousand 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.160
 high performance cars 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.280
 today there is a m version of almost everything 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.510
 model bm w either series 1 or 3 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:11.110
 coupe or sedan also of the series 5 and 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.400
 naturally of the 6 even of the x6 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.400
 there is also a version 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:26.500
 and we continue to develop the m3 m5 m6 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:29.380
 and expanding its sporting character that is 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.290
 know they will charge in the future a greater 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.680
 importance in all countries and will be 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.140
 naturally increasingly demanded by 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.120
 people who say I want that category of 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.730
 vehicle but with one more character 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.790
 sporty yet and we introduce you 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:51.310
 the offer a difficult balancing act 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.830
 40 years ago in 1972 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.130
 nobody could claim with absolute 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.670
 security that something like that could work 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:04.030
 but in sight it works good 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.060
 auguries then for the next 40 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.060
 years
