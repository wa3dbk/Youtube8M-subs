00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.180 
that's going to be closest to whatever
your<00:02:06.869> light<00:02:07.079> source<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.770> gonna<00:02:07.890> say<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
your light source is I'm gonna say the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.540 
your light source is I'm gonna say the
fun<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.640> then<00:02:09.479> down<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.989> here<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.770> where<00:02:11.459> it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
fun and then down in here is where it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.730 
fun and then down in here is where it
would<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.230> darkest

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
would be the darkest

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.400 
would be the darkest
so<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.310> go<00:02:14.790> ahead<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.770> lay<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.480> right

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
so I go ahead and lay that in so right

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.920 
so I go ahead and lay that in so right
here<00:02:19.740> where<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.340> fabric<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.910> gathering<00:02:21.300> it

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
here where the fabric is gathering it

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:31.670 
here where the fabric is gathering it
would<00:02:22.050> be<00:02:22.170> dark<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:28.010> then<00:02:29.210> right<00:02:30.210> around<00:02:30.680> the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
would be dark and then right around the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.490 
would be dark and then right around the
arm<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.720> then<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:34.170> these<00:02:34.500> little<00:02:36.500> valleys

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
arm and then in these little valleys

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.230 
arm and then in these little valleys
just<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:39.630> popping<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.320> I'm<00:02:41.120> just<00:02:42.120> gonna

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
just I was popping it in I'm just gonna

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.760 
just I was popping it in I'm just gonna
put<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.630> other<00:02:42.810> color<00:02:43.050> I'm<00:02:43.260> gonna<00:02:43.350> butt<00:02:43.650> it

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
we go and I'm actually gonna color a

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.120 
we go and I'm actually gonna color a
little<00:03:32.220> oh<00:03:33.500> there<00:03:34.500> we<00:03:34.590> go<00:03:34.710> a<00:03:36.740> little<00:03:37.740> spot

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
little oh there we go a little spot

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.740 
little oh there we go a little spot
right<00:03:38.310> on<00:03:38.460> my<00:03:38.640> glass<00:03:38.880> board<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.450> actually

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
right on my glass board this is actually

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.610 
right on my glass board this is actually
a<00:03:39.780> glass<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.470> glass<00:03:41.370> mat<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.720> I<00:03:42.750> use<00:03:43.230> quite<00:03:43.590> a

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
a glass a glass mat that I use quite a

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.960 
a glass a glass mat that I use quite a
bit<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:44.010> color<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:45.950> for<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.070> this<00:03:47.310> reason<00:03:47.790> is

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
bit to color on for that this reason is

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.210 
bit to color on for that this reason is
because<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.390> cleans<00:03:48.600> off<00:03:48.780> really<00:03:49.110> easy<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.650> I

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
because it cleans off really easy and I

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.730 
because it cleans off really easy and I
can<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.880> can<00:03:51.570> put<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.810> whole<00:03:52.200> bunch<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.500> colors

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
can I can put a whole bunch of colors

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.940 
can I can put a whole bunch of colors
all<00:03:53.190> over<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:54.000> if<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.570> look<00:03:55.020> here<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.830> don't

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
all over and if you look here I don't

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.980 
all over and if you look here I don't
know<00:03:56.100> if<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.280> can<00:03:56.460> do<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:56.760> we<00:03:57.150> zoom<00:03:57.690> out<00:03:57.780> some

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
know if I can do this we zoom out some

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.650 
know if I can do this we zoom out some
more<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.830> can<00:03:58.980> see<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.250> did<00:03:59.520> red<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.560> purple<00:04:02.660> so

it's completely dry once you do the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.810 
it's completely dry once you do the
palate<00:04:13.380> blending<00:04:13.770> usually<00:04:14.400> gonna<00:04:14.490> take<00:04:14.670> your

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
palate blending usually gonna take your
