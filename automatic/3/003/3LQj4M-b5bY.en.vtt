00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 it is the beautiful energy guideline of this 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.440
 new video here on my channel we are from 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.510
 new on splat an i obviously story 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.210
 to star in the video right after what 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.190
 you saw earlier because the demo 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.139
 unfortunately it lasts only an hour and 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.859
 so I don't have much time to do the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.390
 all this 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.460
 last time we tried the shoot 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.380
 color recruit that would be this here e 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.420
 the splash this time we'll do two 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.189
 start one with the splatter in charge that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.550
 will go use now is the next one with 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.070
 the roller splat then the gentlemen circle 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.680
 that gentlemen color as much as you can 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.050
 I think who is also the other match the first 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.210
 in total we did so it was then 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.309
 we are pink this time an ok is right 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.120
 to charge this type a mega sniper a 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.239
 charge I will call myself what the fuck it pulls and so 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.879
 well, wait until ok, however, more shots and more 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.829
 obviously the body goes to the distant this 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.440
 like I wanted to take an enemy from which 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.340
 kind of like I don't see anyone then 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.260
 anything 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.730
 oh well don't do anything I also discovered 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.140
 how to use special power 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.720
 gentlemen, remember with the bubble 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.180
 we saw a glimpse ok video yes 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.729
 use with r when the high indicator 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.640
 to the right is filled with gentlemen I was going to 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.860
 take the guy but no good one 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.490
 or here we went down each other great 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.439
 what a show 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.610
 then I would use the super jump as 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.740
 Man I do so no I don't know if I 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.360
 I didn't understand it I read the guide for 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.549
 just use the super assault as you do 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.320
 ago will log in but I did not understand every ok 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.689
 the same is fine 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 unfortunately the sniper does not help much 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:50.189
 regarding double double 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.470
 really baby baby double come here come 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.939
 here I am me I am a little camper have 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.909
 indeed gentlemen said he had the 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.210
 rates however there is because a sniper but 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.149
 I can let you fuck off ok ok 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.390
 go so sniper best weapon is a disp la 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.670
 dune comes a little here come a little where 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.159
 fuck you are not seen a couple 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.659
 interesting to you 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:17.049
 type that no left him totally 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:19.500
 or this with the damn roll after the roller 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.370
 we try to ask both fortissimo ok 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.720
 within a second we try again 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.650
 do the teleportation 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.349
 here is the uncle that show gentlemen 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.420
 oh god what a beautiful gentlemen show 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.450
 ok i shoot in that direction so from 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.500
 put a little charge all in all 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.049
 under the teeth 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.340
 let's throw a grenade if they fit 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.750
 massacring with regard to the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.180
 conquer the field but I am 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.370
 having fun with that rims is fine 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.310
 so fuck you damn my damn 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.129
 Hence the fact that the shadow deploy 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.629
 helps with the assistant's guide 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.349
 guide that is fundamental on the games 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.810
 consul 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.920
 slutty bitch it's very hard there 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.349
 I assure you it's really hard 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.489
 the aiming assistant gives it to you I said 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.290
 I will be a driving assistant too 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.540
 before it goes well it does nothing 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.530
 absent from the aim it only gives you if 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:21.209
 use the movement system the sixaxis 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:24.519
 the gyroscope of the men then me though 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.440
 so this is a little difficult with ok 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.200
 come on you put yourself in front and work 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:34.000
 broke the damn thing to you but already 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.680
 10 9 8 7 ok enough i throw a 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.660
 sniper the sniper anyway 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.690
 quite short distance is not 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.190
 very long is not very long I know that 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:48.389
 this time we were a bit slaughtered was 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:51.400

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.349

 splatter and okay let's go back to the 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.000

 re pressing could be gentlemen 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:44.220
 this I must have a little study 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.140
 apple tree because I honestly don't know 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.120
 I do n't think I do more than two or three 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.660
 video on the shift because there really isn't 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.460

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.080
