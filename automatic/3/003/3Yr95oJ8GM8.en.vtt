00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.060

 very mobile and with 0.87 kilograms 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.270

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.490
 the lightest notebooks in the world 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.720
 is really very good on very thin 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.610
 processed as I think 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.890
 Feels great to have a look 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.530

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.649

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.449
 ports and an audio ports and on the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.210
 left side then the impetus for the 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.620
 power supply also here in front one more 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.780

 she has everything you need for traveling 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.739
 Of course , suffers here because of suffering 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.289
 the thick no ethernet port but just 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.559
 Of course , wlan bgn and bluetooth 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.449

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.610

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.320
 the keyboard is lit like you 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.729
 can be seen wonderful 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.409
 Write the rest of the notebook on it 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.340
 really interesting here we have 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.920
 Here is an 11.6 inch touch screen display 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.270
 on the course windows 8 is running 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.470
 and the display has a resolution of 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.850
 1920 x 1080 pixels that is full hd 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.759
 we have the intel hd graphics here 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.710
 inside and more technical data 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.789
 are here so we have an intel 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.670
 core i7 and a 160 gigabyte ssd 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.310
 always hdd but I think rather 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.159
 that is an ssd and 4 gb 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.750
 Memory in this device like 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.130

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.959
 market there 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.239
 I like it very much and I believe in it 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.009
 I could imagine something like that 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.380
 on the way, airplane in front of the train 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.780
 working has enough power is easy 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.510

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.780
