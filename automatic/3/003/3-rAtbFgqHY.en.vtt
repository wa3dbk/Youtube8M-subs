00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
it's a very simple Criss crossing design

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.250 
it's a very simple Criss crossing design
I<00:00:21.720> thought<00:00:21.930> I'd<00:00:22.050> try<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.320> get<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> video<00:00:23.630> and<00:00:24.630> I'm

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
I thought I'd try to get a video and I'm

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.900 
I thought I'd try to get a video and I'm
using<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> camera<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> little<00:00:26.400> different

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
using the camera a little different

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.939 
using the camera a little different
angle<00:00:27.240> than<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.480> usually<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.650> can

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
angle than I usually do so that I can

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.609 
angle than I usually do so that I can
actually<00:00:29.130> see<00:00:29.670> what<00:00:29.699> I'm<00:00:29.939> doing

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
actually see what I'm doing

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.330 
actually see what I'm doing
while<00:00:31.619> shooting<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.250> video<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.980> lot<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.130> times

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
while shooting this video a lot of times

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.729

I<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.640> give<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.880> guys<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> great<00:00:36.719> shot<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.620> I

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
I can give you guys a great shot but I

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.430 
I can give you guys a great shot but I
can't<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.250> see<00:00:38.610> what<00:00:38.700> I'm<00:00:38.820> doing<00:00:39.440> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
can't actually see what I'm doing and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.979 
can't actually see what I'm doing and
since<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.370> actually<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> customer<00:00:42.690> quilt

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
since this is actually a customer quilt

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.220 
since this is actually a customer quilt
I<00:00:43.399> just<00:00:44.399> couldn't<00:00:44.789> risk<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:47.660> now<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.930> have

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
I just couldn't risk it now I do have

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.369 
I just couldn't risk it now I do have
this<00:00:49.530> border<00:00:51.379> divided<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:54.059> roughly<00:00:54.840> three

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
this border divided and roughly three

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.670 
this border divided and roughly three
inch<00:00:55.760> segments<00:00:56.989> there's<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.079> little<00:00:58.320> variation

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
inch segments there's a little variation

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.750 
inch segments there's a little variation
just<00:00:59.309> because<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.079> width<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:01.760> marking

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
just because of the width of my marking

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.120 
just because of the width of my marking
tool<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:04.199> also<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:06.770> accuracy<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> these

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
tool and also the accuracy of these

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.990 
tool and also the accuracy of these
borders<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.970> sashings

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.380 

they're<00:01:14.000> zigzagging<00:01:14.659> down<00:01:15.580> one<00:01:16.580> side<00:01:16.940> to<00:01:17.270> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.380 
they're zigzagging down one side to the
other<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:19.310> I'm<00:01:19.490> changing<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.420> side<00:01:20.690> of<00:01:20.930> my
