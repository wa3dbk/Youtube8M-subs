00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.590
 which I understand Vladimir 

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.180
 Tarasenko could and just drag 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.440
 the author of our last fifth puck 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:13.009
 today's Vladimir Tarasenko immediately 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.750
 after the match grind with a victory and with the first 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.430
 abandoned puck in the tournament probably 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.390
 psychologically she is very very important for 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.340
 any attacker 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.350
 Yes, I think she has no for four years 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.170
 the last is the last heading 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.500
 Slovaks will start the world was a match for the third 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.349
 place remind yah here but of course 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.690
 well what happened to do it and on 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.200
 relieve the situation a little but i think 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.380
 that all the other tasks are not easy 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.340
 one goal at seasonal it before 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.620
 preliminary stage therefore 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.740
 I have questions about the game I think they have 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.930
 we and the interrogation disassemble it probably 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.580
 playing more collected seems important to me 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.380
 now today was the result important 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.020
 win you can forget this game because 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.860
 which is all the most important to come, but I think 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.720
 that this 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.300
 seems like a saying chicks by 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.210
 Autumn is considered therefore no one will remember 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.730
 how did you start you can win 15 0 1 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.600
 This 3 game then play with 01 and all 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.360
 forgot therefore there is time now to 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.160
 concentrate to make out your mistakes and 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.140
 come up full readiness next 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.330
 games before the match is healthy 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.610
 shaken up threes attacks that 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.770
 You picked up here are new combinations like yourself 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.280
 felt during the match it was in this in 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.770
 this link 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.770
 I think they raised up somehow not very 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.860
 sounds just swapped and i think 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:38.120
 which is not a question for me is a collection on the subject and 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:39.260
 home archicad and again by combination i 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.409
 I think it's just not a question for me and 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.320
 every player we have who came from the mountain 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.860
 ready to play with any player and tournament in 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.780
 transient principle 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.220
 no time to play all 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 partners just you want to win against 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.760
 we have two days off now in the tournament 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.290
 to the national team will not play because 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.070
 there is time to prepare for May 9 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.730
 thoroughly of course it's unforgivable 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.280
 spent that day and secondly more 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.410
 such errors and tune our 1 cherry 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.390
 veterans and our fans I'm talking about 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.800
 weekend plan acclimatization how are you 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.810
 because you feel the thirty-fifth day 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.670
 the most difficult say yes to 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.000
 turnover was not good therefore for the time 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.200
 sleep off and the schedule allows therefore 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.320
 let's say it's better and better in the afternoon thanks 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.130
 to you for the interview with the victory and believe you 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.130
 Vladimir Tarasenko was
