 not conducive to overtaking the place 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.340
 on the grid is therefore essential for 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.340
 that must be done down the times and 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.580
 watch each driver has a good style

 a storm breaks out on the jarrat circuit 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.660
 my is panic 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.940
 the race is interrupted should we go up 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.100
 rain tires stay in smic or put 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.150

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.770
 waltz tires 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.510
 note that since the beginning of the season

 Michelin and its new radial tires 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.220
 unanimously second round of 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.640

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.640
 look 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.600
 the wind to dry the track but on the 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.340
 starting grid an advertising tape 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.820
 laminated yet wet play a 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.040
 bad turn to franco china and 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.140
 even the mechanics are busy 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.140
 abandoning the tools for the rag 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.760
 16:02 the departure can finally be given 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.230
 lawson achieved the best time of the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.320
 tests but nothing is played 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.410
 Freddie Spencer is right behind 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.410
 ambush 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.239
 with which friends dawson had imposed 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.450
 but as we said fast freddy for 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.610
 1985 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.459
 I'm aiming for the double, that is, the title 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.799
 in 500 but also in 250 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.230
 right from the start the english ron haslam who 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.519
 he has a honda 3 cylinder more 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.099
 reliable on this type of circuit 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.329
 spencer a regatta looks set 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.609
 but quickly 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.000
 English will be joined went through 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.000
 spencer 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.780
 and haslam drama will perform a 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.420
 straight ahead 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.640
 he will leave to finish 8th but ahead 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.650
 spencer fled decidedly very much to 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.060
 comfortable look at the style it's 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.310
 efficiency at the highest level 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.290
 eddie lawson and second christian sarron 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.550
 after a fantastic 3rd and 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.680
 raymond roesch marks its first 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.050
 points of the 5th year while behind 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.690
 a competitor falls without gravity 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.970
 barely time to drink a cup of 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.120
 champagne and freddie spencer hold of the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.870
 500 to the 250 is watched with what 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.150
 mastery 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.740
 author of the best time of the tests he 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.370
 should not leave any chance to his 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.980
 opponents 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.739
 in the lead in the first corner despite 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.880
 carlos lavado here on the screen which 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.320
 explained who wanted to hear it 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.690
 that the American was not 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.610
 the scarecrow at this moment to tan 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.260
 luck seemed well compromised 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.810
 the new honda had two remaining 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.660
 unbeatable spencer the man of the 500 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.310
 having become that of the 250 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.230
 the event that could upset the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.040
 situation it was the fall or the breakage 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.930
 the fall 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.840
 impossible clement spencer and are at 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.580
 comfortable then it was mechanical boredom at 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.680
 exhaust puncture the american 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.300
 will leave filer carlos lavado with 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.880
