00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
together in the same angle so your crown

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.160 
together in the same angle so your crown
looks<00:02:43.550> four<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:43.970> thick<00:02:44.180> you'll<00:02:44.810> find<00:02:45.050> that

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
looks four and thick you'll find that

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.020 
looks four and thick you'll find that
between<00:02:45.470> flowers<00:02:45.860> sometimes<00:02:46.280> you'll<00:02:46.760> need<00:02:46.790> to

between flowers sometimes you'll need to

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.699 
between flowers sometimes you'll need to
continue<00:02:47.510> wrapping<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.990> base<00:02:48.170> without<00:02:48.380> any

you<00:02:53.840> also<00:02:53.990> want<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.410> make<00:02:54.560> sure<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.040> wrap

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
you also want to make sure that you wrap

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.190 
you also want to make sure that you wrap

close together in the same angle so your
