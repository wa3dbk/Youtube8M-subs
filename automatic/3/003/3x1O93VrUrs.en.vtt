00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
Today's Coffee machine cooked.. I think it's starter? Anyway, it's a rich avocado soup. 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.640
It's hot and spicy, well-seasoned..!     

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.220
Although, I would say this is one of the better recipes of mine.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.760
Coffee Machine Cuisine cooks avocado soup.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.100
Okey, here's everything I think I need.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.200
Firstly, we'll cook some eggs because it take a lot of time.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.960
It doesn't matter if it gets cold or something while I'm cooking the soup.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.920
The important thing is that the soup is hot.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.920
I'll put these directly in the jug.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.720
When this goes through the machine, it gets hot.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.320
Turn it on.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:59.080
It's suppose to be hardboiled which means it has to stay in there for about 45-60 minutes.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.000
 Meanwhile we can prepare some other things. 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.660
I'll take two avocados and cut them on the half and just dig out.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.260
And this is suppose to going into the jug as soon as the the eggs will be ready.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600
Now there's not much left to prepare..

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.720
Gucci!

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.680
Gucci?

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.520
While we're waiting for the eggs there's a good opportunity for playing with the cats.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.720
Although, now I think it's time to check on the eggs.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.000
I think it'll be enough with one egg. This should be hardboiled by now.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.280
Let's see..

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.800
Yes..and this took almost one hour. 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.720
It's time for the avocado soup. 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.780
Two avocados in here.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.320
Squeeze the juice out of half a lemon.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.740
Then I'll add some cream.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.560
Green curry paste.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.000
The soup seems fairly smooth.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.200
Then I'll take a filter and put it in the funnel.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.000
A stock cube in here and place it in the coffee machine. 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.600
Like that!

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.460
I don't know how much time it takes but take a look at it in 30 minutes. 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.580
Stir and add salt and pepper if its needed, perhaps you want some more lemon or more from this thing.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.680
One hour has passed and the soup is hot and nice.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.060
Remove it from the hob and let it rest.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.680
I'll toast this bread.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.360
This machine is.. what is it called..? Multi functional. 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.840
You're able to cook, steak, toast, steam - all sort of things!

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.580
Then I'll put them straight on the hob like this.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.620
This pottery is so nice, my mother bought it for me in Spain.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.800
I'll pour it down in the cup. I wonder how to decorate this?

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.020
The egg goes here and a handful of shrimps.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.900
Something like this?

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.500
And a slice of lemon.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.020
Finally, basil on the top.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.280
If the decoration is too much maybe you'll forget about the taste!

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.500
Something like this.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.180
And some butter too, huh?

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.720
Then we're done!

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.140
Here we have a coffee machine made avocado soup.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.360
Together with a coffee machine cooked egg. 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.740
Also, a coffee machine toasted bread.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.140
Everything made by one coffee machine.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.060
It took about two hours.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.280
You can't use this! 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.140
It was awful! All cold!

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.840
Actually, the taste is all right but it's so disgusting when 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.280
it's only slightly heated and all messy!
