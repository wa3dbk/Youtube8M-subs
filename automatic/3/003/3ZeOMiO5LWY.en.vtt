dr.<00:01:44.189> Finklestein<00:01:44.700> I'm<00:01:45.509> sure<00:01:45.750> they<00:01:45.960> would<00:01:46.140> have

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
dr. Finklestein I'm sure they would have

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.990 
dr. Finklestein I'm sure they would have
some<00:01:46.530> other<00:01:46.740> accessories<00:01:47.070> out<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.609> it<00:01:47.759> maybe

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
some other accessories out of it maybe

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.929 
some other accessories out of it maybe
like<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.719> frogs<00:01:49.020> breath<00:01:49.320> kin<00:01:49.710> or<00:01:50.070> worms<00:01:50.549> war

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
like the frogs breath kin or worms war

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.450 
like the frogs breath kin or worms war
since<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:51.420> already<00:01:51.570> use<00:01:51.840> deadly<00:01:52.109> nightshade

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
since they already use deadly nightshade

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.620 
since they already use deadly nightshade
even<00:01:53.460> though<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> figure<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.210> scrapped

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
surprisingly June planning made their

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.669 
surprisingly June planning made their
version<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> concept<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.259> always

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
version of the concept and I always

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.289 
version of the concept and I always
wondered<00:01:59.009> if<00:01:59.130> they<00:01:59.250> knew<00:01:59.460> they<00:01:59.700> were<00:01:59.759> actually

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
wondered if they knew they were actually

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.319 
wondered if they knew they were actually

Merritt<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:49.120> one<00:03:49.299> weird<00:03:49.600> thing<00:03:49.870> about<00:03:49.900> the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
Merritt the one weird thing about the

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.810 
Merritt the one weird thing about the
ride<00:03:50.410> is<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:51.010> was<00:03:51.130> going<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.400> be<00:03:51.549> placed

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
ride is that it was going to be placed

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.420

next<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.360> it's<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.840> small<00:03:53.140> world<00:03:53.470> ride<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.130> that

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
next to it's a small world ride and that

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.340 
next to it's a small world ride and that
seems<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.760> bit<00:03:54.790> like<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.030> bad<00:03:55.269> idea<00:03:55.480> because<00:03:56.140> on

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
seems a bit like a bad idea because on

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.960 
seems a bit like a bad idea because on
one<00:03:56.560> side<00:03:56.620> we<00:03:57.010> have<00:03:57.040> this<00:03:57.400> cute<00:03:57.790> and
