00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.259
 hello welcome to the channel today I love you 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.530
 teach how to make a delicious hamburger 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.340
 and potatoes for our children I'm going to 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.950
 use a red square of 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.350
 a sheet of paper this measures 4 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.110
 centimeters in three clearings and I'm going to 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.110
 fold in half but diagonally 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.270
 this shape can take a corner 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.330
 towards the other extreme 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.750
 in this way and the same thing I will do with 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.750
 the other 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.000
 I'm going to apply a little glue so that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.000
 do not notice salt 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.510
 in that way 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.309
 then the o 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.850
 I'm also going to double in the part of 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:59.300
 up and applying few glues of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.300
 this way and I turn around and hit so 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.780
 and that's our bag for potatoes 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.390
 I'm going to cut strips of about two 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.430
 minutes for a half centimeter of 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.320
 high 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.320
 you do more slowly 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.680
 and that's the way it would be our fields 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.000
 I the series with silicone because I did not want 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.000
 that came out 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.980
 I'm going to cut the English 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.160
 the role of china has given one more myth 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.400
 large that we produce and cut in 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.940
 true the extent of our in Boston and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.090
 half an inch more around buoy 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.320
 also take the measure of our vote 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.840
 in the same tone of the felt and also 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.840
 in brown color that is going to be meat 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.670
 and in the yellow I will draw a 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.320
 square to simulate the one that I'm going to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.320
 remember each one of these 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.190
 and now I'm going to how to put putting of 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.740
 this form 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.320
 previously pass a stitching around 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.840
 of my circle and I'm going to pull it to 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.740
 reduce the size if you like too 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.740
 they can paste 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.840
 Now I'm taking off each one of 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.580
 our pieces so I'm going to start with 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.000
 the meat then with my sadness 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.860
 with the lettuce and finally the lid 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.220
 in families 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.020
 and that's how we have more putin in 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.870
