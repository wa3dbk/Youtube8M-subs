00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.519
 exciting game 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.699
 make the child do what he 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.280
 uninteresting extremely difficult but if 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.260
 will be able to interest him then and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.679
 cleaning will go by itself 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.170
 because it is not cleaning morsy and building 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:04.350
 mother and baby cranes for 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.690
 Carrying dice box or trucks 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 for transportation of parts designer in 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.210
 cart

 or you and your baby are two beautiful fairies 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.460
 that help Cinderella put on 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.220
 place books and dolls so she has time for 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.660
 Ball idea 2 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.210
 where to store toys even if the child 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.510
 will be very passionate about the cleaning game 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.640
 he is unlikely to want long and carefully 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.130
 lay the toys on the shelves for this 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.190
 ghost children's room in order 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.070
 simplify the presence of a dresser basket or 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.210
 toy containers 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.730
 the latter can easily be done 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.910
 alone with the child from 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.850
 any cardboard box is mainly bright 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.510
 box decoration can be pasted 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.790
 colored or gift paper and 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.430
 sign or stick a bright picture 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.710
 so that the baby knew that this is a box for 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.659
 constructors this is for pencils and 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.479
 markers and so on idea 3 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.420
 put things in order together do not leave 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.670
 child alone with a mess after all 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.040
 he really doesn't know where to start 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.319
 so it can decide what you put 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.470
 in front of him too difficult task for 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.060
 which is not worth playing you can 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.180
 a few minutes to clean up 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.190
 alone then under some pretext 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.060
 attract and child do not skimp on 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.450
 praise 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.630
 phrase as you thought up to put 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.760
 here this doll acts better than 10 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:45.239
 repeating the phrase go and add 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:48.300
 toys idea 4 song about cleaning not to 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.790
 get bored while cleaning go singing 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.489
 or tell poems about cleanliness and 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.640
 order in the room they can write 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.800
 yourself or take from children's books if 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.440
 Nothing comes to mind to include 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.190
 rhythmic music that is to your liking and 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.519
 to kid 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.650
 his idea is the fifth break the stages of cleaning 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.260
 I usually see an adult phrase 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.450
 clean the room for the baby sounds 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.420
 too abstract therefore 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.829
 specify the task put the books on 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.780
 shelf remove the album and markers in the box 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.299
 for example today we fold cars on 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.790
 the shelf tomorrow we disassemble the basket with 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.239
 logical toys and so on 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.030
 leave for cleaning 10-15 minutes so 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:40.799
 the child will master the process of cleaning things 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.250
 to place the idea of ​​6 where did the beloved 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.900
 toy discreetly hide your favorite 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.900
 a toy of your child 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.870
 when the loss is found sympathize 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.560
 tell him that important things often 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.470
 get lost where there is no order offer 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.910
 clean the room together 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:06.540
 all that is conceived find disappear 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.000
 idea 7 explain to the child the need 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.150
 his participation in 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.940
 if mom will clean this one 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.269
 will take a lot of time and we will not have time with 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.370
 you play if you help me in 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.610
 we will have time to read 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.400
 a fairy tale if the room is clean 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.450
 we will not settle dust microbes and you 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.900
 grow up healthy and strong and now 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.560
 several no idea 8 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.580
 do not seek order in the nursery 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.610
 cry and threats 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.740
 this method can make a child 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.960
 several times bring your stuff in 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.570
 order but does not teach 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.000
 responsibility and accuracy and except 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.190
 moreover, he is able to spoil your 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.370
 child relationships and nerves 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.400
 besides having in the arsenal all those ways 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.950
 about which you already know easily 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:06.230
 turn the cleaning into quite peaceful 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:09.410
 lesson idea 9 do not remove toys 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.380
 instead of a child maybe you have it 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.990
 get better and faster but yours 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.780
 the goal is not to tidy the room at one time 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.060
 I clean the room with the child you 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.210
 prepare it in the future do it 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.820
 doing yourself and instead you 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.400
 soon get a teenager and then 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.640
 adult who can not and do not want 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.419
 nothing to clean up 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.580
 idea 10 do not bargain if you remove 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:41.120
 toys buy you a chocolate bar 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.419
 new typewriter will give yum if practice 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.810
 here is a child to establish themselves in opinion 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:50.480
 that everything in life is worth doing tank for 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.960
 reward and finally 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.540
 there is nothing perfect if the child has removed 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.550
 not as good as you would like 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.460
 redo and praise 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.860
 when the child just learned to walk and 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.950
 made his first independent steps 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.380
 it never occurred to you to criticize 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.500
 him that he goes uncertainly and staggers 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:16.040
 water in cleaning, he also makes his first 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:20.320
 steps and only in your hands do so 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.320
 so that they bring him pleasure
