00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:03.960
 application of the main rules of the road 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.830
 movements 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.029
 road marking 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.019
 who are her characteristics 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.089
 described in detail about the main types 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:11.070
 horizontally 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.789
 they have a special center 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.369
 horizontal markings among them 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.189
 stood on the arctic sea and other designations on 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.099
 roadway 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.460
 is set 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.460
 but certain street mode and traffic order 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.389
 Romanenko can be constantly go time 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.070
 permanent applied by case or yellow 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.140
 by color 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.690
 modern good 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.620
 markup is governed by all 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.280
 traffic rules pharmacies 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.290
 crossroads and buildings 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.290
 parking and furnishing 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.020
 often not visible due to weather 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.010
 conditions 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.200
 in the video on which it is worth hoping for 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.320
 the roads 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.670
 about it and statistics 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.680
 in Europe, the markup is kept at an average of 8 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.580
 in Scandinavia with similar to ours 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.790
 climate 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.040
 well no 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.300
 and in Russia no more than a year 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.490
 markup assignment not only 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.780
 limit driver's actions but 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.240
 and help him 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.869
 for example when driving in the dark 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.880
 understandable to another part of the road 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 the driver can navigate by 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.340
 color and white line 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.760
 separating streams 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.670
 opposite direction 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.660
 this line is like an ariadna thread 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.120
 Russian drivers are coming by night 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.120
 the expanses of the country 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.260
 but the main thing that the driver should know 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.270
 markup 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.140
 you can never cross a solid 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.080
 line dividing the flow 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.130
 opposite directions 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.960
 you can lose not only the rights of the new 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.860
 a life 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.860
 departure to the oncoming cabul 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.410
 can not cross the solid line 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.540
 initially decided more 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.600
 this can lead not only to a fine but also 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.250
 more severe consequences by the nose 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.100
 or turning the car due 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.470
 difference coefficient 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.499
 clutch road I'm more 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.729
 markup helps drivers 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.269
 rebuild 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.969
 written in the rules 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.299
 that replacing an old man with a broken line 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.409
 increases as you approach 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.559
 the most dangerous sections of the road 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.559
 crossroad or crosswalk 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.969
 that is why it is better to rebuild 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.789
 dotted lines 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.069
 road marking need 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.129
 allows drivers 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.219
 reduce the risk of occurrence 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.620
 emergency situations
