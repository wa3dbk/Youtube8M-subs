00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
wet when you put the crystals on and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.950 
then I'm just going to place them on the
nail<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.280> I'm<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.970> them<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.510> always

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
nail so I'm going to do them I always

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.719 
nail so I'm going to do them I always
start<00:01:10.260> from<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> bottom<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.189> up<00:01:11.430> in

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
start from the bottom and I go up in

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.450 
start from the bottom and I go up in
vertical<00:01:12.360> lines<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.189> them<00:01:14.340> as

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
vertical lines and I like to do them as

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.820 
vertical lines and I like to do them as
close<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.939> each<00:01:15.060> other<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.420> possible<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
close to each other as possible just you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.710 
close to each other as possible just you
can<00:01:16.979> fit<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.220> many<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.670> possible<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.360> so

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
can fit as many on as possible and so

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.320 
can fit as many on as possible and so
that<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> looks<00:01:19.170> really<00:01:19.650> sparkly<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.180> can

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that it looks really sparkly but you can

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.789 
that it looks really sparkly but you can
kind<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.840> how<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.650> I've

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
kind of do it how you like I know I've

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.700 
kind of do it how you like I know I've
seen<00:01:23.450> some<00:01:24.450> people<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.170> they<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
seen some people do it and they have the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.340 
seen some people do it and they have the
crystals<00:01:26.310> quite<00:01:26.549> spaced<00:01:26.939> out<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:28.110> kind<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
crystals quite spaced out and it kind of

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.010 
crystals quite spaced out and it kind of
depends<00:01:28.740> how<00:01:29.340> many<00:01:29.400> crystals<00:01:29.939> you've<00:01:30.210> got<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
depends how many crystals you've got and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.260 
depends how many crystals you've got and
what<00:01:31.470> sort<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> look<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.790> always

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
what sort of look you like I always

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.210 
what sort of look you like I always
think<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.600> looks<00:01:33.750> nice<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.470> match<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
think it looks nice if you match the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.760 
think it looks nice if you match the
background<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> crystals<00:01:36.600> you've<00:01:36.720> got<00:01:36.960> so

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
background to the crystals you've got so

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.590 
background to the crystals you've got so
if<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.490> wanted<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> different<00:01:39.210> color

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
if you wanted to do a different color

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.429 
if you wanted to do a different color
type<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> manicure<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.009> could<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.229> like<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
type of manicure you could do and like a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.590 
type of manicure you could do and like a
pink<00:01:43.799> background<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.640> put<00:01:44.759> pink<00:01:44.970> crystals<00:01:45.420> on

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
pink background and put pink crystals on

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
pink background and put pink crystals on
or<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.930> purple<00:01:46.350> background<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> pub

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
or a purple background of the pub

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.120 
or a purple background of the pub
crystals<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.320> know<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.740> these

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
crystals on and and I know that these

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.760 
crystals on and and I know that these
crystals<00:01:50.759> were<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.180> kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> cheap<00:01:51.960> from<00:01:52.380> I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
crystals were just kind of cheap from I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.030 
crystals were just kind of cheap from I
think<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:53.759> amazon<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.619> just<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> pack

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
think it was amazon and just for a pack

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.069 
think it was amazon and just for a pack
I<00:01:56.430> think<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:56.969> probably<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.570> don't<00:01:57.840> know<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
I think it's probably I don't know a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.010 
I think it's probably I don't know a
couple<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.500> pound<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> few<00:01:59.159> hundred<00:02:00.020> but

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
couple of pound for a few hundred but

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.380 
couple of pound for a few hundred but
you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.409> buy<00:02:01.799> kind<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.340> Swarovski<00:02:02.909> crystals

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you can buy kind of Swarovski crystals

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.330 
you can buy kind of Swarovski crystals
if<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.170> wanted<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> spend<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.860> little<00:02:04.950> bit<00:02:05.130> more

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
if you wanted to spend a little bit more

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.459 
if you wanted to spend a little bit more
and<00:02:05.579> have<00:02:05.909> them<00:02:06.060> ultra<00:02:06.509> sparkly<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.259> think

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
and have them ultra sparkly but I think

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.590 
and have them ultra sparkly but I think
this<00:02:07.560> gives<00:02:07.740> inner<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.280> nice<00:02:08.640> Sparkle<00:02:09.270> anyway

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
this gives inner a nice Sparkle anyway

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.990 
this gives inner a nice Sparkle anyway
so<00:02:11.530> as<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.680> can<00:02:11.950> see<00:02:12.220> I'm<00:02:12.430> just<00:02:12.640> kind<00:02:12.880> of

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
so as you can see I'm just kind of

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.910 
so as you can see I'm just kind of
putting<00:02:13.600> them<00:02:13.840> as<00:02:13.930> close<00:02:14.320> together<00:02:14.620> as

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
putting them as close together as

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.830 
putting them as close together as
possible<00:02:16.980> I'm<00:02:17.980> going<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.060> carry<00:02:19.270> on<00:02:19.420> going<00:02:19.720> in

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
possible I'm going to carry on going in

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.110 
possible I'm going to carry on going in
lines<00:02:20.080> all<00:02:20.410> over<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.890> nail<00:02:21.070> it's<00:02:21.460> so<00:02:21.760> easy<00:02:21.940> to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
lines all over the nail it's so easy to

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.100 
lines all over the nail it's so easy to
do<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.570> it<00:02:22.720> looks<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.230> effective<00:02:27.990> once<00:02:28.990> you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
do and it looks so effective once you

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.780 
do and it looks so effective once you
put<00:02:29.290> your<00:02:29.500> crystals<00:02:29.890> on<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.130> should<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.520> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
put your crystals on you should have and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.250 
put your crystals on you should have and
look<00:02:30.970> something<00:02:31.420> like<00:02:31.450> this<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:32.050> they<00:02:32.170> all

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
look something like this so they all

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.990 
look something like this so they all
kind<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.560> look<00:02:32.620> quite<00:02:32.950> uniform<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.700> think<00:02:33.880> that

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
kind of look quite uniform I think that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.510 
kind of look quite uniform I think that
looks<00:02:34.090> nice<00:02:34.360> with<00:02:34.570> all<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.840> sparkles<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.620> you

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
looks nice with all the sparkles and you

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.710 
looks nice with all the sparkles and you
can<00:02:36.640> go<00:02:36.760> over<00:02:36.790> with<00:02:37.060> your<00:02:37.120> dotting<00:02:37.360> tool<00:02:37.630> and

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
can go over with your dotting tool and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.480 
can go over with your dotting tool and
kind<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:37.990> press<00:02:38.200> down<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.620> make<00:02:38.710> sure<00:02:38.740> that

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
kind of press down and make sure that

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.310 
kind of press down and make sure that
they're<00:02:39.670> really<00:02:39.910> secured<00:02:40.420> into<00:02:40.720> place<00:02:40.750> or<00:02:41.230> you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
they're really secured into place or you

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.290 
they're really secured into place or you
can<00:02:41.470> use<00:02:41.500> your<00:02:41.740> finger<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:43.090> make<00:02:43.270> sure

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
can use your finger just to make sure

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.640 
can use your finger just to make sure
that<00:02:43.660> they're<00:02:43.810> stuck<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.290> they're<00:02:44.380> not<00:02:44.500> going

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
that they're stuck and they're not going

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.310 
that they're stuck and they're not going
to<00:02:44.710> fall<00:02:44.950> off<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.630> can<00:02:46.750> go<00:02:46.930> over<00:02:46.960> with

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
to fall off then you can go over with

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.870 
to fall off then you can go over with
top<00:02:47.530> coat<00:02:47.710> if<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.980> want<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.310> know<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.520> some<00:02:48.850> of

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
top coat if you want I know that some of

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.820 
top coat if you want I know that some of
the<00:02:49.000> cheaper<00:02:49.240> crystals<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:49.990> get<00:02:50.200> do

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
the cheaper crystals that you can get do

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.370 
the cheaper crystals that you can get do
and<00:02:51.280> their<00:02:51.880> Sparkle<00:02:52.450> disappears<00:02:52.960> a<00:02:52.990> bit<00:02:53.200> with

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
and their Sparkle disappears a bit with

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.830 
and their Sparkle disappears a bit with
the<00:02:53.500> top<00:02:53.680> coat<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.640> maybe<00:02:55.000> if<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.210> just<00:02:55.390> want

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
the top coat so maybe if you just want

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.570 
the top coat so maybe if you just want
it<00:02:56.050> kind<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.620> night<00:02:56.800> out<00:02:57.010> or<00:02:57.160> something<00:02:57.490> like

it kind of a night out or something like

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.460 
it kind of a night out or something like
that<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:58.330> might<00:02:58.480> be<00:02:58.510> best<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.870> leave<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.170> off

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
that it might be best to leave it off

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.680 
that it might be best to leave it off
and<00:02:59.770> just<00:03:00.760> be<00:03:00.910> aware<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.330> won't<00:03:01.480> last

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
and just be aware that it won't last

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.290 
and just be aware that it won't last
quite<00:03:02.110> as<00:03:02.260> long<00:03:02.310> but<00:03:03.310> yeah<00:03:03.520> there<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.060> have

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
quite as long but yeah there you have

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.550 
quite as long but yeah there you have
your<00:03:04.330> finished<00:03:04.600> product<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:05.200> think<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.470> will

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
your finished product I think it will

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.920 
your finished product I think it will
look<00:03:05.650> great<00:03:05.890> as<00:03:06.280> Eva<00:03:06.610> just<00:03:07.240> like<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> ring<00:03:07.690> thing

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.510 
look great as Eva just like a ring thing
a<00:03:08.020> manicure<00:03:08.440> or<00:03:08.500> something<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.100> if<00:03:09.400> you

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
a manicure or something like that if you

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
didn't want it so kind of full on and I

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.830 
didn't want it so kind of full on and I
think<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.400> would<00:03:12.490> look<00:03:12.550> gorgeous<00:03:12.790> on<00:03:13.150> toes<00:03:13.420> too

think it would look gorgeous on toes too

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.540 
think it would look gorgeous on toes too
so<00:03:14.380> yeah<00:03:14.530> give<00:03:14.770> it<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:15.010> go<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.310> let<00:03:15.430> me<00:03:15.520> know
