00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
by about less than a dozen companies I

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.219 
by about less than a dozen companies I
think<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> youth<00:01:59.670> today<00:01:59.909> are<00:02:00.210> bombarded<00:02:01.140> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229

that they can understand and this is

think<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.920> speakers<00:03:03.310> probably<00:03:03.820> learned<00:03:04.030> as

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
think the speakers probably learned as

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.690 
think the speakers probably learned as
much<00:03:04.270> not<00:03:04.900> just<00:03:05.110> from<00:03:05.230> each<00:03:05.380> other<00:03:05.650> but<00:03:06.400> from

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
much not just from each other but from

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.070 
much not just from each other but from
the<00:03:07.060> their<00:03:08.020> audience<00:03:08.380> as<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:10.570> ways<00:03:10.810> that<00:03:10.840> they

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
the their audience as in ways that they

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.080 
the their audience as in ways that they
maybe<00:03:11.440> not<00:03:11.680> even<00:03:11.709> expected<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:12.519> to<00:03:12.580> just<00:03:12.820> hear

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
maybe not even expected so to just hear

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.199
