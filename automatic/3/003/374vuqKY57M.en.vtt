Quiller<00:01:21.910> but<00:01:22.870> quilling<00:01:23.440> is<00:01:23.560> when<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.860> roll<00:01:24.010> up

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
Quiller but quilling is when you roll up

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.450 
Quiller but quilling is when you roll up
the<00:01:24.370> little<00:01:24.580> paper<00:01:24.760> and<00:01:25.120> and<00:01:26.110> then<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.220> take

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
the little paper and and then you take

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.240 
the little paper and and then you take
it<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:27.850> fill<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.960> empty<00:01:29.440> space<00:01:29.710> with

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
it and you fill the empty space with

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.220 
it and you fill the empty space with
that<00:01:30.610> rolled<00:01:30.910> up<00:01:31.090> little<00:01:31.390> paper<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.930> it<00:01:32.080> makes

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
that rolled up little paper and it makes

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.190 
that rolled up little paper and it makes
a<00:01:32.350> really<00:01:32.380> beautiful<00:01:33.310> design<00:01:33.430> but<00:01:34.300> this<00:01:34.690> is

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
a really beautiful design but this is

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.820 
a really beautiful design but this is
let's<00:01:36.190> see<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.900> is<00:01:38.170> what<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:40.450> dye<00:01:40.830> will

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
let's see this is what this dye will

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.370 
let's see this is what this dye will
look<00:01:42.100> like<00:01:42.340> once<00:01:42.790> it's<00:01:43.060> cut<00:01:43.330> out<00:01:43.360> I'm<00:01:44.200> not

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
look like once it's cut out I'm not

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.750 
look like once it's cut out I'm not
going<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.590> demonstrate<00:01:44.710> how<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.250> cut<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.520> out

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
going to demonstrate how to cut it out

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.820 
going to demonstrate how to cut it out
because<00:01:46.690> if<00:01:46.810> you're<00:01:46.930> familiar<00:01:47.140> with<00:01:47.410> wafer

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
because if you're familiar with wafer

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.530 
because if you're familiar with wafer
thin<00:01:48.040> dies<00:01:48.070> you'll<00:01:48.640> know<00:01:48.760> how<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.000> do<00:01:49.180> that

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
thin dies you'll know how to do that

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.600 
thin dies you'll know how to do that
but<00:01:49.960> then<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.260> take<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:50.800> empty<00:01:51.040> space<00:01:51.400> and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
but then you take this empty space and

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.690 
but then you take this empty space and
fill<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:51.970> with<00:01:52.120> the<00:01:52.270> little<00:01:52.540> rolled<00:01:52.840> paper<00:01:53.110> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
fill it with the little rolled paper and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.580 
fill it with the little rolled paper and
you'll<00:01:54.700> use<00:01:55.090> your<00:01:55.120> quilling<00:01:55.660> tool<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:56.230> do<00:01:56.410> this

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
you'll use your quilling tool to do this

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.760 
you'll use your quilling tool to do this
so<00:01:57.010> that's<00:01:57.640> what<00:01:57.940> this<00:01:58.120> die<00:01:58.480> looks<00:01:58.840> like<00:01:59.140> you

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
so that's what this die looks like you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.910 
so that's what this die looks like you
can<00:01:59.980> find<00:02:00.220> this<00:02:00.520> die<00:02:00.790> and<00:02:01.260> other<00:02:02.260> dyes<00:02:02.590> from

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
can find this die and other dyes from

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.410 
can find this die and other dyes from
