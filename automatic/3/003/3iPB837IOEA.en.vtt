new playlists when loop recording so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.640 
new playlists when loop recording so
very<00:01:26.010> very<00:01:26.190> important<00:01:26.610> because<00:01:27.120> it<00:01:28.080> allows<00:01:28.380> me

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
very very important because it allows me

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.950 
very very important because it allows me
to<00:01:29.220> see<00:01:29.460> all<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.730> my<00:01:30.000> work<00:01:30.240> afterwards<00:01:30.659> without

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
to see all of my work afterwards without

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.510 
to see all of my work afterwards without
having<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> go<00:01:31.470> search<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.370> lot

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
having to go search for it it's a lot

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.100 
having to go search for it it's a lot
easier<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.940> use<00:01:32.970> than<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.360> used<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.600> way

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
easier to use than it used to be way

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.410 
easier to use than it used to be way
cool<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.190> tune<00:01:35.370> we're<00:01:35.550> using<00:01:35.730> actually<00:01:36.330> is

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
cool so the tune we're using actually is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.990 
cool so the tune we're using actually is
an<00:01:36.510> amalgam<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.290> bunch<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> free<00:01:38.460> loops

now<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.710> do<00:02:03.860> that<00:02:04.070> I'm<00:02:04.280> going<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.580> use<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.000> 11

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
now to do that I'm going to use the 11

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.540 
now to do that I'm going to use the 11
rack<00:02:05.630> because<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.380> course<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.770> is<00:02:06.890> my<00:02:07.070> audio

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
rack because of course that is my audio

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.550 
rack because of course that is my audio
interface<00:02:07.700> for<00:02:08.090> this<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:08.929> if<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.080> pull<00:02:09.259> this<00:02:09.380> up

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
interface for this so if I pull this up

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.010 
interface for this so if I pull this up
you'll<00:02:10.250> see<00:02:10.369> what<00:02:10.700> I've<00:02:10.789> got<00:02:10.940> running<00:02:11.239> in<00:02:11.690> here

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.360 
a compressor on here as well so if I
just<00:02:18.200> record<00:02:18.530> enable<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.830> track<00:02:19.100> which<00:02:19.250> it

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370

afterwards<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.810> I'm<00:02:41.989> going<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.170> literally

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
afterwards so I'm going to literally

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.050 
afterwards so I'm going to literally
stick<00:02:42.830> Pro<00:02:42.980> Tools<00:02:43.160> into<00:02:43.340> record<00:02:43.670> I'm<00:02:43.940> gonna

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
stick Pro Tools into record I'm gonna

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.460 
stick Pro Tools into record I'm gonna
get<00:02:44.180> myself<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.540> little<00:02:44.720> one<00:02:44.840> bar<00:02:45.019> count<00:02:45.290> off

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
get myself a little one bar count off

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.000 
get myself a little one bar count off
and<00:02:46.420> 8<00:02:47.420> bar<00:02:47.660> loop<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.350> I'm<00:02:48.440> going<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.620> play<00:02:48.769> some

funky R&amp;B kind of guitar stuff but I

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.140 
funky R&amp;B kind of guitar stuff but I
want<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.950> try<00:02:52.130> out<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> couple<00:02:52.550> different<00:02:52.819> ideas

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
want to try out a couple different ideas

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.940 
want to try out a couple different ideas
and<00:02:53.390> then<00:02:53.480> sift<00:02:53.750> through<00:02:53.930> them<00:02:54.080> later<00:02:54.350> so

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
and then sift through them later so

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.410 
and then sift through them later so
produce<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.519> going<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.730> allow<00:02:55.850> me<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.060> do<00:02:56.239> that

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
produce is going to allow me to do that

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.600 
produce is going to allow me to do that
so<00:02:56.840> I've<00:02:56.900> got<00:02:57.049> loop<00:02:57.200> record<00:02:57.530> on<00:02:57.650> I've<00:02:58.130> got<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.370> 1

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
so I've got loop record on I've got a 1

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.250 
so I've got loop record on I've got a 1
bar<00:02:58.760> count<00:02:59.060> in<00:02:59.209> I've<00:02:59.510> got<00:02:59.570> my<00:02:59.840> little<00:02:59.959> funky

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
bar count in I've got my little funky

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:32.510 
bar count in I've got my little funky
sound<00:03:02.320> let's<00:03:03.320> do<00:03:03.470> it

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.880 

all<00:03:33.520> right<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.150> easy<00:03:34.540> as<00:03:34.750> pie<00:03:34.930> we<00:03:35.320> have<00:03:35.500> three

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
all right so easy as pie we have three

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.280 
all right so easy as pie we have three
takes<00:03:36.190> there<00:03:36.460> along<00:03:37.420> with<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.780> previous<00:03:37.930> take

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
takes there along with the previous take

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.630 
takes there along with the previous take
that<00:03:38.440> existed<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.070> can<00:03:39.190> see<00:03:39.310> it's<00:03:39.430> twice

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
that existed and you can see it's twice

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.930 
that existed and you can see it's twice
as<00:03:39.820> long<00:03:39.990> so<00:03:40.990> there<00:03:41.770> has<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:41.980> be<00:03:42.160> a<00:03:42.250> way<00:03:42.460> to<00:03:42.490> sift

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
as long so there has to be a way to sift

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.250 
as long so there has to be a way to sift
through<00:03:43.030> these<00:03:43.330> takes<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.900> hear<00:03:44.140> those

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
through these takes and hear those

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.020 
through these takes and hear those
different<00:03:44.620> elements<00:03:44.980> easily<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.550> we<00:03:45.820> added

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
different elements easily and we added

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.790 
different elements easily and we added
some<00:03:46.330> new<00:03:46.450> features<00:03:46.480> in<00:03:46.840> proto<00:03:47.110> Zeta<00:03:47.320> as<00:03:47.470> well

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
some new features in proto Zeta as well

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.190 
some new features in proto Zeta as well

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.420 
making edits in my source tracks that's

names to anything you're literally just

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.320 
names to anything you're literally just
taking<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.100> data<00:05:06.430> that<00:05:06.610> exists<00:05:06.910> in<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.090> track
