00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
activity so that I can then identify

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.219 
activity so that I can then identify
where<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.700> student<00:01:47.180> may<00:01:47.330> need<00:01:47.390> support<00:01:47.720> where

apply himself really you know we were
out<00:02:46.010> last<00:02:46.340> night<00:02:46.489> at<00:02:46.760> Gabe<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.450> he<00:02:47.570> was

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
out last night at Gabe and he was

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.400 
out last night at Gabe and he was
showing<00:02:47.930> me<00:02:48.080> his<00:02:48.200> grades<00:02:48.470> on<00:02:48.709> his<00:02:48.860> iPhone

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.810 

what<00:02:56.410> we<00:02:56.500> actually<00:02:56.590> found<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.280> there

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
what we actually found is that there

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.940 
what we actually found is that there
increased<00:02:58.660> usage<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.290> gateway<00:02:59.650> led<00:02:59.860> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
increased usage of the gateway led to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.100 
increased usage of the gateway led to
them<00:03:00.070> getting<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.790> highest<00:03:01.030> GCSE<00:03:01.630> results<00:03:01.660> in

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
them getting the highest GCSE results in

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.470 
them getting the highest GCSE results in
their<00:03:02.260> area<00:03:02.710> of<00:03:03.250> all<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.610> school<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.300> does

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
their area of all the school so it does

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.690 
their area of all the school so it does
seem<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.990> using<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.800> revision<00:03:06.190> gateways<00:03:06.520> as

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
seem that using the revision gateways as

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.310 
seem that using the revision gateways as
a<00:03:06.730> revision<00:03:07.000> tool<00:03:07.360> has<00:03:07.810> had<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.020> big<00:03:08.200> impact

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
a revision tool has had a big impact

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:16.920 
a revision tool has had a big impact
already<00:03:14.820> when<00:03:15.820> we<00:03:15.850> started<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:16.510> off<00:03:16.720> with

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
already when we started this off with

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.570 
already when we started this off with
our<00:03:17.050> loading<00:03:17.260> gateways<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:18.100> started<00:03:18.460> putting

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
our loading gateways and started putting

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.060 
our loading gateways and started putting
resources<00:03:18.910> on<00:03:19.300> there<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.990> incredibly<00:03:20.800> high

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
resources on there the incredibly high

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.160 
resources on there the incredibly high
take-up<00:03:21.520> rate<00:03:21.730> from<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.030> students<00:03:22.480> their

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
take-up rate from the students their

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.140 
take-up rate from the students their
feedback<00:03:23.590> was<00:03:23.740> tremendous<00:03:24.280> in<00:03:24.550> terms<00:03:24.580> of<00:03:25.000> they

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
feedback was tremendous in terms of they

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.630 
feedback was tremendous in terms of they
really<00:03:26.050> enjoyed<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.860> results<00:03:27.250> as<00:03:27.370> being

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
really enjoyed the results as being

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.480 
really enjoyed the results as being
there<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.300> they<00:03:28.930> could<00:03:29.140> log<00:03:29.290> on<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.800> school<00:03:30.220> or

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
there and they could log on in school or

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.060 
there and they could log on in school or
at<00:03:30.880> home<00:03:31.210> and<00:03:31.540> get<00:03:32.080> exactly<00:03:32.500> what<00:03:32.650> they<00:03:32.800> wanted
