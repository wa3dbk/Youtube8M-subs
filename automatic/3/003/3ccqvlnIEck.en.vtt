00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.910
 that there are commands in landfill I hope that 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.670
 doing them very well on this occasion I will give 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.219
 a super fast religion of what is the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.340
 sound the cne oliver and has this 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.399
 company that is called both those who 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.800
 do the bookstores 

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:24.079
 gibson sell some guitars 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.809
 acoustic like taylor and dave martin 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:31.340
 etcetera and it's worth in this case they have done 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:33.140
 one of the bass sell jazz bass I think 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.390
 one more price was I do not remember but 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.000
 you know him better than me this is 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.220
 the appearance 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.130
 we see that in the controls we have good 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.300
 the other factors are always the types 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:49.390
 sounds that we can take out 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.610
 a solid ping also if there is 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.070
 certain things to choose football 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.399
 and zador exit level this is to be 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.510
 interesting the teacher and with a volume 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.640
 of tone 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.259
 and we only have four strings in 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.119
 this delivery because I think not 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.149
 we need nothing more this time we do not have 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.790
 the instrument as in others in others 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:15.960
 bookstores but good is quite useful 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.729
 so let's see how it sounds and more 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.840
 I 'm going to take that compressor off because 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.840
 it is for later to listen 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.560
 good as you may notice is a sound 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.219
 pretty vicente I liked for a 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.299
 fast effect if it's just as good as 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:10.450
 It will be something to pull it backlight 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.190
 containers of the native instruments but 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.220
 itself I think this is a job 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.950
 well done and clear to hear such 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.800
 which is there is no effect except that 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.420
 now let's activate that compressor 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.050
 listen to the differences so the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.050
 let's say yes 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.790
 effects of models or for a 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.390
 Home construction is pretty good 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.319
 here you already know if you want this one 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.190
 use it then our return for the 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.890
 page try to get it is a good 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.709
 bet and I say no not finished editing 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.720
 is that I gave myself the way is very good 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.720
 there were cameras I leave them 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.820
 in another video
