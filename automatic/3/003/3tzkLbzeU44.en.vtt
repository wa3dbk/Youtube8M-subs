00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:10.080
 and citrus fruits like orange trees 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.999
 grapefruit or lemon tangerines are 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.730
 trees that offer us spectacular 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.869
 blooms and delicious fruits are 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.790
 adapt perfectly to the climate 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.440
 Mediterranean since they like the sun and 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.600
 the good temperatures and by the 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.690
 otherwise, the cold 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.480
 from winter to the ground require 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.730
 lightly clayey soils 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.279
 acids and that always always always 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.560
 very well drained in plantations in 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.030
 pot or even on the ground 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.120
 We recommend that you use a substrate 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.440
 like compost a plantation all the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.720
 biological cycle of this tree that 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.730
 will begin with the issuance of leaves the 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.950
 subsequent flowering and will end the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.200
 maturation of the fruit supposes a consumption 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.930
 very energetic for him therefore 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.930
 we will have to provide nutrients and water from 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.640
 irrigation to meet these needs 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.590
 irrigation water that as the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.570
 thermometers we will increase the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.760
 amount to meet the needs 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.259
 Nutritious of our citrus fruits 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.830
 you have two products on one side 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.800
 a granulated fertilizer like citrus 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.200
 and a soluble fertilizer as a soluble fertilizer 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.060
 for citrus, these two fertilizers are 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.060
 especially rich in nitrogen potassium 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.220
 and sulfur if you decide on the fertilizer 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.750
 grainy what you should do is like 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.050
 always following the doses of the container 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.490
 Apply around the foot of the tree 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.470
 cover with substrate because of this 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.330
 way when the grain returns 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.730
 will undo much sooner if on the contrary 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.860
 you decide on the soluble fertilizer and 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.110
 if you have water tanks a 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.810
 You can dilute kilo in 400 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.030
 liters well every time you reid you'll be 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.729
 contributing fertilizer for applications with 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.530
 less water as you can check the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.250
 product includes a teaspoon 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.130
 doser at this dose diluted in 34 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.030
 liters of water and to water it would also be 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.350
 possible to spread the around the tree 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.689
 and that yes always remember to water 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.909
 for both products and always 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.250
 depending on the weather 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.310
 you will make contributions between February and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.110
 October every four weeks a problem 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.510
 very common in citrus as well as 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.250
 acid rows is the one known as chlorosis 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.340
 iron is to say the lack of a 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.680
 nutrient like iron this problem 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.790
 it's so common that I'm sure it 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.159
 inspected this citrus I'll find 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.010
 signs or symptoms of systemic color 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:33.549
 easy to detect on the other hand here 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.129
 you see yellowing leaves and the 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.379
 nerves stay green the way more 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.060
 quick to correct it is using a 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.569
 product as with the herd of 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.489
 iron this product always look at the 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.069
 application dose but in the case of 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.769
 the citrus fruit would be two diluted envelopes 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.379
 in five liters of water and apply for 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.180
 watering you will see how in this way the 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.639
 leaves of your citrus will return to 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.590
 green and nothing else we hope that with 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.629
 these tips or it is much easier 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.030
 take care of your citrus fruits and in the end 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:08.159
 you can enjoy those spectacular 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.159
 formations and those delicious fruits
