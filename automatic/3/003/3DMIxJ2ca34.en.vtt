00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
comments what you think of that one I

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.720 
comments what you think of that one I
have<00:03:05.240> no<00:03:05.450> idea<00:03:05.780> but<00:03:06.560> once<00:03:06.770> again<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.070> red<00:03:07.550> is

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
have no idea but once again that red is

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.490 
have no idea but once again that red is
just<00:03:07.940> captured<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:08.600> beautifully<00:03:09.140> man<00:03:09.290> it's

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
just captured so beautifully man it's

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.940 
just captured so beautifully man it's
like<00:03:09.590> blood-red<00:03:10.430> not<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.030> be<00:03:11.090> gross<00:03:11.390> but<00:03:11.950> so

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
like blood-red not to be gross but so

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.199 
like blood-red not to be gross but so
now<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.160> have<00:03:13.400> three<00:03:13.760> fires<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.600> four<00:03:15.380> water

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
now I have three fires and four water

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.080 
now I have three fires and four water
next<00:03:17.209> we<00:03:17.390> have<00:03:17.570> more<00:03:18.310> tech<00:03:19.310> traps<00:03:19.670> only<00:03:19.970> have

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
next we have more tech traps only have

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.800 
next we have more tech traps only have
one<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.989> I<00:03:21.019> found<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.739> wave<00:03:22.070> -<00:03:22.519> tech<00:03:23.239> trap<00:03:23.570> it's

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
one so I found a wave - tech trap it's

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.910 
one so I found a wave - tech trap it's
got<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.290> angel<00:03:24.800> design<00:03:25.160> once<00:03:25.459> again<00:03:26.800> that<00:03:27.800> I

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
got the angel design once again that I

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.949 
got the angel design once again that I
think<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.250> captures<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:28.940> angel<00:03:29.300> even<00:03:29.720> more

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
think that captures the angel even more

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:45.490 
think that captures the angel even more
than<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:31.000> blue<00:03:32.000> one<00:03:32.180> oh<00:03:44.080> look<00:03:45.080> at<00:03:45.230> that

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
and now I have three tech tracks so

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.000 
and now I have three tech tracks so
finally<00:04:48.550> I<00:04:48.820> can<00:04:49.240> put<00:04:49.390> my<00:04:49.660> shred<00:04:50.050> not<00:04:50.260> in<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:50.830> my

all they're all great but once I get
doctor<00:04:55.300> cranking<00:04:55.750> case<00:04:55.900> he'll<00:04:56.110> probably<00:04:56.290> be

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
doctor cranking case he'll probably be

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.640 
doctor cranking case he'll probably be
the<00:04:56.680> one<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:57.010> goes<00:04:57.190> in<00:04:57.270> trap<00:04:58.270> first<00:04:58.690> and

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
the one that goes in trap first and

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.020 
the one that goes in trap first and
finally<00:05:00.220> I've<00:05:00.430> got<00:05:00.670> a<00:05:00.910> series<00:05:01.480> waiting<00:05:02.470> to

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
finally I've got a series waiting to

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.570 
finally I've got a series waiting to
life<00:05:04.030> trap<00:05:04.450> and<00:05:04.720> it's<00:05:04.930> like<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.350> toucan<00:05:06.220> like

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580
