a<00:01:40.970> tower<00:01:41.180> Torx<00:01:41.509> screws<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.829> if<00:01:42.979> you're<00:01:43.189> going

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
a tower Torx screws so if you're going

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.530 
a tower Torx screws so if you're going
to<00:01:43.490> take<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:43.759> apart<00:01:43.970> yourself<00:01:44.090> you're<00:01:44.450> going

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
to take it apart yourself you're going

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.440 
to take it apart yourself you're going
to<00:01:44.600> need<00:01:44.810> one<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.200> those<00:01:45.320> screwdrivers<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:47.360> I'm

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
to need one of those screwdrivers so I'm

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.179 
to need one of those screwdrivers so I'm
going<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.630> speed<00:01:47.840> this<00:01:47.960> up<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.890> save<00:01:49.070> you

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
going to speed this up so to save you

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.300 
going to speed this up so to save you
the<00:01:49.310> pain<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.549> watching<00:01:49.759> me<00:01:50.090> open<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.930> up<00:01:52.810> and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
the pain of watching me open it up and

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.370 
the pain of watching me open it up and
then<00:01:55.310> between<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.850> two<00:01:55.880> sides<00:01:56.360> there<00:01:56.810> is<00:01:56.869> this

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
then between the two sides there is this

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.969 
then between the two sides there is this
environmental<00:01:57.860> seal<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.549> goes<00:01:58.610> around<00:01:58.850> it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
environmental seal that goes around it

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.240 
environmental seal that goes around it
and<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.079> preamplifier<00:02:03.469> circuit<00:02:03.680> board

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
and the the preamplifier circuit board

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.700 
and the the preamplifier circuit board
is<00:02:04.399> also<00:02:04.549> screwed<00:02:04.700> into<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.420> one<00:02:06.320> side<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.649> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
is also screwed into the one side of the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.479 
is also screwed into the one side of the
case<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.390> lift<00:02:08.600> it<00:02:08.869> out<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.890> can<00:02:10.070> see<00:02:10.250> here

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
case so to lift it out you can see here

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.090 
case so to lift it out you can see here
that<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.880> has<00:02:10.910> two<00:02:11.090> identical<00:02:11.739> pieces<00:02:12.739> of

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
that it has two identical pieces of

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.400 
that it has two identical pieces of
sheet<00:02:14.000> metal<00:02:14.329> on<00:02:14.420> either<00:02:14.480> side<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.170> are

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
sheet metal on either side that are

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.870 
sheet metal on either side that are
connected<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:15.920> center<00:02:16.340> circuit<00:02:16.700> board

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
connected to that center circuit board

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.750 
connected to that center circuit board
that<00:02:17.030> has<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.390> preamp<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.109> also<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.040> coax

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
that has the preamp and also the coax

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.530 
that has the preamp and also the coax
connector<00:02:20.209> on<00:02:20.329> it<00:02:20.359> so<00:02:22.090> here's<00:02:23.090> just<00:02:23.329> some

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
connector on it so here's just some

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.009 
connector on it so here's just some
pictures<00:02:24.019> of<00:02:24.739> it<00:02:25.269> some<00:02:26.269> close-ups<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.840> the

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
pictures of it some close-ups of the

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.080 
pictures of it some close-ups of the
circuit<00:02:27.379> board<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:28.340> circuit<00:02:28.489> board<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.970> i

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
circuit board the circuit board is i

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.910 
circuit board the circuit board is i
mean<00:02:29.269> it's<00:02:29.450> remarkably<00:02:29.480> simple<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.590> its

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
mean it's remarkably simple in its

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.220 
mean it's remarkably simple in its
design

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
design

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.309 
design
but<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.830> does<00:02:32.190> work<00:02:32.220> very<00:02:32.760> well<00:02:33.030> like<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:34.050> say<00:02:34.200> in

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
but it does work very well like I say in

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.119 
but it does work very well like I say in
my<00:02:34.409> review<00:02:34.739> it's<00:02:35.040> got<00:02:35.220> good<00:02:35.430> performance<00:02:37.099> so<00:02:38.099> I

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
my review it's got good performance so I

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.440 
my review it's got good performance so I
mentioned<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.549> my<00:02:38.580> review<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.120> was<00:02:39.269> using

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
mentioned in my review that I was using

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.649 
mentioned in my review that I was using
a<00:02:39.599> channel<00:02:39.840> master<00:02:40.170> 4228<00:02:41.000> 8b<00:02:42.000> antenna<00:02:42.360> this

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
a channel master 4228 8b antenna this

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.180 
a channel master 4228 8b antenna this
isn't<00:02:42.959> my<00:02:43.049> picture<00:02:43.409> but<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.709> one<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.040> web

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
isn't my picture but it's one on the web

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.430 
isn't my picture but it's one on the web
it's<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.030> pretty<00:02:45.209> large<00:02:45.390> antenna<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:46.080> was<00:02:46.230> also

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
it's a pretty large antenna I was also

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.910 
it's a pretty large antenna I was also
using<00:02:46.470> their<00:02:47.000> 7777<00:02:48.000> pre<00:02:48.480> amp<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.290> amplifier<00:02:49.650> I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
using their 7777 pre amp and amplifier I

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.350 
using their 7777 pre amp and amplifier I
just<00:02:50.519> want<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.730> show<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:50.879> a<00:02:50.970> size<00:02:51.180> comparison

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
just want to show you a size comparison

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.900 
just want to show you a size comparison
like<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.140> say<00:02:52.290> my<00:02:52.470> review<00:02:52.620> they<00:02:52.980> they<00:02:53.340> have<00:02:53.610> very

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
like I say my review they they have very

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.180 
like I say my review they they have very
similar<00:02:54.150> performance<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.840> each<00:02:54.900> other<00:02:55.190> but

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
similar performance to each other but

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.180 
similar performance to each other but
you<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.489> see<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.879> this<00:02:57.060> skye<00:02:57.840> antenna<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.829> so

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
you can see that this skye antenna is so

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.910 
you can see that this skye antenna is so
significantly<00:02:59.599> smaller<00:03:00.599> than<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.620> channel

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
significantly smaller than that channel

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.220 
significantly smaller than that channel
master<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:03.120> lot<00:03:03.329> easier<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.870> work<00:03:03.989> with<00:03:04.049> a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
master it's a lot easier to work with a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.690 
master it's a lot easier to work with a
lot<00:03:04.440> easier<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.860> mount<00:03:04.980> has<00:03:05.340> about<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.670> same

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
lot easier to mount has about the same

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.360 
lot easier to mount has about the same
performance<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.739> because<00:03:07.739> neither<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
performance but because neither the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.039 
performance but because neither the
channel<00:03:08.579> western<00:03:08.970> or<00:03:09.329> sky<00:03:09.359> gave<00:03:09.870> me<00:03:09.959> the

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
channel western or sky gave me the

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.780 
channel western or sky gave me the
performance<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.650> need<00:03:10.859> and<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.190> might<00:03:11.579> be<00:03:11.700> in

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
performance I need and you might be in

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.979 
performance I need and you might be in
the<00:03:11.849> same<00:03:12.030> boat<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.390> want<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.660> show<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.810> my

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
current setup where I use two antennas I

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.490 
current setup where I use two antennas I
have<00:03:14.910> these<00:03:15.060> RCA<00:03:15.510> antennas<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.079> can<00:03:16.200> buy<00:03:16.319> them

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
have these RCA antennas you can buy them

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.830 
have these RCA antennas you can buy them
off<00:03:16.560> at<00:03:16.680> Amazon<00:03:17.069> for<00:03:17.099> about<00:03:17.400> $50<00:03:18.000> each<00:03:18.180> I'm

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
still using that channel master amp and

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.580 
still using that channel master amp and
preamp<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.030> here's<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.660> look<00:03:21.780> at<00:03:21.930> them<00:03:22.170> mounted

on top of my patio roof you can see that

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.690 
on top of my patio roof you can see that
they're<00:03:25.290> angled<00:03:25.650> off<00:03:25.769> probably<00:03:26.099> bout<00:03:26.280> 75

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
they're angled off probably bout 75
