00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello how about good night everyone 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.560
 today we are going to learn how to prepare a 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.990
 barbecue how to prepare what are the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.809
 steps to follow so that we get one 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.859
 good chop a good piece as I have 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.840
 here sausage or blood sausage which is what 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.270
 necessary to prepare a good 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.390
 barbecue and that does not come out excellent and that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.359
 come out good the main thing is coal 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.960
 we need black charcoal is a few 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.840
 bags that come in paper bags and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.090
 then this coal is bought from the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.090
 shops and you buy and charcoal 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.129
 to later turn on with some 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.079
 pills that I do not have either here are 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.800
 some white pills that are pills 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.930
 of burning and are made with diesel and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.489
 they smell very bad and then you're 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.969
 pills what they do is that you 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.990
 learn with the lighter and you start I'll 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.100
 take a lighter a lighter like this 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.100
 what do I have here 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.100
 I got rid of the whole life that's coming 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.770
 even with its little blue light and then what 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.479
 The main thing is to learn how we have to 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.390
 learn we have to undertake 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.880
 I'm going to catch this is another thing of the 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.610
 what we are going to talk about now later is the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.030
 grid this grid is where it goes 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.250
 supported the weight here you put two 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.920
 boulders put two stones here in 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.050
 Each side gets a stone and this 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.110
 that what we have to achieve is that 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.020
 this does not move so then put 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.450
 here is up the grill put the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.580
 things then to learn we have 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.040
 then we are going to do it with this 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.130
 napkin and what we have to catch is 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.490
 burn the pill since more here a 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.490
 little bit 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.909
 this has to 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.860
 this is learning 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.140
 Then turn on the tablet when you turn on 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.110
 what the pill does is that the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.110
 energy you have for this 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.650
 only 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.570
 what he does as a neighbor 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.330
 what it does is the pill that lights the 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.400
 diesel fuel that is inside then 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.090
 learn this flame what it does is 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.090
 burn the coal 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.710
 what's going to come out is burning then what 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.800
 what does the pill that undertakes the 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.470
 coal and coal generates a lot of heat 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.430
 what it does is heat what it 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.300
 that we put inside then the grill 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.300
 let's put it here 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.690
 this is going to pay for this that is not 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.690
 we face a fire forgive 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.189
 must be pursued 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.980
 and then what we have to catch is 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.980
 know it 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.630
 this has done and it sounded then we have 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.060
 that to catch this is the child's role 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.700
 you can also do many tricks 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.860
 Homemade experiment with cal schümann 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.620
 with sun smoking you can do a lot 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.230
 experiment that you have been talking about 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.150
 that aluminum and then if you can 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.910
 do many experiments with this that 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.390
 someday 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.960
 so I had the chorizo ​​made here 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.150
 and the blood sausage also 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.060
 this is put into several pieces because if 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.510
 it was not nonsense 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.090
 we are not going to advertising we have to put 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.599
 and we put it that way it gets in several 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.840
 chunks 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.489
 if we want several there are several people 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.790
 we have to put distribute well the 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.189
 things on the grill 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.959
 distribute well as grilled 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:59.319
 can things I know fifteen or twenty 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.049
 people can catch so you can eat from 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.930
 our barbecue if you are chops 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:08.140
 different sections with the chop 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.959
 puts him on top of him 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.670
 Discard salt and you have to go toasting 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.280
 you have to go around with a 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.380
 palette is turning around so that it 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.630
 Warm up all and make all 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.870
 the chops that's very important 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.590
 also another important thing is to turn off 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.710
 then what is the local then the 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.139
 physical is what it is then there are also 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.449
 to turn off what to the candle because if 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.580
 we left a meat lit it the only thing 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.830
 what we can cause is that it catches fire 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.880
 because if there is a newspaper or whatever there is 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.880
 branch because it catches fire what it is that 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.789
 it's the forest nature catches fire and 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.680
 we cause a fire therefore 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.910
 we have to turn off our candle 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.210
 our bonfire as we want to call it 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.430
 we all have to turn off then after 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.010
 have done the food we have to turn off 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.980
 I recommend putting it in a place where 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.590
 there are not many people who do not 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.990
 there is a lot of vegetation that there is not 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.720
 vegetation and especially that there is not 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:14.740
 cars because it can take away a spark 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.990
 whatever it is and it can be learned that 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.440
 let's be very careful with the candle and 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.320
 with people and we always pay for it 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.810
 before we leave the place where 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.390
 We have been dining on Sunday or 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.880
 Saturday that we paid everything well all the 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:34.360
 candela that do not remain restrojos and 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.820
 can burn other things and 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.700
 they will not always use my diesel and gasoline 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.580
 to learn because I've done the only thing 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.370
 what can cause is that we approach 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.320
 hand and we burn and go out watching 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.540
 and we have problems therefore 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.820
 we the gray and everything that has 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.160
 what to do with what with the barbecue we 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.520
 we have to separate quite a lot 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.910
 almond trees of the precautions that 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.670
 let's have therefore so it can be done 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.470
 a barbecue perfectly and with a lot 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.870
 security 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.810
 that's all for making a barbecue if 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.930
