thinking of exchanging some of my monies
I<00:06:29.690> could<00:06:29.930> do<00:06:30.080> that<00:06:30.229> right<00:06:30.410> now<00:06:30.440> actually

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
I could do that right now actually

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.210 
I could do that right now actually
exchange<00:06:31.940> some<00:06:32.120> of<00:06:32.210> my<00:06:32.300> monies<00:06:32.690> for<00:06:33.380> 15<00:06:34.010> Pierre

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
exchange some of my monies for 15 Pierre

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.519 
exchange some of my monies for 15 Pierre

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:36.529 
box and actually buy the elevator

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:38.899 
but so far I think I'm good with this

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:43.359 
but so far I think I'm good with this
elevator<00:06:39.499> and<00:06:40.839> yeah<00:06:41.839> maybe<00:06:42.199> we'll<00:06:42.439> do<00:06:42.679> maybe

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:43.369

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.969 
elevator and yeah maybe we'll do maybe
we'll<00:06:43.579> do<00:06:43.759> that<00:06:44.259> maybe<00:06:45.259> I'll<00:06:45.409> do<00:06:45.589> that<00:06:45.619> when<00:06:45.919> I

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:45.979 
we'll do that maybe I'll do that when I

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:47.889 
we'll do that maybe I'll do that when I
feel<00:06:46.279> like<00:06:46.489> you<00:06:47.059> know<00:06:47.209> there's<00:06:47.599> too<00:06:47.809> many

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:47.899 
feel like you know there's too many

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:49.659 
feel like you know there's too many
levels<00:06:48.199> and<00:06:48.559> I<00:06:48.679> need<00:06:48.829> to<00:06:48.949> go<00:06:49.039> faster<00:06:49.459> but
