00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.730
 arguments against the African plaque 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.350
 moves very slowly 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.299
 this scheme would reverse the genesis 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.980
 known from the different islands should 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.670
 to be younger, there will be the 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.670
 oldest 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.550
 the theory of laminar thermal anomaly 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.289
 was based on physical data according to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.629
 which exists under the archipelago 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.489
 canary hot zones similar to 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.930
 flat sheets and without contact with the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.210
 mantle and that are part of a great 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.020
 global thermal structure in this area 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.640
 of the Atlantic 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.710
 both theories are eminently 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.560
 volcanic as is the theory of 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.800
 hot spots from which they are derived 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.080
 arguments against the anomaly not 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.880
 comes from the lower mantle which is the 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.340
 place of origin of the tufts 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.200
 according to recent theories the anomaly 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.420
 thermal is not exclusive to the Canary Islands 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.089
 but it covers a very large region 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.220
 of the Atlantic Africa and Europe located 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.470
 in volcanic areas as non-volcanic and 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.630
 it seems even more important under the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.270
 Atlas area in Morocco that went down 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.050
 Canary Islands located on an area not 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.050
 especially hot 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.439
 the current proposal 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.420
 the latest ideas collect elements of 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.290
 the previous hypotheses exposed in 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.350
 the following theories 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.960
 theory of the bill propagates before theory 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.480
 of the raised blocks theory of the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.520
 thermal sheet 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.740
 therefore it is a theory of 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.390
 synthesis or unifying based on motives 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.390
 both volcanic and tectonic 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.250
 of the theory of thermal normality 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.410
 laminar laminate collects the following 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.940
 the hot areas garbage archipelago 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.590
 they are the rest of an old criminal 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.480
 existing thermal since the time of the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.490
 opening of the Atlantic about 200 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.350
 millions of years its root had 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.390
 disappeared and his heat had 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.490
 largely dissipated what explains 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.070
 the low percentage of infusion and the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.780
 decline in the volume of pragmatism 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.150
 a residual thermal anomaly would be a 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.980
 effective source of magma only under one 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.140
 very fractured bark that lowered its 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.030
 pressure and facilities on the way out 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.320
 to magma without formed what would come 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.700
 explained by the numerous failures 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.630
 present at the bottom of chairs 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.630
 channels and their surroundings 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.460
 of the theory of the prepaid invoice before 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.710
 to catch the next one

 / gadir morocco and the archipelago 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.270
 canary the stretches of the cortex 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.620
 they generated sunken zones what explains 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.230
 the accumulations of large volumes 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.600
 of segments an easy plastic mass 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.970
 reform but difficult to break and few 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.980
 earthquakes because there are no faults but the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.780
 that there is a seismic line of the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.520
 African atlas where there is a 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.200
 similar volcanic activity in 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.660
 Lithological composition sequence 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.830
 selective adjective similar to that of 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.830
 archipelago in last million years 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.280
 of the theory of the raised blocks 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.890
 collects the following 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.930
 there are some tectonic forms called 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.459
 Flowering structures that are big 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.770
 creases limited by failures 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.450
 called expressive trans in which 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.010
 there is a push inwards with a 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.230
 displacement that is paid to both 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.240
 blocks and a central bulge like 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.010
 consequence of the shock in the case of 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.690
 the islands would produce an elevation of 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.459
 the island blocks while the 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.350
 alternation with tran 3 faults and bass 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.720
 TV tran looks like a 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.830
 displacement would generate volcanism and 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.830
 generation of islands 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.480
 next to you can see the tear 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.950
 trust itself goes at the point of the 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.950
 transgressive tear 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.090
 this summary figure of your current 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.400
 shows elements of the three hypotheses 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.709
 of the hot spot takes the idea of ​​a 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.599
 anomalous mantle under the Canary Islands 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.670
 fracture spreads before the importance of 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.410
 tectonic control in the production and 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.510
 channeling or interruption of the most 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.069
 more and from the raised blocks 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.890
 the tectonic explanation of the current 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.170
 exhibition of the islands 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.690
 the birth of a new island 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.910
 daughters 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.550
 the Canarian archipelago will have shortly 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.170
 an island plus a small island that is 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.630
 arising at this time about 70 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.580
 kilometers southwest of the iron the most 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.070
 southern and young of all the Canaries 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.470
 this statement must be understood in 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.240
 geological time since it is calculated 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.180
 that will still take thousands of years 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.490
 emerge from the waters of the Atlantic 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.889
 we are talking about the baptized as the 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.930
 candelas and the daughters a crater 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.490
 submarine about 500 meters high 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.229
 that is active and in 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.900
 constant and slow growth in 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.320
 depths of the ocean at 3500 meters 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.320
 Of the surface 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.680
 the daughters follow exactly the same 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.180
 growth pattern that have had the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.190
 rest of the lists ex dowries that 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.410
 make up the Canary archipelago in its 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.360
 millions of years of existence lava 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.310
 will emerge little by little it will cool and 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.560
 finally the trade winds and the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.610
 wildlife of nearby islands will make their 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.680
 work in colonization and 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.720
 fertilization of this new land all 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.000
 it over hundreds of thousands or 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.710
 millions of years even if it is a pity 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.690
 say that we can never observe the 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.070
 suffering of this new island if it serves 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.360
 the scientific community to study 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.250
 the origins of the creation of 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.430
 archipelagos that make up the area of ​​the 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.460
 macaronesia canaries cabo verde azores and 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.460
 Madeira 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.889
 the first of the stages by which 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.509
 goes through this type of view is that of 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.879
 Submarine growth with eruptions 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.860
 hydro magmatic dilated throughout 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.629
 hundreds of thousands or millions of years in 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.190
 this stage in this stage would be 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:37.800
 the volcano of the islands of the islands 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.750
 then the outcrop phase would come 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.130
 the marine surface of which we can 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.870
 see some spectacular images 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.460
 following this link from a video 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.890
 hung on youtube on the outcrop 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.890
 of an island in Tonga Oceania 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.809
 final reflection 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.430
 the only important characteristic of the 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:02.710
 Canary geology that remains without a 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.990
 clear explanation is the spread of 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.699
 volcanism towards the west although it is 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.409
 interesting to note that also the 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.300
 Lambda vulcanism spreads towards the 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.419
 north towards the Quaternary volcanoes 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.309
 of the Spanish southeast, if there is 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.469
 a coherent explanation for a point 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:20.700
 critical the lack of a network of 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.890
 fractures between the Canary Islands and Africa 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.840
 in regional seismic studies 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.210
 highlights the existence of a lagoon 6 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.190
 almost absolute half in that area while 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.560
 that the earthquakes are resumed in the area 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.720
 of the Canary Islands and the Atlantic 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.420
 Moroccan seismologists believe that in this 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.860
 unexplainable zone of seismic calm the 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.880
 deformation is produced by the flow 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.950
 ductile seismic because maybe because the 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.630
 huge accumulation of sediment absorbs 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.350
 the preferentially to the deformation of 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:51.000
 this way because deformation exists 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.380
 a confirmation of this idea is that the 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.390
 same phenomenon happens in the 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.470
 mouth of the pit another place of 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.470
 strong sedimentation
