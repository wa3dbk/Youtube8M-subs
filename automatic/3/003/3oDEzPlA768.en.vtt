00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.900
 the following direct statements to coincide directly with the important 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.290
 subject studied by the geography that is the greenhouse effect analyzes 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.900
 greenhouse effect 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.160
 first question 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.400
 of this 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.449
 the co2 composition 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.449
 professou translate this word co2 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.019
 means 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.280
 composition of biologists been at the pump 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.290
 the carbon dioxide co2 composition in the present case is well 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.219
 greater than that which exists between the Pelé era 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.500
 industry 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.859
 this information 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.630
 she walks away from reality 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.789
 Do you know 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.519
 which unfortunately in this country on this planet, the more industrialized 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.050
 the area with the largest region has been the emission 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.280
 polluting gases that compromise the future of our 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.380
 humanity 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.089
 Then I made a greenhouse 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.549
 cheese from the island of kalou the global fear thesis to pcm block in practically all 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.880
 this year's tests 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.460
 global warming was a reality 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 This year I can not 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.570
 so this number she also 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.560
 an 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.439
 or the following information 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.579
 the co2 composition in the atmosphere is now much larger than that 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.600
 that exists in the pre-industrial era 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.280
 clear today that the seer 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.560
 because 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.380
 vote greater the industrial advance 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.590
 mayorga unfortunately is for emission of pollutants 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.880
 in the part of the pac shows, so I remembered the Kyoto Protocol 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.630
 playboy 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.120
 of air 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.580
 echo 92 the river call 92 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.859
 which happens in 1992 on the river when countries started to air if it really is 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.189
 started to think about a more sustainable development of our resources 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.130
 the revalidate + 10 that was that symposium that happened at once in the 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.660
 game 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.800
 one of the most important cities in South Africa now in 2002 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.279
 to analyze what really has changed the planet save 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:23.680
 the parents' commitment to decrease the percentage in the pacha 92 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.959
 and today a true one of good direction that is changing 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.200
 the pucpr procon that another was that meeting of the countries in the city 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.540
 of Japan when it committed abilio and the emission of gazes 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.180
 and you know that by a war already happening on the planet states 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.969
 united do not sign the black protocol remember this is that it is very important 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.539
 send more information to 2 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:53.789
 The selection of those responsible for increasing the greenhouse effect are 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:58.179
 there are several activities involved by the man called 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:59.999
 philanthropic activities 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:04.099
 That is why I am worthy even of clear questioning 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.289
 he spoke number 3 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:08.959
 the theme of fossil fuels 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.019
 is that deforestation 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.800
 are two of the main points of the increase 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.379
 is not accused of carbon anything that worries us 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.529
 fuel burning sessions 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.299
 namely oil 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.629
 and deforestation 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.840
 are two of the main sources of 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.920
 garcez in the atmosphere this information number 3 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.700
 besides being right 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.270
 no obvious logic is obvious 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.830
 I took with this nation also 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.900
 question number 3 information number three 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:43.109
 the information is from the body 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.999
 the greenhouse effect 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.829
 is a natural feature ' 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.219
 from several to a serious planetary 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.219
 and not just the atmosphere 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.619
 the greenhouse effect a natural feature 'gee greenhouse effect with 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:59.599
 artificial feature 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.549
 the man duration 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.140
 there was an increase in running costs nothing in our era remember that today 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.950
 is as the historian said the man is the wolf of the man himself 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.920
 so the whole problem that happens today floods 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.249
 deforestation 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:16.209
 question 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.010
 given the rubbish the issue of visual pollution now the auditory pollution 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.860
 all this is what the man's finger 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.949
 the complaint in procon flooding remember the issue of flooding 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.159
 artificial 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.800
 promoted by the construction of hydroelectric 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.720
 this year sobradinho is a great liberal leader and touched they get there in bahia 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.150
 could be picked up also sobradinho actually dropped four cities 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.740
 city ​​backwater pylon arched santa sé house new major cities 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.440
 from the Bahia empire 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.360
 then this is the training number four she is the track have been settled 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.700
 because it overcomes a natural characteristic but is a characteristic 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.010
 own 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.060
 Park and 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.349
 this real 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:03.699
 He will be 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.740
 the considerable increase of carbon ips in the beast 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.760
 terrestrial 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.689
 may imply global climate change on planet earth 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:14.910
 everybody knows it 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.870
 global warming 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.500
 increase of temperature flooding of low areas 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.789
 to which the great river of the north already begins to cpi this pcp cida of the beaches of the 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.319
 North Coast already has cases and more cases 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:30.589
 in one of them 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.869
 Priscilla knows where the northern coast is 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.419
 a big hug to the staff there 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.259
 I watched a room and pool and hungry 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.409
 but the answer will be beyond the die baby 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.550
 one touch bid 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.830
 and 3 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.100
 and yes with just 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.390
 one two three and five athens letter d only the information team number 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.020
 four 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.050
 is that it passes a little distant from the reality sometimes the data centers 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.270
 Remembering the vestment 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.719
 the students ask themselves 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.699
 prosor how is this greenhouse issue talking about 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.249
 here at brasília store 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:11.419
 power appears here our question 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.969
 chemistry 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:15.400
 It's difficult too. 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.710
 then see the greenhouse effect well 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.260
 The agreement does not know that a wave carries it 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:26.440
 here comes our land 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.400
 she gets through 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.839
 by his 2 that the man who produced this is the goal of our home 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:33.539
 but if she can get in 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.740
 because she can not get out then this meat the big question to take 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.309
 incoming aviation 

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:42.790
 our atmosphere when it hits our soil 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.520
 she lost in India 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.120
 if she had to appeal to the creation of the world and its frequency 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.260
 if it changes its frequency when it hits the earth through the reflection that 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.350
 want to return it found its 2 and as it is transmitted in smaller gia with the 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.319
 lower frequency it can not 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.889
 exactly get out of our atmosphere 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.570
 and being here in our land this radiation 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.449
 that will generate our callus 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:13.160
 the increase in warming in the earth then greenhouse remember that due 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.950
 the radiation wave au is just in the soil on the ground by perve gallery and with 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.129
 she can not leave because otherwise 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:24.460
 The way she came in she got out 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.810
 so why does she come in and can not get out 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.140
 just remember that it would change its frequency that changes the pole along with the 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:31.699
 energy 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:37.020
 he also that the same occurs in the car the radiation I was able to enter goes through the 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.039
 windshield but on bank tapping 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:43.500
 when she's leaving I did not get to the villa free 

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:45.930
 like it's your luiz 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.930
 so the inside of the car is a lot warmer than 

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:53.059
 because co2 is doing with the earth 

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:54.580
 the windshield of a car 

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.160
 who lets in but does not let out ok
