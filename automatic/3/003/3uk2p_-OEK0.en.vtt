learned how to do both ways I'm not

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.850 
learned how to do both ways I'm not
going<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:33.879> focus<00:00:34.059> too<00:00:34.300> much<00:00:34.600> on<00:00:34.780> what<00:00:35.500> not<00:00:35.710> to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
going to focus too much on what not to

going to focus too much on what not to
do<00:00:36.040> or<00:00:36.390> common<00:00:37.390> problems<00:00:37.840> this<00:00:38.110> time<00:00:38.290> around

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
do or common problems this time around

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.170 
do or common problems this time around
I'm<00:00:38.650> going<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:38.860> try<00:00:38.980> something<00:00:39.280> different<00:00:39.400> I'm

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
I'm going to try something different I'm

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.280 
I'm going to try something different I'm
going<00:00:40.390> to<00:00:40.449> go<00:00:40.540> over<00:00:40.690> some<00:00:40.870> drills<00:00:41.140> that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
going to go over some drills that

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.350 
going to go over some drills that
actually<00:00:41.710> teach<00:00:41.949> you<00:00:41.980> how<00:00:42.730> to<00:00:42.790> do<00:00:43.000> the<00:00:43.090> skill

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
actually teach you how to do the skill

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:56.610 
actually teach you how to do the skill
so<00:00:44.730> without<00:00:45.730> further<00:00:45.940> ado<00:00:46.620> let's<00:00:47.620> begin

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.250 

when<00:00:57.620> starting<00:00:57.800> out

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
when starting out

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.580 
when starting out
it's<00:00:59.620> better<00:01:00.400> just<00:01:00.520> to<00:01:00.790> get<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.090> feel<00:01:01.360> of<00:01:01.590> what

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
it's better just to get the feel of what

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.580 
it's better just to get the feel of what
your<00:01:03.130> body<00:01:03.280> actually<00:01:03.550> does<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:05.410> way<00:01:05.560> I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
your body actually does and the way I

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.050 
your body actually does and the way I
figured<00:01:06.040> of<00:01:06.310> doing<00:01:06.610> that<00:01:06.730> is<00:01:06.970> you<00:01:07.120> just<00:01:07.330> roll

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
figured of doing that is you just roll

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.890 
figured of doing that is you just roll
across<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.950> back<00:01:12.190> over<00:01:13.090> time<00:01:13.300> that<00:01:13.540> gets<00:01:13.690> too

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
across your back over time that gets too

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.800 
across your back over time that gets too
easy<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.530> want<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:15.310> move<00:01:15.430> on<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:15.880> bouncing<00:01:16.630> off

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
easy you want to move on to bouncing off

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.380 
easy you want to move on to bouncing off
your<00:01:16.840> back<00:01:17.200> and<00:01:17.470> back<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.979> your<00:01:18.100> feet<00:01:18.310> I<00:01:18.580> go

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
your back and back to your feet I go

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.550 
your back and back to your feet I go
this<00:01:19.540> way<00:01:23.250> okay<00:01:24.510> this<00:01:25.510> helps<00:01:25.870> you<00:01:25.990> understand

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
this way okay this helps you understand

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.800 
this way okay this helps you understand
the<00:01:26.650> motion<00:01:27.130> of<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.580> flip<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.000> it<00:01:28.540> helps

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
the motion of the flip and it helps

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.650 
the motion of the flip and it helps
teach<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.320> how<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.560> spot<00:01:30.100> your<00:01:30.370> landing<00:01:30.660> when

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
teach you how to spot your landing when

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.469 
teach you how to spot your landing when
you're<00:01:32.130> starting<00:01:33.130> your<00:01:33.250> jump<00:01:33.610> with<00:01:34.360> the

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
you're starting your jump with the

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.520 
you're starting your jump with the
slight<00:01:34.720> rotation<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:35.410> your<00:01:35.560> back<00:01:35.770> bounce<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
slight rotation to your back bounce and

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.400 
slight rotation to your back bounce and
you<00:01:38.619> go<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.800> your<00:01:38.950> feet<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.840> get<00:01:41.170> more<00:01:41.350> and

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
into your tuck very important as you

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.589 
into your tuck very important as you
tuck<00:05:28.569> and<00:05:29.319> then<00:05:29.710> you're<00:05:30.279> going<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.669> spot<00:05:31.360> the

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.439 
tuck and then you're going to spot the
landing<00:05:31.779> as<00:05:32.460> you're<00:05:33.460> finishing<00:05:33.909> your<00:05:34.150> flip

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
landing as you're finishing your flip

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.360 
landing as you're finishing your flip
you're<00:05:34.659> going<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:35.139> straddle<00:05:35.499> your<00:05:35.770> legs<00:05:36.009> to

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.760
