for longer range shots like that one and
yeah<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.090> my<00:00:20.330> main<00:00:20.450> tactic<00:00:20.960> getting<00:00:21.410> this<00:00:21.530> Moab

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
yeah so my main tactic getting this Moab

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.760 
yeah so my main tactic getting this Moab
is<00:00:22.100> i<00:00:22.190> peek<00:00:23.180> around<00:00:23.360> like<00:00:23.720> this<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.230> kill<00:00:24.619> the

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
is i peek around like this and kill the

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.890 
is i peek around like this and kill the
mango<00:00:25.100> back<00:00:25.310> because<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.180> fire<00:00:26.449> rate<00:00:26.690> on<00:00:26.810> the

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
mango back because the fire rate on the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.529 
mango back because the fire rate on the
KSG<00:00:27.199> is<00:00:27.470> pretty<00:00:28.100> terrible<00:00:28.369> but<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:29.300> range

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
KSG is pretty terrible but the range

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.599 
KSG is pretty terrible but the range
damage<00:00:29.960> are<00:00:30.320> insane<00:00:30.770> especially<00:00:31.130> when<00:00:31.460> use

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
damage are insane especially when use

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.270 
damage are insane especially when use
the<00:00:31.820> damage<00:00:32.270> proficiency<00:00:32.960> it's<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.890> damage

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
the damage proficiency it's the damage

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.189 
the damage proficiency it's the damage
so<00:00:34.460> I<00:00:34.519> hit<00:00:34.699> one<00:00:34.909> shot<00:00:35.179> kills<00:00:35.479> a<00:00:35.690> really<00:00:35.929> long

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
so I hit one shot kills a really long

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.349 
so I hit one shot kills a really long
range<00:00:36.469> like<00:00:36.620> long<00:00:36.829> shots<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:37.850> I'll<00:00:37.940> get<00:00:38.059> a<00:00:38.120> lot
