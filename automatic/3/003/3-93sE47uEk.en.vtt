survival hunter in warlords of Draenor
so<00:00:05.430> first<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.790> all<00:00:05.879> it's<00:00:06.000> worth<00:00:06.120> saying<00:00:06.420> that

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
so first of all it's worth saying that

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.299 
so first of all it's worth saying that
the<00:00:06.690> survival<00:00:07.109> hunter<00:00:07.410> was<00:00:07.560> recently<00:00:07.980> buffed

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
the survival hunter was recently buffed

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.370 
the survival hunter was recently buffed
which<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:09.030> very<00:00:09.330> good<00:00:09.570> for<00:00:09.780> its<00:00:09.900> performance

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
which is very good for its performance

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.990 
which is very good for its performance
and<00:00:10.679> its<00:00:10.830> current<00:00:11.070> lease<00:00:11.160> back<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.610> doing

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
and its current lease back that is doing

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.430 
and its current lease back that is doing
quite<00:00:12.030> well<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> grand<00:00:12.990> scheme<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.290> things

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
quite well in the grand scheme of things

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.950 
quite well in the grand scheme of things
certainly<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.580> will<00:00:14.700> not<00:00:14.910> have<00:00:15.210> any<00:00:15.540> real

downside from playing it now it's worth

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.510 
downside from playing it now it's worth
just<00:00:19.050> talking<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.529> little<00:00:19.680> bit<00:00:19.859> about<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.369> or

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
available with this spec also they've

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.599

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
been moved into our cane shot

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.560 
been moved into our cane shot
essentially<00:00:32.189> whenever<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.550> use<00:00:32.700> arcane<00:00:33.300> shot

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
essentially whenever you use arcane shot

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.200 
essentially whenever you use arcane shot
it<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.170> applies<00:00:34.440> serpent<00:00:34.950> sting<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.370> Cobra

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it just applies serpent sting and Cobra

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.299 
it just applies serpent sting and Cobra
shot<00:00:36.420> will<00:00:36.660> no<00:00:36.840> longer<00:00:36.870> refresh<00:00:37.800> serpent

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
shot will no longer refresh serpent

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.700 
shot will no longer refresh serpent
sting<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.090> essentially<00:00:39.540> whenever<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.200> dump

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
sting so essentially whenever you dump

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.289 
which i think is very handy it's hard to
go<00:01:37.500> wrong<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.979> your<00:01:38.520> heroes<00:01:38.790> will<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.150> you

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
go wrong and your heroes will like you

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.249 
go wrong and your heroes will like you
for<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.689> next<00:01:40.409> at<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> level<00:01:41.040> six<00:01:41.310> ET<00:01:41.520> r<00:01:41.729> i

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
for it next at the level six ET r i

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.960 
for it next at the level six ET r i
recommend<00:01:43.259> going<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.799> dire<00:01:44.310> beast<00:01:44.579> for

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
recommend going with dire beast for

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.210 
recommend going with dire beast for
single<00:01:45.450> target<00:01:45.810> situations<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.860> really

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
single target situations as it's really

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.520 
single target situations as it's really
easy<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.640> use<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.360> thrill<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.930> hunt<00:01:49.049> can

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
easy to use the thrill of the hunt can

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.080 
easy to use the thrill of the hunt can
actually<00:01:49.920> pull<00:01:50.100> ahead<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.610> single<00:01:50.939> target

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
actually pull ahead in a single target

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.230 
actually pull ahead in a single target
situation<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.560> use<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.860> perfectly<00:01:53.369> ie<00:01:53.790> you

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
situation if you use it perfectly ie you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.719 
situation if you use it perfectly ie you
never<00:01:54.570> cap<00:01:54.869> focus<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.890> spend<00:01:56.189> every

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
never cap focus and you spend every

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.030 
never cap focus and you spend every
single<00:01:56.939> proc<00:01:57.479> however<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.469> don't<00:01:58.710> really<00:01:58.829> know

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
single proc however I don't really know

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.740 
single proc however I don't really know
if<00:01:59.130> that's<00:01:59.310> realistic<00:01:59.700> for<00:02:00.119> every<00:02:00.390> scenario

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
if that's realistic for every scenario

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.980 
if that's realistic for every scenario
so<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> think<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.180> dire<00:02:03.180> base<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.570> probably

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
so I think that dire base is probably

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.870 
so I think that dire base is probably
the<00:02:04.200> best<00:02:04.380> single<00:02:04.799> target<00:02:05.130> recommendation

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the best single target recommendation

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.910 
the best single target recommendation
thrill<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.719> hunt<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:07.140> actually<00:02:07.590> fantastic

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
thrill of the hunt is actually fantastic

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100 
thrill of the hunt is actually fantastic
an<00:02:08.250> AoE<00:02:08.520> though<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.360> you're<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.660> big<00:02:09.810> AoE

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
an AoE though so if you're in a big AoE

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.880 
an AoE though so if you're in a big AoE
situation<00:02:10.800> then<00:02:11.190> do<00:02:11.520> go<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> thrill<00:02:12.420> of

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
situation then do go for a thrill of

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.790 
situation then do go for a thrill of
hunt<00:02:13.069> next<00:02:13.910> at<00:02:14.180> level<00:02:14.450> 75<00:02:14.840> murder<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.530> crows

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
hunt next at level 75 murder of crows

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.949 
hunt next at level 75 murder of crows
just<00:02:16.220> flat-out<00:02:16.520> does<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.120> most<00:02:17.270> damage<00:02:17.420> so

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
just flat-out does the most damage so

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.740 
just flat-out does the most damage so
for<00:02:18.170> PVE<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.800> recommend<00:02:19.580> going<00:02:19.850> for<00:02:20.240> that<00:02:20.510> and

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
for PVE I recommend going for that and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.740 
for PVE I recommend going for that and
then<00:02:21.500> at<00:02:21.740> level<00:02:22.069> 90<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:23.000> choice<00:02:23.390> really

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
then at level 90 the choice really

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.050 
then at level 90 the choice really
depends<00:02:24.170> on<00:02:24.290> again<00:02:24.830> are<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.640> an<00:02:25.819> AoE

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
depends on again are you in an AoE

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.180 
depends on again are you in an AoE
situation<00:02:26.720> or<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.900> single<00:02:27.290> target<00:02:27.440> situation

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
situation or a single target situation

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.490 
situation or a single target situation
for<00:02:28.700> single<00:02:29.060> target<00:02:29.390> clave<00:02:29.690> tossed<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
for single target clave tossed is the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.760 
for single target clave tossed is the
best<00:02:30.680> damage<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.280> then<00:02:31.970> for<00:02:32.360> AOE<00:02:32.690> brush<00:02:33.170> is<00:02:33.560> by

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
best damage and then for AOE brush is by

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.560 
best damage and then for AOE brush is by
far<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.040> best<00:02:34.310> damage<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.030> just<00:02:35.270> depends

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
far the best damage so it just depends

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.820 
far the best damage so it just depends
on<00:02:35.810> whatever<00:02:36.050> you're<00:02:36.320> going<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.560> be<00:02:36.680> doing

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
on whatever you're going to be doing

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.790 
on whatever you're going to be doing
then<00:02:37.520> finally<00:02:38.000> at<00:02:38.150> level<00:02:38.450> 100<00:02:38.600> lone<00:02:39.320> wolf<00:02:39.590> is

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
then finally at level 100 lone wolf is

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.920 
then finally at level 100 lone wolf is
currently<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.400> best<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.880> terms<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.360> damage

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
currently the best in terms of damage

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.900 
currently the best in terms of damage
and<00:02:42.080> that's<00:02:42.620> really<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:42.980> as<00:02:43.220> far<00:02:43.459> as<00:02:43.580> talents

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
and that's really it as far as talents

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.420 
and that's really it as far as talents
go<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.390> pretty<00:02:44.870> clear-cut<00:02:45.410> choice<00:02:45.920> really

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
go it's a pretty clear-cut choice really

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.820 
go it's a pretty clear-cut choice really
next<00:02:47.180> let's<00:02:47.330> talk<00:02:47.480> about<00:02:47.630> glyphs<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.320> now<00:02:48.800> a

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
next let's talk about glyphs and now a

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.380 
next let's talk about glyphs and now a
lot<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.340> glyphs<00:02:49.550> are<00:02:49.700> not<00:02:49.820> particularly

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
lot of the glyphs are not particularly

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.240 
lot of the glyphs are not particularly
useful<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.959> your<00:02:51.080> raw<00:02:51.230> throughput<00:02:51.830> but<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.100> do

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
useful to your raw throughput but I do

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.310 
useful to your raw throughput but I do
have<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.519> few<00:02:52.670> recommendations<00:02:53.320> obviously

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
have a few recommendations obviously

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.870 
have a few recommendations obviously
it's<00:02:54.470> definitely<00:02:54.920> worth<00:02:55.070> just<00:02:55.370> having<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.700> read

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
it's definitely worth just having a read

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.880 
it's definitely worth just having a read
through<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.269> glyph<00:02:56.450> book<00:02:56.720> yourself<00:02:56.900> anyway<00:02:57.860> I

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
through the glyph book yourself anyway I

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.320 
through the glyph book yourself anyway I
recommend<00:02:58.430> going<00:02:58.580> for<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.910> glyph<00:02:59.090> of

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
recommend going for the glyph of

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.180 
recommend going for the glyph of
deterrence<00:02:59.720> I<00:03:00.200> think<00:03:00.650> this<00:03:00.769> is<00:03:00.830> pretty<00:03:01.070> much

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
deterrence I think this is pretty much

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.940 
deterrence I think this is pretty much
mandatory<00:03:01.600> because<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:03.110> additional<00:03:03.620> damage

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
mandatory because the additional damage

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.009 
mandatory because the additional damage
reduction<00:03:04.220> can<00:03:04.580> be<00:03:04.700> really<00:03:05.180> vital<00:03:05.630> in<00:03:05.780> some

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
reduction can be really vital in some

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.410 
reduction can be really vital in some
scenarios<00:03:06.230> now<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.250> glyph<00:03:07.489> disengage<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.239> one

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
scenarios now the glyph disengage is one

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.080 
scenarios now the glyph disengage is one
that<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:08.780> can<00:03:09.230> use<00:03:09.650> if<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.040> want<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.670> just

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
that you can use if you want it just

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.430 
that you can use if you want it just
means<00:03:11.239> your<00:03:11.450> disengage<00:03:11.840> shoots<00:03:12.110> you<00:03:12.230> back<00:03:12.410> a

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
means your disengage shoots you back a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.380 
means your disengage shoots you back a
bit<00:03:12.680> further<00:03:12.980> however<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.820> don't<00:03:14.000> think<00:03:14.180> it's

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
bit further however I don't think it's

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.660 
bit further however I don't think it's
that<00:03:14.450> useful<00:03:15.050> because<00:03:15.310> generally<00:03:16.310> i<00:03:16.340> use

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
that useful because generally i use

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.490 
that useful because generally i use
disengage<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.510> get<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.810> speed<00:03:18.049> boost<00:03:18.320> from

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
disengage to get the speed boost from

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.500 
disengage to get the speed boost from
posthaste<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.700> it's<00:03:19.970> not<00:03:20.060> really<00:03:20.180> something

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
posthaste so it's not really something

posthaste so it's not really something
that<00:03:20.660> i<00:03:20.780> find<00:03:21.049> to<00:03:21.140> be<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.440> useful<00:03:21.700> next<00:03:22.700> the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
that i find to be that useful next the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.240 
that i find to be that useful next the
glyph<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.120> liberation<00:03:23.510> gives<00:03:24.110> a<00:03:24.410> like<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:24.980> four

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
glyph of liberation gives a like a four

percent heal on your disengage I mean it

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.949 
percent heal on your disengage I mean it
can<00:03:28.280> be<00:03:28.400> useful<00:03:28.549> but<00:03:28.790> four<00:03:29.150> percent<00:03:29.480> really

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
can be useful but four percent really

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.569 
can be useful but four percent really
just<00:03:30.170> isn't<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.440> much<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:31.070> then<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.549> course

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
just isn't that much and then of course

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.610 
just isn't that much and then of course
is<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:31.880> few<00:03:32.090> other<00:03:32.209> glyphs<00:03:32.540> like<00:03:32.870> say<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.350> glyph

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
is a few other glyphs like say the glyph

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.560 
is a few other glyphs like say the glyph
of<00:03:33.799> distracting<00:03:34.340> shop<00:03:34.610> which<00:03:34.880> are<00:03:35.060> are<00:03:35.390> all

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
of distracting shop which are are all

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.120 
of distracting shop which are are all
useful<00:03:35.780> but<00:03:36.079> just<00:03:36.320> again<00:03:36.410> have<00:03:36.860> a<00:03:36.890> read

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
useful but just again have a read

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.460 
useful but just again have a read
through<00:03:37.310> your<00:03:37.370> glyphs<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:38.000> lot<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.810> these<00:03:38.959> don't

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
through your glyphs a lot of these don't

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.259 
through your glyphs a lot of these don't
really<00:03:39.980> affect<00:03:40.100> your<00:03:40.459> rate<00:03:40.579> performance<00:03:40.850> in

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
really affect your rate performance in

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.600 
really affect your rate performance in
any<00:03:41.420> meaningful<00:03:41.720> way<00:03:42.140> as<00:03:42.890> far<00:03:43.220> as<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.370> minor

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
any meaningful way as far as the minor

any meaningful way as far as the minor
glyphs<00:03:43.820> go<00:03:44.060> again<00:03:44.390> none<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.750> them<00:03:44.870> are<00:03:44.989> really

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
glyphs go again none of them are really

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.810 
glyphs go again none of them are really
that<00:03:45.350> useful<00:03:45.560> however<00:03:46.190> i<00:03:46.310> do<00:03:46.459> recommend

that useful however i do recommend

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.640 
that useful however i do recommend
having<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.450> glyph<00:03:47.690> of<00:03:47.840> lesser<00:03:48.140> proportions

statistic priority the best that for you
is<00:04:20.810> of<00:04:21.140> course<00:04:21.410> multi<00:04:21.919> strike<00:04:22.190> followed<00:04:22.880> by

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
is of course multi strike followed by

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.680 
is of course multi strike followed by
crit<00:04:23.360> than<00:04:23.960> mastery<00:04:24.650> then<00:04:25.099> versatility<00:04:25.880> and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
crit than mastery then versatility and

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.500 
crit than mastery then versatility and
finally<00:04:27.050> haste<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:28.160> basically<00:04:28.790> if<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:29.300> see<00:04:29.480> a

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
finally haste so basically if you see a

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.570 
finally haste so basically if you see a
bit<00:04:29.720> of<00:04:29.840> gear<00:04:30.080> that's<00:04:30.410> got<00:04:30.710> multi<00:04:31.130> strike<00:04:31.400> and

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
bit of gear that's got multi strike and

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.090 
bit of gear that's got multi strike and
crit<00:04:31.850> that's<00:04:32.480> pretty<00:04:32.810> much<00:04:33.080> perfect<00:04:33.680> for<00:04:33.920> you

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
crit that's pretty much perfect for you

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.850 
crit that's pretty much perfect for you
now<00:04:35.020> secondary<00:04:36.020> stats<00:04:36.230> are<00:04:36.380> actually<00:04:36.650> pretty

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
now secondary stats are actually pretty

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.280 
now secondary stats are actually pretty
powerful<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.760> when<00:04:38.330> you<00:04:38.420> look<00:04:38.630> at<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.810> lot<00:04:39.110> of

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
powerful and when you look at a lot of

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.810 
powerful and when you look at a lot of
the<00:04:39.380> warlords<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:39.920> draenor<00:04:40.220> in<00:04:40.340> lutz<00:04:40.580> you'll

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
the warlords of draenor in lutz you'll

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.370 
the warlords of draenor in lutz you'll
notice<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.330> lot<00:04:41.510> of<00:04:41.540> it's<00:04:41.720> got<00:04:41.840> randomized

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
notice that a lot of it's got randomized

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.350 
notice that a lot of it's got randomized
stats<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:42.920> various<00:04:43.220> things<00:04:43.250> like<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:43.790> so

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
stats and various things like that so

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.600 
stats and various things like that so
you<00:04:44.420> really<00:04:44.870> do<00:04:45.050> need<00:04:45.230> to<00:04:45.290> watch<00:04:45.590> out<00:04:45.920> for<00:04:46.190> the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
you really do need to watch out for the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.820 
you really do need to watch out for the
stats<00:04:46.850> on<00:04:47.060> here<00:04:47.510> generally<00:04:48.350> if<00:04:48.500> it's<00:04:48.650> got

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
stats on here generally if it's got

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.950 
stats on here generally if it's got
multi<00:04:49.220> strike<00:04:49.490> on<00:04:49.850> it<00:04:50.060> then<00:04:50.210> you<00:04:50.330> can't<00:04:50.600> do<00:04:50.750> too

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
multi strike on it then you can't do too

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.510 
multi strike on it then you can't do too
much<00:04:50.990> wrong<00:04:51.470> but<00:04:51.920> if<00:04:52.040> you're<00:04:52.160> in<00:04:52.310> doubt<00:04:52.460> just

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
much wrong but if you're in doubt just

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.850 
much wrong but if you're in doubt just
use<00:04:52.970> ask<00:04:53.150> mr.<00:04:53.480> robot<00:04:53.900> or<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.110> similar<00:04:54.410> service

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
use ask mr. robot or a similar service

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.200 
use ask mr. robot or a similar service
to<00:04:55.520> weigh<00:04:55.760> out<00:04:55.940> what's<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.420> best<00:04:56.450> choice<00:04:58.210> next

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
to weigh out what's the best choice next

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.150 
to weigh out what's the best choice next
let's<00:04:59.360> talk<00:04:59.510> about<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.930> rotation<00:05:00.050> so<00:05:01.040> the

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160

so forth so your best opener is going to

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.909 
so forth so your best opener is going to
be<00:06:32.300> just<00:06:32.330> to<00:06:32.630> use<00:06:32.780> glaive<00:06:33.080> toss<00:06:33.320> right<00:06:33.620> before

normal<00:06:40.670> it<00:06:40.850> really<00:06:41.300> is<00:06:41.450> a<00:06:41.480> pretty<00:06:41.840> easy<00:06:42.080> opener

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590

really<00:07:06.020> it<00:07:06.260> honestly<00:07:06.950> survival<00:07:07.700> is<00:07:07.910> the

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
really it honestly survival is the

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.510 
really it honestly survival is the
easiest<00:07:08.780> hunter<00:07:09.260> spec<00:07:09.500> to<00:07:09.710> play<00:07:09.950> pretty<00:07:10.310> much

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
easiest hunter spec to play pretty much

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.840 
easiest hunter spec to play pretty much
in<00:07:10.700> my<00:07:10.730> opinion<00:07:11.090> anyway<00:07:11.350> once<00:07:12.350> you<00:07:12.530> got<00:07:12.710> that

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850 
in my opinion anyway once you got that

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.670 
in my opinion anyway once you got that
priority<00:07:13.850> system<00:07:14.090> in<00:07:14.480> your<00:07:14.660> head<00:07:14.870> it<00:07:15.200> just

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
priority system in your head it just

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.010 
priority system in your head it just
sort<00:07:15.770> of<00:07:15.890> plays<00:07:16.160> itself<00:07:16.610> and<00:07:17.060> with<00:07:17.720> there

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
sort of plays itself and with there

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.380 
sort of plays itself and with there
being<00:07:18.230> no<00:07:18.920> cooldown<00:07:19.310> to<00:07:19.670> manage<00:07:19.970> or<00:07:20.090> anything

being no cooldown to manage or anything

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.390 
being no cooldown to manage or anything
else<00:07:20.540> like<00:07:20.690> that<00:07:20.840> it's<00:07:21.680> just<00:07:21.800> very<00:07:22.070> much

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 
else like that it's just very much

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.040 
else like that it's just very much
getting<00:07:22.910> in<00:07:23.000> one<00:07:23.150> flow<00:07:23.420> maintaining<00:07:23.930> that

getting in one flow maintaining that
throughout<00:07:24.290> the<00:07:24.440> fight<00:07:24.650> and<00:07:24.950> not<00:07:25.460> cocking<00:07:25.970> up

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 
throughout the fight and not cocking up

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.510 
throughout the fight and not cocking up
and<00:07:26.360> honestly<00:07:27.050> it's<00:07:27.260> pretty<00:07:27.590> easy<00:07:27.800> because<00:07:28.250> a

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 
and honestly it's pretty easy because a

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.820 
and honestly it's pretty easy because a
lot<00:07:28.910> of<00:07:28.940> the<00:07:29.360> the<00:07:29.690> focus<00:07:30.050> costs<00:07:30.410> and<00:07:30.530> volatile

well it's just it's pretty forgiving and
it's<00:07:35.510> not<00:07:35.750> particularly<00:07:36.140> hard<00:07:36.560> it's<00:07:37.040> actually

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:37.430 
it's not particularly hard it's actually
