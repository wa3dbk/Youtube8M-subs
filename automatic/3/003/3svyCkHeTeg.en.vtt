00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:07.660
 Hello my grandchildren Must stop newbies What a love my love 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:14.940
 Well. 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:19.390
 Yomo I had no wine that I ask the question, What supper party lovers 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:24.609
 I did not have anything like this on the first night of my romantic honeymoon. 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:29.050
 It is still something quite special, even a little about wine minority 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:34.510
 It seems that there is still some prejudice that the hierarchy will enjoy. 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:37.000
 Now that you are with wine today, it will be prejudiced and a little bit new. 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.020
 I think I can do that. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.730
 Invite parties today gimjuncheol Heo, Jin wine experts to help many words 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.430
 Let's learn. Hello. 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:50.800
 4 And crossing the sound , I do not want to be in the second movement on the radio 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:56.710
 If you are fixing as a means to get more now 4 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:01.329
 You're supposed to talk about the fact that moderate drinking is rather about the way now 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.400
 The fact that even if you drink well, you drink better than men 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.020
 I do not think so. 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:12.850
 Why is the amount of women less than men? 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.340
 We're talking about blood alcohol levels in general. 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.920
 It's about the alcohol content in the blood. 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:25.210
 2 Because of this reason , people with a large number of people with high blood pressure 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.009
 Even if you drink the same amount of alcohol, the concentration will be lower. 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.789
 That's it. 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:35.770
 In general, when two men I'd have to come a lot more weight weight 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:39.130
 So come one and from there the women to take as soon as you drink alcohol second 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.209
 Women also have a lot of body fat content men. 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.770
 I mean for example, the moisture content eopjiyo more than men. 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:49.150
 You have to touch the concentration once again . 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.720
 The third is 2 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:59.210
 Alcohol breaks down to the top. 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:06.140
 I sent it, but the rate is low enough for a man to quit 1 to 2 5. 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:08.600
 So Ain lady weighing 50 km wrestle over key Oath For what the state 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:14.540
 We drank the same thing together. You do not need to know this. 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.750
 I will triple the difference. In Ahih, the kids are constitutionally male 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.980
 I was born with a structure that I can not drink more. 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:26.600
 4 is not a sexism Think about the men and women u * Yes No What 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.920
 This squares with what 1l drinking in moderation is what is good for your health 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:36.290
 What this research I haetneundeyo-year-old faces a lot to see, so for example, what the chart 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:40.310
 We have prepared some kind of relationship between alcohol and our health 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.480
 There are three kinds of beer and Yangju wines 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.760
 Yes, I have a done a comparison chart while watching, please explain to me 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.010
 First you see the horizontal axis 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:58.680
 So if you do not drink our active duty , 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.700
 If you drink in a week once a month once a day in a glass of Chapter 2 of the day 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.950
 Let's do it. 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:09.000
 Yes it's a new look to the axis is a third term drinking of one's death, people 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:15.420
 What happens to the spiritual world when we are told about the mortality rate ? 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.100
 So you see drinking wine Group First mortality increasingly collide number is also written 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.710
 Sipping a day receipt was not ready coal is approximately 0.5 to 0.4 in the box office 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.240
 Drinker 4 days and 6 days 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:31.620
 And I drink a lot of beer, but it does not change much. 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:36.420
 Yangju is very good. Yes. The mortality rate goes up. 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:40.770
 4 Oh, well, it's probably the most realistic thing, even if some ingredients are scientifically poor. 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:47.790
 Listening to you 3 cases Now you have 95 calls to you 2, 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:52.170
 The results of a recent study show that heart disease is still happening. 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.800
 There's a report that says that the net is now available . 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:01.050
 Yes. So enjoying it. 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.040
 If you take this medicine properly , you will be able to keep good health and also give basic instructions . 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.180
 same 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:10.440
 But now that Sir y is divided're going to create a nose that such a party 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:16.859
 Yes, it 's important because it's the mountain of the grapes. 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:21.600
 If the quality of the wine've got to really home in order to understand absolutely prisoners 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.500
 Do not get into a few raw materials other than grapes, so the whole thing to poke cycle 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.040
 uh 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:30.330
 If you want to make a delicious kimchi stew 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.890
 Told kimchi delicious tasty miso soup is used when people have got very 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.110
 So how are you 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:39.810
 4 So Pho get more when everything is resolved alternative wine grapes that aside for 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.170
 Do you have to do the sheep? 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:48.000
 It is made of ordinary grapes and it becomes wine. 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:52.770
 4 We are usually cooked and served with the taste of European-made vinegar 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.520
 If you make wine with our grapes, it makes you a little strange . 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.380
 It's different. 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:02.940
 Four little problems, but we can make a lot of wine in Korea for the load . 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.700
 In addition to that Potosi Billiards Siza I make wine now than in the interests of the house 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:10.350
 I'm not the same ah gotta did 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:17.100
 It's hard to make good wine at home. 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:22.290
 I think that this improvement is not good, how much is the amount, 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:27.630
 Part is a problem and this moderate acting choice or various conditions are not good 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:32.520
 4 to 10kg in stucco, the other years I have had four grapes 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:36.300
 4 And now I do not have ahdeulraemi Novo narcissism carved Oriental White Well 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:41.880
 Grandma looked out line, I know this tie look so right gyesyeoseo buy 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.950
 When the two sperm sleep this wine fornication 4 seconds then lowered grunge a4 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.419
 The basic principle of the 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:53.640
 Because sugar is converted to alcohol by the yeast force, 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:55.979
 Concentration is proportional to weight only. So I wish I knew some sugar . 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.060
 You can not go when you become the assumption of sugar content. 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.650
 game 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.410
 Together the various conditions to get worse though so at home as a hobby 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:09.930
 You can make it simple and have a nice taste. 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:14.010
 4 And I think that the mountain is not that important for a week, 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:18.660
 That's because the amount of sunlight is so important . 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.890
 The bank time in the summer is so deep in Europe that it is not so woven that the wine 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.900
 If you like, 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:29.310
 We are boneyo He liked it so wine lovers wine yireongeo yeonnyeonsaeng 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.910
