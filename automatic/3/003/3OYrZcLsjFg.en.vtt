00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.630
 How about friends, I'm Ricardo Dominguez and 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.040
 we are in grace style in this 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.640
 program are you going to learn something very 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.890
 important style is not something with 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.710
 that is born is something that is activated 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.140
 learn over time and on the road 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.960
 this time I would like to talk with 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.179
 you on a trivia subject if you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.039
 it seems good to you but notice that it is 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:33.750
 interesting the story because that's how it looks 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.730
 how fashion is feeding on things 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.970
 and objects that were first merely 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.579
 the shoes were merely functional 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.579
 brogues or as commonly Bostonians 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.100
 they are called from Mexico are an example 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.210
 very clear of this story see you 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.280
 at the time of the industrial revolution 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.670
 the construction workers and the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.890
 miners from england and ireland 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.910
 they used very heavy shoes 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.280
 and how there it rains very often 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.290
 those puddles were always walking 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.880
 puddles filled their shoes with 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.070
 water and they always walked with their feet 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.710
 Wet ones always ended with their feet 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.250
 with fungi or even more infections 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.070
 severe 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.610
 they could not solve it until a 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.280
 London shoemaker decided to invent a 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.490
 system for shoes to have 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.460
 drainage is to say that they could expel 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.350
 the water that he had gotten while 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.869
 during work and during the use of 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.820
 footwear this is interesting because 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.560
 it turns out that the English have been 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.210
 always very clever for those things 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.820
 the Bostonian shoe you know him 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.270
 well it 's a tip shoe rather 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.759
 round with a series of drawings 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.390
 perforated but these drilled come 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.550
 with a colored background they come at the tip 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.890
 and they come on the sides because it has 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.229
 gained initial function if the water is 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.509
 completely put the shoe had to 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.229
 eject him by the tip and by 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.960
 costs that was what defined these 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.440
 brow shoes 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.630
 and that today are called Bostonians 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.050
 fortunately fashion has adopted them 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.080
 for our normal use today and 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.150
 the bostonian brow shoes have those 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.010
 characteristics but obviously the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.530
 perforations are simulated are not 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.930
 really piercings maybe you 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.180
 already has a couple and if I do not suggest that 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.870
 you buy one because they are very practical 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.370
 very durable and very comfortable but look 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.520
 you that to be a blog or 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.850
 true Bostonian the sole is thick 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.940
 of leather with the fence flown with the 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.430
 sewing of the fence very apparent and that 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.930
 see very well the heel should be firm 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.630
 to give to you 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.360
 better security in the footsteps and a 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.410
 best attraction by sheer gravity in the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.780
 floor that you are stepping on the laces 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.920
 they are playing a very important role should 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.800
 be a round cord 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.470
 enclosed and fine so it does not cost you 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.480
 work untie them and tie them and so that 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.420
 also do not give me continue with time 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.610
 this story is interesting but 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.620
 regardless of the story I think 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.110
 that it suits us to use this 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.379
 kind of shoes because they will always look 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.120
 well they will never lose validity ever 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.099
 will go out of fashion because it is not that they are 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.010
 precisely fashion have always been 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.440
 there they have always existed and they will be but 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.960
 stylish men 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.000
 friends that's all for today a lot 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.940
