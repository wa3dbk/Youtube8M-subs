what it would take to end hunger in our
nation<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.190> I<00:01:41.820> think<00:01:42.060> money<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.870> a<00:01:43.680> very

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
nation and I think money is a very

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.880 
nation and I think money is a very
integral<00:01:44.820> part<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.350> think<00:01:46.500> the

greater component is compassion don't

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.070 
greater component is compassion don't
