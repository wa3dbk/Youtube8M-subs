PlayStation 3 is in fact losing money in
fact<00:02:09.300> up<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:10.050> estimated<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.220> place

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
fact up it's estimated that the place

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.330 
fact up it's estimated that the place
three<00:02:11.840> alone<00:02:12.110> would<00:02:12.320> lose<00:02:12.500> at<00:02:12.740> least<00:02:12.830> 25

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
three alone would lose at least 25

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.070 
three alone would lose at least 25
million<00:02:13.640> dollars<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.450> you're<00:02:14.630> not<00:02:14.720> making

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
million dollars so you're not making

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.170 
million dollars so you're not making
money<00:02:15.200> out<00:02:15.320> of<00:02:15.440> these<00:02:15.590> consoles<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:17.030> is

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
money out of these consoles so this is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.450 
money out of these consoles so this is
clearly<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.650> marketing<00:02:18.650> strategy<00:02:18.800> lowering

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
clearly a marketing strategy lowering

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
clearly a marketing strategy lowering
the<00:02:19.580> price<00:02:19.790> even<00:02:20.000> though<00:02:20.090> you're<00:02:20.330> already

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
the price even though you're already

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.010 
the price even though you're already
losing<00:02:20.780> money<00:02:21.430> well<00:02:22.430> once<00:02:22.820> again<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.840> comes

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
losing money well once again it comes

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.240 
losing money well once again it comes
down<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.560> 10<00:02:24.800> year<00:02:24.980> life<00:02:25.190> cycle<00:02:25.340> expectancy

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
down to a 10 year life cycle expectancy

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.110
