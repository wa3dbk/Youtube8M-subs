retraction very nice feature so when you
power<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> machine<00:01:18.659> off<00:01:19.159> you<00:01:20.159> don't<00:01:20.280> end<00:01:20.490> up

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
power the machine off you don't end up

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.969 
power the machine off you don't end up
with<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.090> needle<00:01:21.409> stick<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.560> housing<00:01:22.799> into

the tube which can be a problem if you

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.499 
the tube which can be a problem if you
set<00:01:26.189> your<00:01:26.280> machine<00:01:26.549> down<00:01:26.759> real<00:01:26.970> fast<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.390> the

needle sticking out and you end up

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.660 
needle sticking out and you end up
Barban<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:32.840> you'll<00:01:33.840> team<00:01:34.140> vice<00:01:34.549> with<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
Barban it you'll team vice with the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
Barban it you'll team vice with the
screw<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.030> tops<00:01:36.270> real<00:01:36.540> nice<00:01:36.750> I've<00:01:36.990> found

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
screw on tops real nice I've found

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.200 
screw on tops real nice I've found
because<00:01:37.530> well<00:01:38.400> them<00:01:38.520> sticking<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
because well them sticking out of the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.910 
because well them sticking out of the
sides<00:01:39.450> they<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.020> tend<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.320> dig<00:01:40.560> into<00:01:40.740> your

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
sides they can tend to dig into your

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.560 
sides they can tend to dig into your
knuckles

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
knuckles

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.219 
knuckles
you<00:01:42.570> didn't<00:01:42.720> no<00:01:42.780> matter<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.110> you're

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
you didn't no matter if you're

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.840 
you didn't no matter if you're
right-handed<00:01:43.439> or<00:01:43.920> left-handed<00:01:43.950> or<00:01:44.670> which

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
right-handed or left-handed or which

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
right-handed or left-handed or which
side<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> screws<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.750> they<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.560> annoying

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
side the screws on they can get annoying

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.590 
side the screws on they can get annoying
sometimes<00:01:47.159> basically<00:01:47.670> got<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> big<00:01:48.060> coin<00:01:48.329> on

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
sometimes basically got a big coin on

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.230 
sometimes basically got a big coin on
there<00:01:48.810> or<00:01:49.020> something<00:01:49.729> this<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.909> nice<00:01:51.119> because

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
there or something this is nice because

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.960 
there or something this is nice because
it<00:01:51.360> keeps<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.750> out<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.049> way<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:53.430> hole<00:01:53.670> is

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
it keeps it out of the way the hole is

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.569 
it keeps it out of the way the hole is
in<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.299> 5/16<00:01:55.229> instead<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> use<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> 8<00:01:56.040> millimeter

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
in a 5/16 instead I use a 8 millimeter

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.770 
in a 5/16 instead I use a 8 millimeter
which<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:58.020> big<00:01:58.290> enough<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:59.600> that<00:02:00.600> way

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
which is just big enough for that way

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.719 
which is just big enough for that way
you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.079> use<00:02:01.229> any<00:02:01.439> tube<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.920> want<00:02:02.159> stainless

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you can use any tube you want stainless
