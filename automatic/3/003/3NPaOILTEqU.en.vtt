then all right we're back to where we

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.950 
then all right we're back to where we
were<00:05:12.550> shooting<00:05:13.550> him<00:05:13.849> up<00:05:14.000> again<00:05:14.300> so<00:05:14.479> I<00:05:14.539> can<00:05:14.720> see

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
were shooting him up again so I can see

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.770 
were shooting him up again so I can see

exact same place that we work for and I

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.469 
exact same place that we work for and I
think<00:05:21.530> it<00:05:21.949> developed<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.610> better<00:05:23.000> technique

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
think it developed a better technique

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.180 
think it developed a better technique
rather<00:05:23.840> than<00:05:24.050> just<00:05:24.199> shielding<00:05:24.770> all<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:24.979> time

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
rather than just shielding all the time

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.249 
rather than just shielding all the time
you<00:05:25.910> can<00:05:26.060> just<00:05:26.090> dodge<00:05:26.389> some<00:05:26.690> of<00:05:26.780> his<00:05:26.900> moves<00:05:27.110> Oh

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
you can just dodge some of his moves Oh
