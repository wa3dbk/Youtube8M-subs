00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.459 

I<00:00:08.140> got<00:00:09.140> a<00:00:09.170> develop<00:00:10.450> inside<00:00:11.450> here<00:00:12.340> it's

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
I got a develop inside here it's

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.080 
I got a develop inside here it's
in<00:00:14.920> fact<00:00:15.129> it's<00:00:15.340> very<00:00:15.400> dark<00:00:17.039> right

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
in fact it's very dark right

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.679 
in fact it's very dark right
deep<00:00:19.539> inside<00:00:20.050> there<00:00:20.470> so<00:00:20.800> I'm<00:00:21.250> using<00:00:22.080> 175<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
deep inside there so I'm using 175 and

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.330 
deep inside there so I'm using 175 and
as<00:00:25.990> if<00:00:26.259> true<00:00:26.529> as<00:00:26.740> you<00:00:26.919> draw<00:00:27.220> out<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.740> becomes<00:00:30.070> a

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
as if true as you draw out it becomes a

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.650 
as if true as you draw out it becomes a
little<00:00:31.079> lighter<00:00:32.100> to<00:00:33.100> there<00:00:33.370> I<00:00:36.480> won't<00:00:37.480> do<00:00:37.629> it

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
little lighter to there I won't do it

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.540 
little lighter to there I won't do it
all<00:00:37.930> because<00:00:38.050> it<00:00:38.379> will<00:00:38.500> take<00:00:38.739> forever<00:00:39.010> to<00:00:39.370> do

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
all because it will take forever to do

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.470 
all because it will take forever to do
so<00:00:40.000> we<00:00:40.690> just<00:00:40.719> do<00:00:41.050> this<00:00:41.260> section<00:00:41.620> here<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:43.300> that

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
so we just do this section here so that

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.479 
so we just do this section here so that
you<00:00:43.570> can<00:00:43.750> see<00:00:43.960> just<00:00:44.200> how<00:00:44.410> strong<00:00:44.469> we<00:00:45.190> need<00:00:45.370> to

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
you can see just how strong we need to

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.069 
you can see just how strong we need to
make<00:00:45.700> it<00:00:45.910> we<00:00:46.240> can<00:00:46.390> bring<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.900> light<00:00:47.050> back

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
make it we can bring the light back

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.800 
make it we can bring the light back
again<00:00:47.620> over<00:00:48.310> the<00:00:48.400> top<00:00:48.610> if<00:00:48.970> you<00:00:49.120> do<00:00:49.329> happen<00:00:49.630> to
