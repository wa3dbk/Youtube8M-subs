00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
don't think it's any dimmer than the

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.370 
don't think it's any dimmer than the
blue<00:03:09.239> had<00:03:10.239> like<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.510> was<00:03:10.630> inside<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:11.200> know

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
blue had like that was inside of it know

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.740 
blue had like that was inside of it know
where<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.620> got<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.310> go<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:15.300> yeah<00:03:16.300> let's<00:03:16.510> take<00:03:16.690> a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
where I got the go but yeah let's take a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.290 
where I got the go but yeah let's take a
look<00:03:16.989> at<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.730> at<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.209> lights<00:03:19.420> for<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:21.300> okay

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
look at it at the lights for you okay

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.820 
look at it at the lights for you okay
you<00:03:22.360> can<00:03:22.570> kind<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.840> get<00:03:22.989> an<00:03:23.080> idea<00:03:23.170> that's<00:03:23.650> the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
you can kind of get an idea that's the

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.140 
you can kind of get an idea that's the
low<00:03:23.980> beam<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:26.459> there's<00:03:27.459> no<00:03:27.580> light<00:03:27.820> on<00:03:28.030> the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
low beam and there's no light on the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.240 
low beam and there's no light on the
hiding<00:03:28.600> stuff<00:03:28.810> really<00:03:29.050> shut<00:03:29.980> up<00:03:30.070> in<00:03:30.160> the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
hiding stuff really shut up in the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.850 
hiding stuff really shut up in the
camera<00:03:30.580> but

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.930 

there<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.730> go<00:03:36.890> he's<00:03:37.890> kind<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.160> close<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.760> my

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
there you go he's kind of close to my

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:47.240 
there you go he's kind of close to my
eyes

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.560 

see<00:03:47.910> what<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.090> can<00:03:48.240> do<00:03:48.390> here<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.820> mean<00:03:50.820> it's<00:03:51.300> lit

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
see what I can do here I mean it's lit

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:58.730 
see what I can do here I mean it's lit
up<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:52.020> works<00:03:55.370> okay<00:03:56.370> after<00:03:56.550> seeing<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.740> the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
up it works okay after seeing that the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.180 
up it works okay after seeing that the
LEDs<00:03:59.190> are<00:03:59.400> much<00:03:59.670> much<00:03:59.880> white<00:04:00.510> term<00:04:00.870> light

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
LEDs are much much white term light

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.490 
LEDs are much much white term light
white<00:04:02.190> light<00:04:03.090> hope<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:03.960> comes<00:04:04.140> through<00:04:04.260> okay

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
white light hope that comes through okay

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.600 
white light hope that comes through okay
um<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:06.240> course<00:04:06.510> it's<00:04:06.690> one<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.930> me<00:04:07.610> remember

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
um of course it's one of me remember

um of course it's one of me remember
this<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.910> an<00:04:09.060> experiment<00:04:09.780> for<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.200> able<00:04:10.350> to

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
this is an experiment for the able to

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.100 
this is an experiment for the able to
say<00:04:10.530> headlight<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:10.890> did<00:04:11.370> not<00:04:11.580> mean<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.810> do

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
say headlight I did not mean to do

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.860 
say headlight I did not mean to do
intend<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:14.340> say<00:04:14.580> run<00:04:14.880> out<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.300> get<00:04:15.450> LED

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
intend to say run out and get LED

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.789 
intend to say run out and get LED
headlights<00:04:17.330> actually<00:04:18.330> this<00:04:18.510> is<00:04:19.410> what<00:04:19.590> their

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
headlights actually this is what their

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.270 
headlights actually this is what their
bulbs<00:04:20.160> sorry<00:04:21.060> let<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.390> had<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.410> smaller<00:04:22.920> plug

bulbs sorry let that had a smaller plug
in<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.640> back<00:04:23.820> end<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.270> they<00:04:24.570> should<00:04:24.750> have

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
in the back end of it they should have

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.870 
in the back end of it they should have
been<00:04:24.900> really<00:04:25.350> marked<00:04:25.860> as<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.040> fog<00:04:26.550> light

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
been really marked as a fog light

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.240 
been really marked as a fog light
whenever<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.840> bought<00:04:28.050> online<00:04:28.260> i<00:04:28.590> strictly<00:04:28.830> fog

whenever I bought online i strictly fog

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.080 
whenever I bought online i strictly fog
light<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.760> not<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.770> headlight<00:04:32.930> but<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:35.090> little

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
light and not a headlight but a little

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.710 
light and not a headlight but a little
bit<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.530> ingenuity<00:04:37.530> got<00:04:38.130> that<00:04:38.370> replaced<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.630> i

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
bit of ingenuity got that replaced and i

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.470 
bit of ingenuity got that replaced and i
didn't<00:04:39.990> change<00:04:40.230> anything<00:04:40.500> on<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.770> go<00:04:41.360> but<00:04:44.480> as

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
didn't change anything on the go but as

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.710 
didn't change anything on the go but as
meant<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.810> see<00:04:45.960> if<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.110> could<00:04:46.230> be<00:04:46.260> done<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:48.210> it

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
meant to see if it could be done and it

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.220 
meant to see if it could be done and it
is<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.550> i<00:04:50.930> mean<00:04:51.930> i<00:04:52.880> think<00:04:53.880> i<00:04:54.419> mean<00:04:54.690> it's<00:04:55.050> better

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
is and i mean i think i mean it's better

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.040
