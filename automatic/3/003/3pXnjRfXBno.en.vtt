00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.140 
it's it seriously works wonders like the
first<00:01:40.680> time<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.040> try<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.490> sit<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:41.970> when

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
first time you try it I sit like when

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.730 
first time you try it I sit like when
you<00:01:42.270> remove<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.140> already<00:01:43.380> see<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you remove it you can already see the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.410 
you remove it you can already see the
difference<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.909> I'm<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.180> show<00:01:45.360> you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
difference so I'm going to show you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.510 
difference so I'm going to show you
inside<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> jelly<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:47.430> of

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
inside it's like a jelly kind of

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.149 
inside it's like a jelly kind of
consistency<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.810> heard<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.740> comes<00:01:49.979> with

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
consistency and I heard that comes with

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.280 
consistency and I heard that comes with
a<00:01:50.189> spatula<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:51.000> buy<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.210> spatula<00:01:51.780> but

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
a spatula you can buy the spatula but

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.630 
a spatula you can buy the spatula but
when<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.470> bought<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:53.070> home<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> spatula

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
when I bought it in home with a spatula

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.840 
when I bought it in home with a spatula
so<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.509> bought<00:01:55.079> one<00:01:55.110> separately<00:01:56.070> from<00:01:56.310> salsa

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
so I bought one separately from salsa

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.319 
so I bought one separately from salsa
which<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.990> drugstore<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:59.100> Asia<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.909> heard

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that you can tell if it's real or not by

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.929 
that you can tell if it's real or not by
looking<00:02:02.729> at<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.490> has<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.909> a
