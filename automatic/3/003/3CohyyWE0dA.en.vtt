00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.370 
boots
so<00:01:51.610> basically<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.850> know<00:01:53.030> that's<00:01:53.750> lacking<00:01:53.990> is

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
so basically you know that's lacking is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.730 
so basically you know that's lacking is
a<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.890> about<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.760> rape<00:01:55.940> uh<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:56.720> he's<00:01:57.530> switching

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
a is about to rape uh so he's switching

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.200 
a is about to rape uh so he's switching
out<00:01:57.950> all<00:01:58.130> over<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.460> place<00:01:58.610> because<00:01:58.820> he's

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
out all over the place because he's

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.880 
out all over the place because he's
figuring<00:01:59.540> like<00:01:59.869> this

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
figuring like this

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.670 
figuring like this
slacking<00:02:01.400> is<00:02:01.580> that<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:02.060> extremely<00:02:03.049> high<00:02:03.200> power

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
slacking is that a extremely high power

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.010 
slacking is that a extremely high power
level<00:02:04.010> I'm<00:02:04.190> not<00:02:04.490> really<00:02:04.729> sure<00:02:05.060> if<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:05.630> can<00:02:05.690> get

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
level I'm not really sure if I can get

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.080 
level I'm not really sure if I can get
around<00:02:06.140> this<00:02:06.560> guy<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:07.130> he<00:02:07.520> basically<00:02:07.670> cap

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
around this guy and he basically cap

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.279 
around this guy and he basically cap
because<00:02:08.299> there's<00:02:08.539> not<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.720> lot<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.869> things<00:02:09.140> in
