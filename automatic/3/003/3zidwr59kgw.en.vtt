see everything I did a little bit of pvp

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.630

since<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.590> row<00:01:19.830> gets<00:01:20.130> pretty<00:01:20.310> cool<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
since this is a row gets pretty cool to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.990 
since this is a row gets pretty cool to
do<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.659> two<00:01:21.780> piece<00:01:22.049> cataclysmic

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
do think it's two piece cataclysmic

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.920 
do think it's two piece cataclysmic
which<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.299> don't<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.479> what<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.720> means

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
which if you don't know what that means

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.679 
which if you don't know what that means
it's<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.369> player<00:01:26.369> versus<00:01:26.729> player<00:01:26.759> gear<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
it's like player versus player gear it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.170 
it's like player versus player gear it
makes<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.020> better<00:01:28.170> against<00:01:28.530> people<00:01:29.180> stuff

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
makes you better against people stuff

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
makes you better against people stuff
like<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.750> he<00:01:31.380> also<00:01:31.530> has<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> blazing

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
like that so he also has the blazing

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.620 
like that so he also has the blazing
Drake<00:01:32.520> which<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.900> mount<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.350> drops<00:01:34.860> off<00:01:35.130> of

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
Drake which is a mount that drops off of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
Drake which is a mount that drops off of
Deathwing<00:01:36.630> himself<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.380> think<00:01:38.280> he's<00:01:38.460> only

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
Deathwing himself so think he's only

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.069 
Deathwing himself so think he's only
like<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.909> third<00:01:39.090> person<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.450> server<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.869> get

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
like the third person on server to get

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.870 
like the third person on server to get
it<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.740> was<00:01:40.860> pretty<00:01:41.009> cool<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.460> more<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.790> them

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
