00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
because all the latest Android devices

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.530 
because all the latest Android devices
now<00:01:51.110> have<00:01:51.350> quad-core<00:01:51.830> processors<00:01:52.700> we<00:01:53.420> can

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
now have quad-core processors we can

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.750 
now have quad-core processors we can
also<00:01:53.690> expect<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.350> camera<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.800> be<00:01:54.950> up<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.460> 12

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
also expect the camera to be up to 12

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.230 
also expect the camera to be up to 12
megapixels<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:57.160> that<00:01:58.160> concludes<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.820> if<00:01:59.060> I

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
megapixels and that concludes it if I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.330 
megapixels and that concludes it if I
have<00:01:59.360> any<00:01:59.540> more<00:01:59.780> iphone<00:02:00.170> 5<00:02:00.440> news<00:02:00.680> that<00:02:01.040> i<00:02:01.160> will
