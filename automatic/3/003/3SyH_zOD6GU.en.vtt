00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.030 
series is the Dragon Age series if I had
to<00:02:18.910> choose<00:02:18.940> between<00:02:19.270> these<00:02:20.110> two<00:02:20.440> which<00:02:20.800> one<00:02:20.980> I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
to choose between these two which one I

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.270 
to choose between these two which one I
liked<00:02:21.310> better<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.530> very<00:02:25.620> very<00:02:26.620> hard<00:02:26.980> for

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
liked better that is very very hard for

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.240 
liked better that is very very hard for
me<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.460> decide<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:28.590> think<00:02:29.590> dragon<00:02:29.980> age<00:02:30.070> origins

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
me to decide I think dragon age origins

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.480 
me to decide I think dragon age origins
was<00:02:30.670> more<00:02:30.910> emotional<00:02:31.420> than<00:02:32.160> dragon<00:02:33.160> age<00:02:33.250> 2

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
was more emotional than dragon age 2

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.180 
was more emotional than dragon age 2
dragon<00:02:34.120> age<00:02:34.210> 2<00:02:34.450> was<00:02:34.660> very<00:02:34.980> interesting<00:02:35.980> and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
dragon age 2 was very interesting and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.160 
dragon age 2 was very interesting and
very<00:02:36.280> in<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:37.270> very<00:02:37.380> unique<00:02:38.400> experience<00:02:39.400> um<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
very in a very unique experience um the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.310 
very in a very unique experience um the
the<00:02:41.590> relationships<00:02:42.430> were<00:02:42.640> very<00:02:43.030> very<00:02:43.810> tight

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
the relationships were very very tight

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.390 
the relationships were very very tight
in<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:45.700> game<00:02:46.060> also<00:02:46.420> which<00:02:46.960> I<00:02:47.110> also<00:02:47.260> loved<00:02:47.710> but

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
in this game also which I also loved but

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.070 
in this game also which I also loved but
this<00:02:48.580> one<00:02:48.760> just<00:02:50.040> made<00:02:51.040> me<00:02:51.190> react<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.970> lot<00:02:52.720> more<00:02:53.050> I

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
this one just made me react a lot more I

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.470 
this one just made me react a lot more I
think<00:02:53.350> it<00:02:53.890> just<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.490> was<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:55.540> was<00:02:55.900> just<00:02:56.110> such<00:02:56.440> an

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
think it just it was it was just such an

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.200 
think it just it was it was just such an
incredibly<00:02:58.480> emotional<00:02:59.290> game<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.800> I<00:03:00.460> love<00:03:01.030> it

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
number two is the Mass Effect series of

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.580 
number two is the Mass Effect series of
course<00:03:10.840> Mass<00:03:11.530> Effect<00:03:12.780> out<00:03:13.780> of<00:03:13.960> these<00:03:14.080> two<00:03:14.350> my

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
course Mass Effect out of these two my

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.090 
course Mass Effect out of these two my
favorite<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.130> mass<00:03:15.910> effect<00:03:16.590> mass<00:03:17.590> effect<00:03:17.830> 2<00:03:17.980> is

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
favorite is mass effect mass effect 2 is

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.460 
favorite is mass effect mass effect 2 is
also<00:03:18.430> really<00:03:18.700> good<00:03:18.820> but<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.630> storyline<00:03:19.990> in

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
also really good but the storyline in

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.470 
also really good but the storyline in
Mass<00:03:20.770> Effect<00:03:21.160> one<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.670> thought<00:03:21.910> was<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.180> lot

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
Mass Effect one I thought was a lot

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.310 
Mass Effect one I thought was a lot
better<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.890> gameplay<00:03:24.280> was<00:03:24.450> more<00:03:25.450> improved<00:03:25.930> it

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
better the gameplay was more improved it

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.740 
better the gameplay was more improved it
was<00:03:26.440> improved<00:03:26.830> in<00:03:27.040> mass<00:03:27.310> effect<00:03:27.580> 2<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.060> mass

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
was improved in mass effect 2 and mass

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.000 
was improved in mass effect 2 and mass
effect<00:03:28.780> who<00:03:29.110> does<00:03:29.290> have<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.500> good<00:03:29.680> storyline

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
effect who does have a good storyline

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.970 
effect who does have a good storyline
but<00:03:30.340> overall<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.180> think<00:03:31.920> Mass<00:03:32.920> Effect<00:03:32.950> one<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:34.980> a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
but overall I think Mass Effect one is a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.260 
but overall I think Mass Effect one is a
better<00:03:36.550> story<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.690> was<00:03:38.680> thinking<00:03:39.010> if<00:03:39.520> I<00:03:39.730> were<00:03:39.940> if

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
better story I was thinking if I were if

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.570 
better story I was thinking if I were if
I<00:03:40.480> had<00:03:40.690> more<00:03:41.200> games<00:03:41.620> like<00:03:42.100> maybe<00:03:42.370> say<00:03:42.670> my<00:03:44.580> like

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
I had more games like maybe say my like

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.960 
I had more games like maybe say my like
more<00:03:45.910> games<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.330> put<00:03:47.200> in<00:03:47.320> a<00:03:47.410> list<00:03:47.680> i<00:03:48.040> would

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
more games to put in a list i would

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.510 
more games to put in a list i would
probably<00:03:49.540> order<00:03:49.930> these<00:03:50.140> when<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.070> comes<00:03:51.280> to

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
probably order these when it comes to

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.360 
probably order these when it comes to
these<00:03:51.670> two<00:03:52.000> series<00:03:52.270> that<00:03:52.600> I<00:03:52.630> love<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.170> think<00:03:54.100> it

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
these two series that I love I think it

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.520 
these two series that I love I think it
would<00:03:54.700> be<00:03:58.590> organized<00:03:59.590> like<00:04:00.100> this<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:02.080> I'm<00:04:02.320> not

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
would be organized like this and I'm not

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.500 
would be organized like this and I'm not
like<00:04:02.890> entirely<00:04:03.550> sure<00:04:03.730> about<00:04:03.760> this<00:04:04.120> but<00:04:04.390> this

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
like entirely sure about this but this

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.020 
like entirely sure about this but this
is<00:04:04.690> kind<00:04:05.050> of<00:04:05.140> what<00:04:05.410> I'm<00:04:05.590> going<00:04:05.920> for<00:04:06.000> not<00:04:07.000> a

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
is kind of what I'm going for not a

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.120 
is kind of what I'm going for not a
speck<00:04:07.180> number<00:04:07.570> one<00:04:07.750> or<00:04:08.320> mass<00:04:08.590> out<00:04:08.800> of<00:04:08.980> these

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
speck number one or mass out of these

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.090

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
it more but i think the storyline was a

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.439 
it more but i think the storyline was a
lot<00:06:30.710> better<00:06:31.010> portal<00:06:31.699> um<00:06:32.200> the<00:06:33.200> twist<00:06:33.590> is

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
lot better portal um the twist is

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:38.070 
lot better portal um the twist is
it's<00:06:35.110> hard<00:06:35.860> to<00:06:36.099> beat<00:06:36.340> that<00:06:36.370> really<00:06:36.969> and<00:06:37.180> Arkham

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
it's hard to beat that really and Arkham
