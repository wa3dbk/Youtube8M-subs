00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.569 
turned slowly and we'll look over there
in<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.510> moment<00:00:47.409> so<00:00:48.409> that's<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.860> approach<00:00:49.309> you

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
in a moment so that's the approach you

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.939 
in a moment so that's the approach you
notice<00:00:50.030> that<00:00:50.360> as<00:00:51.489> you<00:00:52.489> would<00:00:52.789> expect<00:00:53.829> for<00:00:54.829> an

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
notice that as you would expect for an

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.719 
notice that as you would expect for an
ancient<00:00:55.430> Creek<00:00:56.350> that<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.530> road<00:00:57.739> comes<00:00:58.219> down

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
ancient Creek that the road comes down

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.359 
ancient Creek that the road comes down
hill<00:00:59.119> from<00:00:59.449> both<00:00:59.719> directions<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.769> reach<00:01:01.039> the

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
hill from both directions to reach the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.819 
hill from both directions to reach the
creek<00:01:01.640> otherwise<00:01:02.600> this<00:01:02.869> was<00:01:03.110> an<00:01:03.289> erosion

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
creek otherwise this was an erosion

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:14.910 
creek otherwise this was an erosion
Valley<00:01:04.119> is<00:01:05.119> an<00:01:05.449> erosion<00:01:05.929> Valley

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.230

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.399

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
can't fish from the bridge so uncle

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.210
