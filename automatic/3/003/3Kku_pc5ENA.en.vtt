00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.920
 index box imagine a properly right 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.390
 noble product where I gave up before 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.040
 especially before the video 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.090
 Viewed I must say it is 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.460
 Definitely my new one 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.489
 favorite track box is a bit 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.379
 bigger looks really classy with the 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:46.269
 there is a total of 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.360
 750 at mt discount just on the 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.430
 stop by or just below in 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.030
 the description is the right link 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.000
 yes so far so far as is commercial 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:03.430
 attack box the dect box is very stable 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.780
 I'm going to open here so here 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.159
 we have nice robes here 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.689
 that means when you press on it 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.159
 here you can not bend too 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.229
 if I push it that hard 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.670
 means that later nothing is nothing 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.740
 broken you have a really pleasant 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.350
 surface in addition you have 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.600
 a snap closure to recognize one 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.570
 that here are such little ones 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.650
 points that then snap when you get the 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.900
 bigbox too makes hand press my 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.980
 Heart on the noise snaps wonderfully pure 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.780
 and just raise it again and yes 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.470
 simply because the blanket is another 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.140
 advantage the red box is the total 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.760
 100 cards in Davos leafs so I have 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.670
 here my enemy all highlander away in 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.560
 double sleeves nude painting and you fit 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.810
 wonderful even even minimal 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.240
 space that is you also can a 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.750
 Modern standard way in davos leafs with 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.019
 reinstall ball around cards 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.260
 everything fits wonderfully wlan dect box 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.049
 our maps are optimally protected 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.700
 yes, I will definitely be one 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.129
 Part of my decks here in this covers 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.069
 rebuild boxes 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.210
 I also have these covers boxed here 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.800
 must still the cards coach gives 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.020
 You could also use it here 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.630
 you can see every case in now 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.570
 course direct box is bigger here 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.720
 below such a small subject as well 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.210
 with this snap closure looks here 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.850
 once you're ultra pro in size 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.920
 hot here 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.210
 our accessories are now quite grad 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.840
 already already belongs the dice 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.530
 sliced 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.790
 you can find your dice clean 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.680
 I was really strong right now 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.590
 not my ex extra deck box needs 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.180
 for your dice for your 10 dice or 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.280
 so maybe you have extra 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.730
 to take along but you have here directly 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.130
 The tray for the dice 920 fit in 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.890
 Of course you can also have your six 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.780
 dice or something like that is big box 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.970
 Build in and make a contact box 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.540
 and perfectly under deck along with 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.600
 roll the dice 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.230
 Rather, you need not actually 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.700
 and of course you can just as well 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.380
 Is it correct to leave me alone if 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.720
 you probably will naturally go there 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.560
 but we are disturbed by the small cavity 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.930
 not further 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.790
 so quarks can do so 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.890
 put together as you like 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.470
 I'm so excited about this 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.770
 Covers box another advantage of this 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.040
 covers boxes that is not the course 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.970
 only in black there but we have 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:59.180
 Of course she is still white 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:04:04.220
 we have it in red green in light blue 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.870
 and one last color in dark blue 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.040
 in total in six different colors 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.870
 this big box gives 7 euro 50 each 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.280
 and yes, yes, yes it can be 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.730
 really optimally protected 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.040
 it is not better then yes 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.840
 there anything else to say about it 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.980
 of course stands is quite well again 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.190
 here on the side now every now and then 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.010
 As I said was 200 game can in Davos 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.980
 let her practical death closure 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.830
 strain durable housing 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.160
 has eicher touch and of course still in 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.080
 other colors available so who's there 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.210
 I do not know his color 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.740
 neither 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.180
 So as I said, I'm a huge fan 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.090
 from this covers boxe I am black 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.080
 Somebody also did not really like anyone 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.400
 Already of you me on it 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.210
 I do not remember exactly 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.210
 who that was 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.160
 or he wanted a yes 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.170
 a blanket presentation of a discovered 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.930
 box presentation to a roofbox with 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.420
 a cube tray and the buffet was from 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.740
 I just love it so much 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.930
 because just the dice perfectly pure 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.430
 fit 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.960
 All in all, much more is needed 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.000
 you really do not get out of the game 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.290
 maybe some with us all 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.900
 very many different teams or 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.180
 Similar it fits any terrain is you 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.030
 So I can only really do that for you 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.740
 recommend and again very space-saving 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.330
 of course everything packed in again 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.970
 this in this box covers therefore 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.230
 Just order and I hope 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.730

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.150

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.390
 I'm a big fan of 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.780
 this redbox 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.710
 and yes, if we do it again 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.300
 Maybe they are looking 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.030
 different wegboxen for the for 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.230
 respective appropriate way or still exist 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.610
 a few times the black or one 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.160
 other case, they make me do that 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.510
 world has to think even more carefully and 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.520
