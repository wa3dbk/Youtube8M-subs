well<00:00:02.460> here's<00:00:02.700> my<00:00:05.450> fridge<00:00:06.450> rater<00:00:06.859> still<00:00:07.859> trying

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
well here's my fridge rater still trying

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.640 
well here's my fridge rater still trying
to<00:00:08.160> figure<00:00:08.340> out<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.580> name<00:00:09.300> for<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.809> not<00:00:10.320> really<00:00:10.620> a

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
to figure out a name for it not really a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.390 
to figure out a name for it not really a
kegerator<00:00:11.450> the<00:00:12.450> fermenter<00:00:13.019> ater<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.530> guess

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.070 

anyways<00:00:17.660> this<00:00:18.660> cabinet<00:00:19.230> here<00:00:20.150> was<00:00:21.150> converted

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
anyways this cabinet here was converted

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.839 
anyways this cabinet here was converted
into<00:00:22.289> my<00:00:22.710> fermenter<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:25.160> you<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.400> see<00:00:26.640> what<00:00:26.820> I

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
into my fermenter and you can see what I

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.299 
into my fermenter and you can see what I
did<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:28.279> add<00:00:29.279> some<00:00:29.539> insulation<00:00:32.660> and

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
did here is just add some insulation and

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.280 
did here is just add some insulation and
I<00:00:35.309> modified<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.210> thermostat<00:00:37.550> extended<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
I modified that thermostat extended a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.770 
I modified that thermostat extended a
thermistor<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:41.180> I'm<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.360> take<00:00:42.570> that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
thermistor and I'm going to take that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.100 
thermistor and I'm going to take that
take<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.530> my<00:00:43.680> car<00:00:43.950> boys<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.460> could<00:00:45.110> measure

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
take that to my car boys I could measure

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.630 
take that to my car boys I could measure
the<00:00:46.350> temperature<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.100> carboy<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.469> using

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
the temperature of this carboy and using

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.819 
the temperature of this carboy and using
antifreeze<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.930> pumped<00:00:52.469> through<00:00:52.530> these

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
antifreeze that is pumped through these

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.340 
antifreeze that is pumped through these
lines<00:00:54.110> cooled<00:00:55.110> by<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:56.270> fridge<00:00:57.270> up<00:00:57.870> here

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.070 

and<00:01:02.090> inside

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
and inside

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.640 
and inside
there's<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.950> bilge<00:01:06.310> pump<00:01:06.730> in<00:01:06.940> there<00:01:07.150> that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
there's a bilge pump in there that

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
there's a bilge pump in there that
circulates<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.770> cold<00:01:09.160> antifreeze<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:11.280> these

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
circulates the cold antifreeze and these

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.700 
circulates the cold antifreeze and these

the<00:01:17.860> air<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:19.330> does<00:01:19.480> a<00:01:19.510> pretty<00:01:19.690> good<00:01:19.840> job

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
the air and it does a pretty good job

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.220 
the air and it does a pretty good job
cooling<00:01:20.620> down<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.920> temperature<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:22.230> I

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
cooling down the temperature and I

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.310 
cooling down the temperature and I
decided<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:23.830> build<00:01:24.100> this<00:01:24.280> because<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:26.020> the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
decided to build this because of the

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.100 
decided to build this because of the
random<00:01:26.710> heat<00:01:27.010> waves<00:01:27.280> that<00:01:27.610> we<00:01:27.850> tend<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.930> have

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
random heat waves that we tend to have

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.290 
random heat waves that we tend to have
in<00:01:29.290> Southern<00:01:29.620> California<00:01:30.630> makes<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.840> hard<00:01:32.080> to

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
in Southern California makes it hard to

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.640 
in Southern California makes it hard to
ferment<00:01:34.300> and<00:01:34.480> keep<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.960> temperature<00:01:35.470> that

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
ferment and keep the temperature that

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.860 
ferment and keep the temperature that
you<00:01:35.890> need<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.460> keep<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:40.350> right<00:01:41.350> now<00:01:41.380> it's<00:01:41.890> the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
you need to keep so right now it's the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.840 
you need to keep so right now it's the
open<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:43.960> door<00:01:44.200> went<00:01:44.470> up<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.740> degree<00:01:45.070> with<00:01:45.280> 69

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
open the door went up a degree with 69

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.670 
open the door went up a degree with 69
it's<00:01:46.180> at<00:01:47.670> 70.5<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:49.030> I'm<00:01:49.840> going<00:01:50.050> to<00:01:50.140> turn<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.560> on

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
it's at 70.5 so I'm going to turn it on

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:59.250 
it's at 70.5 so I'm going to turn it on
and<00:01:52.890> let's<00:01:54.450> bring<00:01:55.450> this<00:01:55.600> down<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:56.080> like<00:01:56.460> 65<00:01:58.260> it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
and let's bring this down to like 65 it

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.800 
and let's bring this down to like 65 it
should<00:01:59.530> turn<00:02:00.100> on<00:02:00.340> want<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.970> go<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.390> degree

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
should turn on want to go the degree

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.600 
should turn on want to go the degree
below<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.940> current<00:02:04.210> temperature<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:06.430> there

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
below the current temperature so there

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.400 
below the current temperature so there
it<00:02:06.729> is<00:02:06.820> 70<00:02:07.510> it<00:02:08.020> just<00:02:08.260> turned<00:02:08.530> on

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.690 

and

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.580 

kinda<00:02:19.360> hard<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.660> see<00:02:20.610> fluid<00:02:22.080> moving<00:02:23.080> around<00:02:23.349> in

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
kinda hard to see fluid moving around in

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.770 
kinda hard to see fluid moving around in
there<00:02:24.720> could<00:02:25.720> hear<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.110> fans<00:02:26.410> and

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.460 

feel<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.530> cool<00:02:31.800> air<00:02:32.010> coming<00:02:32.340> out<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.580> there

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.140 

this<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.330> transmission<00:02:39.330> radiator

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
this is a transmission radiator

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.149 
this is a transmission radiator
nice<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.959> cold<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:45.170> with<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.860> door<00:02:46.129> shut

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
nice and cold so with the door shut

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.530 
nice and cold so with the door shut
should<00:02:46.879> I<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.970> another<00:02:49.970> door<00:02:50.269> that<00:02:50.420> needs

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
should I have a another door that needs

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.880 
should I have a another door that needs
to<00:02:50.720> go<00:02:50.870> on<00:02:50.900> there<00:02:51.170> but<00:02:51.349> I<00:02:51.379> drops<00:02:51.709> the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
to go on there but I drops the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.449 
to go on there but I drops the
temperature<00:02:52.489> pretty<00:02:53.030> quickly<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:54.189> time<00:02:55.189> did<00:02:55.430> I

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
temperature pretty quickly I time did I

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.759 
temperature pretty quickly I time did I
got<00:02:55.970> about<00:02:56.269> 14<00:02:56.900> degree<00:02:57.349> drop<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:58.060> 10<00:02:59.060> minutes

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
got about 14 degree drop in 10 minutes

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.630 
got about 14 degree drop in 10 minutes
so<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:01.609> went<00:03:01.849> two<00:03:02.000> drops<00:03:02.319> with<00:03:03.319> that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
so and it went two drops with that

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.030 
so and it went two drops with that
insulated<00:03:04.640> door<00:03:04.879> on<00:03:05.209> there<00:03:06.200> tends<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.739> hold

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
insulated door on there tends to hold

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.890 
insulated door on there tends to hold
this<00:03:07.220> temperature<00:03:07.909> for<00:03:08.239> quite<00:03:08.659> some<00:03:08.870> time

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
this temperature for quite some time

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.599 
this temperature for quite some time
before<00:03:09.560> before<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.819> pump<00:03:11.060> comes<00:03:11.269> back<00:03:11.510> on<00:03:11.720> and

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
before before the pump comes back on and

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.180 
before before the pump comes back on and
wired<00:03:13.609> everything<00:03:14.299> up<00:03:14.599> see<00:03:15.379> if<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.620> kiki<00:03:16.069> is

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
wired everything up see if I kiki is

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.910 
wired everything up see if I kiki is
shot<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.760> back<00:03:16.940> here

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.570 

with<00:03:22.520> that<00:03:22.959> let's<00:03:23.959> just<00:03:24.200> think<00:03:24.490> that's<00:03:25.490> a

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
with that let's just think that's a

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.490 
with that let's just think that's a
computer<00:03:26.980> power<00:03:27.980> supply<00:03:28.520> and<00:03:29.260> converts<00:03:30.260> the

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
computer power supply and converts the

there<00:03:37.970> just<00:03:38.830> dropped<00:03:39.830> it<00:03:39.980> down<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.780> target

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
there just dropped it down to target

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.729 
there just dropped it down to target
temp<00:03:41.989> or<00:03:42.140> 70s<00:03:42.709> at<00:03:42.950> 69<00:03:43.520> so<00:03:43.790> just<00:03:44.030> shut<00:03:44.209> off

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
temp or 70s at 69 so just shut off

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.449 
temp or 70s at 69 so just shut off
actually<00:03:47.200> see<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.350> fan<00:03:48.590> just<00:03:48.890> trying<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.220> slow

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
actually see the fan just trying to slow

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.340 
actually see the fan just trying to slow
down<00:03:50.860> yeah

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350

this idea from a website i'll put on
there<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:08.090> northern<00:04:09.090> brewers<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.700> they<00:04:11.700> got

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880
