 telecaprisport.it 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.720
 authorization issued the first update 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.720
 software for google nexus one 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.750
 we really have a thing after the terminal state 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.930
 when they were superior in that 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.770
 thanks to this update we have many taxi tundra uses clematis a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.470
 gallery 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.670
 radio reception has been improved, we have more fluidity 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.380
 and many other '' small '' innovations make it even more so we say excellent 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.450
 terminal 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.520
 let's start right away with speed as soon as we can say that I installed 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.440
 official odnoklasniki and more 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.330
 modified bear and dog 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.560
 which will allow skin to then take advantage of all 512 megabytes of ram 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.000
 facebook &amp; lt all 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Galen nations as you see now are much more fluid 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.740
 we visited in verona for excellent 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.470
 translation 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.800
 the space 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.810
 very very fast 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.810
 go see the browser immediately 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.030
 Bookmarks 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.030

 you can see really fast hehe 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.540
 I voted 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.540
 improvement also in the browser in the sense that we now have 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.330
 scrolling and much more delicate 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.950
 you can see 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.630
 and we also have multitach music files there is really bad 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.839
 if we use halfon as a comparison, I really can't find any difference 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.959
 we can also clearly zoom in 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.449
 with the keys though 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:19.229
 multitach 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.829
 it's something else 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.090
 we go out laughing laughing maps 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.969
 also maps we have the possibility 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.340
 1 ... 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.279
 with the pc 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.209
 and held the same pic function 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.129
 everything is really very fast and very fast 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.540
 many guil maps have been updated 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.509
 Announcements 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:39.530
 only 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.530
 that we have calzaiuoli where we can choose 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.879
 traffic labels 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.939
 the button my position 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.849
 the comic buttons that allow us to 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.389
 call let's say 1 point of intersection finder per unit of 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.160
 true measure draw a line 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.370
 to calculate the distance between frames always set vs demi this map 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.430
 rt really 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.250
 1 of the garden I have to come to the gallery the gallery opens with a speed 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.250
 awesome you can see 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.019
 fast 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.019
 also this fantastic terminal game 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.399
 our 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.069
 the effect 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.759
 - image and here it is 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.509
 multitach as you see 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:32.529
 it's very harmonious in motion if it's really a really nice job 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.209
 the part 2 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.209
 within scrolling of images 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.759
 it's great 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:50.469
 let's go back see the whole is really a lot of instant keys we have 1 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:56.180
 miriam improvement also in the 4 buttons sofia staks but now they are 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.479
 much more reactive 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.479
 no pressure 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:04.499
 to say way much more easily that it gets to take a little bit earlier 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:05.520
 previous I'm 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.809
 I abandoned sultan engenes a problem 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:09.569
 - remained alone 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.999
 however, even here we see the speed score 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:13.499
 the 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:16.680
 webmail ikea dir a little awesome makes you smile 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.479
 how much free memory 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.909
 as you can see there are 26 processes 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:26.139
 and we have winning89 megavideo le 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.139
 really or really much faster 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.960
 do not laugh 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.960
 another application 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.559
 let's try with video 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.319
 maximum seriousness gurs 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:51.020
 atdi the photos of the save vs which is a degree so let's say research 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.650
 photo you just want to take a picture of an image 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.860
 eburnea will search on the internet 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.300
 let's see if that 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.729
 have disabled the history of however now received 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.189
 photo pro 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.679
 the usual camera remained unchanged 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.749
 fast shutter speed 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.849
 scary 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.490
 I think the focus however you see 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.990
 very very fast 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.659
 cinema to see 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.659
 in the settings menu capasso has it voice 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.020
 here it is 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.050
 as you see 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.509
 eh already prepared 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.939
 ter the new dock has been available for a few days 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.809
 in this case we hate it 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:41.449
 you have the possibility 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.449
 iva listen to the audio via the doc 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.979

 rt 27 and the modified kernel 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:06.099
 what to say I really am that if the spirits pull up because it was already excellent 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.169
 with this quick update it has become nothing short of 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.319
 perfect honestly me 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:17.559
 wrongly 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:20.789
 I go underage prostitutes who are released like this 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:21.750
 important 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.420
 even more stable chlorine is faster so it is entirely up to everyone 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.749
