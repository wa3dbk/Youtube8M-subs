00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.690
 from t-mobile and here you can see the new one 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.460
 product lineup of ValCOM we had 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.230
 yes you miss a few devices which 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.080
 tested and also shown and this 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.970
 year, there is now a completely new 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.529
 series of smartphones the biggest model 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.439
 Here it is soon at 8 13 8 13 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:31.050
 It has a 5 3 inch display with it 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.360
 a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.210
 The device is still with answer 40 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.329
 but should be equipped in the run or until 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.649
 to the launch also android 4 1 serbia 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.680
 get it working already now 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.550
 quite fast with the dual core processor 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.430
 from qualcomm 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.289
 who is installed you get four gigabytes 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.110
 internal memory and relies on 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.640
 a micro sd card will expand that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.820
 the second one gets here at first 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.170
 look must be such a Finnish 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.940
 Smartphone looks like the model 800 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.750
 that has the complete game here so it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.860
 is not as bright as the 8 already 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.810
 should be synonymous with a better 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.920
 I give a display with higher resolution 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.229
 want later in the year 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.420
 standard also here dual core processor 1 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.030
 2 gigahertz four gigabytes internal 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.500
 memory is dead 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:25.680
 it had a slightly better camera with 8 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:28.860
 megapixel the 1850 recommendation 298 298 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.530
 euro at 1 813 was the non-binding 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.810
 twitter its new middle class it was

 installed and via micro sd card 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.110
 expandable 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.140
 the camera also solves with 5 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.970
 mega pixels on interesting nor the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.299
 atmo which is installed here in the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.650
 smallest so its middle class in the 600th 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.680

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.410

 So that should be with all phones 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.290
 Good weather is coming and also very 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.180
 very important that I forgot it 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.530
 All smartphones are dual sim 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.630
