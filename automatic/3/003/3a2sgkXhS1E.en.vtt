00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.390
 ball of wool take the ball 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.980
 never 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.980
 take it fettuccina 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:12.699
 Kartinki 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.999
 and finally iron 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:16.779
 a sweater 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.980
 la5 a little space 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.109
 and the wires 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.710
 the second mysia 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.089
 at random, leaving a little space, the third mysia is inserted 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.229
 if this continues 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.229
 to get there now we are at 4 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.240
 ascn 5 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.020
 we still issue one because these are a test 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.620
 six jerseys 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.020
 but for a talking medium scarf 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.830
 20 never say 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.830
 then we take the other iron 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.920
 it's over 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.540
 to work 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.540
 how the normal desire doing. right then slips on 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.410
 the Jersey 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.440
 it continues 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.300
 to be enlarged 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.640
 id another maya 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.040
 fish 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.800
 and then the first stop 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.190
 infi 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.700
 on the shirt 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.880
 cleave some nice cool pig again 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.930
 to take away more hard rock 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.979
 in practice it is done 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.250
 the straight point 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.540
 always pinching the enlarged maya 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 and it goes on like this 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.060
 tucking 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.610
 at the beginning it is a bit difficult 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.190
 because we need to enlarge 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.190
 and at the same time thread the real. 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.050
 the text mesh 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.209
 you change carlo petrini does the same job 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.629
 slips into the mail 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.629
 the thread widens 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.279
 always more or less away 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.699
 I sell now at a distance 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.699
 Belgium more or less similar 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.439
 Yes 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.789
 and it goes on always doing so 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.179
 one point after another 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:24.730
 here it is 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.069
 begins to take shape 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.069
 it always goes on like this 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.539
 in a row 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.539
 the shirt always widens 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.559
 for those who always work a straight point of and among other things 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.099
 the point. well grant 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.489
 i'm at command 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.650
 begins to take shape 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.370
 to close 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.669
 lol the scarf 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.569
 Once a desired length scale is reached, it is done in this world 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:35.689
 always lined up in the first way 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:37.319
 it is cultivated 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.319
 not always the same way widening 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.370
 the first ever 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.110
 and on the iron 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.439
 last second 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:52.409
 always going forward in the study the same way always a network point 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.039
 behind the other 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.379
 we take the first shirt with the first iron on a white horse 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.059
 on the previous one 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:05.959
 institut as the usual sweaters are closed the straight links the 

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:09.330
 right closure of the knits worked with the irons 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.550
 the procedure is the same, the difficulty lies only in the 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.499
 always widen the thread as you work 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.710
 in this way 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.949
 always. right last movies 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.919
 then I create the second jersey 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.690
 I sell the first pig horse I do not take off from 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.639
 hour of knits worked straight 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.770
 labels you can no grief 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.400
 PoinX 

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:03.149
 mt-6 

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:07.830
 it remains 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.919
 one more shirt 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:13.919
 you take all the thread 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:17.659
 you turn it to forgiveness 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:22.009
 let's redo this step a little more complicated 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.559
 what a success 

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:33.999
 fishing techniques 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:35.569
 the Tyrrhenian Sea 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:37.409
 we invite 

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:38.720
 normal 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.669
 the first media 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.809
 then you do here I take the last one 

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:45.889
 x ray dog ​​all the 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:46.710
 wire 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.710
 I ride it all around the iron 

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.639
 so I make a straight shirt 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:08:01.189
 in this way a super super but a super maya the last iron 

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:05.749
 I always fish with the previous one 

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:08.879
 I create this mini shit 

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.599
 with scissors 

00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:12.569
 taio and face to the north o
