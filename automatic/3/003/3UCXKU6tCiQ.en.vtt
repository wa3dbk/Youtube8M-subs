00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.010
 At least an hour, man. Give it to us.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.040

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.329
 sponsored to earn a living being 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.420
 vital to unpredictable unpredictable by 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.740
 It 's important that you dedicate yourself too. 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.319
 to other activities 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.319
 learn other things because you can 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.219
 Yes, you have a future but you can not give 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:22.729
 in nothing 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.990
 skateboarding can be just fun 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.219
 physical activity right 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.189
 even the great skaters 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.520
 professionals who have succeeded in 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.380
 in the iscte were the guys who 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.569
 have developed their own brands not 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.369
 will only depend on 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.429
 sponsors were the guys who 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.609
 had an entrepreneurial spirit of 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.950
 manage a skateboarding company 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:50.039
 carlos sousa and jasiel you are 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.280
 teacher from which humans to skate board 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.249
 to the bone to English supervisor of 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.310
 guitar and now skateboarding on the internet 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.329
 there is big hug to my rescue 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.950
 you Carlos 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.350
 Let's go to the last question that did it 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.959
 it became available here murilo brito 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.170
 I wonder if you think chips 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.599
 from 8.0 upwards are bad to send 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.910
 flip maneuver and which marks you 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.069
 recommended face are not bad is issue 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.599
 adaptations are a bit heavier 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.940
 not always what is easier is better 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.800
 so if you can work the flip 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.540
 one more way there 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.239
 perfect will not be any problem 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.609
 It even gets wider is cool to 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.189
 transition to the handrail at the edge is 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.950
 pest rep is much better you learn 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.540
 develop sending flip maneuvers one 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.640
 shape wider than walking in chico 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.879
 of course it goes from each one in 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.920
 each has its own focus its taste and 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.170
 each one will choose what to do with 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.060
 expensive brands are diverse. 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.769
 brands if you can get a chip 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.349
 email is better 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.069
 that's right the guy talks a lot that 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.810
 summarizes are many questions I 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.810
