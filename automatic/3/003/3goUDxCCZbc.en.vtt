I promised you monster numbers I have
finally<00:00:33.360> come<00:00:33.540> through<00:00:33.600> sorry<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.559> taken<00:00:34.950> so

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
finally come through sorry it's taken so

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.729 
finally come through sorry it's taken so
long<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.000> together<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:37.140> there<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
long to get this together but there you

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.290 
long to get this together but there you
have<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.460> when<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.300> raid<00:00:39.600> together<00:00:40.079> eight<00:00:41.300> ocz

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
have it when you raid together eight ocz

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
of achieving 1.3 gigabytes per second

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.549 
of achieving 1.3 gigabytes per second
read<00:00:50.219> that's<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.329> sequential<00:00:51.809> read<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.440> it's

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
read that's a sequential read so it's

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.680 
read that's a sequential read so it's
not<00:00:52.739> all<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:52.980> indicative<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:54.120> performance

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
not all that indicative of performance

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.389 
not all that indicative of performance
but<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.020> still<00:00:55.260> quite<00:00:55.559> impressive

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
but it's still quite impressive

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.510 
but it's still quite impressive
now<00:00:56.730> bear<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.030> mind<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.600> did<00:00:57.809> promise<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.199> guys

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
now bear in mind I did promise you guys

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.830 
now bear in mind I did promise you guys
more<00:00:59.520> than<00:00:59.579> anything<00:00:59.760> else<00:01:00.180> more<00:01:00.449> than<00:01:00.510> one

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
more than anything else more than one

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.049 
more than anything else more than one

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
gigabyte per second read speeds so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.670 
gigabyte per second read speeds so
that's<00:01:03.239> what<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.660> optimized<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.559> my

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that's what I have optimized all of my

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.320 
that's what I have optimized all of my
grade<00:01:04.860> settings<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.150> our

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
grade settings for you can see if our

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.950 
grade settings for you can see if our

eight identical OCC vertex two drives

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.469 
eight identical OCC vertex two drives
here<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.619> they<00:01:11.220> are<00:01:11.280> running<00:01:11.549> very<00:01:11.970> randomly

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
here and they are running very randomly

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.420 
here and they are running very randomly
off<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> controller<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.159> I've<00:01:14.250> got

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
off of the controller here so I've got

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.550 
off of the controller here so I've got
these<00:01:14.580> long<00:01:14.820> cables<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.600> running<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.530> over

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
these long cables just running all over

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.210 
these long cables just running all over
the<00:01:16.860> place<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:17.780> yeah<00:01:18.810> bear<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.590> mind<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:20.189> I

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the place but yeah bear in mind like I

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.310 
the place but yeah bear in mind like I
said<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.580> could<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.119> optimizing<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.990> certain

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
said I could be optimizing for certain

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.249 
said I could be optimizing for certain
other<00:01:22.729> other<00:01:23.729> performance<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:25.170> I've

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
other other performance but what I've

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.200 
other other performance but what I've
really<00:01:25.650> gone<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.580> massive

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
really gone for here is massive

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.050 
really gone for here is massive
sequential<00:01:27.750> reads<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:29.310> has<00:01:29.490> finally<00:01:29.759> been

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
sequential reads and it has finally been

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.450 
sequential reads and it has finally been
achieved<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.049> comparison<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:32.369> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
achieved so just for comparison one of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.200 
achieved so just for comparison one of
these<00:01:32.579> SSDs<00:01:33.180> alone<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.840> capable<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.350> about<00:01:35.210> 260

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
these SSDs alone is capable of about 260

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.600 
these SSDs alone is capable of about 260
kick<00:01:36.720> megabytes<00:01:37.560> per<00:01:37.650> second<00:01:38.130> read<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
kick megabytes per second read and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.179 
kick megabytes per second read and
actually<00:01:38.909> hold<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.180> let<00:01:39.390> me<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:40.040> find<00:01:41.040> that

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
actually hold on let me just find that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.080 
actually hold on let me just find that
285<00:01:41.960> 285<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.740> pair<00:01:43.979> together<00:01:44.340> or<00:01:44.820> throw

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
285 285 so you pair together or throw

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.179 
285 285 so you pair together or throw
together<00:01:45.450> eight<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.320> we're<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:46.920> reaching

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
together eight and we're really reaching

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.700 
together eight and we're really reaching
the<00:01:47.880> maximum<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> raid<00:01:49.259> card<00:01:49.470> like

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the maximum of what a raid card like

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.800 
the maximum of what a raid card like
this<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.100> provide<00:01:50.399> which<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.180> actually<00:01:51.600> one

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
this can provide which is actually one

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.870 
this can provide which is actually one
of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.079> best<00:01:52.259> RAID<00:01:52.530> cards<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.310> market<00:01:53.729> in

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
of the best RAID cards on the market in

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.969 
of the best RAID cards on the market in
terms<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.509> SSD<00:01:54.869> performance<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.890> were

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
terms of SSD performance so if you were

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.639 
terms of SSD performance so if you were
using<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.310> lesser<00:01:56.640> raid<00:01:56.850> card<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.229> fact<00:01:58.409> okay

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
using a lesser raid card or in fact okay

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.289 
using a lesser raid card or in fact okay
why<00:01:58.799> don't<00:01:58.950> we<00:01:59.040> start<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.399> onboard<00:01:59.790> raid<00:02:00.180> if

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
why don't we start with onboard raid if

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.389 
why don't we start with onboard raid if
you're<00:02:00.420> using<00:02:00.570> onboard<00:02:00.840> raid<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.590> ich10r

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
you're using onboard raid that is ich10r

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.010 
you're using onboard raid that is ich10r

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
around 600 megabytes per second so

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.490

much<00:02:13.770> better<00:02:14.040> performance<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.730> doesn't

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
much better performance so it doesn't

raid cards will scale again better than
onboard<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.170> not<00:02:31.350> quite<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.860> well<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.310> this

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
onboard but not quite this well so this

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.010 
onboard but not quite this well so this
is<00:02:32.550> one<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> best<00:02:33.240> examples

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
is one of the best examples

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.860 
is one of the best examples

big thanks to LSI for helping us do this

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.830 
big thanks to LSI for helping us do this
little<00:02:37.430> demonstration<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.910> what<00:02:38.970> we<00:02:39.420> can<00:02:39.630> have

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
little demonstration of what we can have

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.860 
little demonstration of what we can have
in<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.380> future<00:02:40.410> if<00:02:41.180> storage<00:02:42.180> technology

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
in the future if storage technology

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.620 
in the future if storage technology
keeps<00:02:43.110> going<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.650> way<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.630> very

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
keeps going the way that it is very

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.230 
keeps going the way that it is very
impressive
