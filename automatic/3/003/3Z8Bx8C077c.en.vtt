00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.450
 added moment that we know each person that I think 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.340
 obviously I get the impression that you have played your part if you prefer 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.539
 talk about it so if each school enrolled 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.750
 the acer you in the house he says that because you all know the world 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.579
 whole knows my character knows my person 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.439
 It was very quiet. 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.519
 only that everything we were going to have a story pronoun not only by the mixture 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.630
 machel played I'm still in São Paulo to play soccer 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.370
 I play and I confirm that the game 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.330
 If I'm on the field I'm going to work. 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.520
 and I'll do my best in the field 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.560
 and there is a moment that I felt good with the mirrado and until my opinion the 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.570
 consent for not having entered a game that I could 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.729
 Do something 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.700
 inside the field and you there in the bank 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.040
 the cold and you stay in that situation without being able to help the 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.040
 fellows I love you my right to speak for feeling humiliated this is a 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.840
 My thing that I felt helsinki 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.990
 This does not have to come from the take but the supply of what I said this is a 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.829
 my right 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.170
 I say this the moment I stand on the bench in the cold to see my team lose and 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.110
 You can not do anything. It's sad. It's humiliating and I felt better than that. 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.250
 what happened this the paulo ahead with you are there the game was 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.040
 televised and saw that it was a shame not to be missed with all due respect 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.830
 pottery 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530
 We are São Paulo 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.370
 and we have everything to achieve this classification 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.790
 The easiest way I've never even seen 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.730
 and I got back to the liberators then and I was sad I cried time I cried 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.890
 into the locker room and cried because 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.890
 It's time that he's safe. I do not have cheap blood. 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.640
 you vent your opinion and I you are there all 3 4 I left training and 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.840
 dedicating myself 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.570
 O 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.570
 but you need experienced players 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.330
 you need 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.490
 because the takita rogério experienced he was in the ball kelly so he is a 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.740
 great goalkeeper that he is 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.990
 how many other clubs have out there and experienced singers for 35 36 years 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.160
 john white and I have conditions to be playing 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.740
 I've never hurt myself and torben thanks to God on the ground I have nothing 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.760
 against him he does his job that I am doing my job only that I 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.210
 I'm sad when I do not know the portland 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.850
 diego appears the opportunity now 3 to 1 take the moment of I enter there not 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.139
 I went in then I was very sad about this situation 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.969
 Leave it till 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.799
 For the future, a complicated situation for the two of you to remain. 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.269
 because each one put their point of view and was misinterpreted 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.289
 It's difficult for you to stay in the same environment. 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:35.019
 making a light opposition say what is going to happen is I have my 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.910
 contract I hope to fulfill my contract because all the time in the fans are paulo 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.010
 the affection that São Paulo fans are going with me is motivating me to train 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.130
 to play so I want to fulfill my contract in são paulo I have tatto ter 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.820
 a huge affection for São Paulo for this Italian crowd I'm sorry 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.639
 I played a minute 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.589
 but I feel on the skin that I never asked for I am a winning player and when the 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.809
 top-10 or a title of flying like this from nowhere 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.479
 It hurt me a lot because in every club I went I was champion and I 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:06.419
 I did not come to Sao Paulo to walk, not to stay. 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.609
 All the time in the bank there for the people who set fire to me, I did not come to play. 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.729
 If opportunity appears to play 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.389
 so I'm sad I'm a winning player where I've spent all mine 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.859
 career and confiscation conquered title 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.849
 and it is not here that I that I will not conquer so I become sad it was Roman 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:23.969
 was from 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.549
 at the moment if you can not help with your club it is difficult then 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.889
 This makes us nervous, I stayed 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.330
 out of me and I'm very quiet but there's an hour 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.470
 I the cat or cat is counting on this title already blocks we know 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.289
 respecting the other teams 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:44.309
 but we know that são paulo with the players that have the cast that has 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.919
 he deserved to reach the final the whole relationship is that of the player from são paulo 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.239
 generally 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.079
 with carpegiani is good the real adjustment I can not tell you right 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.799
 I'm talking about my situation, he's not happy. 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.039
 happy are players who get nowhere 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:05.119
 The player who is in the bank has to be sad, he has to be disgusted. 

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:08.249
 What I need opportunity to play 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:11.889
 This and I, I know where I've been, I've always played. 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.129
 despite the 39 years I have 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.130
 lots of firewood to burn yet because I trust I work I do training 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.019
 that everyone does and I have the condition of being able to play 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.430
 until I play badly to be criticized but it's s 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.220
 It's skiing thing that happens in football as anyone could get 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.900
 there and playing bad I'm not I do not have that player I'm not that player 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.050
 our the lucas who has the speed of lucas 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.550
 but you put the ball in the foot 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.440
 where I want in the terminal and we saw there who was the best player of the match 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.139
 against the saints before são paulo 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.629
 the claws then the charge made in the game 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:46.830
 a lousy 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.810
 his game in the game that tranquility all play a metabolic hurley or 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.580
 You or Dóôdo Dôglas's function because he knows how to play football 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.740
 of course I will be pulling the other after I have résumé in front of the players 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.229
 everyone 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.610
 make a bow you now have a detail 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.589
 the players had podium this year blew out 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.249
 after so many complaints against the coach 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:14.689
 you are the players spokesperson by an individual position 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.599
 no I can not I can not talk to the players I speak my 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.849
 situation for each player 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.379
 in his coach's opinion this is a thing of each of each player ne 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.550
 and I did not give 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.669
 nothing against the coach only sometimes and for not having played for the 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.159
 situation of the game and being eliminated is sad 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.430
 and I'm pretty upset that it was deleted 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.460
 It's difficult, I heard where I went I was a champion and I heard it very easy. 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.610
 this reaction to the arrival at a final in which Eliana heard that they are 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.610
 group that was trying to reach a final 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.370
 you try to move away 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.759
 other detail 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.070
 already comes suddenly the influence of the opinion of the fans 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.630
 No, I do not know why I'm not saying anything. 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.090
 she gets away from the saucer of sao paulo so do not think it's to each of each 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.039
 player has 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.710
 tense to ap 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.750
 your opinion to speak in this sector in the bank and did not enter and I feel 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.150
 humiliated for not having played better my opinion each one has an opinion 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.490
 that nothing has your opinion every player 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.349
 Who razed opinion right? 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:20.880
 So 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.040
 That is 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.249
 It's bad bad and I'm not here for the beach. 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:27.869
 Ah, speak for the players, I'll speak for myself. 

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:32.279
 What beauty had times when you live such a situation in your career? 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.469
 and it's not 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.849
 of your profile make statements as blunt as 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.400
 extra psychological may even cause damon 

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:45.199
 now in case there is in oracle history has already been 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.059
 It was already built on it, it's normal. My master was already built. 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:53.259
 only now it was sad for me to stay in the bank gave of são paulo to be 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:55.169
 disqualified so this is it 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:56.479
 I'm going to stay a little 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.499
 revolted with this sum will already more staining my wife's story and 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:02.229
 I think everyone knows the story. 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:05.309
 that moment that will stain the story for saying that I wanted to 

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:06.189
 have played 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:10.150
 The player has to say that he wants to play the player. 

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:13.189
 not only play paternal you have to devote 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.769
 So
