can see the cylinder head before this is
pretty<00:00:49.079> indicative<00:00:49.470> of<00:00:49.650> what<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.920> see

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
pretty indicative of what we see

that<00:00:58.290> I<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> stress<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:58.949> when<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.550> an

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that I like to stress is when we do an

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.180 
that I like to stress is when we do an
engine<00:01:00.000> rebuild<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.680> do<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> true

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
engine rebuild like this we do a true

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
engine rebuild like this we do a true
rebuild<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.359> take<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.690> down<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
rebuild and we actually take it down and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.810 
rebuild and we actually take it down and
cleanliness<00:01:04.259> is<00:01:04.739> event<00:01:05.070> most<00:01:05.309> importance

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
cleanliness is event most importance

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.010

I mean here with a little bit further

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.320 
I mean here with a little bit further
exploration<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.850> what<00:01:11.850> we've<00:01:12.000> done<00:01:12.149> is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
exploration of this what we've done is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.389 
exploration of this what we've done is
disassembled<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.110> engine<00:01:13.410> completely<00:01:13.979> it's

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
disassembled this engine completely it's

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.279 
disassembled this engine completely it's
down<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.030> bare<00:01:15.240> bones<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:15.960> wanted<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
down to the bare bones and we wanted to

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:17.749 
down to the bare bones and we wanted to
get<00:01:16.410> inside<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.950> make<00:01:17.100> sure<00:01:17.220> everything<00:01:17.670> is

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
get inside and make sure everything is

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.520

correct<00:01:18.149> and<00:01:18.360> again<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.840> rebuild<00:01:19.320> means

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
correct and again a rebuild means

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.639 
correct and again a rebuild means

to get painted these parts will be
silver<00:01:44.819> as<00:01:45.660> they<00:01:45.840> were<00:01:45.989> originally<00:01:46.560> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
have to do this move down here we've got

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.290 
have to do this move down here we've got
a<00:02:26.280> few<00:02:26.370> parts<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.940> are<00:02:27.000> going<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.150> get

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
a few parts that are going to get

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.030 
a few parts that are going to get
polished<00:02:27.750> right<00:02:28.050> now<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.260> old<00:02:28.470> clear<00:02:28.680> coat<00:02:28.920> is

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
polished right now the old clear coat is

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.860 
polished right now the old clear coat is
yellowed<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:29.550> them<00:02:29.730> they<00:02:30.000> have<00:02:30.180> been<00:02:30.420> washed

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870

yellowed on them they have been washed
and<00:02:31.080> cleaned<00:02:31.489> so<00:02:32.489> once<00:02:33.209> they're<00:02:33.560> effectively

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
and cleaned so once they're effectively

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.200 
and cleaned so once they're effectively
smoothed<00:02:34.980> out<00:02:35.190> we'll<00:02:35.400> get<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.580> few<00:02:35.760> Nicks<00:02:36.030> out

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
smoothed out we'll get a few Nicks out

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.910 
smoothed out we'll get a few Nicks out
of<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.450> will<00:02:36.690> polish<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.080> aluminum<00:02:37.620> down<00:02:37.740> to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
of this will polish the aluminum down to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.590 
of this will polish the aluminum down to
the<00:02:38.010> point<00:02:38.190> where<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.580> perfect<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.420> nice

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the point where it's perfect and nice

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.430 
the point where it's perfect and nice
and<00:02:39.780> shiny<00:02:39.960> again

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
and shiny again

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.040 
and shiny again
and<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.490> will<00:02:41.550> cover<00:02:41.760> those<00:02:42.000> parts<00:02:42.420> we

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
and so that will cover those parts we

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.390 
and so that will cover those parts we
move<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.350> over<00:02:43.530> here<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:44.160> see<00:02:44.310> the

one<00:02:54.840> thing<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.080> bears<00:02:55.410> noting<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.950> these

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
one thing that bears noting on these

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.760 
one thing that bears noting on these
particularly<00:02:57.210> on<00:02:57.330> Honda's<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.170> many<00:02:58.590> other

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
particularly on Honda's and many other

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.340 
particularly on Honda's and many other
Japanese<00:02:59.250> manufacturers<00:02:59.940> as<00:03:00.120> well<00:03:00.300> is<00:03:00.600> that

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
Japanese manufacturers as well is that

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.260 
Japanese manufacturers as well is that
these<00:03:01.620> bearings<00:03:02.040> are<00:03:02.220> selective<00:03:02.790> which<00:03:03.030> means

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
these bearings are selective which means

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.940 
these bearings are selective which means
you<00:03:03.360> can't<00:03:03.570> just<00:03:03.750> take<00:03:03.900> one<00:03:04.140> bearing<00:03:04.500> throw<00:03:04.860> it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
you can't just take one bearing throw it

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.560 
you can't just take one bearing throw it
in<00:03:05.070> there<00:03:05.220> out<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.430> another<00:03:05.610> motor<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.180> do

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
in there out of another motor and do

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.700 
in there out of another motor and do
that<00:03:06.720> because<00:03:06.930> they<00:03:07.200> won't<00:03:07.320> work<00:03:07.530> together

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
that because they won't work together

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.340 
that because they won't work together
these<00:03:08.490> are<00:03:08.550> various<00:03:09.210> sizes<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.750> things<00:03:10.110> for

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
these are various sizes and things for

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.050 
these are various sizes and things for
machining<00:03:10.770> in<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.160> factory<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.790> they<00:03:11.880> need

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
machining in the factory and they need

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.090 
machining in the factory and they need
to<00:03:12.150> be<00:03:12.270> properly<00:03:12.540> done<00:03:12.990> just<00:03:13.710> a<00:03:13.770> little<00:03:13.980> nuance

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
to be properly done just a little nuance

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.820 
to be properly done just a little nuance
but<00:03:14.490> it<00:03:14.580> has<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.850> be<00:03:14.970> right<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.680> these<00:03:16.770> are

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
but it has to be right so and these are

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.830
