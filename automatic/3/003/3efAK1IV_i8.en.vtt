00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.860
 'we play league of legends for fun 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.320
 and it's usually more fun when 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.269
 we won it takes quite a lot to be successful in lol 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.639
 the games are won with more than 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.290
 individual skill and reflexes your 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.060
 ability to coordinate as a team 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.770
 has a significant impact on the 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.680
 result of a game in fact the 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.609
 games is respectful they earn 1.7 million 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.619
 of games more than average players 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.689
 the fellowship was a bigger role in 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.629
 lic of what you imagine we see more of 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.010
 close how your game can impact 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.720
 let's say you start playing and at the beginning 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.460
 one of your classmates dies a couple of 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.170
 times before you find out you 're 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.239
 doing a tantrum now you have a 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.760
 option for is to act as a child of five 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.220
 years screaming whining and kicking 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.140
 because of course that will help improve the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.790
 situation because some players do not 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.220
 understand is that the epic comebacks 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.199
 they do not come from rebuking your classmates 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.659
 anger in new games 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.089
 every negative player in the reduces your 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.860
 opportunities to earn 54% 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:07.350
 probability of victory without anger 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.350
 goes down 46% with 3 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.090
 then more sense to focus on winning 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.220
 help your buddy shopping sentinels 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.260
 Concentrate on your lane and avoid 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.490
 personalities collide in the chat the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.619
 games that keep your team 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.420
 focused players earn more than 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.970
 fight fire with fire ruin their 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.000
 opportunities to win sportsmanship and 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.830
 fellowship win games the impact 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.380
 of companionship can be observed in 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.540
 You just have to watch the oven 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.790
 our studies reveal a relationship 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.250
 between the attitude of a team and the gold 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.660
 that you can get in a game in 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.940
 this case things go down 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.740
 after an ambush fails a 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.869
 player decides that the other is a lobby 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.940
 exits control meanwhile 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.039
 another team stays focused what 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.070
 means that they can take more goals 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.200
 objectives more gold plus gold plus objects 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.869
 unnecessarily large more objects 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.399
 unnecessarily large more and if the 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.530
 power of companionship can be 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.229
 identified at the individual level 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.000
 positive players win 10% more games 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.619
 that the average player 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.290
 On the other hand, players with a 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.720
 negative history earn 35% less 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.360
 games 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.530
 It is very clear which teams are supported 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.990
 in adversity they have more 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.880
 opportunities to win then the 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.580
 next time you look is to win in link 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.580
 just remember fellowship or see
