is out of dr. Salim's control meaning

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.300 
is out of dr. Salim's control meaning
he'll<00:02:24.659> have<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.989> use<00:02:25.140> physical<00:02:25.650> restraints<00:02:26.159> to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
he'll have to use physical restraints to

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.670 
he'll have to use physical restraints to
keep<00:02:26.579> them<00:02:26.790> down<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:28.019> they<00:02:28.049> don't<00:02:28.349> move<00:02:28.530> around

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
say here in the first snapchat was this

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.839 
say here in the first snapchat was this
very<00:02:45.870> weird<00:02:46.439> kind<00:02:46.859> of<00:02:46.950> high-pitched<00:02:47.129> sound<00:02:47.700> in

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
very weird kind of high-pitched sound in

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.369 
very weird kind of high-pitched sound in
the<00:02:47.970> background<00:02:48.120> whilst<00:02:48.629> dr.<00:02:48.989> Salim<00:02:49.260> was

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
talking now in previous snapchats weird

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.720 
talking now in previous snapchats weird
sounds<00:02:52.379> in<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.530> background<00:02:52.560> relate<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.549> an

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
actual image that we can get from a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.349 
actual image that we can get from a
spectrogram<00:02:55.859> we<00:02:56.250> had<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> previous<00:02:56.730> hidden

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359

spectrogram we had a previous hidden
image<00:02:57.719> which<00:02:58.139> I<00:02:58.260> made<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.409> video<00:02:58.560> about<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.919> few

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
image which I made a video about a few

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.319 
image which I made a video about a few
days<00:02:59.280> ago<00:02:59.430> which<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.819> really<00:03:00.060> really<00:03:00.209> exciting

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
days ago which is really really exciting

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.869 
days ago which is really really exciting
and<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:01.409> a<00:03:01.560> brand<00:03:01.919> new<00:03:02.189> hidden<00:03:02.489> image

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
and we have a brand new hidden image

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.240 
and we have a brand new hidden image
here<00:03:03.150> now<00:03:03.629> on<00:03:03.870> screen<00:03:04.290> probably<00:03:04.829> makes<00:03:05.099> no

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
here now on screen probably makes no

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.500 
here now on screen probably makes no
sense<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.669> just<00:03:05.819> looks<00:03:05.939> like<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.120> bunch<00:03:06.329> of

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
sense it just looks like a bunch of

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.319 
sense it just looks like a bunch of
squares<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.799> actually<00:03:08.280> Pigpen<00:03:08.909> this<00:03:09.209> is

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
squares this is actually Pigpen this is

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.990 
squares this is actually Pigpen this is
actually<00:03:09.659> a<00:03:09.689> cipher<00:03:10.200> language<00:03:10.620> used<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.519> kind

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
actually a cipher language used to kind

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.300 
actually a cipher language used to kind
of<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.209> know<00:03:12.239> decrypt<00:03:13.079> messages<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.889> it's

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
of you know decrypt messages and it's

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.619 
of you know decrypt messages and it's
just<00:03:14.459> another<00:03:14.700> way<00:03:14.819> for<00:03:14.939> people<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.450> send

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
just another way for people to send
