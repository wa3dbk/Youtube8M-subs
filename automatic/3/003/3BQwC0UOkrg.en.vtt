00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 targati and welcome back on the channel aaron 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.190
 manager this video is a video of 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.309
 reply to a paragraph written by 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.780
 italian you italian body appeared yesterday 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.460
 evening this morning on my group since 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.220
 titolo made me smile for a moment 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.350
 the title was in fact to become big 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.869
 you need to count calories 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.060
 here too the premise a little questionable 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.140
 but the gist of the speech in practice 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.330
 was this 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.500
 the author who seems to talk about nature 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.689
 body building 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.710
 in short, he said that it makes no sense to count 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.450
 calories garim akros but I am brought 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.610
 for example for example of john wray 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.899
 hence the genetic monster of Olympia 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.280
 I think it's a unique physicality in the world 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.629
 saying as he did in the period 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.160
 rimassa not counted calories but if 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.860
 look in the mirror according to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.510
 impressions then decided if it was seen 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.879
 too soft to lower i 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.230
 carbohydrates here too carbohydrates 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.960
 in short, demonized 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.660
 or if you could see well of the two of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.920
 increase calories because in short 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.750
 there were reserves the body had 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:14.070
 need more calories and then talked 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.030
 precisely to suggest to the boys to do 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.310
 the same thing as not counting calories 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.259
 macros but in short, beware 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.150
 simply the mirror during one 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.590
 bulk phase so try to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.210
 imagine of you now 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.189
 the sixteen year old who knows nothing about 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.570
 feeding does not know what it eats 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.240
 from morning to night he doesn't know what they are 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.920
 macros knows nothing about bodybuilding 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.119
 who does not know his body does not 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.970
 know the action of his metabolism 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.549
 which evaluates its mass period 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.700
 looking at myself in the mirror I see 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.439
 big arms full 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.820
 perhaps increase the calories then 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.210
 obviously it degenerates then in the famous ones 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.780
 dirty masses where kg kg accumulates 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.719
 of fat and then in short to pull yourself up or 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.490
 to be defined in summer or for a race 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.409
 it takes months and months or if yes 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.030
 wants to do it very quickly 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.929
 inevitably, there is also a loss 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.120
 always lean mass if we talk 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.810
 as I hope of natural bodybuilding e 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.250
 so in short I don't think it's the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.540
 right message to give to young people 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.790
 first of all 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.500
 shaun ray will have said this but it was 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.500
 followed also by a team of doctors e 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.569
 preparers who counted his own 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.609
 macro nutrients during the day of 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.959
 period of the 90s 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.599
 I don't know if you've seen any videos of 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.180
 luigi gasparri and how manic he was 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.969
 he too in macro counting 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.579
 if you want lip science the speech of the 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.290
 clean food or dirty food that is also 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.829
 the author of italian boy 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.980
 in short, it refers to a moment that was born 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.629
 at that time where he knew that 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.519
 vole builders had to eat alone 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.260
 those 56 foods while all the others 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.780
 therefore not considered as food vents 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.840
 in mass, pounds and pounds and pounds of rice 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.180
 until it gets out of your ears and in short 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.349
 without counting calories without anything 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.319
 now I am for a flexible approach 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.000
 to the diet especially as far as 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.889
 regards the sustainability of the diet 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.739
 as a food style as I said more 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.930
 sometimes not as a restriction period 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.739
 like the slimming film clinic of 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.530
 so I imagine these too 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.359
 sixteen year old kids who hear these 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.340
 they read these messages 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:32.180
 and then I believe in short that to become 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.590
 big need to swallow pounds and pounds 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.459
 of calories from morning to night 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.629
 absolutely flexible approach 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.099
 sustainable diet especially for 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.040
 avoid this not especially for 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:46.430
 avoiding the distinction is the absurdity if 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.189
 you want clean food of dirty food 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.939
 in short, think of a boy who does 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.259
 eat only 56 foods for years 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.269
 inevitably it will then come to do the 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:59.959
 so-called citm il poi to eat 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.509
 they always said not a cookie but a 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.650
 whole package of biscuits then a 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:06.500
 approach to diet and 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.000
 sustainable for this and then they are 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.799
 of very good agreement also on the speech that 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.540
 obviously like all things there 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.879
 extremisms are really easy 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.880
 condemn extremism to stick to 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.620
 that but it doesn't make sense to do everything 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.139
 an herb a bundle so I too am 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.330
 against or at least condemning who 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.120
 becomes manic in the count of 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.939
 macros so if it does not reach the altitude 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.330
 Protein coffee is no longer anabolic 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:35.400
 or if I don't eat todt carbohydrates too 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.900
 there hot in catabolism on these are 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.029
 absurdities that are not part of 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.310
 of the principles of flexible diet 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.580
 sustainable 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.430
 should not as usual not 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.189
 take sides on one side or the other but 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.229
 always see the middle ground that it seems 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:58.080
 the right way for example for how much 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.240
 regards the undersigned use la 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.830
 flexible diet or otherwise the approach 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.289
 flexible judgment macros 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.819
 mainly when I travel and not 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.250
 I eat what I usually eat 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.930
 because I challenge anyone except those who 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.069
 travel every day they do all 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.779
 spend the day away from home 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:20.759
 for better or worse they are eaten more or less 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:22.849
 same things I do not say the usual foods but if 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.529
 in the first months in the first weeks 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.529
 you know how many the caloric intake of 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:31.740
 macros of a rice dish with del 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:34.289
 chicken with special sauce 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.810
 end in short, repeat that dish on 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.699
 next day or during the week 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.009
 You do not have to stand there with 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.310
 calculator to calculate macros if each 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.139
 once more or less do you have those who are i 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.469
 your typical dishes or those for 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:52.229
 usually save and then you have 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:53.939
 more or less an idea of ​​macros without having to 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:58.159
 bring the calculator once 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:06:00.930
 therefore in short I condemn these messages 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:03.270
 where it is said that counting calories does not 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.219
 need or count macros if not needed 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.899
 serves serves as especially for 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:11.310
 become anabolic or to prepare for 

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:16.229
 a period of caloric deficit like 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.789
 think of doing if you don't have it 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.139
 an idea of ​​what your take 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:24.060
 caloric and that of caloric expenditure 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:25.229
 to lose weight to lose fat or to put 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.479
 on muscle mass 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.849
 will follow only the mirror and trust 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.339
 if you are not a competitive athlete with one 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.940
 certain experience that they went to do 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:36.430
 races on races 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.280
 you can't look at yourself in the mirror 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.920
 understand if you were actually putting it 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.920
 on lean mass or if you are losing 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.600
 fat rather than muscle is very likely 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.030
 instead of simply relying on 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.370
 your inexperienced eye looking at you 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.190
 mirror and see big when you put on 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.110
 on a lot of fat it is however more defined 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.820
 when you are already too late 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.150
 you are already losing fine muscle mass 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:03.430
 then we know that even the click omits the 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.320
 scale hangs metric are not methods 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.460
 excellent for evaluating the composition 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.640
 corporeal 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:12.190
 you need to do a dexa board pod 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.500
 so leave the eye if you want to 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.480
 olympian champions that I repeat yes 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.550
 they entrust the eye but also to a team 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.700
 of doctors of chef preparers who 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.170
 prepare their meals to perfection and to the al 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.350
 macro 

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:29.020
 in short, look for a moment to use 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.870
 a slight surplus caloric surplus 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:35.140
 during the mass phase and a slight one 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.930
 gradual calorie deficit in the phase of 

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.490
 short definition of that draw 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.960
 call you 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.650
 well this is all I greet you at 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.650
 next hello
