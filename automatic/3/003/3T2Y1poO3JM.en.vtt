00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
best shield in the world but this this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.100 
best shield in the world but this this
will<00:01:46.829> work<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:48.180> covers<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> entire<00:01:48.869> valley

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
will work the covers the entire valley

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.710 
will work the covers the entire valley
or<00:01:49.259> most<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.670> will<00:01:50.820> work<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.270> any

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720

type<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> plastic<00:01:52.950> top<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.640> work<00:01:53.850> this

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
type of plastic top would work this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.639 
type of plastic top would work this
thing<00:01:55.020> over<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.070> use<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
thing over here which I use for the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.060 
thing over here which I use for the
firing<00:01:58.649> tests<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.969> nerf<00:02:00.229> yeah<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.950> would<00:02:02.040> be

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
firing tests for nerf yeah that would be

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.429 
firing tests for nerf yeah that would be
perfect<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.880> little<00:02:03.780> bit<00:02:03.869> wider<00:02:04.020> than<00:02:04.320> this

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
perfect to a little bit wider than this

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.980 
perfect to a little bit wider than this
but<00:02:04.680> whatever<00:02:05.360> like<00:02:06.360> i<00:02:06.450> said<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.689> baseball

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
but whatever like i said the baseball

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.529 
but whatever like i said the baseball
bat<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.439> club<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:08.179> don't<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> helmet

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
bat for the club I don't have a helmet

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.839 
bat for the club I don't have a helmet
that<00:02:09.750> would<00:02:10.020> work<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:10.950> um<00:02:11.160> if<00:02:11.700> I

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
that would work with this but um if I

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.040 
that would work with this but um if I
did<00:02:12.030> find<00:02:12.330> one

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
did find one

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.470 
did find one
oh<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.710> probably<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.400> an<00:02:14.520> update<00:02:14.790> video<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.300> that

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
oh I probably do an update video on that

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.460 
oh I probably do an update video on that
but<00:02:15.870> whatever<00:02:17.120> this<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.240> how<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.080> how<00:02:19.110> to

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
but whatever this is how this is how to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.820 
but whatever this is how this is how to
