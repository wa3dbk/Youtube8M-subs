so<00:00:07.439> in<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:07.680> example<00:00:08.099> we'll<00:00:08.400> be<00:00:08.430> looking<00:00:08.519> at

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:08.969 
so in this example we'll be looking at

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.449 
so in this example we'll be looking at
Minogue<00:00:09.389> growth<00:00:09.780> kinetics<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.799> the<00:00:11.160> problem

Minogue growth kinetics and the problem

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:13.430 
Minogue growth kinetics and the problem
statement<00:00:11.879> is<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:12.930> wanted<00:00:13.230> to

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
statement is that if we wanted to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.910 
statement is that if we wanted to
produce<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.920> recombinant<00:00:14.400> protein<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.299> coli

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
produce a recombinant protein and a coli

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.580

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
we have to wait for us to reach this

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.509 
we have to wait for us to reach this
cell<00:00:24.869> density<00:00:25.140> if<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.830> started<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.369> an

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.820 
concentration of 100 grams per liter and
we<00:00:35.610> know<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.089> for<00:00:36.480> e.coli<00:00:37.170> growth<00:00:37.559> on

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
we know that for e.coli growth on

we know that for e.coli growth on

glucose new max is 1.3 inverse hours KS

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.459 
glucose new max is 1.3 inverse hours KS
the<00:00:43.500> KS<00:00:43.950> constant<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.690> 2.2<00:00:45.690> e<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> negative

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the KS constant is 2.2 e to the negative

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.270 
the KS constant is 2.2 e to the negative
5<00:00:46.860> grams<00:00:47.250> per<00:00:47.550> liter<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:48.809> death<00:00:49.350> constant<00:00:50.039> is

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
5 grams per liter the death constant is

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.990 
5 grams per liter the death constant is
point<00:00:51.059> zero<00:00:51.690> 2<00:00:51.809> inverse<00:00:52.440> hours<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.640> we're

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
point zero 2 inverse hours and we're

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.330 
point zero 2 inverse hours and we're
going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> assume<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.649> one<00:00:55.649> cell<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
going to assume that one cell is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.060 
going to assume that one cell is
approximately<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.180> nanogram<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:58.199> cellular

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
approximately one nanogram of cellular

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.840 
approximately one nanogram of cellular
mass

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.830 

so<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> first<00:01:06.180> thing<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> we're<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.780> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so the first thing that we're going to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.800 
so the first thing that we're going to
do<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.409> write<00:01:08.340> mole<00:01:08.820> balances<00:01:09.619> for<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
do is write mole balances for the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.649 
do is write mole balances for the
concentration<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.080> cells<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.710> substrate<00:01:14.659> so

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
concentration of cells and substrate so

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.090 
concentration of cells and substrate so
for<00:01:16.020> our<00:01:16.200> cells

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
for our cells

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.490 
for our cells
we're<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:18.479> change<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
we're going to have a change in a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.969 
we're going to have a change in a
concentration<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.430> cells<00:01:20.810> over<00:01:21.810> time<00:01:22.110> since

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
concentration of cells over time since

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.340 
concentration of cells over time since
we're<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.280> batch<00:01:23.490> reactor<00:01:23.960> is<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.289> be

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
we're in a batch reactor is going to be

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.630 
we're in a batch reactor is going to be
equal<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> rate<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.580> growth<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.539> ourselves

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
equal to the rate of growth of ourselves

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.630 
equal to the rate of growth of ourselves
minus<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.030> rate<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.840> death<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.710> ourselves<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
minus the rate of death of ourselves and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.040 
minus the rate of death of ourselves and
so<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:34.170> our<00:01:34.289> substrate<00:01:35.179> the<00:01:36.179> change<00:01:36.539> in<00:01:36.899> the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
so for our substrate the change in the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.180 
so for our substrate the change in the
concentration<00:01:37.759> per<00:01:38.759> time<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.990> equal<00:01:40.229> to

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
concentration per time will be equal to

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.380 
concentration per time will be equal to
the<00:01:42.179> negative<00:01:42.509> rate<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.729> growth<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.970> our<00:01:45.090> cells

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the negative rate of growth of our cells

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.710 
the negative rate of growth of our cells
and<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.409> now<00:01:46.560> second<00:01:47.039> we're<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.240> define

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
and so now second we're going to define

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.539 
and so now second we're going to define
our<00:01:49.490> rate<00:01:50.490> law<00:01:50.990> expressions<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.530> for<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.399> node

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
our rate law expressions and for my node

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.020 
our rate law expressions and for my node
growth<00:01:53.909> kinetics<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:55.799> rate<00:01:55.830> of<00:01:56.429> growth<00:01:56.700> is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
growth kinetics the rate of growth is

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.399 
growth kinetics the rate of growth is
equal<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.929> MU<00:01:58.380> maps<00:01:59.360> times<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.630> concentration

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
equal to MU maps times the concentration

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.770 
equal to MU maps times the concentration
of<00:02:01.530> substrate<00:02:01.819> times<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:02.970> concentration<00:02:03.659> of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
of substrate times the concentration of

cells over the constant K yes plus the
concentration<00:02:10.019> of<00:02:10.829> our<00:02:11.160> substrate<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
concentration of our substrate and the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.349 
concentration of our substrate and the
rate<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:14.060> death<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.480> equal<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:17.359> death

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
rate of death is equal to the death

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.860 
rate of death is equal to the death
constant<00:02:19.109> times<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.600> concentration<00:02:21.600> of

constant times the concentration of

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.610 
constant times the concentration of
cells<00:02:22.609> so<00:02:23.609> third<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:24.750> need<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.959> calculate<00:02:25.850> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
cells so third we need to calculate the

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.940

and<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.640> desired<00:02:32.970> concentration<00:02:33.750> based<00:02:34.650> off

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
and the desired concentration based off

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.030 
and the desired concentration based off
of<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.280> mass<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:35.910> assumed<00:02:36.239> per<00:02:36.690> cell<00:02:37.040> so

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
of the mass that we assumed per cell so

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.830 
of the mass that we assumed per cell so
our<00:02:38.489> initial<00:02:39.359> cell<00:02:40.079> concentration<00:02:40.859> in<00:02:41.220> grams

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
our initial cell concentration in grams

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.030 
our initial cell concentration in grams
per<00:02:42.840> liter<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:44.190> going<00:02:44.549> to<00:02:44.640> be<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:46.040> 10,000

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
per liter is going to be the 10,000

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.280 
per liter is going to be the 10,000
cells<00:02:47.579> per<00:02:48.000> liter<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.690> started<00:02:49.109> with

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290

times one nanogram per cell and then to

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.650 
times one nanogram per cell and then to
get<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.190> grams<00:02:56.430> per<00:02:56.640> liter<00:02:57.030> we're<00:02:57.540> gonna

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
get it in grams per liter we're gonna

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.069 
get it in grams per liter we're gonna
have<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.260> one<00:02:58.470> gram<00:02:59.209> is<00:03:00.209> 10<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.889> ninth
