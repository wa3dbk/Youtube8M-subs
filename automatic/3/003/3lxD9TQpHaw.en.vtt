assistant Lynne hello I'm healthy so

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.039 
assistant Lynne hello I'm healthy so
we're<00:00:15.030> setting<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.450> up<00:00:15.599> we're<00:00:15.780> gonna<00:00:15.900> be

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
we're setting this up we're gonna be

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.210 
we're setting this up we're gonna be
using<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> course<00:00:16.619> tomorrow<00:00:16.859> with<00:00:17.039> some

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
using on a course tomorrow with some

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.769 
using on a course tomorrow with some
science<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.880> mission<00:00:18.119> showing<00:00:18.330> them<00:00:18.420> how<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.570> do

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
science a mission showing them how to do

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.290 
science a mission showing them how to do
it<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.650> we'll<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> video<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.789> show

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
it and so we'll do a video just to show

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.359 
it and so we'll do a video just to show
them<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.779> steps<00:00:21.990> involved<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.769> hopefully

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
them the steps involved and hopefully

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.529 
them the steps involved and hopefully
you'll<00:00:23.490> find<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.760> useful<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:24.150> well

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
you'll find it useful as well

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.170 
you'll find it useful as well
so<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> gang<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.490> speedometer<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
so this is the gang on speedometer a

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.980 
so this is the gang on speedometer a
pedometer<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.990> device<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:29.519> measuring

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
pedometer is a device for measuring

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.120 
pedometer is a device for measuring
transpiration<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.109> plants<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.769> basically

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
transpiration in plants so basically

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.250 
transpiration in plants so basically
upon<00:00:32.430> time<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.000> water<00:00:33.180> out<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.390> scope<00:00:34.110> from

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
upon time the water out of scope from

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.190 
upon time the water out of scope from
the<00:00:34.350> leaves<00:00:34.550> for<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> stomata<00:00:35.820> usually<00:00:36.450> so

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the leaves for the stomata usually so

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.660 
the leaves for the stomata usually so
it's<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.530> really<00:00:37.680> handy<00:00:37.829> device<00:00:38.100> for

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it's just a really handy device for

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.920 
it's just a really handy device for
doing<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.000> but<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.450> quite<00:00:39.540> tricky<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
doing it but it can be quite tricky to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.920 
doing it but it can be quite tricky to
set<00:00:40.170> up<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> sort<00:00:41.820> of

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
set up and this one is the sort of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.889 
set up and this one is the sort of
standard<00:00:42.930> school<00:00:43.890> science<00:00:44.899> demonstration

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
standard school science demonstration

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.959 
standard school science demonstration
one<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.770> another<00:00:46.980> class<00:00:47.250> set<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.579> these<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
one you another class set of these is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.540 
one you another class set of these is
just<00:00:48.739> demonstration<00:00:49.739> tests<00:00:50.010> or<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> teachers

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
just demonstration tests or the teachers

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.410 
just demonstration tests or the teachers
to<00:00:50.700> use<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.610> glass<00:00:53.610> vessel<00:00:53.850> there<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
to use so we have a glass vessel there a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.209 
to use so we have a glass vessel there a
capillary<00:00:55.020> tube<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.530> measure<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.039> water

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
capillary tube here to measure the water

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.849 
capillary tube here to measure the water
going<00:00:56.670> up<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.210> got<00:00:57.780> graduations<00:00:58.739> as

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
going up so you can got graduations as

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.740 
going up so you can got graduations as
we<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.160> measure<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.550> rate<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.239> based<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
we can measure the rate and based the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.689 
we can measure the rate and based the
plant's<00:01:00.989> transpiring<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.340> reservoir

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
plant's transpiring and then a reservoir

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.090 
plant's transpiring and then a reservoir
which<00:01:03.000> helps<00:01:03.270> us<00:01:03.329> push<00:01:03.600> back<00:01:03.860> bubbles<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
which helps us push back bubbles and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.289 
which helps us push back bubbles and
colored<00:01:05.489> liquid<00:01:05.820> here<00:01:05.970> because<00:01:06.150> we'll<00:01:06.270> use

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
colored liquid here because we'll use

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
colored liquid here because we'll use
that<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.840> actually<00:01:06.960> measure<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.979> rate<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that to actually measure the rate of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.940 
that to actually measure the rate of
transpiration<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.810> plant<00:01:10.140> we're<00:01:10.350> using<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
transpiration the plant we're using is

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.820 
transpiration the plant we're using is
Laurel<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:13.790> if<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.570> totally<00:01:16.080> that's<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
Laurel and if we just totally that's a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.090 
Laurel and if we just totally that's a
lowly<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:18.270> that's<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.960> soother<00:01:19.470> she<00:01:19.740> works<00:01:19.950> on

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
lowly and that's a soother she works on

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.710 
lowly and that's a soother she works on
contract<00:01:20.580> farmers<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> laurel

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
contract farmers and so this is a laurel

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.330 
contract farmers and so this is a laurel
leaf<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.770> good<00:01:25.920> plant<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> use

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
leaf and it's really good plant to use

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429 
leaf and it's really good plant to use
because<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.670> nice<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.850> woody<00:01:27.200> good<00:01:28.200> leads

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
because it's nice and woody good leads

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.840 
because it's nice and woody good leads
to<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.040> convey<00:01:29.340> saline<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
to you so you can convey saline on the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.010 
to you so you can convey saline on the
other<00:01:30.000> side<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.840> makes

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
other side to see if that makes

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.090 
other side to see if that makes
difference<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.500> terms<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.829> rate<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
difference in terms of the rate of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.179 
difference in terms of the rate of
transpiration<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> Laurel<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.680> we

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
transpiration so that's the Laurel so we

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.440 
transpiration so that's the Laurel so we
have<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:37.369> potometer<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.329> all

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
have a potometer and we have it all

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.850 
have a potometer and we have it all
reservoir<00:01:40.049> water<00:01:40.200> here<00:01:40.470> which<00:01:40.590> we're<00:01:40.740> going

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
reservoir water here which we're going

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.399 
reservoir water here which we're going
to<00:01:40.950> put<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.280> end<00:01:41.810> just<00:01:42.810> fill<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.200> with

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
to put at the end just fill that up with

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.780 
to put at the end just fill that up with
some<00:01:43.880> liquid

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.469 

in<00:01:51.790> this<00:01:52.210> side<00:01:52.770> I'm<00:01:53.770> just<00:01:54.010> going<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.479> move

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
in this side I'm just going to move

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.020 
in this side I'm just going to move
along<00:01:55.660> so<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:55.870> can<00:01:56.050> see<00:01:56.520> coin<00:01:57.520> some<00:01:57.850> water

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
along so you can see coin some water

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.760 
along so you can see coin some water
here<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:01.479> fill<00:02:01.990> out<00:02:02.140> nearly<00:02:02.530> up<00:02:02.590> at<00:02:02.710> the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
here like so fill out nearly up at the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.600 
here like so fill out nearly up at the
top<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.550> also<00:02:03.820> just<00:02:04.000> for<00:02:04.180> that<00:02:04.330> reservoir<00:02:04.660> up

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
top and also just for that reservoir up

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.719 
top and also just for that reservoir up
and<00:02:06.610> then<00:02:06.700> just<00:02:06.910> close<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:08.070> now<00:02:09.070> the

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
and then just close that to that now the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.460 
and then just close that to that now the
big<00:02:09.910> thing<00:02:09.940> we<00:02:10.209> have<00:02:10.240> to<00:02:10.509> do<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.350> is

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
big thing we have to do and this is

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.380 
big thing we have to do and this is
really<00:02:11.620> important<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.610> make<00:02:12.910> sure<00:02:12.940> there's<00:02:13.240> no

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
really important is make sure there's no

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.510 
really important is make sure there's no
air<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:14.350> any<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:14.680> these<00:02:14.800> vessels<00:02:15.220> here<00:02:15.400> these

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
air in any of these vessels here these

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.910 
air in any of these vessels here these
last<00:02:15.760> structures<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:17.410> I'm<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.800> make

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
last structures and I'm going to make

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.500 
last structures and I'm going to make
sure<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.430> water<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.700> dripping<00:02:18.880> at<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.390> end

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
sure the water is dripping at the end

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.680 
sure the water is dripping at the end
which<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.840> is<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.850> make<00:02:22.030> sure<00:02:22.060> there's<00:02:22.360> no<00:02:22.510> air

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
which it is so make sure there's no air

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.970 
which it is so make sure there's no air
in<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.900> systems<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.410> all<00:02:23.500> flooding<00:02:23.860> out

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
in the systems it's all flooding out

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.010 
in the systems it's all flooding out
there<00:02:24.190> which<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.459> nice<00:02:24.640> flexible<00:02:25.420> we<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.870> see

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
there which is nice flexible we just see

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.590 
there which is nice flexible we just see
that's<00:02:26.230> going<00:02:26.709> down<00:02:26.739> ever<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:27.700> slowly<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.510> you

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
that's going down ever so slowly so you

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.120 
that's going down ever so slowly so you
can<00:02:28.720> see<00:02:28.870> without<00:02:29.020> any<00:02:29.320> points<00:02:29.770> in<00:02:29.890> here<00:02:29.980> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
can see without any points in here the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.420 
can see without any points in here the
action<00:02:30.400> will<00:02:30.520> just<00:02:30.760> close<00:02:31.030> out<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.360> system

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
action will just close out of the system

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.670 
action will just close out of the system
so<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.790> next<00:02:34.360> step<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.230> don't<00:02:35.380> have<00:02:35.530> to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
so the next step and you don't have to

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.020 
so the next step and you don't have to
do<00:02:35.770> this<00:02:35.980> one<00:02:36.160> underwater<00:02:36.520> if<00:02:36.730> you're<00:02:36.850> quick

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
do this one underwater if you're quick

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.080 
do this one underwater if you're quick
enough<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:37.870> have<00:02:38.080> some<00:02:38.800> oil<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> pot<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.790> you

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
enough we have some oil in a pot and you

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.580 
enough we have some oil in a pot and you
want<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.360> just<00:02:40.480> remove<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.989> pot<00:02:41.170> oh<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.350> you

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
want to just remove the pot oh so you

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.250 
want to just remove the pot oh so you
could<00:02:41.830> see<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.130> enough<00:02:42.400> done<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.720> big

could see it's enough done and a big

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.910 
could see it's enough done and a big
selection<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.920> Laurel<00:02:45.730> here<00:02:45.940> all<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:47.110> this<00:02:47.290> job

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
the Laurel is the same sort of thickness

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.979 
the Laurel is the same sort of thickness
as<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.580> bore<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.209> your<00:03:01.600> bump

here we go because this is going to go

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.550 
here we go because this is going to go
into<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.150> top<00:03:04.360> here<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.230> want<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.440> make

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
into the top here so you want to make

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.380 
into the top here so you want to make
sure<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:06.040> that's<00:03:06.310> close<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.239> get<00:03:07.299> a

sure that that's close to that to get a
really<00:03:07.570> good<00:03:07.690> fit<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:09.060> we're<00:03:10.060> going<00:03:10.180> to

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
really good fit on it so we're going to

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.140 
really good fit on it so we're going to
just<00:03:11.709> top<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.040> back<00:03:12.250> up<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:12.790> want<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.030> make

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
just top this back up so we want to make

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.000 
just top this back up so we want to make
sure<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.390> water<00:03:13.630> is<00:03:13.840> right<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.530> top<00:03:14.739> in<00:03:14.890> this

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
sure the water is right the top in this

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.740 
sure the water is right the top in this
vessel<00:03:15.810> we're<00:03:16.810> going<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:19.060> snip<00:03:19.510> off<00:03:19.690> the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
vessel we're going to just snip off the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.240 
vessel we're going to just snip off the
end<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.440> Laurel<00:03:22.950> like<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.130> would<00:03:24.840> some

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
end of the Laurel like you would some

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.750 
end of the Laurel like you would some
transfer<00:03:27.250> files<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.760> put<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.690> bun<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:29.760> like

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
transfer files and put the bun on like

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.210 
transfer files and put the bun on like
so<00:03:31.030> might<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.780> sort<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.170> white<00:03:32.560> part<00:03:32.890> it's

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
so might the sort of white part it's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.979 
so might the sort of white part it's
nice<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.610> snug<00:03:33.700> fit<00:03:35.040> add<00:03:36.040> some<00:03:36.370> more<00:03:36.989> water

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
nice and snug fit add some more water

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.340 
nice and snug fit add some more water
into<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.920> vessel<00:03:39.510> into<00:03:40.510> your<00:03:40.600> potometer<00:03:40.959> and

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
into the vessel into your potometer and

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.120 
into the vessel into your potometer and
squeeze<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.310> down<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.510> then

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
squeeze it down and then

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.760 
squeeze it down and then
big<00:03:46.130> glob<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.430> Vaseline<00:03:46.849> and<00:03:47.810> just<00:03:48.230> put<00:03:48.739> that

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
big glob of Vaseline and just put that

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.750 
big glob of Vaseline and just put that
round<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.520> plants<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.209> there<00:03:50.709> now<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:52.250> reason

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
round the plants in there now the reason

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.640 
round the plants in there now the reason
we're<00:03:52.880> doing<00:03:53.120> all<00:03:53.270> this<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.870> that<00:03:54.110> it's<00:03:54.230> really

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
we're doing all this is that it's really

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.550 
we're doing all this is that it's really
important<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.250> make<00:03:55.400> sure<00:03:55.550> you<00:03:55.640> get<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.819> seal<00:03:56.560> if

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
important to make sure you get a seal if

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.260 
important to make sure you get a seal if
there's<00:03:57.890> no<00:03:58.099> seal<00:03:59.709> what<00:04:00.709> happens

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
there's no seal what happens

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.930 
there's no seal what happens
you<00:04:02.630> mean<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.840> plants<00:04:03.170> here<00:04:03.380> if<00:04:04.340> there's<00:04:04.790> no

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
you mean the plants here if there's no

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.729 
you mean the plants here if there's no
seal<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.480> walls<00:04:05.690> air<00:04:05.989> will<00:04:06.140> get<00:04:06.260> in<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:06.620> just

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
seal the walls air will get in and just

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.710 
seal the walls air will get in and just
push<00:04:06.950> them<00:04:07.069> all<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.340> out<00:04:07.459> plants<00:04:08.180> not<00:04:08.360> strong

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
push them all to out plants not strong

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.750 
push them all to out plants not strong
enough<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:09.680> put<00:04:10.010> it<00:04:10.100> back<00:04:10.250> up<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:10.640> the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
enough to and put it back up so the

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.090 
enough to and put it back up so the
ground<00:04:10.940> sealed<00:04:11.090> push<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.450> out<00:04:11.890> don't<00:04:12.890> grab

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
ground sealed push it out don't grab

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.699 
ground sealed push it out don't grab
your<00:04:13.280> push<00:04:13.489> down<00:04:13.700> so<00:04:14.660> if<00:04:15.170> you<00:04:15.349> go<00:04:15.440> you've<00:04:15.620> got

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
your push down so if you go you've got

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.229 
your push down so if you go you've got
to<00:04:15.739> get<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.040> really<00:04:16.280> good<00:04:16.400> seal<00:04:16.669> here<00:04:16.910> it's<00:04:17.120> a

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
to get a really good seal here it's a

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.210 
to get a really good seal here it's a
silk<00:04:17.479> there's<00:04:17.810> no<00:04:17.900> silver<00:04:18.139> just<00:04:18.410> will

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
silk there's no silver just will

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.650 
silk there's no silver just will
disappear<00:04:21.040> so<00:04:22.040> we've<00:04:22.430> got<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.700> end<00:04:22.880> we've<00:04:23.510> got

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
disappear so we've got the end we've got

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.480 
disappear so we've got the end we've got
no<00:04:23.810> air<00:04:23.960> forming<00:04:24.530> here<00:04:24.740> so<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:24.979> think<00:04:25.070> this<00:04:25.430> is

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
no air forming here so I think this is

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.570 
no air forming here so I think this is
OK<00:04:26.270> in<00:04:26.389> terms<00:04:26.419> of<00:04:26.750> how<00:04:26.900> it's<00:04:27.080> sealed<00:04:27.350> I'm<00:04:28.220> going

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
OK in terms of how it's sealed I'm going

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.600 
OK in terms of how it's sealed I'm going
to<00:04:28.820> lift<00:04:29.060> this<00:04:29.300> up<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.720> just<00:04:30.160> take<00:04:31.160> our<00:04:31.370> few

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
to lift this up and just take our few

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.030 
to lift this up and just take our few
jobs<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.120> inject<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:33.139> to<00:04:33.200> get<00:04:33.350> an<00:04:33.740> air<00:04:33.860> bubble

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
jobs and inject so to get an air bubble

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.080 
jobs and inject so to get an air bubble
into<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.520> cavilleri<00:04:34.790> tube<00:04:36.280> look<00:04:37.280> that<00:04:37.880> it's

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
into the cavilleri tube look that it's

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.469 
into the cavilleri tube look that it's
falling<00:04:38.389> over<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:40.060> what<00:04:41.060> we're<00:04:41.180> looking<00:04:41.450> for

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
falling over and what we're looking for

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.750 
falling over and what we're looking for
is<00:04:41.930> whether<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.620> air<00:04:42.710> bubbles<00:04:43.040> going<00:04:43.280> up<00:04:43.460> or

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
is whether the air bubbles going up or

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.580 
is whether the air bubbles going up or
not<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.030> mean<00:04:44.270> usually<00:04:44.450> if<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.229> air<00:04:45.320> bubbles

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
not I mean usually if the air bubbles

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.050 
not I mean usually if the air bubbles
moving<00:04:45.830> up<00:04:45.979> it's<00:04:46.130> all<00:04:46.250> working<00:04:46.610> it's<00:04:46.729> fine<00:04:46.910> the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
moving up it's all working it's fine the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.060 
moving up it's all working it's fine the
plants<00:04:47.360> transformation<00:04:48.080> or<00:04:48.200> to<00:04:48.320> hear<00:04:48.530> what's

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
plants transformation or to hear what's

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.000 
plants transformation or to hear what's
being<00:04:49.280> drawn<00:04:49.550> up<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:50.020> if<00:04:51.020> it<00:04:51.560> goes<00:04:51.620> backwards

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
being drawn up and if it goes backwards

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.650 
being drawn up and if it goes backwards
means<00:04:52.430> there's<00:04:52.669> no<00:04:52.760> silver<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:53.390> you<00:04:53.450> have<00:04:53.539> to

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
means there's no silver so you have to

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.420 
means there's no silver so you have to
start<00:04:53.870> again<00:04:54.169> and<00:04:54.440> if<00:04:54.770> it's<00:04:54.950> stationary<00:04:55.370> you

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
start again and if it's stationary you

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.040 
start again and if it's stationary you
just<00:04:55.580> mean<00:04:55.700> the<00:04:55.820> pants<00:04:56.060> not<00:04:56.570> doing<00:04:56.840> anything

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
just mean the pants not doing anything

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.960 
just mean the pants not doing anything
and<00:04:57.710> you've<00:04:57.860> got<00:04:58.010> a<00:04:58.039> silver<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.520> pawn<00:04:58.729> store

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
and you've got a silver the pawn store

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.219 
and you've got a silver the pawn store
drawing<00:04:59.240> any<00:04:59.360> liquid<00:04:59.690> up<00:05:01.390> now<00:05:02.390> I<00:05:02.660> don't<00:05:02.750> know

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
drawing any liquid up now I don't know

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.460 
drawing any liquid up now I don't know
if<00:05:03.320> we're<00:05:03.470> going<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.620> see<00:05:03.860> this<00:05:03.979> on<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.160> camera

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
if we're going to see this on the camera

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.040 
if we're going to see this on the camera
I'll<00:05:06.470> move<00:05:06.650> this<00:05:06.830> forward<00:05:07.840> hoping<00:05:08.840> you<00:05:08.930> might

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
I'll move this forward hoping you might

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.560 
I'll move this forward hoping you might
be<00:05:09.200> able<00:05:09.320> to<00:05:09.440> see<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.740> air<00:05:09.830> bubble<00:05:10.479> there<00:05:11.479> we

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
be able to see the air bubble there we

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.909 
be able to see the air bubble there we
go<00:05:11.890> think<00:05:12.890> you<00:05:12.979> can<00:05:13.100> just<00:05:13.250> about<00:05:13.400> see<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:14.919> now

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
go think you can just about see it now

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.500 
go think you can just about see it now
you<00:05:15.979> could<00:05:16.190> use<00:05:16.220> food<00:05:16.700> coloring<00:05:16.729> this<00:05:17.330> but

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
you could use food coloring this but

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.120 
you could use food coloring this but
we're<00:05:17.600> just<00:05:17.630> on<00:05:17.840> air<00:05:18.020> bubble<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:18.440> you<00:05:18.560> can<00:05:18.919> see

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
we're just on air bubble and you can see

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.640 
we're just on air bubble and you can see
the<00:05:19.250> air<00:05:19.340> bubble<00:05:19.669> is<00:05:19.760> it's<00:05:19.910> sort<00:05:20.120> of<00:05:20.210> silver

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
the air bubble is it's sort of silver

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.730 
the air bubble is it's sort of silver
line<00:05:21.729> so<00:05:22.729> it<00:05:22.789> starts<00:05:23.180> there<00:05:23.390> and<00:05:23.660> what<00:05:24.289> I<00:05:24.440> start

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
line so it starts there and what I start

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.350 
line so it starts there and what I start
throwing<00:05:24.950> ends<00:05:25.160> there<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.970> you<00:05:26.090> should<00:05:26.150> be

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
throwing ends there and you should be

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.390 
throwing ends there and you should be
able<00:05:26.419> to<00:05:26.539> see<00:05:26.780> it<00:05:26.870> going<00:05:27.080> up<00:05:27.320> now<00:05:27.979> you<00:05:28.039> can

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
able to see it going up now you can

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.390 
able to see it going up now you can
change<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:30.770> atmosphere<00:05:30.919> the

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
change the the atmosphere the

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.249 
change the the atmosphere the
environment<00:05:31.490> around<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.270> lace<00:05:32.390> you<00:05:32.539> can<00:05:32.720> put

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
environment around the lace you can put

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.230 
environment around the lace you can put
Vaseline<00:05:34.069> on<00:05:34.129> the<00:05:34.189> surface<00:05:34.610> that<00:05:34.759> is<00:05:34.909> on<00:05:35.120> the

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
Vaseline on the surface that is on the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.999 
Vaseline on the surface that is on the
neetha<00:05:35.509> lays<00:05:35.689> to<00:05:36.620> see<00:05:36.740> if<00:05:36.800> that<00:05:36.889> makes

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
neetha lays to see if that makes

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.769 
neetha lays to see if that makes
difference<00:05:37.430> in<00:05:37.550> terms<00:05:37.759> of<00:05:37.939> how<00:05:38.120> quickly<00:05:38.479> the

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:38.779 
difference in terms of how quickly the

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.899 
difference in terms of how quickly the
plant<00:05:38.990> transpires<00:05:39.650> by<00:05:40.099> computing<00:05:40.430> a<00:05:40.520> plastic

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
it and it's working it's going up really
