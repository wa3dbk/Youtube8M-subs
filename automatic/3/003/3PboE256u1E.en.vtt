00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
you know let's show you how this

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.979 
you know let's show you how this
redstone<00:00:37.320> contraption<00:00:38.070> works<00:00:38.989> you're

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
redstone contraption works you're

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.380 
redstone contraption works you're
probably<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.410> what<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.950> puke<00:00:41.370> kind<00:00:42.329> of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
probably like what is that puke kind of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.330 
probably like what is that puke kind of
looks<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.890> actually

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
looks like it but it's not it's actually

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.850 
looks like it but it's not it's actually
something<00:00:44.579> called<00:00:44.789> redstone<00:00:45.300> pace<00:00:45.649> it's<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
something called redstone pace it's a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.029 
something called redstone pace it's a
brand<00:00:47.100> new<00:00:47.190> mod<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:48.390> I'm<00:00:48.719> showcasing<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
brand new mod that I'm showcasing and I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.380 
brand new mod that I'm showcasing and I
think<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.969> most<00:00:51.090> brilliant

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
think it's one of the most brilliant

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.139 
think it's one of the most brilliant
things<00:00:51.840> ever<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.250> added<00:00:53.579> into<00:00:53.730> Minecraft

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
things ever to be added into Minecraft

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.069 
things ever to be added into Minecraft
now<00:00:54.270> you're<00:00:54.390> probably<00:00:54.480> wondering<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:55.020> how

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
now you're probably wondering like how

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.590 
now you're probably wondering like how
does<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.530> actually<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.730> across

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
does that actually go like that across

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.959 
does that actually go like that across
the<00:00:58.170> sides<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> block<00:00:58.920> well<00:00:59.670> actually

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the sides of the block well actually

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
the sides of the block well actually
let's<00:01:00.719> first<00:01:00.960> show<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.140> how<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> actually

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
let's first show you how to actually

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.910 
let's first show you how to actually
make<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.719> you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.899> make<00:01:04.019> redstone<00:01:04.229> paste<00:01:04.650> by

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
make this you can make redstone paste by

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.609 
make this you can make redstone paste by
getting<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.549> redstone<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:07.049> slimeball

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
getting one redstone and one slimeball

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.770 
getting one redstone and one slimeball
and<00:01:07.799> putting<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> crafting<00:01:09.420> table<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and putting it in a crafting table and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.590 
and putting it in a crafting table and
you<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.590> full<00:01:10.860> redstone<00:01:11.340> paste<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:12.299> we've

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you get full redstone paste now we've

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.800 
you get full redstone paste now we've
already<00:01:12.810> made<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> crap<00:01:13.409> ton<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.810> let's

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
already made a crap ton of this so let's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.830 
already made a crap ton of this so let's
show<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.049> how<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> works<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:17.490> right<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
show you how it works all right so you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.649 
show you how it works all right so you
it<00:01:19.409> goes<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.070> one<00:01:20.610> half<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.090> block<00:01:21.330> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
it goes on one half of the block and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.240 
it goes on one half of the block and
then<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> paste<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> other

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
then you have to paste it on the other

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.620 
then you have to paste it on the other
half<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.880> eventually

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
half and so on and you can eventually

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.910 
half and so on and you can eventually
make<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.140> full<00:01:28.560> circuit<00:01:29.009> oh<00:01:31.189> not<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.400> know

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
make a full circuit oh not that know

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.010 
make a full circuit oh not that know
sometimes<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> goes<00:01:36.000> different<00:01:36.600> ways<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
sometimes it goes different ways and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.609 
sometimes it goes different ways and
what<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.320> want<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.710> go<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:39.439> you<00:01:40.439> got

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
what you want it to go like that you got

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.999 
what you want it to go like that you got
to<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.670> specifically<00:01:42.649> making<00:01:43.649> sure<00:01:43.890> it

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
to be like specifically making sure it

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.710 
to be like specifically making sure it
goes<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> right<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:47.240> anyhow<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.299> get<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
goes the right way anyhow you get the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.899 
goes the right way anyhow you get the
gist<00:01:49.009> so<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.369> there<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.579> pretty<00:01:50.759> much

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
gist so that right there is pretty much

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.550 
gist so that right there is pretty much
