00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the one screw and pull hard to the point

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.680 
the one screw and pull hard to the point
to<00:02:09.840> where<00:02:09.960> you<00:02:09.990> think<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:10.440> gonna<00:02:10.590> break<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
to where you think it's gonna break and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.630 
to where you think it's gonna break and
that<00:02:12.690> explanation<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.800> about<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:16.460> plain<00:02:17.460> as

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
that explanation is about is plain as

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.040 
that explanation is about is plain as
you<00:02:17.790> can<00:02:17.970> get<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.270> because<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.690> literally

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
you can get it because you literally

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.610 
you can get it because you literally
have<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.320> pull<00:02:19.709> like<00:02:20.580> you're<00:02:20.730> gonna<00:02:20.880> break<00:02:21.240> it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
have to pull like you're gonna break it

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.300 
have to pull like you're gonna break it
so<00:02:22.620> as<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.070> see<00:02:23.880> my<00:02:24.150> mirror<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.810> had<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.860> pull<00:02:26.130> it

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
so as you see my mirror I had to pull it

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.180 
so as you see my mirror I had to pull it
forward<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.990> get<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.290> out<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> way<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.160> I

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
forward to get it out of the way so I

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.980 
forward to get it out of the way so I
basically<00:02:29.820> pushed<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.270> all<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.450> way<00:02:30.660> forward

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
basically pushed it all the way forward

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.040 
basically pushed it all the way forward
and<00:02:31.400> what<00:02:32.400> you're<00:02:32.580> gonna<00:02:32.730> do<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:36.540> when<00:02:36.870> it's

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
and what you're gonna do is when it's

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.430 
and what you're gonna do is when it's
sitting<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:39.260> you're<00:02:40.260> gonna

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
sitting up here like this you're gonna

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.380 
sitting up here like this you're gonna
get<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.890> screwdriver<00:02:41.160> after<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.150> take<00:02:42.360> it

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
get the screwdriver after you take it

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
screwdriver right there and just pull

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.070 
screwdriver right there and just pull
down<00:02:56.340> real<00:02:57.090> real<00:02:57.810> real<00:02:58.170> hard<00:02:59.720> once<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.900> pulls

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
down real real real hard once it pulls

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.320 
down real real real hard once it pulls
down<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:01.890> just<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.730> basically<00:03:03.090> gonna

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
down it's just it's basically gonna

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.930 
down it's just it's basically gonna
shoot<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.080> face<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:05.430> gonna<00:03:05.580> fall

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
shoot you in the face so it's gonna fall

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.300 
shoot you in the face so it's gonna fall
down<00:03:05.970> hard<00:03:06.690> if<00:03:07.320> you're<00:03:07.590> pulling<00:03:07.890> with<00:03:08.070> enough

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
down hard if you're pulling with enough

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.120 
down hard if you're pulling with enough
force<00:03:08.900> so<00:03:09.900> once<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.350> falls<00:03:10.590> down<00:03:12.920> it's<00:03:13.920> still

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
force so once it falls down it's still

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.100 
force so once it falls down it's still
gonna<00:03:14.640> be<00:03:14.760> connected<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:16.860> right<00:03:17.160> here<00:03:18.110> so

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
gonna be connected to this right here so

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.009 
gonna be connected to this right here so
basically<00:03:19.680> if<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:19.860> pull<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.250> down<00:03:20.959> by<00:03:21.959> the

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
basically if you pull it down by the

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.050 
basically if you pull it down by the
screwdriver<00:03:22.769> or<00:03:22.980> pry<00:03:23.010> bar<00:03:23.489> whatever<00:03:23.700> you're

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
screwdriver or pry bar whatever you're

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.650 
screwdriver or pry bar whatever you're
using<00:03:25.310> it's<00:03:26.310> gonna<00:03:26.489> fall<00:03:26.760> down<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.060> still<00:03:27.420> be

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
using it's gonna fall down and still be

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
using it's gonna fall down and still be
connected<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:28.530> right<00:03:28.830> here<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.500> is

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
connected to this right here and this is

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.460 
connected to this right here and this is
where<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:31.980> goes<00:03:32.130> into<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.360> then<00:03:33.600> basically<00:03:34.170> you

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
where it goes into so then basically you

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.710 
where it goes into so then basically you
can<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:34.950> pull<00:03:35.579> it<00:03:35.730> out<00:03:35.820> disconnect<00:03:36.540> it

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
can just pull it out disconnect it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.040 
can just pull it out disconnect it
however<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:37.200> want<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.500> do<00:03:37.650> it

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
however you want to do it

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.980 
however you want to do it

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
but um here's what it looks like here's

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.370 
but um here's what it looks like here's
the<00:03:46.200> one<00:03:46.380> screw<00:03:46.740> here<00:03:46.950> at<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.220> top<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:52.200> one

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
the one screw here at the top the one

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.070 
the one screw here at the top the one
screw<00:03:52.740> here<00:03:53.280> at<00:03:53.460> the<00:03:53.610> bottom<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:54.870> took

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
screw here at the bottom that you took

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.610 
screw here at the bottom that you took
off<00:03:55.290> initially<00:03:55.920> when<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.130> was<00:03:56.340> up<00:03:56.550> here<00:03:56.760> and

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
off initially when it was up here and

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.590 
off initially when it was up here and
then<00:03:58.620> here<00:03:59.040> are<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.190> two<00:03:59.280> other<00:03:59.670> screws<00:04:00.150> right

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
then here are the two other screws right

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.770 
then here are the two other screws right
there<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:01.290> need<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.920> take<00:04:02.160> out<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:03.480> warm
