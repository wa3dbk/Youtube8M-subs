climate scientists are just beginning to
weigh<00:02:33.800> options<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.700> Sun<00:02:34.910> shield<00:02:35.180> as<00:02:35.870> we

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
weigh options like the Sun shield as we

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.870 
weigh options like the Sun shield as we
contemplate<00:02:36.230> an<00:02:36.770> uncertain<00:02:37.400> future<00:02:39.700> if<00:02:40.700> you

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
contemplate an uncertain future if you

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.720 
contemplate an uncertain future if you
were<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.270> put<00:02:41.750> in<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.110> much<00:02:42.380> effort<00:02:42.620> maybe<00:02:43.490> we

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
were to put in this much effort maybe we

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.310 
were to put in this much effort maybe we
should<00:02:43.910> just<00:02:44.030> be<00:02:44.120> building<00:02:44.570> wind<00:02:44.780> turbines

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
should just be building wind turbines

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.410 
should just be building wind turbines
and<00:02:45.590> solar<00:02:45.650> cells<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.550> things<00:02:46.730> like<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:46.910> and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
and solar cells and things like that and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.610 
and solar cells and things like that and
not<00:02:47.540> bother<00:02:47.810> building<00:02:48.080> these<00:02:48.350> huge

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
not bother building these huge

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.860 
not bother building these huge
satellites<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.150> don't<00:02:50.420> think<00:02:50.690> it's

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
satellites but I don't think it's

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.440 
satellites but I don't think it's
completely<00:02:51.710> off<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.550> charts<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.120> think<00:02:53.330> it's

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
completely off the charts I think it's

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.470 
completely off the charts I think it's
off<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.780> charts<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:54.350> century<00:02:55.060> what<00:02:56.060> we<00:02:56.240> have

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
off the charts this century what we have

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.440 
off the charts this century what we have
to<00:02:56.690> be<00:02:56.870> prepared<00:02:57.440> for<00:02:57.590> is<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.760> many<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.210> these

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
to be prepared for is that many of these

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.260 
to be prepared for is that many of these
experiments<00:02:59.990> aren't<00:03:00.470> going<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:01.010> work<00:03:01.190> this<00:03:02.090> is

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.630
