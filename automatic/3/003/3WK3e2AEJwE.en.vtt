00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.769
 I'm Brazilian I'm 27 my name is 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:33.660
 Daniel and I live in Rome he was a make-up artist 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:38.040
 Brazilian Latin mata very matt graham 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.379
 it's just it that's just me always up 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.149
 Facebook 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.530
 I do n't know how I wear my evening from what 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.800
 I do 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.320
 I put my work that is the photos of the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.260
 neighboring 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.190
 the evenings I make these things so we 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.520
 I can do it 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.449
 I do n't like them there is n't a pale one 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.359
 idea 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.949
 you know it's there because I see the face of a 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.480
 account is ugly and therefore I only remember 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.270
 of the ugly face for once I have 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.760
 put you know with the classic phrases of 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 facebook I'm almost all color though 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.790
 still have not understood that we have in 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.530
 square and the rainbow or 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.350
 these things that one writes such a 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.570
 once I like the spirit of the type 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.090
 people who never give up that 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.100
 they insist it will once be a boy 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.620
 who was rehearsing and told me but you know 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.330
 because I saw that you wrote him 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.150
 like people who always try 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.770
 but certainly not all I have to stay 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:42.940
 watch what I write because 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:46.510
 people if it really is crap sol do 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.960
 I settle for one of them, I look, I see which one 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.890
 the best light because it is not so bad 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:59.200
 obviously that is all the criticisms 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:07.060
 is in use so on 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:12.840
 I took a picture with a look 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:15.750
 simple girl square me 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.750
 let's say that 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.750
 york 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.910
 raises comedy visas and therefore 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.390
 comfortable shoe 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.510
 she 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.930
 a somewhat more elegant handcuff is with 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.030
 glitter 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.890
 with powder pink that I like a lot though 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.230
 I thought more about the fact that I have to 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.159
 take a subway I don't have to stay 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.750
 comfortable as I do not like and the sports and 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:52.840
 so i have no such thing anyway 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.840
 I'm comfortable but I'm in my way 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.850
 the twenty years becomes rome with the witch 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.400
 in the morning my dream looks 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.400
 photographed on 100 to realize it 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:21.170
 so wake up my baby I do n't know 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:21.170
 comrades I was little 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.030
 concert with dolcetto because me 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.980
 monstrous credibility when it must 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.070
 eat something that surely you 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.290

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.150

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.640

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.740

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.470
