00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.409

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:19.199
 jejeje although the game has just come out has already been pirated in directions as 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.529
 always the naruto games for the ds are taken by takara tomy 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.320
 well at first glance we can see that all this shit is in Japanese from the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.529
 that we do not understand a fuck but I'm going to tell you what this means 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.940
 first is battle inside is the battle free battle with beasts and mode 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.290
 survivor 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.310
 coming out of here we find the story mode that is very good and that 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.990
 then I will show you coming out of here is the sound option mode and 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.800
 difficulty 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.540
 well the other is good multiplayer good to not keep losing the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.680
 precious time I will show you some of the characters that I have unlocked to 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.449
 through the six hours of my life that I have dedicated to this good game the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.610
 characters that I show you are almost all that are available as 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.620
 is known to unlock the hidden characters that in this case are 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.110
 like shit you have to play the game the normal mode mode hard mode 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.430
 survivor and shock mode morris 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.590
 I just need to unblock the others with streets a good fact is that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.410
 there are more characters than in previous deliveries of naruto but bieber rise 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.140
 between them tim attack is new for the ds 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.070
 good good now I will show you this new innovative game mode to which I 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.600
 I have called battle against the beasts in which we battle against the beasts xd 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.580
 in this mode we can choose - characters that in the previous ones that are 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.049
 Naruto rooms that decide each course 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.430
 vegara hitachi 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.210
 to see and I choose houses that is what I think is appropriate for this 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.100
 work 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.920
 well actually this shit I do not know what it is for but I filled it with 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.460
 this way xd 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.670
 those who are here are the monsters available at the beginning there is only one and 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.390
 the others are unlocking the best thing is that here is the one who was 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.430
 free out there I mean him three tails xd 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.410
 but this time I think he chooses real two tails that was bento a 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.520
 bitch who is weaker than the roque tekis team of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.580
 to start we can see that the scenario is very broad and the graphics 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.470
 are good 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.490
 besides that this mode is new for the laptop to see we are taken 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.180
 tails son of a bitch draza shahzad takes with my super sword wahaha they gave me 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.090
 better I go out to show you the other little monsters that are a total of 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.580
 five at the beginning he's just two tails and you only play with naruto 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.739
 but as you play it the other monsters and players come out good 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.079
 here is the two tails normalitos tails the three tails and other monsters more than 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.540
 they are not viruses but they are equally strong and that we can find in level 1 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.799
 in a natural state 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.180
 by level 2 or be crazy with annoying because they saw it becoming a 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.119
 chacra tableware good xd let's get out of here 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.609
 now I will show you the story mode 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.150
 this one starts since the 7 team finds handles that which does not make them 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:03:01.359
 no shit about the case and on top it hits them xd 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.849
 let's go through the prologue to see this game mode that has already been seen in the 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.959
 previous delivery of naruto but south bieber in three or 2 to 1 that the world 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.999
 that we travel here is wider than the previous good good let's get out of 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:16.809
 history mode to enter so long awaited free battle which sure many 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.369
 they were waiting 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.519
 well let's give oysters to another character 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.539
 Adela will see who I choose 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:24.879
 we'll see 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.089
 be thirsty 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.909
 I choose which one you have asked and to whom I will put as a contributor 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.189
 I think I'll put opponents 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.749
 handles that small 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.729
 and the scenario because the little hills that comes to this is where kakÃ¡ 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.129
 I teach him how to vote by hand ray pager to the guy this 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.749
 while loading I'll tell you something new for the saga of the shinobi 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:45.769
 summary 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.069
 is that here in some characters you can use two of definitive uses and in 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.140
 the majority can be 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.370
 shaltut his normal ones like fireball explosive spiders one way 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:04:00.569
 in the characters that I've seen that you can use two yushu are naruto you know 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.559
 that is kakashi naruto little gara hitachi others more than I still do not know 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:05.499
 to play 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:09.499
 as for those who do not have two children their faithful instead of this one combo that 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:13.159
 it comes out by pressing forward and so that is what the dup of the 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.930
 other this combo is to take a few taps followed and finish it 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.349
 with a personal touch of each fighter 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.349
 good left them with the fight 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.639
 as they could already observe 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.509
 I already put a yusuke is that of the espadista 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.589
 but as it is in difficult mode I have not yet been able to do it the second is much 

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:53.529
 siri and finally it came out tomasas that little son of a bitch 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.340
 in terms of graphics they are very good to be a game for the ds 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.490
 the sound is good 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.090
 It has many characters 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.410
 but few scenarios the game modes are good and novel although it lacked 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.969
 a practical mode or tutorial 

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:44.839
 let's see I put a 9 

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:48.709
 Well now I finish my work I do not say goodbye without first telling you that if this shit 

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:51.229
 succeeds in other analyzes 

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:52.770
 Ok, now yes 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.379
