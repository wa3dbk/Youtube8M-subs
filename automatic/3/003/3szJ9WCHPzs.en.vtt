bike<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.280> worth<00:01:44.520> investing<00:01:44.789> in<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.390> good

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
bike so it's worth investing in a good

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.870 
bike so it's worth investing in a good
hefty<00:01:45.929> lock<00:01:46.110> unapproved<00:01:46.920> alarm<00:01:47.189> system

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880

you<00:01:59.530> like<00:01:59.710> about<00:01:59.740> it<00:02:00.180> quite<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.240> lot<00:02:01.479> the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
you like about it quite a lot the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.780 
you like about it quite a lot the
handling<00:02:02.320> was<00:02:02.380> brilliant<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.310> best<00:02:03.550> out<00:02:03.760> of

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
handling was brilliant the best out of

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.010 
handling was brilliant the best out of
all<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.060> them<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:06.370> engine<00:02:06.729> wasn't<00:02:07.210> its<00:02:07.720> strong

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
all of them the engine wasn't its strong

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.990 
all of them the engine wasn't its strong
point<00:02:08.289> actually<00:02:08.800> right<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.429> thought<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.850> was

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
point actually right I thought it was

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.050 
point actually right I thought it was
going<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.330> be<00:02:10.509> quite<00:02:10.810> talky<00:02:11.440> being<00:02:12.070> a<00:02:12.190> twin<00:02:12.430> but

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
going to be quite talky being a twin but

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.280 
going to be quite talky being a twin but
it<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.330> don't<00:02:13.600> know<00:02:13.660> if<00:02:13.750> it's<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.080> this

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
it I don't know if it's just this

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.260 
it I don't know if it's just this
particular<00:02:14.500> bike<00:02:15.070> but<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.459> didn't<00:02:15.790> pull<00:02:16.000> very

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
particular bike but it didn't pull very

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.720 
particular bike but it didn't pull very
strongly<00:02:16.630> right<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.280> was<00:02:18.400> sort<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.610> quite

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
strongly right and it was sort of quite

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.400 
strongly right and it was sort of quite
difficult<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.690> get<00:02:19.840> going

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
difficult to get going

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.500 
difficult to get going
it<00:02:20.590> needed<00:02:20.860> quite<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.070> lot<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.280> effort<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.790> think

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
it needed quite a lot of effort I think

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.840 
it needed quite a lot of effort I think
it<00:02:22.750> might<00:02:22.870> be<00:02:23.020> this<00:02:23.110> bike<00:02:23.380> not<00:02:24.250> traditionally

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
it might be this bike not traditionally

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.820 
it might be this bike not traditionally
how<00:02:24.940> they<00:02:25.120> are<00:02:25.300> supposed<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.720> be<00:02:25.810> no<00:02:26.590> because

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
how they are supposed to be no because

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.830 
how they are supposed to be no because
I've<00:02:26.950> never<00:02:27.070> ridden<00:02:27.340> one<00:02:27.489> before<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:28.180> I'm<00:02:28.690> not

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
I've never ridden one before so I'm not

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.240 
I've never ridden one before so I'm not
sure<00:02:29.020> what<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.350> compare<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.860> to

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
sure what to compare it to

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.160 
sure what to compare it to
yeah<00:02:30.340> they're<00:02:30.700> quite<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.940> powerful<00:02:31.360> thing<00:02:31.870> you

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
yeah they're quite a powerful thing you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
it's a 750 but it's got the performance

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.539 
it's a 750 but it's got the performance
of<00:02:52.420> near<00:02:52.840> enough<00:02:53.020> 900<00:02:53.800> but<00:02:53.980> it's<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.190> size<00:02:54.370> of

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
of near enough 900 but it's the size of

a 400 yes that is perfect well it should
have<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.760> performance<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.299> an<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.450> hope

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
have the performance of an I hope

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.000 
have the performance of an I hope
everywhere<00:02:59.140> all<00:02:59.470> right

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
everywhere all right

did you find it very extreme so from
these<00:03:01.690> very<00:03:02.019> extremes<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:02.980> price<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.580> know

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
these very extremes and price you know

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.570 
these very extremes and price you know
like<00:03:03.820> it<00:03:03.970> was<00:03:04.180> not<00:03:04.510> too<00:03:04.780> bad<00:03:04.810> it<00:03:05.650> was<00:03:05.830> okay<00:03:06.220> it

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
like it was not too bad it was okay it

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.310 
like it was not too bad it was okay it
was<00:03:06.820> quite<00:03:07.060> full<00:03:07.269> under<00:03:07.570> it's<00:03:07.720> something<00:03:08.230> I

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
was quite full under it's something I

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.050 
was quite full under it's something I
could<00:03:08.470> get<00:03:08.590> used<00:03:08.739> to<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.280> could<00:03:09.670> live<00:03:09.820> with<00:03:09.970> it

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
could get used to I could live with it

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.990 
could get used to I could live with it
yes<00:03:10.630> for<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.080> looks<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:12.430> talk<00:03:12.640> yourself<00:03:12.730> into

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
yes for the looks you talk yourself into

these things yes oh yeah okay so comfort
wise<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.200> stuff<00:03:17.440> can<00:03:17.739> we<00:03:17.799> do<00:03:17.920> miles<00:03:18.130> on<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.400> I

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
wise and stuff can we do miles on it I

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.750 
wise and stuff can we do miles on it I
think<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.810> could<00:03:19.870> probably<00:03:20.650> need<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.280> couple<00:03:21.579> of

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
think I could probably need a couple of

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.729 
think I could probably need a couple of
breaks<00:03:21.940> yeah<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.450> think<00:03:22.750> yeah<00:03:23.170> it's<00:03:23.410> quite<00:03:23.709> a

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
breaks yeah I think yeah it's quite a

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.819 
breaks yeah I think yeah it's quite a
happy<00:03:24.280> medium<00:03:24.820> yeah<00:03:25.150> okay<00:03:25.930> well<00:03:26.500> we<00:03:26.620> need<00:03:26.739> to

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
happy medium yeah okay well we need to

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.199 
happy medium yeah okay well we need to
go<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.100> scoreboards<00:03:27.640> then<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:27.970> give<00:03:28.120> it

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
go to the scoreboards then and give it

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.110 
go to the scoreboards then and give it
