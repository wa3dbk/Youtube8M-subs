here<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.039> said<00:01:59.249> by<00:01:59.369> using<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.729> kind

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
here so like I said by using that kind

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.099 
here so like I said by using that kind
of<00:01:59.909> language<00:02:00.119> he's<00:02:00.420> showing<00:02:00.719> everyone<00:02:00.899> around

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
there that he knows the jargon he knows

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.419 
there that he knows the jargon he knows

the fry cook game he is just as

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:06.949 
the fry cook game he is just as
competent<00:02:05.729> he's<00:02:06.029> trying<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.359> prove<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.689> he

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
competent he's trying to prove that he

competent he's trying to prove that he
is<00:02:07.079> better<00:02:07.319> that<00:02:07.679> he<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:07.889> wrongfully<00:02:08.280> fired

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909 
is better that he was wrongfully fired

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.669 
is better that he was wrongfully fired

now<00:02:11.519> another<00:02:11.760> piece<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.030> evidence<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.420> point

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 
now another piece of evidence to point

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:13.820 
now another piece of evidence to point
out<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.080> how<00:02:13.379> when

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
out is how when

it's hidden on the menu only employees

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.460 
it's hidden on the menu only employees
would<00:02:26.970> know<00:02:27.180> about<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.660> because<00:02:27.960> mr.<00:02:28.140> Crabb

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
would know about that because mr. Crabb

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.570 
would know about that because mr. Crabb
is<00:02:28.620> being<00:02:28.800> such<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> cheapskate

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
is being such a cheapskate

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.820 
is being such a cheapskate
they<00:02:29.940> writes<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.240> super<00:02:30.540> small<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.380> sole

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
they writes it super small on the sole

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.290 
they writes it super small on the sole
on<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.100> board<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.400> no<00:02:32.460> one<00:02:32.580> could<00:02:32.670> see<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:32.970> that

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
on the board so no one could see it that

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.000 
on the board so no one could see it that
only<00:02:33.480> employees<00:02:33.720> would<00:02:34.260> know<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.620> about<00:02:34.800> it

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
only employees would know the about it

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.380 
only employees would know the about it
so<00:02:35.190> he<00:02:35.370> had<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.850> have<00:02:35.940> known<00:02:36.090> about<00:02:36.210> this

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
so he had to have known about this

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.630 
so he had to have known about this
because<00:02:36.660> he's<00:02:36.780> employed<00:02:37.110> now<00:02:37.890> third<00:02:38.310> off

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
because he's employed now third off

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.770 
because he's employed now third off
which<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.150> biggest<00:02:39.540> piece<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.690> evidence

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
which is the biggest piece of evidence

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.650 
which is the biggest piece of evidence
in<00:02:40.050> my<00:02:40.230> opinion<00:02:40.770> is<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.850> he<00:02:41.970> looks<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.450> part

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
in my opinion is that he looks the part

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.440 
in my opinion is that he looks the part
he<00:02:42.960> looks<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.290> part<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:44.070> over<00:02:44.880> for

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
he looks the part of a over for

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.960 
he looks the part of a over for
overweight<00:02:46.080> fry<00:02:46.770> cook<00:02:47.040> he<00:02:47.160> wears<00:02:47.310> tank<00:02:47.640> tops

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
all there is to this theory guys I would
