00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 very good people here you have a video 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.670
 that I'm going to show you that you can have 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.770
 you receive infinities in the origin map 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.870
 It's good this game was dedicated 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.420
 completely commit suicide bet for 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.910
 that so that the machine was gone and then 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.350
 try to remove them from the machine 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.180
 random drinks is well worth it there already 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.550
 I had my two falls I bought the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.769
 revive and the machine goes as normal 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.060
 ok because now what I did was go to 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.789
 the area where the drinks are 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.170
 randomly I committed suicide to take away the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.029
 revive this one that fits me I had the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.730
 three falls that allow you to live 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.980
 ok and now I had to buy good 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.190
 tricks to fast camera and now I had to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.500
 buying the revive is worth now I would have 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.829
 that have come out in revive of the machine 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.210
 of this lega toria good and it did not come out 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.180
 I'm not going to pass this quickly and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.600
 when I went back to the beginning that you're going to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.059
 see immediately the teddy bear came out 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.039
 it's hard for us to differentiate good 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.140
 because in that I found in the beginning of 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.329
 the machine is of random drinks 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.730
 and that buying is worth the first 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.650
 I buy the revive what I want 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.710
 to say is that I now have 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.470
 three falls and one revive and now I let that 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.420
 kill me again and add four falls 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.280
 and I will be alive what he means is that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.130
 when I fall again I will have five falls 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.390
 in the bookmarks it is worth what I 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.280
 we see that with this is that you can have 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.720
 infinite reviews and that the people who 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.610
 see by the markers with more than 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.070
 four falls that are not hackers worth 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.800
 because it's normal to think that when 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.150
 It really is not like that, you can see 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.010
 harker it is clear that we are always 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.870
 they slip out there but good in this case 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.330
 it's like afterlife or like 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.830
 the judgments we can have more than 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
 four falls worth 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.700
 there you have the four more falls 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.950
 the one that there was when dying of the whole would be the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.020
 fifth and a pretty curiosity 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.600
 important that I want you to know is that 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.790
 to see me it occurred to me to use it in 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.260
 take the drink out of the random drink 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.240
 it is otherwise it is worth I say good 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.390
 I know that the revive machine contains 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.910
 three revives, then I'm going to 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.530
 do is spend two the first two and 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.090
 instead of buying me the third I bought it 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.040
 an astoria machine is worth as you can 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.900
 see how you can see there I had just 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.760
 die twice was worth two spent 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.110
 revives I had one you see the machine 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.770
 I had one left but I had just pulled out 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.020
 one 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.240
 good random machine this is from 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.620
 I'm going to check that it works and this 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.020
 can be spent to follow the wave if 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.030
 It is a discovery of the host as 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.870
 well there was the machine turned off the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.810
 I turn on and you will see what happens let us 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.330
 what is the law 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.030
 the machine goes flying or stays 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.990
 the machine and because there is no electricity 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.250
 but really the moment of the 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.690
 electricity to be able to buy the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.400
 machine disappears what you want to say 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.960
 is that what is what is not effective 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.640
 I told you, I also wanted you to 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.680
 that you knew because surely more 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.910
 one occurs to you but you can see that 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.800
 is going to be able to be used in this way 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.560
 so we can not reserve the 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.940
 backhand machine as was my intention 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.900
 nothing more kids a greeting and I hope that 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.900
 you liked ciao
