then at the bottom of the circle draw
another<00:00:29.109> line<00:00:29.230> going<00:00:29.470> across<00:00:32.070> now<00:00:33.070> we're

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250

a<00:01:30.280> line<00:01:30.580> straight<00:01:30.940> across<00:01:31.620> here<00:01:32.620> about

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
a line straight across here about

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.430 
a line straight across here about
halfway<00:01:33.580> between<00:01:34.030> these<00:01:34.630> two<00:01:34.900> lines<00:01:35.050> that<00:01:35.350> we

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
halfway between these two lines that we

especially<00:03:11.570> if<00:03:11.900> it's<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.110> female<00:03:12.500> character<00:03:12.800> if

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
especially if it's a female character if

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.950 
especially if it's a female character if
it's<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:13.910> male<00:03:14.090> character<00:03:14.300> you<00:03:14.570> might<00:03:14.690> want<00:03:14.900> it

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
it's a male character you might want it

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.260 
it's a male character you might want it
a<00:03:15.080> little<00:03:15.200> bit<00:03:15.350> farther<00:03:15.710> down<00:03:16.090> since<00:03:17.090> they

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
a little bit farther down since they

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.490 
a little bit farther down since they
tend<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.630> have<00:03:17.750> larger<00:03:18.200> noses<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:20.230> then<00:03:21.230> the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
tend to have larger noses and then the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.350 
tend to have larger noses and then the
mouth<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:22.190> like<00:03:22.520> to<00:03:22.670> put<00:03:22.880> about<00:03:23.060> halfway

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
mouth I like to put about halfway

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:32.020 
mouth I like to put about halfway
between<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.930> nose<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:24.140> chin<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:30.760> if<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:31.940> a

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
between the nose and chin and if it's a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.250 
between the nose and chin and if it's a
really<00:03:32.360> cartoony<00:03:32.600> style

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
really cartoony style

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.670 
really cartoony style
I'll<00:03:33.350> make<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.860> mouth<00:03:34.250> also<00:03:34.790> really<00:03:35.180> close<00:03:35.680> to

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
I'll make the mouth also really close to

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.870 
I'll make the mouth also really close to
the<00:03:36.800> eyes<00:03:36.920> this<00:03:37.460> one<00:03:37.610> actually<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:39.790> little<00:03:40.790> bit

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
the eyes this one actually a little bit

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.980 
the eyes this one actually a little bit
low<00:03:42.700> since<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.850> mouth<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.180> open<00:03:44.210> I<00:03:44.660> like<00:03:44.840> to

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
low since the mouth is open I like to

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:53.940 
low since the mouth is open I like to
put<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.380> bit<00:03:45.470> higher

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.050 

and<00:03:54.550> then<00:03:54.819> for<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.420> ears<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:56.459> like<00:03:57.459> them<00:03:57.670> to<00:03:57.880> be

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
and then for the ears I like them to be

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.449 
and then for the ears I like them to be
the<00:03:58.540> top<00:03:58.750> of<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.989> ears<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.590> just<00:03:59.890> a<00:04:00.010> little<00:04:00.340> bit

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
the top of the ears is just a little bit

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.430 
the top of the ears is just a little bit
below<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.819> top<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.599> eye<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:04.290> then<00:04:05.290> it

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
below the top of the eye and then it

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.620 
below the top of the eye and then it
comes<00:04:05.680> down<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:06.430> little<00:04:07.300> bit<00:04:07.660> below<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.319> eye

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.360 

there's<00:04:13.630> really<00:04:13.870> so<00:04:14.200> many<00:04:14.380> ways<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.950> do<00:04:15.190> this

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
there's really so many ways to do this

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.300 
there's really so many ways to do this
this<00:04:15.640> is<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:16.030> kind<00:04:16.989> of<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.500> process<00:04:17.919> I<00:04:18.100> go

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
this is just kind of the process I go

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.569 
this is just kind of the process I go
through<00:04:18.609> in<00:04:18.730> my<00:04:18.910> head<00:04:19.180> when<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:19.690> draw<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.579> then

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
through in my head when I draw and then

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.640 
through in my head when I draw and then
the<00:04:22.570> neck<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:24.510> usually<00:04:25.510> I<00:04:25.930> don't<00:04:26.290> really<00:04:26.500> know

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
the neck is usually I don't really know

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.830 
the neck is usually I don't really know
how<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.800> explain<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:30.419> rough<00:04:31.419> it's<00:04:31.750> a

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
how to explain this it's rough it's a

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.480 
how to explain this it's rough it's a
little<00:04:32.050> bit<00:04:32.169> wider<00:04:32.530> than<00:04:32.919> the<00:04:33.040> distance

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
little bit wider than the distance

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.240 
little bit wider than the distance
between<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:34.090> eyes<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:34.600> I've<00:04:34.750> drawn<00:04:34.990> here

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
between the eyes that I've drawn here

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.250 
between the eyes that I've drawn here
it's<00:04:36.250> really<00:04:36.550> whatever<00:04:37.150> style<00:04:37.479> you<00:04:37.750> prefer

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
it's really whatever style you prefer

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.469 
it's really whatever style you prefer
and<00:04:38.979> if<00:04:39.100> it's<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.340> male<00:04:39.550> character<00:04:39.790> of<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.270> neck

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
and if it's a male character of the neck

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.850 
and if it's a male character of the neck
will<00:04:40.750> be<00:04:40.960> wider<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:44.110> just<00:04:44.320> play<00:04:44.500> around<00:04:44.710> with

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
will be wider and just play around with

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.430 
will be wider and just play around with
it<00:04:45.010> until<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.310> find<00:04:45.930> what<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.110> like<00:04:49.290> I'm<00:04:50.290> just

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
it until you find what you like I'm just

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.310 
it until you find what you like I'm just
gonna<00:04:50.560> finish<00:04:50.950> up<00:04:51.250> my<00:04:51.490> eyes<00:04:51.669> here<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.419> once

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
gonna finish up my eyes here and once

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.320 
gonna finish up my eyes here and once
you've<00:04:53.560> drawn<00:04:54.010> all<00:04:54.250> this<00:04:54.400> in<00:04:54.669> roughly<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.210> can

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
you've drawn all this in roughly you can

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:10.570 
you've drawn all this in roughly you can
go<00:04:55.479> back<00:04:55.720> and<00:04:56.020> erase<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.889> guidelines<00:04:57.400> we<00:04:57.669> made

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580
