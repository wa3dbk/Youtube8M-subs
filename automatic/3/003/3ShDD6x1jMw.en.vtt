00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
just have to make a car catch fire next

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.840 
just have to make a car catch fire next
to<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.229> car<00:02:01.740> will<00:02:01.860> explode<00:02:02.280> blow

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
to it and then the car will explode blow

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609 
to it and then the car will explode blow
up<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.270> sand<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.630> cog<00:02:03.899> enter<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.439> then<00:02:04.469> you

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
up the sand a cog enter and then you

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.319 
up the sand a cog enter and then you
just<00:02:04.770> push<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:04.979> back<00:02:05.250> with<00:02:05.520> tank<00:02:05.969> or<00:02:06.119> fire
