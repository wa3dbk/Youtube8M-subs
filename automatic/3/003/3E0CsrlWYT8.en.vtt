00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 erratic passes like you well brand 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.600
 but not only was it much we were in 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.710
 general erratic in the first time I 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.940
 I think in the second half the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.280
 changes gave us absolutely another 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.110
 Football dynamics think we could 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.420
 overflow a lot on the outside that I think 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.949
 that we could have much more mobility 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.750
 the contribution was for having a boy who 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.189
 came in michael jackson quiñones this one 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.350
 it gave a different dynamic to the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.529
 midfield and I think this initial 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.789
 he ran a lot in all of them at all 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.890
 sectors of court I think we had 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.539
 another dynamic at another pace we had more 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.030
 actions and fewer breaks and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.399
 We fundamentally improve the pass in 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.030
 general lines of the team that's why I think 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.129
 that the tie is highly justified 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.760
 leonardo following question mola 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.760
 watchtower radio 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.590
 hello teacher good night good 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.600
 Good evening nights with all teacher 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.910
 it was shown that he has emelec 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.129
 deficiencies by the air game perhaps 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.870
 is a way to hurt him in the 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.110
 return match 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.350
 not all matches are the same is that 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.089
 always one finds errors or successes 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.790
 in all the matches is the magic of 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.340
 soccer us this if we bet a lot 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.070
 to the air game because we have the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.420
 players and the condition of that 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.210
 including the professor osvaldo canobbio 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.810
 works many, many hours at the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.880
 week with the ball game still is 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.840
 something that we have done 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.020
 throughout the semester I would not know if 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.429
 tell them if you have deficiencies in the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.820
 picture of emelec if I know that we 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.950
 we have power we have good footing for 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.580
 to work that and then then what 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.580
 we take full advantage 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.450
 Professor, good evening, well, nights in 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.850
 when I moved here the wheel 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.710
 Press 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.290
 many fans told me to ask the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.720
 professor because michael jackson quiñones 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.360
 not from the beginning but for a stage 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.670
 complementary and with respect to the tie 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.700
 teacher here in the middle is said of 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.940
 drowned in the hat this tie own 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.580
 Thank you 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.080
 the rest is clearly this is 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.330
 strategic us this let's say that 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.790
 as coaches we know what the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.980
 moments or we think we know what the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.470
 best moments for each game to 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.640
 Every player 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.400
 many times michael has been the owner 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.950
 mario martínez has been the owner and many 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.450
 times have entered the second time 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.300
 the truth that they are not explanations that 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.970
 I can give this publicly because it has 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.000
 what to do with the privacy of the campus 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.840
 then this one we know that we have 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.970
 with maikel because he is a great player 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.060
 this and that at any time can 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.530
 be a holder or substitute and as for the 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.950
 tie for us this is a match 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.590
 Mr. 190 minutes recently the same 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.290
 first time we go 11 does not change us 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.290
 playing at home or away or 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.640
 manabí or in machala or wherever 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.200
 we have won the vast majority of 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.330
 points in this second stage of 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.500
 visitor then this one we're 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.880
 used to this 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.820
 no, I do not think there's still a trial 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.830
 definitive of what may happen in the 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.780
 future but yes I think we had 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.550
 a great comeback more than anything 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.860
 emotional spiritual in the second 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.380
 next time question he is from the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.380
 candle magallanes 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.510
 thank you teacher good night before the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.379
 presence of caicedo bolaños and oyola in 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:52.879
 the midfield what was the intention and if 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:54.230
 is that it turned out and because look Miss 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.750
 explanation of the three flyers in the 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.170
 medium is to contain a very game 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.920
 fast you have to have emelec 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.409
 from the two containment flyers 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.150
 towards forward where where 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:09.319
 we knew that he was going to put people fast 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.690
 this and they have a game of understanding 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.170
 it's a long time this he is going to be very 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.130
 alright then somehow the 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.519
 location of the front end will be for 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.989
 neutralize what they had as 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.260
 as strong in this and his second 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.450
 ask forgiveness 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.450
 I complement the question with another 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.120
 if you know the only thing that was not inside 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.720
 what we calculate and have to 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.250
 watch 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.100
 journalists that they understand that I 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.040
 I never talk about the results but 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:56.570
 we have played in three in one 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:59.570
 week three games this and sometimes the 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.340
 motor coordination is altered by 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.690
 by the fatigue that accumulates not 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.910
 were three simple matches were 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.820
 three games where we played in two in 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.640
 three and in four courts the attention the 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.510
 pressure fatigue height 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.030
 travels 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.850
 we had visitors all week east 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.680
 makes a natural wear that did not 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.990
 emelec emelec had the possibility of 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.970
 rest the team and just on Sunday 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.650
 we will be matched as to 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.020
 pressure in terms of attention regarding 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.320
 tiredness and that today happened to us 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.560
 a little bit gives us the last bill 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.210
 Question Andrey Radio Carrion 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.690
 basin excellence 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.720
 very kind teacher israel good evening 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.419
 in summary, teacher is a tie with flavor 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.759
 to victory a tie with a tie flavor 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.759
 a tie with flavor to defeat what is your 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:53.370
 opinion is that in a final until the 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.840
 last minute there is no one there is no 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.130
 balance 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.770
 in winning does not ensure the championship 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.330
 obviously losing complicates a draw 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.000
 the chance of both is kept alive 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.400
 teams the result is part of what 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.979
 we could think because this is not 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.680
 it's a 95 minute match this is a 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.270
 190 minute match and these matches 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.320
 they are long and you have to play and what 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.570
 first thing to do is not 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.220
 lose them to be able to win and we 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.110
 we are on that path I think that in 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:26.300
 final the tie 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.310
 it generates a force for us 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.740
 tremendous in these 34 days to rest 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.710
 and go out and look for the championship many 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.030
 thanks to all the best education 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:40.460
 barcelona between morning from 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:44.440
 4 and a half in the afternoon 4 and a half 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.440
 the afternoon very well thank you very much
