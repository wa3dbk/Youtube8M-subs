 People who walks not youtube 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.790
 Welcome to this new video tutorial 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.759
 this time I'm going to teach you how to create 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.410
 a cover for your biography of 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.869
 Facebook 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.550
 I already know that this topic is very basic but 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.520
 like there are still people who do not know 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.950
 how to create it and well I'll give you more 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.590
 that nothing measures and then 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.000
 practically the bases no good we're going to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.230
 start me this time I'm going to use 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.790
 photoshop we will create a new file 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:42.360
 the dimensions are 720 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.360
 x 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.530
 266 I think it 's new 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.050
 rectified since I have already done them and if 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.910
 I am correct so there are no errors 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.089
 there ok 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.969
 This is the measure that I use and good 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.229
 Well, let's start, I'll do it 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.200
 so fast I already have some brushes 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.840
 predetermined I have some styles 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.630
 more than anything 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.869
 let's say it's going to be as easy as 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.010
 I'm going to do and well, it's practically 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.980
 for this tutorial more than anything for 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.720
 that this video does not stretch so long 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.050
 I will try to do it as fast as 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.780
 can so I'm going to start putting a 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.870
 I'm going to leave a fund like this 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.860
 I'm going to put a text in orange 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.860
 this case is going to be 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.900
 93 ok 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.600

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.420
 and well everyone can edit as 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.369

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.930

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.299
 I'm going to leave it like that, really, nothing more 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.430
 it's to give you the bases, truth you 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.970

 they will create it to your liking 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.660
 let me return to the brush 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:57.459
 it is already and well then what else do I put 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.500

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.540
 fact of what 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.320
 together the profile photo with the banner is 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.830
 I could say and well I create an image or 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:38.310
 a photo so different from the others and 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.650
 good can give your style a lot of style 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.490
 cover to your facebook biography you 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.670
 can give 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.250
 elegant and well then we will 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.570
 create it I'm going to keep it 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.570
 a jpg format 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:58.030
 I'm going to keep it, I'm going to put the 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.520
 maximum quality 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.800
 because like to put it on facebook 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.819
 quality is lost 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.210
 okay 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.910
 let me good and I go 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:18.050
 upload and we will upload the one that we just 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.300
 create obviously is very ugly but good 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.060
 It's a quick thing for you to know 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.250
 more or less the measurements and how he read 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.640
 well here I already spend a lot of the photo 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.700
 in profile was an approx as I told you and 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.710
 As you can see, they do not move and here 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:40.070
 you as I tell you with your imagination 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:42.590
 can this then create what they want 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.120
 for example I have these images of 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.370
 cover but it was previously 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.230
 previously if everything was fine but 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.030
 they made bigger what is being 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.880
 the profile picture and already 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.409
 because it was not the same, this was the one 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.659
 I had old I had this too 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:08.539
 and well I think that nothing else those two in 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:10.949
 this on this facebook page but 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:14.489
 as I tell you they made the 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:17.159
 profile picture you can see where 

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:18.989
 the picture and the picture of 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:22.800
 hour profile reaches halfway through the 

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:25.199
 that is, it is easy to enlarge 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.879
 a lot and good practically how 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.639
 I say you can do well what 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:33.259
 be with your imagination you can put 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.259
