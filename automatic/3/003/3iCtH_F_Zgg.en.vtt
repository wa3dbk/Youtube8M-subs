00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
or which is not defined here so every

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.399

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
other button basically bought one or two

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.510 
other button basically bought one or two
and<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:14.430> goes<00:01:14.909> down<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.720> path<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:17.310> case

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and it goes down this path so this case

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.420 
and it goes down this path so this case
this<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.119> basic<00:01:18.630> example<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.770> color<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
this really basic example the color is a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.719 
this really basic example the color is a
busy<00:01:20.939> signal<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.130> could<00:01:23.280> also<00:01:23.400> put<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
busy signal but you could also put a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.960 
busy signal but you could also put a
recording<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.220> sent<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
recording here and go to and sent to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.390 
recording here and go to and sent to
call<00:01:27.150> her<00:01:27.240> back<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.930> point<00:01:28.170> where<00:01:28.470> they

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
call her back to this point where they

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.359 
call her back to this point where they
can<00:01:29.610> select<00:01:30.270> again<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.159> down<00:01:32.340> here

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
can select again and the one down here

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.410 
can select again and the one down here
this<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:34.009> timeout<00:01:35.009> extension<00:01:35.520> t<00:01:35.970> extension

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
this is a timeout extension t extension

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.249 
this is a timeout extension t extension
so<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.290> case<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:39.509> caller<00:01:39.720> needs<00:01:39.930> more<00:01:40.140> than

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
so in case the caller needs more than

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.370 
so in case the caller needs more than
five<00:01:40.470> seconds<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.820> goes<00:01:42.060> down<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.689> you

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
five seconds it goes down here and you

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.560 
five seconds it goes down here and you
can<00:01:43.530> play<00:01:44.009> another<00:01:44.280> message<00:01:44.640> here<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:45.090> give

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.240 
that I'm this example is by the way
using<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.340> text<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.850> speech<00:02:32.120> engine<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:33.290> you

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
using the text to speech engine so you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.620 
using the text to speech engine so you
just<00:02:34.430> enter<00:02:34.790> some<00:02:35.030> text<00:02:35.060> here<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:37.330> then<00:02:38.330> the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
just enter some text here and then the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.110 
just enter some text here and then the
text-to-speech<00:02:39.080> engine<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.950> going<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.460> we<00:02:40.940> did

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
text-to-speech engine is going to we did

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.330 
text-to-speech engine is going to we did
to<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:43.090> think<00:02:44.290> just<00:02:45.290> tied<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:49.010> I'm<00:02:49.130> going<00:02:49.310> to

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
to you I think just tied so I'm going to

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.800 
to you I think just tied so I'm going to
use<00:02:49.490> my<00:02:49.520> cell<00:02:49.850> phone<00:02:50.060> again<00:02:52.540> press<00:02:53.540> 1<00:02:53.780> for

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
use my cell phone again press 1 for

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.080 
use my cell phone again press 1 for
English<00:02:54.500> press<00:02:54.530> this<00:02:55.310> is<00:02:55.460> a<00:02:55.490> type<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:55.730> speech

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
English press this is a type of speech

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.440 
English press this is a type of speech
engine<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:57.170> we're<00:02:57.410> gonna<00:02:57.500> choose<00:02:57.830> German

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
engine so we're gonna choose German

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.870 
engine so we're gonna choose German
philosophy<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.660> how<00:02:59.900> into<00:03:00.650> German<00:03:01.010> Thank<00:03:01.760> You

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
philosophy and how into German Thank You

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.100 
philosophy and how into German Thank You
fati<00:03:02.060> I'm<00:03:02.570> not<00:03:03.020> gonna<00:03:03.200> do<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:04.930> gives<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.050> an

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
fati I'm not gonna do that gives you an

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.980 
fati I'm not gonna do that gives you an
idea<00:03:06.170> what<00:03:06.890> is<00:03:07.220> possible<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.420> text<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.750> speech

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
idea what is possible so text to speech

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.720 
idea what is possible so text to speech
engine<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:10.070> set<00:03:10.670> language<00:03:11.320> all<00:03:12.320> right<00:03:12.500> um<00:03:12.730> one

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
engine and set language all right um one

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.290 
engine and set language all right um one
more<00:03:13.760> example<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:17.600> also<00:03:17.750> got<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:19.610> if<00:03:19.970> what

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
more example you also got and if what

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.070 
more example you also got and if what
you<00:03:20.560> like<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.680> any<00:03:21.830> programming<00:03:22.250> language<00:03:23.080> you

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
you like in any programming language you

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.980 
you like in any programming language you
get<00:03:24.230> if<00:03:24.500> statements<00:03:25.190> so<00:03:25.880> if<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:26.720> want<00:03:26.959> to

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
get if statements so if you want to

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.170 
get if statements so if you want to
decide<00:03:27.350> for<00:03:27.730> certain<00:03:28.730> from<00:03:29.209> what<00:03:29.450> happens
