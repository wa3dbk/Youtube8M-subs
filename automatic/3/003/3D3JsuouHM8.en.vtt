off with that is a gas mask it does not

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.950 
off with that is a gas mask it does not
cover<00:00:11.460> your<00:00:11.730> ears<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:14.210> yeah<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.360> comes<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
cover your ears and yeah it comes with a

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:33.700 
cover your ears and yeah it comes with a
fan<00:00:16.699> and<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:18.600> detach<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.230> by<00:00:19.470> twisting<00:00:20.039> it

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.290 

like<00:00:35.840> when<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> button<00:00:38.270> right<00:00:39.270> here

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
like when you have a button right here

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.569 
like when you have a button right here
on<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> side<00:00:41.329> hold<00:00:42.329> on

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
on the side hold on

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.910 
on the side hold on
there<00:00:44.579> when<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.789> press<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.559> has<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> little

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
there when you press it it has a little

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.709 
there when you press it it has a little
fan<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.550> think<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.180> lasts<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.600> eight

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
fan and I think it lasts for eight

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.660 
fan and I think it lasts for eight
minutes<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> time<00:00:49.530> then<00:00:49.770> automatic<00:00:50.430> it's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
minutes at a time then automatic it's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.860 
minutes at a time then automatic it's
off<00:00:51.199> save<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.410> battery<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:54.000> helps<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.719> lot

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
off save your battery and it helps a lot

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.900 
off save your battery and it helps a lot
with<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.980> doesn't<00:00:56.010> fogged<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.699> with

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
with that so it doesn't fogged up with

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.500 
with that so it doesn't fogged up with
the<00:00:57.000> mask<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.190> it's<00:00:59.190> really<00:00:59.489> awesome<00:01:00.090> that
