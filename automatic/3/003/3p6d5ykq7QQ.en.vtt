00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:09.120
 now and again with new ones 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:11.130
 Additions new entrances to analogue organ 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.440
 here still a bus in it so the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.330
 Have to see where I get under one 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.210
 hammond commodore slightly smaller model 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:25.130
 like the elegant one as well 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:31.430
 excellent leslie sound top condition 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:34.880
 from a budget resolution where it is too 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.880
 next organ 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.660
 here is the galaxy we come 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.660
 not further 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.020
 then here is the next object and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.210
 though a thomas organ 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:57.770
 the special thing about this thomas organ is 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.770
 the integrated moog synthesizer 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:07.020
 this is a mob satellite 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.770
 or satellite or satellite with the man 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.189
 just create the most different sound 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.540
 It can actually be an organ 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.840
 was not planned, but it is more or less 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.700
 been a gift 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.780
 Also here is the pedal here 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.189
 belongs to inhibit concorde commodore then 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.630
 here also very special looks funny 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.159
 old slot machine, yes synonymous get that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.920
 you then with and here then something else 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.509
 special 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.710
 when I almost got the door out, that came 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.399
 even a nasty and a nasty 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.820
 professional piano to the model can 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.640
 I say nothing at all I know 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.170
 not yet but it seems to be 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.189
 work because if you turn on 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.380
 come already different 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.549
 light diodes and so on I have to go 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.290
 hang an external amplifier 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.950
 thoroughly clean but otherwise 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:12.090
 tip top condition, however, the bank 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:17.430
 for the inhibit commodore here is still 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:23.459
 the bank for the thomas and here is 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.750
 what else is this for piano makers and 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.250
 Although you can play some piano on it 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.800
 pack and you can turn that over 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.700
 men working on the piano it 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.410
 I do not really need it though 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.810
 and admit if someone has the thing 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.330
 want or know or be familiar with it 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.030
 can put piano upside down then can 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.860
 he likes to ask 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.920
 I think there will definitely be one 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.920
 me yes that was it first of me again
