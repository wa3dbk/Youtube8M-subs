00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.990
 for me 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.440
 ah 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.970
 good 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.920
 friends, I tell you that in this 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.920
 occasion the games with cameras and 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.600
 microphones to meet the lord 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.029
 austreberto garcía arias who very 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.430
 kindly invited us to his house a 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.890
 very special place to share the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.870
 its different figures made of wax 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.720
 who are characters that have marked 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.180
 his life and the most interesting thing about this 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.280
 reportage is that these dolls that now 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.040
 you're going to see were made by the 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.340
 hands and time of this great person to 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.739
 a size similar to ours 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.230
 interesting truth yes look at them I talk 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.120
 what started as a fun in his 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.250
 childhood today has become his 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.350
 favorite pastime but what happens that 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.890
 being a boy had that kind of ideas from 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.979
 do someday things 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.120
 bigger then doing little soldiers 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.270
 of lead 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.190
 already with the passage of time it occurred to me 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.880
 make them in wax because I liked the 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.760
 natural size but perform each of 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.920
 these dolls has not been an easy task anymore 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.380
 that for the final realization of each 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.050
 one of them has to read a lot 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.270
 about who I was doing to how 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.120
 behaved with those of the people and 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.610
 to give them an even more special touch and 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.900
 Real also dresses according to who 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.990
 It was in our history 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.660
 for this Mr. austreberto also 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.390
 he has become a collector 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.430
 has objects that he has been collecting 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.670
 throughout his life since he was a 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.860
 child like you but how do you do anything 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.440
 then look to start making a 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.290
 character of these the adventure begins 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.440
 in the books since with it investigates 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.110
 life and work of each person for later 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.350
 get the sidewalk more they had with the one 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.220
 each figure once made ready don 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.410
 austreberto tells us what 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.320
 and I make the figure I try to see all the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.460
 angles and I make the face then I do 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.410
 then in play dough later I do it in 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.170
 a mold I take out a mold in plaster after 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.900
 I do the casting on it will expire and 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.990
 later his eyes are added and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.600
 finally it paints this process takes 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.350
 also another day 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.130
 the case is that the figure 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.590
 well determining the weekend well 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.360
 that for a doll to be ready as 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.600
 Today you can see them on your screen 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.750
 it takes about a week to have it 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.510
 standing and wearing clothes and their creativity 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.430
 the patience and love that he has for art 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.230
 of making wax dolls have been 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.300
 essential elements to have 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.610
 made over time more than 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.920
 40 wax figures with nostalgia the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.200
 mister austreberto garcía tells us that 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.780
 each doll goes beyond a value 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.550
 economic to do these characters 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.340
 of history they have left a 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.060
 satisfaction as a person and everyone 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.580
 has moved to a stage of his childhood 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.350
 then how to remember the past 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.640
 remember my childhood 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.940
 and try to express what we are going to read 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.490
 now he was lost in reading 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.160
 then reading all this time of 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:44.560
 adventure 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.560
 they keep me going 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.290
 somewhat childish or not lose that that 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.780
 childhood good bugs this has been the 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.250
