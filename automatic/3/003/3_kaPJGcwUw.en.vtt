you'll notice it's a TDM and that's
quite<00:01:15.509> important<00:01:15.899> obviously<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.470> TDM

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
quite important obviously because TDM

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.010 
quite important obviously because TDM
wasn't<00:01:17.310> even<00:01:17.580> around<00:01:18.060> when<00:01:18.390> gives<00:01:18.690> all<00:01:18.810> one

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
wasn't even around when gives all one

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.449 
wasn't even around when gives all one
come<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.709> quite<00:01:19.860> nice<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.160> see<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
come out so it's quite nice to see that

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:24.249 
come out so it's quite nice to see that
they<00:01:20.550> brought<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.910> back<00:01:21.679> also<00:01:22.679> it's<00:01:22.950> TDM<00:01:23.459> 4v4

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
they brought that back also it's TDM 4v4

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.449 
they brought that back also it's TDM 4v4
so<00:01:25.259> it'll<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.530> quite<00:01:25.740> interesting<00:01:26.160> to<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.399> how

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:26.459 
so it'll be quite interesting to see how

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:29.330 
so it'll be quite interesting to see how
that<00:01:26.640> works<00:01:26.819> out<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:28.470> obviously<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.039> can<00:01:29.190> see

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
that works out so obviously you can see

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.370 
that works out so obviously you can see
that<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.640> was<00:01:30.060> recorded<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.599> a<00:01:30.750> phone<00:01:31.080> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that this was recorded with a phone and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.839 
that this was recorded with a phone and
the<00:01:31.560> quality<00:01:31.709> offices<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.490> good<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:32.849 
the quality offices in that good of the

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:35.540 
the quality offices in that good of the
images<00:01:33.179> but<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.740> video<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.039> no<00:01:35.280> better<00:01:35.459> either

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
images but the video is no better either

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.850 
images but the video is no better either
it<00:01:36.179> is<00:01:36.390> pretty<00:01:36.599> grainy<00:01:36.959> is<00:01:37.140> pretty<00:01:37.440> bad<00:01:37.679> but

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it is pretty grainy is pretty bad but

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.139 
it is pretty grainy is pretty bad but
you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.099> definitely<00:01:38.310> tell<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.789> difference

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
you can definitely tell the difference

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.930 
you can definitely tell the difference
in<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.360> lighting<00:01:39.929> and<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> whole<00:01:41.190> map<00:01:41.459> itself

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
in the lighting and the whole map itself

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.240 
in the lighting and the whole map itself
is<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.630> different<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.440> terms<00:01:43.679> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.130> way

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
is just so different in terms of the way

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.580 
is just so different in terms of the way
it<00:01:44.369> looks<00:01:44.660> before<00:01:45.660> many<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.050> guys<00:01:46.229> asked
