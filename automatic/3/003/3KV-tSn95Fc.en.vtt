00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.359
 thank you 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.599
 a performance not like that we asked ourselves on the radio 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 apart from what I see also the first mention of the radio when 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.640
 even a little breakage yes 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.750
 forgiveness first 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.570
 for 100 th so I try to do things a little seriously since 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.279
 I usually do silly and ridiculous things on the internet 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.259
 when my name is fund manager 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.539
 led one knows me on the internet sometimes on the cdo you know cold and we 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.750
 so has that the game was worried parent sir stone journet she 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.050
 still super newspaper mouths the purchase and will not leave 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.870
 to make a movie spell 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.790
 % 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.370
 noon 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.310
 acoustic from line 6 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.670
 Warning 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.730
 a guitar lent by the n 6 gentlemen ladies 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.970
 and so this sparkle guitar battery axis 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.530
 and this is the acoustic version of this range 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.390
 so we will try censorship properly 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.770
 and for those to see a little everything we can do with her this little 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.720
 wonder and nobody wants it I love 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.870
 so we'll start with the instrument itself so it's a guitar 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.150
 if the tower 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
 in e then the guitar yes sorry we said we were very serious 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.750
 the guitar were not invented odyssey 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.440
 bamba prejudge the 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.440
 the fact that you know what a guitar is 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.230
 in europe directly attacked on one side in 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.600
 there is a mechanical string handle nothing but the classic 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.200
 and a piece to the final europe 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.860
 we wait we expect an acoustic guitar start you see 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.220
 but in fact the publisher and the toxins that it does not sound by the box of 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.350
 resonance nanometers 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.350
 finally listen earlier to 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.370
 and so in fact why of how of because by those that 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.810
 everything is modeled 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.690
 and actually rivers 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.299
 this beautiful rose to which is totally dummy 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.109
 elia on the easel 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:13.089
 a large part if you are a microbot more than elsewhere a sensor per command 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:15.220
 because everyone had treated independently 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.339
 and all that happens after all that makes the value of the guitar 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.980
 if m of electronics to model December actually 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.849
 any modeled grief 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.849
 it's a bit of the trademark of line 6 anyway 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.919
 she turned editors we see besides a so a large plate 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.919
 black that must be I imagine access to all this electronics 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.149
 in which one can 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:44.149
 the carousel put the drivers since this guitar 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.229
 mine will produce a sumptuous by the dga acts 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.309
 since again this is modeling trust are real 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:53.109
 netapp makes it so 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.720
 feeding is done either by his studies that's it 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.209
 6 he leaves 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.699
 which are supposed to be about ten hours of autonomy 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:05.629
 joy one I think you can put a pin up volte for two hours 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.319
 autonomy 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.800
 but the simplest percent is still used percent 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.120
 not me I'm not going to have fun flattening 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.140
 finally I saw there is a pedal that is powered and that finally comes 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.140
 active and social already fueled all that 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.919
 so that allowing on stage to be autonomous with a sector 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.699
 at the time precisely because its output there are plenty of jacques heuclin 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.349
 site obviously and there is one hundred percent something I do not know what 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.959
 I'm sorry 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.739
 it looks like a network jack 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.499
 I was told it was for a 20% piloting 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.439
 in addition to vegetables I do not know 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.369
 will have to search the internet 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:49.249
 % that's it for the guitar itself so% I just wanted to say 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.089
 that she is absolutely 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:53.119
 super easy to play 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.299
 it feels more like being on a 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.889
 it feels more like being on an electric guitar 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.069
 she is very compact 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.239
 very very low action the strings are very low 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.579
 yet very very easy to play 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.429
 % of which there are fasteners for assembly 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.319
 I think we can go back to the station 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.629
 ap 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.930
 so we go apathetic 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.959
 Poitiers last thing anyway for the controllers% near the handle 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.060
 it actually comes from two buttons 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.120
 the only button a very big buttons with the name of the guitars 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.669
 which will be used to choose which guitar to model 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.870
 what kind of guitar 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.750
 and let's continue to three-pistoles white and black laurent 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.349
 one for the volume 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.559
 a power 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:41.129
 in e for compression and reached for the position of the modeled micro 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.350
 these buttons the cia finally has a combinatorics of its buttons will allow 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:46.199
 as well 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.129
 we will see 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.029
 later for more use 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:53.990
 to be able to change tunings and to be able to change some are in progress 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.150
 we'll see that in a second part for now 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.259
 branchaud the day before 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.029
 be careful
