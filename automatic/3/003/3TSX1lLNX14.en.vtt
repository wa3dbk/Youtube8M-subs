they<00:00:07.919> last<00:00:08.130> years<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.700> personally<00:00:09.599> have<00:00:09.780> ten<00:00:10.290> of

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
they last years I personally have ten of

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.520 
they last years I personally have ten of
them<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.679> have<00:00:10.800> had<00:00:11.370> 15<00:00:11.820> years<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.530> they

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
them that have had 15 years and they

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.560 
them that have had 15 years and they
allow<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.400> plants<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.849> get<00:00:15.030> really<00:00:15.360> big

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
allow the plants to get really big

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.420 
allow the plants to get really big
because<00:00:15.750> there's<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.109> lot<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.440> soil<00:00:16.650> capacity

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
because there's a lot of soil capacity

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.390 
because there's a lot of soil capacity
which<00:00:17.970> holds<00:00:18.330> water<00:00:18.539> which<00:00:19.170> means<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:20.310> don't

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
which holds water which means you don't

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.830 
which holds water which means you don't
have<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.640> water<00:00:20.820> as<00:00:21.029> much<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
have to water as much and you have a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.359 
have to water as much and you have a
larger<00:00:22.199> root<00:00:22.380> system<00:00:22.769> which<00:00:22.920> means<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.220> bigger

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
larger root system which means a bigger

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.859 
larger root system which means a bigger
plant<00:00:23.640> simple<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.480> that

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
plant simple as that

drainage but in general that hole is

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
going to cook in there when you get it

going to cook in there when you get it
first<00:00:31.019> thing<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.230> need<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.309> need

first thing you need to do is you need

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.610 
first thing you need to do is you need
to<00:00:32.489> pull<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.759> cork<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.510> provide<00:00:34.260> proper

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
to pull the cork out and provide proper

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.650 
to pull the cork out and provide proper
drainage<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.399> case<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.360> hasn't

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
drainage in this case that hasn't

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.440 
drainage in this case that hasn't
happened<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:38.370> another<00:00:38.730> thing<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> want

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
happened and another thing is you want

happened and another thing is you want
to<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.629> your<00:00:39.809> drainage<00:00:40.260> holes<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> sides

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to have your drainage holes on the sides

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.240 
to have your drainage holes on the sides
of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.280> barrel<00:00:41.600> simply<00:00:42.600> because<00:00:42.899> when<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
of the barrel simply because when if you

of the barrel simply because when if you
have<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> bottom<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.180> don't<00:00:45.329> have

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
have it on the bottom and you don't have

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.819 
have it on the bottom and you don't have
proper<00:00:45.690> drainage<00:00:45.899> underneath<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> barrel

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
proper drainage underneath the barrel

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.310 
proper drainage underneath the barrel
what<00:00:47.610> happens<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> rain<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> get<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
what happens is the rain if you get a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.660 
what happens is the rain if you get a
prolonged<00:00:49.710> period<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.010> rain<00:00:50.280> or<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
prolonged period of rain or you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.639 
prolonged period of rain or you
overwater<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.930> weight<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> barrel

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
overwater the weight of the barrel

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.560 
overwater the weight of the barrel
itself<00:00:52.890> pushes<00:00:53.370> down<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> doesn't<00:00:54.360> allow

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
itself pushes down and it doesn't allow

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.720 
itself pushes down and it doesn't allow
the<00:00:54.600> water<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.079> drain<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> bottom<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.399> in

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the water to drain out the bottom so in

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.430 
the water to drain out the bottom so in
essence<00:00:57.059> what<00:00:57.180> happens<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.960> thing<00:00:58.140> fills

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
essence what happens is it thing fills

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.170 
essence what happens is it thing fills
up<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> water<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> whiskey

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
up the water and you get a whiskey

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.590 
up the water and you get a whiskey
barrel<00:01:00.329> full<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.629> water<00:01:01.670> now<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> suggest

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
barrel full of water now what I suggest

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
barrel full of water now what I suggest
is<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.500> drill<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> holes<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> side<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
is you drill the holes on the side of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.760 
is you drill the holes on the side of
the<00:01:05.880> barrel<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.780> want<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> drill<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> holes

the barrel you want to drill the holes

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.490 
the barrel you want to drill the holes
four<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.790> them<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> sides<00:01:09.840> all<00:01:10.140> around<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
four of them on the sides all around the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.690 
four of them on the sides all around the
barrel

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.470 

I<00:01:15.890> said<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.010> you<00:01:17.100> don't<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.090> plants<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
I said if you don't do that the plants a

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.600 
I said if you don't do that the plants a
little<00:01:18.690> good<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:19.050> first<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.800> know<00:01:20.010> if<00:01:20.370> it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
little good at first you know if it

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.210 
little good at first you know if it
never<00:01:20.820> rains<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:22.140> water<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
never rains and you water it as you

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.290 
never rains and you water it as you
normally<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.730> look<00:01:23.850> good<00:01:23.910> for<00:01:24.120> a<00:01:24.180> long

there's<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> couple<00:01:37.800> of<00:01:37.920> reasons<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.310> reasons

there's a couple of reasons we reasons

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.740 
there's a couple of reasons we reasons
why<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.180> use<00:01:39.300> a<00:01:39.330> peat<00:01:39.660> moss<00:01:39.780> primarily<00:01:40.770> it's

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
why we use a peat moss primarily it's

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.180 
why we use a peat moss primarily it's
sterilized<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.020> been<00:01:43.170> heated<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.590> 180

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.010 
sterilized it's been heated up to 180

that there's no seeds for weeds no weed
seed<00:01:52.440> so<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.650> know<00:01:52.710> when<00:01:53.010> you<00:01:53.100> put<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.340> in

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
seed so you know when you put it in
there<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.670> only<00:01:53.700> thing<00:01:53.940> it's<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.210> grow

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
there the only thing it's going to grow

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.590 
there the only thing it's going to grow
in<00:01:54.600> there<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:54.870> plan<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.760> and<00:01:56.760> then<00:01:56.970> beyond

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
in there your plan and and then beyond

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
in there your plan and and then beyond
that<00:01:57.690> it's<00:01:57.870> very<00:01:58.410> absorbent<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.040> lot<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.340> people

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that it's very absorbent a lot of people

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.670 
that it's very absorbent a lot of people
say<00:02:00.210> jeez<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.540> don't<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.840> using<00:02:01.050> that<00:02:01.200> parting

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
say jeez I don't like using that parting

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.890 
say jeez I don't like using that parting
that<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.190> Pro<00:02:02.910> mix<00:02:03.120> simply<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:03.720> it

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
that that Pro mix simply because it

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.820 
that that Pro mix simply because it
dries<00:02:04.110> out<00:02:04.290> fast

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
dries out fast

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.740 
dries out fast
it<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.340> doesn't<00:02:05.580> dry<00:02:05.850> out<00:02:05.880> any<00:02:06.270> faster

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
it really doesn't dry out any faster

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.180 
it really doesn't dry out any faster
than<00:02:06.810> anything<00:02:07.080> else<00:02:07.320> what<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.770> does<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.070> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
than anything else what it does is it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.070 
than anything else what it does is it
allows<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.429> roots<00:02:08.760> to<00:02:09.060> grow<00:02:09.179> very<00:02:09.929> rapidly

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
allows the roots to grow very rapidly

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.190 
allows the roots to grow very rapidly
and<00:02:10.770> because<00:02:11.490> you<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.360> many<00:02:12.450> roots<00:02:12.750> they

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and because you have so many roots they

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.870 
and because you have so many roots they
efficiently<00:02:13.860> use<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.220> water<00:02:14.460> that's<00:02:14.700> in

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
efficiently use the water that's in

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.640 
efficiently use the water that's in
there<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.270> that's<00:02:15.720> what<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.990> want<00:02:16.200> more

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
there and that's what you want more

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.130 
there and that's what you want more
roots<00:02:16.950> big<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> plant<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:18.330> allows<00:02:18.660> more<00:02:18.930> root

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
roots big a plant this allows more root

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.740 
roots big a plant this allows more root
Shawn<00:02:19.620> then<00:02:19.890> adds<00:02:20.130> time-released<00:02:20.880> fertilizer

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
Shawn then adds time-released fertilizer

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.900 
Shawn then adds time-released fertilizer
now<00:02:22.020> most<00:02:22.230> greenhouses<00:02:22.680> use<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> three<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.700> four

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
now most greenhouses use a three to four

depleted<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.360> what<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:36.690> do<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.080> use<00:02:37.230> a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
depleted so what I do is I use a

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.370 
depleted so what I do is I use a
landscaping<00:02:38.090> version<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.140> takes

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
landscaping version of it and it takes

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.890 
landscaping version of it and it takes
you<00:02:40.530> all<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.680> way<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.920> September<00:02:41.640> October<00:02:41.900> so
