00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.200
 and fusion solders use heat 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.970
 to melt the base metals in many 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.100
 sagna metal welding operations 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.840
 of contribution a welding operation 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.950
 where we add metal contribution 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.950
 called autogenous welding 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.060
 in this video we will talk about a 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.650
 modern tool for blacksmiths the 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.050
 Welding cutting arc welding torch 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.610
 has a little bit of history the works 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.660
 of the soldiers by mental of thousand 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.180
 before Christ in weapons and tools 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.650
 made by the peoples of the Mediterranean 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.760
 since ancient times they closed it sometimes 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.470
 advance you were heating the iron 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.000
 high temperatures in an anthill 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.770
 cutting or welding with hammers 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.239
 Anvils and tongs today exist 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.489
 tools that facilitate this work 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.050
 but there is no lack of the 19th century that humphry 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.970
 davy I made essential discoveries 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.129
 for welding the electric arc and the 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.930
 acetylene gas the first equipment of 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.390
 welding was patented in england 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.520
 by nicolai bernardos in 1885 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.620
 diagram we can observe the parts that 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.879
 make up this tool we start 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.640
 with the pure oxygen tank and the 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.869
 gas tank after the pressure gauges the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.060
 hoses that are connected from 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.409
 gas tank to torch and blowtorch 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.580
 which is made up of the keys of 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.910
 control and ejector and how do you know that 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.320
 is ready to be used those who verify 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.320
 a bad moment 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.670
 and this will be to regulate the pressure of 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.670
 the output of oxygen 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.600
 upside down 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.119
 if you are not 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.830
 and how much do they have to mark so that 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.760
 pressure that there has to be is what 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:51.060
 as I have regulated I am under pressure and 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.700
 this goes against the watches then 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.970
 you should always be against these 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.970
 watches 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.170
 with power it is necessary to have stockings of 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.880
 security 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.830
 for the use of these tools in 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.030
 This helmet in these protective gloves 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.770
 Y 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.690
 the person who works must be 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.729
 isolated from the other shoes so as not 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.080
 cause any accidents as well as 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.990
 people who are also working 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.850
 they must keep a distance 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.710
 this tool works to join 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.780
 pieces as well as to make cuts of 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.630
 plates and beams and pere the courts 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.250
 They may be linear of 45 deg 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.840
 Pure oxygen and gas tanks can 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.680
 get to last up to two days they are given 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.480
 a continuous use 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.849
 the cost of a team like the one shown 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.319
 It is 28 thousand pesos and 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.569
 keeps in a good state can get 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.040
 to last hoses for a long time 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.720
 last about three years before 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.940
 be changed 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.140
 when you finish using the tool it is 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.940
 necessary to check that everything is fine 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.160
 closed and no oxygen or gas escapes 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.510
 since with a slight step you can 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.510
 cause an accident regretting 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.319
 the perception of this 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.450
 tool is that it is a tool of 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.920
 high risk in its use but that in turn 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.510
 it's easy and workers who use it 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.810
 since you can cut almost any metal 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.190
 attack a thickness of 1.5 inches it serves 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.720
 for the construction of stairs for 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.140
 industrial warehouses and other pipes 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.140
 utilities 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.609
 In Mexico, arc welding comes in 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.680
 the 20th century and they are a very role 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.540
 important that is of great importance in 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.219
 the construction for the realization of 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.560
 buildings industrial buildings other works 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.969
 also open the doors to leave 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.180
 of this mechanical mining and 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:35.180
 hydrocarbons 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.910
 everything that I know revilla either in the 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.330
 stairs you work under blackboard and 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.230
 this one and it's used in math where all 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.310
 the maths 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.880
 is not there I invented everything all 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.880
 do not kill yourself 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.880
 Y 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.209
 all this 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.580
 that people have been 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.990
 in the piece of you 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.510
 so they do not value work 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.510
 there are some people who do 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.170
 is supposed to have 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.550
 I do not have to use math as well 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.550
 waves to each time communes 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.860
 we go more or less with this one 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.120
 you can say that holding hands 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.120
 with the civil 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.890
 to calculate the structures 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.890
 and everything is worked under white 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.400
 accompanied 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.200
 with the 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.069
 here the work has to be done 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.069
 design 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.800
 you have 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:27.210
 it must be for all this 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.210
 so you have to work 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.070
 yes
