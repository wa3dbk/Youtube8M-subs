 I am a veteran of the topical countries 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.229
 really going to be going to be a big 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.390
 room because Europe will want to show 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.060
 service that is public service is 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:31.880
 very lively and will be presented in 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:35.150
 2011 and 2020 with this one with the hb 20 of 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.009
 Brazil to the same platform is a 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.390
 global honda platform they will 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.549
 want to make a platform for a 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.500
 Brazilian car right not spend another 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.270
 billion and a half two million dollars 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.340
 to make a platform that is all 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.710
 underneath the car where the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.990
 mechanical aggregates because this face has 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.119
 a good platform and 21've driven in 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.490
 europe is an excellent car a charge 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.170
 high level of emotional stress and this is 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.740
 serious and 2002 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.290
 this is the torsional stiffness is a 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.110
 face that really surprised me in your 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.890
 excellent cornering stability 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.490
 lateral stability made me confess 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.380
 It's been almost a year since I've gotten 1h 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.870
 What a pleasant surprise to have 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.970
 back to hb 20 that I had already tested 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.600
 maybe even quieter up to examine 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.420
 it 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.300
 What are your privileges? 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.730
 its good characteristics and 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.090
 what would be their limitations 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.190
 Look at the feed in a curve almost no 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.500
 There is this car car you enter into 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.140
 curve how you want it is good for you 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.180
 normal consumer because he will forgive 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.730
 and are not very likely 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.710
 he will even forgive some 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.350
 driving tables people heads 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.200
 they are distracted they enter with time with the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.450
 with an excessive speed in curve and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.360
 if the position is stable the card is 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.610
 stabilize can lead to a serious accident 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.620
 It's good, I'm here on public roads. 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.410
 I can go into corners as I enter the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.390
 race course or on a test track but 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.910
 I was able to feel instability with 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.880
 drawer in the face because it pleases is not the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.180
 panel all cute little all charming 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.510
 with several angles a car that has a 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.550
 Nothing special, nothing special. 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.620
 in us here it is not a car of 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.740
 high luxury a car without entrance that 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.590
 starts its price around 35 thousand 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.610
 nine hundred and if there were 38 thousand 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.520
 little men personal reveals extremely 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.200
 organized and gave me the resale km 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.920
 gave the datasheets with a 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.080
 price 30 8690 had already read the prisoners 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.210
 previously is the price of the car that has 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.280
 cancer have characteristics nothing that runs away 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.070
 much here the entry cars in the 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.710
 Brazil has but this one has more that is 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.420
 plus the wrist that I guess is 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.770
 especially the woman who tied 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.230
 In this car, which is the woman who does not 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.590
 like the brad pitt then're here 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.820
 brad pitt of the automobile because there is something 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.730
 there it is 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.460
 she analyzed the driveway 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.560
 Koreans are very much alive to know 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.790
 what would be the weaknesses of cars 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.910
 entrance in brazil 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.459
 and evidently one of the weaknesses is the 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.870
 lack of creativity design we have 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.120
 a goal there that is progressing in the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.780
 market for at least 30 years you do not 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.360
 to do with a carbonite golon 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.639
 a seductive car so they solved 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.990
 nor the appeal was released now is a case 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:34.340
 practical pragmatic excellent car 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:38.900
 they decided to put a beautiful one 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:42.530
 in this guise and this year dae hp 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.510
 20 members 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.980
 the elantra with the big ones is 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.750
 from Brazil in the world 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.580
 or I would have some decisions I think 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.110
 the engine that the dae is not new engine three 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.790
 cylindrical cylinders that are 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.840
 time in the world market there has been 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.340
 since 2011 2010, by the way, is the engine that 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.730
 has a fairly long cycle but is a 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.220
 very efficient motor has 80 hps mans 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.410
 it goes better from the 3 thousand turns 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.700
 without any doubt and in that second 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.790
 The selection that I'm making I had 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.560
 I confess to a better impression of hb 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.540
 20 the first assessment was on the coast 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.380
 I might not have 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.930
 Good morning, I really do feel 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.210
 some qualities that keeps this and 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.550
 Look at the head there is clear as it does not 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.250
 much romantic scrolling would not be here 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.080
 he feels the irregularities a bit 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.870
 the ground it feels is not or 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.790
 is not immune to this pirambeira that we 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.560
 we have there on the streets and roads of Brazil 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.900
 look at a good product there the consumer 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.940
 Brazilian 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.240
 eating of stroke that consumes 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.030
 product and if one gives this is the inquires be 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.979
 now with 2,015 assumption crossed and friends 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.060
 they wanted to sell even more than anyone else 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.330
 make a mistake 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.240
 Like I said the car was kind. 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.140
 dakar the eike is one of the largest resellers 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.140
 Hyundai of Brazil
