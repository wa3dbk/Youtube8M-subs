00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hey here is norman i want you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.010
 Show me how wheatgrass breeder everything 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.759
 What we need is not capable 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.200
 wheat grains like those here for example 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.770
 the soft as well as best about 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.539
 One night in a big bowl 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.060
 I did that here so that 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.609
 are the wheat grains they have 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.949
 Soaked with water the bowl was 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.830
 only half full and about that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.059
 I'll give it to a tray now 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.980
 always abuse the trays of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.989
 my dÃ¶rr device and give it to it 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.660
 we earth and then on the targeted 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.860
 Wheat grains I still have before 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.260
 Rinse the soaking water away 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.930
 nice here I have the soaked 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.690
 wheat grains and I give up now 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.859
 a tray full of earth and the tray 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:06.780
 I got out of my device and I will 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.150
 looking for the rollers abuse as 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.830
 next I cover the whole thing off with 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.100
 put the whole thing in another tray 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.670
 We do not go directly to a place then 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.670
 the sun 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.549
 Now it is important that the wheat grains 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.290
 always stay wet so we should 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.530
 you always best with a water 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.490
 sprayer once earliest once a month 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.960
 spraying evening happened on the first day 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.850
 Do not catch so much on the second day 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.030
 Most wheat grains are already on 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.030
 germinate 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.009
 on the third day, most are already 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.729
 aimed and form green continues and 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.729
 also roots 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.720
 Meanwhile, they are raising the tray as well 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.900
 so high we can on it 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.430
 in the meantime renounce already 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.360
 on the fourth day, they are already growing properly 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.360
 strong in the height 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.760
 the fifth day is already very clear 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.250
 to recognize that wheatgrass 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.439
 and here we have a lot of grass on 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.640
 next day 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.760
 Here you can see the whole time 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.250
 root carpet together with the earth 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.989
 the great thing is that wheatgrass is not 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.470
 gluten contains more but only the 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.590
 seeds because when no process is that 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.629
 quota reduced 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.069
 Now a week has passed and that 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.930
 grass just sprouts up 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.269
 So now after nine days I will 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.200
 definitely harvest because it grows here 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:55.230
 already pretty high 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.519
 best we used a pair of scissors 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.900
 and cut it as low as possible from here 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.609
 is also growing again 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.030
 but then it is not quite so 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:07.829
 educational and the cut 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.349
 Wheatgrass we can also have one 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.359
 store something without that fridge 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.989
 Great nutrients are lost 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:19.560
 but of course it would be better immediately 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.889
 to juice and drink with 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.849
 maybe other green sprouts or 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:28.319
 Green represented vegetables 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.829
 Now I have the whole wheatgrass 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.859
 harvested and so much comes from one 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:38.280
 tray wheatgrass and we can 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.049
 juicing over several days now 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.829
 best with green sprouts here i have 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:47.459
 for example, fenugreek sprouts 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:51.680
 or other green vegetables and here's 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.680
 my juicer that is suitable 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.750
 so I have all the wheatgrass on 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.480
 once detained 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.819
 so me wheat grass tastes pure 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.049
 delicious but we can of course 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.670
 also season 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:11.739
 such as with wanda powder or 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.010
 cinnamon I have the two different ones 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:18.729
 ingredients that exist 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.130
 or we used stevia for sweetening 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.370
 every case of wheatgrass one of 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.520
 most nutritious sprouts ever 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.550
 which we can breed and at the same time 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.639
 the wheat grains are virtually free 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.639
 to have
