types of event types you can see that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.800

isn't really in air it's just an event
the<00:02:04.790> most<00:02:05.060> concerning<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.740> probably

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
the most concerning to you is probably

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.900 
the most concerning to you is probably
the<00:02:07.880> critical<00:02:08.450> or<00:02:08.840> warnings<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.580> see

happen within the hour 24 hour or 7 day

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.310 
happen within the hour 24 hour or 7 day
period<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:19.299> critical<00:02:20.299> errors<00:02:20.690> are<00:02:20.989> things

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
period the critical errors are things

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.680 
period the critical errors are things
that<00:02:21.440> happened<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.400> Windows<00:02:22.940> was<00:02:23.180> totally

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
that happened that Windows was totally

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.320 
that happened that Windows was totally
not<00:02:23.870> expecting<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.890> could<00:02:25.549> not<00:02:25.760> correct<00:02:26.239> for

not expecting and could not correct for

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.280 
not expecting and could not correct for
and<00:02:27.190> probably<00:02:28.190> led<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.610> crash<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:30.079> they

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
and probably led to a crash so they

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.880 
and probably led to a crash so they
would<00:02:30.500> be<00:02:30.680> your<00:02:30.920> most<00:02:31.100> concerning<00:02:32.049> the<00:02:33.049> event

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
would be your most concerning the event
