00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
features and then a bunch of bug fixes

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.269 
features and then a bunch of bug fixes
bugs<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.240> map<00:00:30.560> causing<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.710> program<00:00:32.099> to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
bugs like the map causing the program to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.760 
bugs like the map causing the program to
run<00:00:32.430> slowly<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.239> if<00:00:33.690> you've<00:00:33.960> been<00:00:34.230> using<00:00:34.500> it

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
run slowly and if you've been using it

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.959 
run slowly and if you've been using it
the<00:00:35.010> text-to-speech<00:00:35.370> alerts<00:00:36.260> have<00:00:37.260> been

the text-to-speech alerts have been

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.180 
the text-to-speech alerts have been
basically<00:00:39.410> freezing<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> program<00:00:40.890> until

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
basically freezing the program until

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.819 
basically freezing the program until
they<00:00:41.399> finished<00:00:42.290> that<00:00:43.290> stuff's<00:00:43.530> all<00:00:43.649> been

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
they finished that stuff's all been

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.580 
they finished that stuff's all been
fixed<00:00:45.469> I've<00:00:46.469> added<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.160> couple<00:00:47.309> commands<00:00:48.590> I'll

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
fixed I've added a couple commands I'll

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.680 
fixed I've added a couple commands I'll
get<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> those<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.399> minute<00:00:50.550> first<00:00:51.420> i'd<00:00:51.629> like

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
get to those in a minute first i'd like

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.500 
get to those in a minute first i'd like
to<00:00:51.809> point<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.739> big<00:00:52.949> feature<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.850> version

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
to point out the big feature of version

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
to point out the big feature of version
0.7<00:00:55.350> point<00:00:55.590> zero<00:00:55.910> which<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:58.109> fact<00:00:58.379> that

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
0.7 point zero which is the fact that

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.889 
0.7 point zero which is the fact that
i'm<00:00:58.800> able<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.280> speak<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:00.180> much<00:01:00.420> without

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
i'm able to speak this much without

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.130 
i'm able to speak this much without
setting<00:01:01.649> off<00:01:01.770> any<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:03.000> false<00:01:03.510> positives

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
setting off any you know false positives

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.250 
setting off any you know false positives
it's<00:01:05.040> because<00:01:05.250> i<00:01:05.339> added<00:01:05.610> push-to-talk<00:01:06.180> if<00:01:06.960> i

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it's because i added push-to-talk if i

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
it's because i added push-to-talk if i
disable<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.950> by<00:01:08.220> unchecking<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.180> push<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
disable it by unchecking the push to

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
working that's why they're not going to

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.469 
working that's why they're not going to
be<00:05:18.659> recommended<00:05:20.029> but<00:05:21.029> yeah<00:05:21.120> that's<00:05:21.330> basically
