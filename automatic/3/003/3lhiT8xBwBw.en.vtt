00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you can see we are in a very nice tunnel

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.350 
you can see we are in a very nice tunnel
I<00:01:18.780> spent<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.380> lot<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.650> time<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.460> once<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.210> was

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
I spent a lot of time on and once I was

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.090 
I spent a lot of time on and once I was
completed<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.960> figured<00:01:22.320> who<00:01:22.470> wants<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.860> walk

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
completed I figured who wants to walk

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.260 
completed I figured who wants to walk
this<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.700> put<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> train<00:01:24.509> track<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
this so put a train track in it and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.819 
this so put a train track in it and
basically<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.630> tunnel<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> take

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
basically this tunnel is going to take

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.130 
basically this tunnel is going to take
us<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.549> home<00:01:29.759> update<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.990> new

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
us to the home update or the new

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.490 
us to the home update or the new
addition<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.829> world<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:33.630> tunnel<00:01:34.079> took<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
addition to the world this tunnel took a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.620 
addition to the world this tunnel took a
little<00:01:34.710> bit<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.979> time<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
little bit of time as you can see the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.410 
little bit of time as you can see the
torches<00:01:37.470> are<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.890> underneath<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> tracks<00:01:39.150> as

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
torches are not underneath the tracks as

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.330 
torches are not underneath the tracks as
I<00:01:39.570> prefer<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.049> put<00:01:40.200> them<00:01:40.409> whenever<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.829> some

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
I prefer to put them whenever I do some

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.760 
I prefer to put them whenever I do some
kind<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.579> train<00:01:41.790> delayed<00:01:42.030> thing<00:01:42.740> because<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
kind of train delayed thing because a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.289 
kind of train delayed thing because a
lot<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.280> tunnel<00:01:44.490> kind<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> goes<00:01:45.000> over

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
lot of this tunnel kind of goes over

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.749 
lot of this tunnel kind of goes over
open<00:01:45.570> space<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.259> would<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.740> lot<00:01:47.729> more

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
open space and that would be a lot more

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.490 
open space and that would be a lot more
time<00:01:48.060> consuming<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.049> come<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
time consuming but here we come to the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.440 
time consuming but here we come to the
bend<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.009> after<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> bend<00:01:50.820> there's<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.270> much

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
bend and after the bend there's not much

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.899 
bend and after the bend there's not much
more<00:01:51.630> tunnel<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.079> not<00:01:52.200> super<00:01:52.619> long<00:01:52.850> try<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
more tunnel it's not super long try to

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.560 
more tunnel it's not super long try to
keep<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.360> going<00:01:54.570> at<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.960> decent<00:01:55.320> speed<00:01:56.390> on<00:01:57.390> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
way down but at the end of this tunnel

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.600 
way down but at the end of this tunnel
you'll<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:00.930> what<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.710> spent<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.219> lot<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.490> time

looking for and a lot of time making
this<00:02:04.590> tunnel<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:06.200> hopefully<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.530> kind<00:02:07.979> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
this tunnel for and hopefully it kind of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.350 
this tunnel for and hopefully it kind of
opens<00:02:08.580> new<00:02:08.879> doors<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.539> my<00:02:10.500> world<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.360> right

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
alpha world it's decently far away

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.649 
alpha world it's decently far away
mostly<00:02:40.560> because<00:02:40.799> of<00:02:41.090> all<00:02:42.090> it's<00:02:42.269> an<00:02:42.389> alpha

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
was get scattered throughout this tunnel

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.949 
was get scattered throughout this tunnel
that<00:03:40.680> way<00:03:40.979> is<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.180> staircase<00:03:42.449> that<00:03:42.810> goes

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
that way is just a staircase that goes

that way is just a staircase that goes
down<00:03:43.199> and<00:03:43.979> some<00:03:44.430> other<00:03:44.579> things<00:03:44.669> over<00:03:45.359> here

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
down and some other things over here

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.059 
down and some other things over here
which<00:03:47.129> is<00:03:47.879> very<00:03:48.810> nice<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.290> have<00:03:49.409> so<00:03:49.590> close<00:03:49.829> to

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
which is very nice to have so close to

which is very nice to have so close to
my<00:03:50.250> little<00:03:50.519> base<00:03:50.669> over<00:03:50.970> here<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.959> blaze

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
my little base over here is a blaze

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.719 
my little base over here is a blaze
spawner<00:03:53.120> which<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.299> have<00:03:54.510> neutralized<00:03:55.079> and<00:03:55.319> not

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:55.729 
spawner which I have neutralized and not

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:59.599 
spawner which I have neutralized and not
utilized<00:03:56.729> point<00:03:57.150> yet<00:03:57.329> but<00:03:58.189> yeah<00:03:59.189> this<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.430> the

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
utilized point yet but yeah this is the

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.399 
utilized point yet but yeah this is the
blaze<00:03:59.790> spawner<00:04:00.060> standard<00:04:00.810> room<00:04:00.989> pretty<00:04:01.290> low

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
blaze spawner standard room pretty low

ceiling everything nice and contained
and<00:04:06.859> I'm<00:04:07.859> not<00:04:08.010> going<00:04:08.159> to<00:04:08.220> walk<00:04:08.340> through<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
and I'm not going to walk through the

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.640 
and I'm not going to walk through the
whole<00:04:08.760> thing<00:04:08.790> but<00:04:09.389> you<00:04:09.720> get<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.900> gist<00:04:10.139> of<00:04:10.319> it<00:04:10.439> I

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
whole thing but you get the gist of it I

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.550 
whole thing but you get the gist of it I
haven't<00:04:11.400> explored<00:04:11.909> a<00:04:12.209> whole<00:04:12.239> lot<00:04:12.810> over<00:04:13.290> that

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
haven't explored a whole lot over that

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.339 
haven't explored a whole lot over that
way<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:13.769> don't<00:04:14.220> think<00:04:14.989> there's<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.079> straight

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
way I don't think there's a straight

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.589 
way I don't think there's a straight
toward<00:04:16.530> shadow<00:04:16.769> maybe<00:04:17.039> i<00:04:17.159> did<00:04:17.340> but<00:04:17.519> yeah<00:04:18.509> i'm

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
toward shadow maybe i did but yeah i'm

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.879 
toward shadow maybe i did but yeah i'm
getting<00:04:18.840> around<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.259> you<00:04:19.440> know<00:04:19.560> looking

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
getting around to it you know looking

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.589 
getting around to it you know looking
looking<00:04:20.519> for<00:04:20.579> various<00:04:21.030> things<00:04:21.090> there's<00:04:21.449> only

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
looking for various things there's only

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.089 
looking for various things there's only
so<00:04:21.780> much<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:21.959> can<00:04:22.079> find<00:04:22.349> another<00:04:22.469> fortress

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
so much you can find another fortress

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.019 
so much you can find another fortress
but<00:04:23.969> back<00:04:24.270> here<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:25.039> probably<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.550> bulk<00:04:26.729> of

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:27.029 
but back here is probably the bulk of

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.560 
but back here is probably the bulk of
the<00:04:27.120> home<00:04:27.240> of<00:04:27.389> the

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
the home of the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.550 
the home of the
eight<00:04:27.660> in<00:04:28.080> these<00:04:29.070> doors<00:04:29.400> in<00:04:30.180> terms<00:04:30.540> of<00:04:30.840> the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
eight in these doors in terms of the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.790 
eight in these doors in terms of the
nether<00:04:31.800> fortress<00:04:33.470> basically<00:04:34.470> when<00:04:34.620> I<00:04:34.650> was

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
nether fortress basically when I was

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.560 
nether fortress basically when I was
making<00:04:34.950> this<00:04:35.130> train<00:04:35.340> station<00:04:35.730> I<00:04:35.880> decided<00:04:36.270> to

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
making this train station I decided to

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.380 
making this train station I decided to
build<00:04:37.410> my<00:04:37.620> tunnel<00:04:38.070> which<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.090> might<00:04:39.240> as<00:04:39.330> well

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
build my tunnel which I might as well

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.860 
build my tunnel which I might as well
show<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:39.720> my<00:04:40.680> tunnel<00:04:41.010> goes<00:04:41.420> just<00:04:42.420> pretty<00:04:42.780> much

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
show you my tunnel goes just pretty much

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.960 
show you my tunnel goes just pretty much
just<00:04:43.290> sealed<00:04:43.590> in<00:04:43.830> goes<00:04:44.160> all<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.400> way<00:04:44.700> over

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
just sealed in goes all the way over

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.450 
just sealed in goes all the way over
there<00:04:45.020> goes<00:04:46.020> underground<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.920> lot<00:04:47.130> of<00:04:47.220> digging

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
there goes underground a lot of digging

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.160 
there goes underground a lot of digging
was<00:04:47.760> required<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.450> I<00:04:48.540> cut<00:04:48.750> most<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:49.050> this

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
was required so I cut most of this

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.620 
was required so I cut most of this
netherrack<00:04:49.890> but<00:04:50.610> it's<00:04:50.730> totally<00:04:51.150> contained

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
netherrack but it's totally contained

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.770 
netherrack but it's totally contained
totally<00:04:52.110> lit<00:04:52.290> up<00:04:52.440> there's<00:04:52.710> no<00:04:52.770> chance<00:04:53.130> of

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
totally lit up there's no chance of

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.780 
totally lit up there's no chance of
being<00:04:54.780> attacked<00:04:55.140> in<00:04:55.320> here<00:04:55.590> unless<00:04:56.280> something

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
being attacked in here unless something

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.460 
being attacked in here unless something
we<00:04:56.970> respond<00:04:57.390> in<00:04:57.510> there<00:04:57.630> which<00:04:57.780> is<00:04:57.810> unlikely<00:04:58.260> i

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
we respond in there which is unlikely i

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.520 
we respond in there which is unlikely i
think<00:04:58.860> but<00:04:59.630> nothing<00:05:00.630> has<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:00.930> far<00:05:01.140> but<00:05:01.350> if<00:05:01.440> it

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
think but nothing has so far but if it

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.580 
think but nothing has so far but if it
does<00:05:01.680> so<00:05:01.950> well<00:05:02.150> but<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.390> totally<00:05:04.020> safe<00:05:04.260> train

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
does so well but the totally safe train

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.120 
does so well but the totally safe train
track<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:05.930> standard<00:05:06.930> little<00:05:07.230> launching<00:05:07.920> thing

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
track a standard little launching thing

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.210 
track a standard little launching thing
here<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:09.230> should<00:05:10.230> keep<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:10.650> at<00:05:10.770> top<00:05:10.950> speed

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
here and should keep you at top speed
