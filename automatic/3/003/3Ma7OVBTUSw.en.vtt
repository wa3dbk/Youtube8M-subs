00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.690
 very good we are all this time in 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.220
 the show if it was a battle 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.530
 from a small campaign that I am 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.820
 doing with the tokugawa in legendary 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.950
 the most difficult and good thing is crazy 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.710
 legendary you are attacked by all those who 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.380
 callas border but but right away 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.630
 practically 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.269
 and good is costing is costing 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.130
 I'm defending good, I'm attacking 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.269
 this army was going to attack one of 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.269
 my recent conquests 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.780
 we are in it 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.270
 archers are going to have to advance to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.270
 deal 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.690
 the good ones that they do not have archers 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.220
 it's a massive army to assign with 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.020
 jaric 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.020
 - supermassive sector in fact 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.210
 the only advantage that I have good is that 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.210
 I have these samurai but I think they 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.280
 not only has gas arrived those are my 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.600
 two windows others the rest is everything 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.070
 numbers and in that I think that they will arrive 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.140
 by difference 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.140
 campaigning I lived there 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.190
 that's for signs of 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.510
 to a real attack 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.790
 for this flank 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.000
 and hold the position 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.340
 it's going to cost a lot and it's going to cost 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.340
 I guarantee it 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.750
 ostias and that have archers 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.870
 they do not attack the worst 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.870
 all of us 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.080
 we will not have 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.430
 because at this rate he will still be 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.430
 looking at us 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.340
 he is not in danger damn crazy 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.459
 you will have to win not disappoint me 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.189
 and mark them well 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.400
 in santiago he has just won 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.190
 we 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.820
 how they deal out the fucking 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.040
 it is not time to pursue 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.639
 let's walk 

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:38.639
 to the boots with which you can 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.710
 yes no 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.930
 two 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.990
 good luck 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.430
 a massacre of the truth 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.430
 let's enjoy it very well 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.840
 more blood than more comes out on the screen 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:53.120
 come 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.260
 cut your head please 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.260
 to my house 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.760
 what cut his head 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.210
 s one less head in the world 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.540
 although large 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.750
 good a good victory 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:39.370
 the truth is going to be difficult to survive 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:41.620
 it's good this will help pretty stable 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.930
 of only two dollars everything that you know that 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.620
 I'm doing a small campaign to 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:50.160
 I do not know how to do mea to pilgrims more 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.020
 quickly 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.220
