00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.930
 that day the harvest in green and this tomato we take it to the camera 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.090
 now they are going to produce 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.100
 a series of modifications such as the change of acid blue sugars 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.319
 or also changes in color 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:16.269
 but what is not going to happen 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.269
 this accumulation of potassium or calcium accumulation what we find 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.239
 I was here 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.160
 and go to the camera because it will not produce absorption in the portfolio 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.749
 in the options is made 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.029
 ground 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.140
 Of the same 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.740
 the part that I who of synthesis of vitamins 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.659
 It will also be done in the field 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:39.289
 with it the solar radiation that it needs and with also all the balances 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350
 of some of the minerals 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.370
 involved 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.390
 in the biosynthesis d also approached from any other nutrition element of 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.760
 vintage type cohen 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.730
 Thus 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.980
 in the camera 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.030
 yes we collect in green 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.309
 well there those nutrition losses 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.980
 and in doing it 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.030
 and the fourth question 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.810
 which is related to the view that the loss of nutrition 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.149
 If they are 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.350
 carrying out the food 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.130
 is also linked 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.810
 with the collection in green 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.880
 directly relates to the great distances that the 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.390
 food we collect the food we collect it in a destination 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.670
 i can go 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.380
 in the position of 2004 thousand kilometers to reach the market 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.929
 at destination that means 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.880
 that in that transport and we're going to have some losses 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.870
 of vitamins, mainly minerals, will be retained there, but 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.070
 some vitamin losses 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.610
 which are the ones that give us the transport 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.950
 apart also 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.720
 d the collateral issues in it 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.300
 jet and boxes that are linked to transportation the entire carbon footprint 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:54.920
 that carries 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.770
 in it purity collection four thousand kilometers from the destination point 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.600
 for 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.260
 solve all these problems 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.750
 of conventional production 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.379
 standing 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.009
 do not put 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:16.609
 military already have to put certain controls to improve 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.769
 this because final 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.009
 who 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:21.919
 your consumer phrase 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.199
 the consumer 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.020
 to take the vitamin c to which they take the food 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.740
 well it will fall into the deficiencies of vitamin C and therefore ma 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.839
 susceptibility alaya to the sky to some constipated 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.619
 to fewer defenses in our body 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:43.199
 and we end up with a type of diseases that 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.900
 initially we would have to be cured 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.030
 the hypocrite police food that my food and medicine and 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.019
 my medicine to the minute 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.829
 of the story will change 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.920
 so much has changed that they are now generating 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.050
 certain medicines to cure the evil that some of us do 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.619
 food in 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:10.749
 what is the solution the solution goes through organic farming 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:12.079
 an agriculture 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.409
 which also includes a livestock 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.889
 ecological and let's not forget that livestock also includes 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.749
 percent and agriculture and livestock and I want to say 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:24.879
 and therefore 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.329
 everything to produce 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.230
 foods 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.469
 balanced 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.219
 in a reasoned way 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.249
 in which 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.040
 all energy investment 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.030
 this very very very streamlined 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.519
 we do not have food 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.639
 with a nutritional composition 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.879
 Much more 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.879
 the our essays in our experiments 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.639
 edp that are 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.839
 and they have been published through international journals through 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:54.299
 national magazines 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.169
 to also through etts mine books and that being there 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.579
 available 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.819
 these tests that we have done 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.059
 we have done them and many more sad when he talks about macri 3 I mean in 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:14.959
 different types of food leaf foods such as lettuce 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.579
 poles spinach chard 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.599
 fruits such as citrus fruits 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.689
 the pepper aubergine 

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:26.710
 On average, how can potatoes be? 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.090
 the carrots the onion 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.889
 also with food of livestock origin we have worked mainly 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:36.900
 with the quality of the game 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.469
 a protein food where there are 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:42.689
 and with the quality of comic meat 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.939
 and with all that we have a series of results 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.659
 that as a conclusion they have given us 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.710
 they speak the following 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.469
 if 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.620
 of minerals the mineral concentration 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.389
 is higher in organic food 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.759
 something logical 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:02.659
 yasky 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:07.489
 I used to tell you that all part of the soil and if we have a soil 

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:08.400
 in equilibrium 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.270
 the plant is capable of absorbing 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.730
 this military potential and translate it finally 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.960
 in the plant 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.530
 raises that if in the end it ends up as food of the ecological channel 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.110
 Also, the animal is eating with a nutritional balance just like 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.339
 we would do 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.020
 as for the levels that such 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.759
 and then more than the same 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.999
 for all these reasons previously provided the dryness of the fruits 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.099
 citrus 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.710
 peppers 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.530
 all food 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.220
 they finish 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.779
 with more Miguel de Tandil 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:50.830
 Vitamin C is the most abundant vitamin in fruits and vegetables and that's why 

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:54.119
 I always prefer to this level of itesm be 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.639
 pilot something 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.530
 that also 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.680
 that stands out 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.300
 in fruits and vegetables 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.789
 and it is the level 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.129
 of substances of antioxidant type 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.840
 which are concentrated mostly in production foods 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.589
 ecological 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:12.059
 i the 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:16.339
 not in the levels of metals in the levels of vitamins 

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:19.790
 the scientific community was undoubtedly a little 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.790
 who has more and who has less because everything will depend on the soil 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.919
 and the entire scientific community is in complete agreement 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.919
 is that organic production foods 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.699
 Greater miguel of substances of antioxidant type 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.169
 when it talks about antioxidant-type substances 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.780
 I am referring 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.780
 can you adapt 21st century medicine 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:49.300
 there are many scientific works that relate us 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.470
 as the intake image 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.470
 certain substances of an antioxidant nature 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:56.680
 among which 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.680
 percent and some minerals are classified as zinc and selenium the 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.699
 molybdenum 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:04.000
 also some 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.749
 yesterday some vitamins like vitamin to vitamin c but vitamin e 

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:09.719
 and also 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:11.899
 some compounds 

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:15.070
 which are secondary metabolites of the plant 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.559
 what do we call polyphenolic substances 

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:22.249
 that said the group of polyphenolic substances 

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:26.849
 is where the scientific community has no doubt that food from 

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:28.669
 ecological production 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:31.899
 and in it greater concentration 

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:36.649
 Well, that's because it's not casual and he said it's not casual 

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:38.369
 if not 

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:40.119
 impose 

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:43.749
 because adm greater balance between sleep 

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:45.099
 but also 

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:48.650
 here are the organic production plants
