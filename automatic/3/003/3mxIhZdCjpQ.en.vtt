 i for postures adapted since one of the lines would fall 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.559
 because if it is not the most important the world but one of the most 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:19.249
 important how you feel there as you arrived at the same time as it emerges 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.679

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.979

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.089
 Then the luck comes out that they called me but they did not call me and I thought 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.529
 hazel team classes we interviewed or less 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:10.129
