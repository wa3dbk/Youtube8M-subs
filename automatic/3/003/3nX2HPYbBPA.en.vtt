00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.930
 In this comment we want to comment on 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.160
 the latest passion system in 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.990
 Battlefield 4 talk 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.480
 Battlefield 3 was one of the am 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.070
 mostly discussed topics and berti 44 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.380
 There were actually some 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.029
 Changes how that looks in detail 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
 we will now show you some examples 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.079
 where we are with the normal 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.670
 Handguns but also from the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.120
 Shoot different vehicles 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.129
 to let 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.079
 there will be some surprises 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.840
 what you already have in the background 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.940
 have seen that the 44 magnum 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.370
 not too much tripping but triggers 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.230
 what you can see in principle 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.539
 what kind of impact is it 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.160
 Personally Battlefield 4 has in contrast 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.079
 to battlefield 3 blurs the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.559
 screen no longer if you like that 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.840
 is fixed and there are none 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.940
 arbitrary scattering of the ball more 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.739
 that is where you should drags 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.729
 in theory, in fact 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.590
 the google land 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.110
 the special effect in battlefield 4 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.670
 can now be seen by the results so 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.159
 the weapon is no longer at the southwest 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.409
 keeps calm but it starts easily 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.159
 to the left to the right or to the top to colorful 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.720
 swing 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.689
 that looks like something like that 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.009
 infinity sign or one on the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.350
 page laid 8 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.990
 the stronger the weapons go out 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.659
 to break that is the farther it is 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.189
 this will swing the weapon out of that 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.350
 we show here in the background you have 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.650
 you saw a regular pistol that it 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.790
 23 and the eu 100 so the whole 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.590
 regular weapons on the one in the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.700
 usually applies 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.250
 For example , it looks a bit different 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.590
 protection slabke from here remains this 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.229
 lateral swing out but the soldier 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.939
 almost squats together and runs away 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.790
 the visor 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.219
 This is especially dramatic with the dms 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.229
 Here you have a quasi non-stop 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.189
 shrug that aim at the clean one 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.189
 enormously difficult 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.240
 it will be particularly interesting if 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.830
 you look at those of vehicles 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.970
 go out first we see that 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.459
 light or 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.709
 the heavy coaxial mg tanks here 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.780
 The crosshairs drew soldiers downright 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.780
 that they look pretty weird 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.240
 This is especially dramatic with gypsum 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.430
 Interestingly, you jump that 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.650
 reticle even stronger than the mgs 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.020
 the tanks that you should know 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.090
 what you can expect that a 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.920
 has to combat such vehicle 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.360
 you would count on such 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.360
 usually did not celebrate 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.830
 in the examples we have so far 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.450
 we only showed one 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.820
 normal red dot visier had what 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.230
 So no enlargement has more critical 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.210
 Of course it looks like if you are now 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.670
 a weapon already uses one 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.620
 either has magnifying visor on it 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.480
 or as here it is easy for the woman 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.110
 then it increases 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:16.970
 whole and the balance is all the more 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.170
 you become more difficult now 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.760
 for example not that one through 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.920
 this passion of chips or tanks 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.020
 particularly strong twitching has to be expected 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.030
 then here are examples like these 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.640
 show some strange ones 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.760
 Things do not happen and the as roma 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.380
 to meet 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.790
 we bring us in like machos 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.410
 Here we link to ours 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.500
 Last comments in which we talk about that 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.810
 balancing of mbt / l and active raider 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.180
 must break and our friend
