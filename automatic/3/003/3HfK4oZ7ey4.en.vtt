little more versatility is you have your
basic<00:01:05.460> big<00:01:05.670> muff<00:01:05.880> circuit<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:08.189> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
basic big muff circuit in here with a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.149 
basic big muff circuit in here with a
parametric<00:01:08.880> eq<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.290> dial<00:01:10.890> in

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
parametric eq so you can dial in

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.740 
parametric eq so you can dial in
different<00:01:11.670> sounds<00:01:12.060> tweak<00:01:12.360> certain

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
different sounds tweak certain

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.750 
different sounds tweak certain
frequencies<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> want<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.890> just

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
just dial it in a little more you know

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.969 
just dial it in a little more you know
accurately<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.439> vintage
