00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 2 all boys and welcome back here 247 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 every day 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.540
 today we are here with a review of locations 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.830
 with the review because three or was released 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.880
 four days ago I know it depends on 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.170
 when to upload the video 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.810
 the test the playtest of the former 15.1 mi 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.150
 you literally asked for 400,000 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.820
 to do it review I said no it comes 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.199
 review all my opinions on 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.519
 what do you think of these shoes by 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.920
 talk about all the technologies that they are 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.450
 have been introduced and are many 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.390
 so let's go to the first one that saw the beginning 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.250
 the schanbel like we reach at least 200 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.059
 because there is for the former so there 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.739
 we have to get at least 200 meters am 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.530
 like text waits for the first thing 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.390
 I also want to tell you these low shoes 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.670
 let's say for a month then 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.199
 try to really room 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.530
 let's say then I can give you opinions 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.879
 really objective, very truthful 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.520
 spring I want to talk about 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.799
 this shoe and breakfast coloring 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.900
 with this fluorescent yellow and I know it is me 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.119
 liked very much are shoes that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.100
 let's say they are very much in taste 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.900
 personal I like that if this 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.500
 appearance coloring I also look forward to the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.659
 next let's talk about the first thing 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.450
 important is the upper the upper 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.140
 which version I tested is 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.509
 in synthetic leather what we can find 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.150
 then we have the surface could 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.050
 seem to say smooth an upper 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.510
 normal 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.300
 let's say classical we find instead of 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.830
 kind of bumps says on the tip 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.570
 of the foot but that nevertheless go 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.580
 went ahead on everything else 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.840
 never given tranche on the inps cage though 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.450
 we'll talk later 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.730
 these things also really help a lot 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.890
 however in the upper ball control 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.680
 really very fine we say that for 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.960
 those who perhaps seek protection 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.350
 although sincerely in a shoe from 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.780
 football 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.940
 at the end of the set it too often becomes 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.850
 a tank that this obviously either 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.650
 gives a great benefit to the control 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.710
 of ball because it seems to play at 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.899
 bare feet with uppers so little same 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.550
 another technology introduced in these 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.200
 x15 is precisely the xxx cage that now 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.770
 you will probably see here at mine 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.490
 shoulders 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.470
 it is this structure that allows the end 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.110
 to have more stability in exchange rates 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.570
 direction especially this technology 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.970
 is aimed at the stability of the GDP 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.220
 having so many newspapers and in 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.800
 even different conditions I can tell you that 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.080
 it really does its job because the foot 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.360
 of the immense stable it remains at a 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.160
 well the changes of direction to see little 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.830
 the push that maybe with a shoe that 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.840
 tends to let go after a while 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.850
 time that you use them you lose 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.459
 because the foot then widens a little 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.709
 inside the shoe moves while here 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.690
 remains tight and therefore we manage to do 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.239
 change direction even later 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.640
 wear over time really great hicks 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.100
 cage technology that I liked high 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.610
 technology that we still find talking about 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.800
 of the upper is a mess we say more 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.790
 discreet or not that it catches the eye is 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.610
 this technology is the techfit to say 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.090
 in a bit grim wake this mess 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.959
 what good is it I liked is useful 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.540
 we say that a little better we say la 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.490
 hunting also increases this 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.170
 a little stability is that we have 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.690
 inside the shoe when we play there 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.880
 seems to have more content 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.010
 of the shoe I must tell the truth that I do not 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.920
 it really seemed to me precisely because it is 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.720
 even a little pronounced is so much so 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.580
 inside the shoe and then never continued 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.920
 normally that is of the Polish one 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.990
 technology that I did not make of 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.420
 hot or cold for my opinion this 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.450
 neither techfit nor anything says about performance 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.810
 general of the scale we speak now of the 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.420
 sole and therefore of the arrangement of the 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.320
 stage cleats serve it in 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.480
 English 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.060
 the problem of sole cleats 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.340
 let 's talk about the hicks highlight the technology of 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.900
 let's say these marines shoes a shoe 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.000
 all renewed all technologies 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.710
 new ones we had never found before 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.960
 of ships from this technology what me 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.730
 I move very revolutionary thing 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.350
 that I absolutely loved 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.989
 which will also save some 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.240
 deaf because of this need then 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.510
 this sole allows you to play on 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.150
 fields in fg that we can spend today 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.280
 200 euros and this shoe shares all 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.650
 and two surfaces at the front of the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.320
 normal or usual cleats we have the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.810
 six front packs 4 rear of 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.710
 a normal shoe but what is the 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.050
 true revolution 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.360
 are these tiny little packets in 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.620
 half really are small but there 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.630
 we usually find more than half a 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.550
 shoe we have on one maybe to2 like 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.000
 I would download it but here we have it 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.310
 seven small central cleats e 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.720
 dry cleaners would be needed to increase 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.790
 even more the generation and the grip on 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.980
 terrain I must say absolutely that 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.150
 this technology is true this canvas 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.010
 it works 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.650
 I really enjoyed talking about it 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.630
 an absolutely important aspect for 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.580
 one that goes to make a purchase like that 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.920
 then spending 120 euros 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.170
 resistance resistance than in these 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.350
 now used shoes I've been using for a month 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.020
 as said before it is absolute 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.820
 and indeed quite unbelievable 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.910
 nothing seems to move I say so 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.950
 sincerely resistance takes a 10 pro 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.170
 indeed 10 and praise because it deserves 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.210
 absolutely the period in which the 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.340
 shoe gets used to the foot than one 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.800
 what always many people ask of me 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.380
 it wasn't one of the fastest shoes 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.190
 to breastfeed puts us let's say I have 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.810
 made two days of using them two days 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.630
 more or less 2 different facts two workouts 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.210
 bar three and they are perfect in my opinion 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.280
 that I am not immediately equal to 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.640
 forming the foot are not fierce from 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:58.760
 adapt however when they adapt do 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.760
 really really great job you are 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.760
 what guys this review 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.410
 of the unidas hicks 15.1 as you have it 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.270
 asked in wife care sent fuck off 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.250
 and in others because it is a form e 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.250
 only in head fi hawaii ebri 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.800
 admits cia reviews had so many serious 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.310
 so this piercing shoes there 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.910
 I remember two scintu the aifa 200 from the 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.430
 project allows whole pieces of shit 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:30.390
 squinzi review final vote i wonder 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:32.010
 I these shoes is a 9 and a half 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.440
 nine and a half because I liked them 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.330
 really much just what da 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:40.110
 compare them to the magisterial say that 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:43.890
 magistà and 15 at this point are 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.140
 together in the top ten of my shoes 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.100
 so, for now, these are your favorites 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.610
 in first place 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.260
 I absolutely recommend you shoes 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.630
 extraordinary adidas made a great deal 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.120
 work 32 all public technologies 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.500
 or explained the competition a little earlier, I hope 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.090
 which I liked this I hope 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.630
 this format is especially there 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:05.300
 liked no if you like skeleton 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.250
 I will certainly no longer resort to 247 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.920
 thousandths resolved mostly instagram 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.270
 that more ignorant then also the facebook 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.980
 page where I keep you updated study 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.980
 that load is all good
