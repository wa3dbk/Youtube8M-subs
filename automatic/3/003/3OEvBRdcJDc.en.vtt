00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.690
 yes in this video I want to show how 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.250
 you can release a network that can 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.040
 For example, to use it from 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.309
 his android smartphone or even from 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.070
 other devices in the network that out 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.789
 Network access has data too 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.080
 transfer 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.570
 that means, for example, I have 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.010
 Pictures on my smartphone that would like 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.070
 I like to have it on my pc or 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.500
 also the other way then also music from 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.080
 pc on the smartphone and push that 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.030
 all wireless network that gives 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.340
 In the following way you actually need 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.090
 on the phone to a file 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.230
 explorer actually no programs 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.710
 that can be so if so 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.809
 the first one still goes to the explorers 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.719
 down from windows 7 is yes in this 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.559
 taskbar down in it 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.550
 alternatively you can also use the windows 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.890
 press button then we have this pc 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.719
 under windows 8 without him now easy 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.030
 times the folder downloads give everyone 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.120
 Any folder and do one 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.119
 then right click on properties and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.610
 say release and then we open 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.680
 extended release then get this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.490
 window in which I click this folder 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.500
 release 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.670
 Here I can then the release name 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.729
 esch can then change the users 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.290
 number limit what you then 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.509
 should do now on authority 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.770
 then gives everyone full access 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.490
 take over 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.140
 ok then take it over again and that was it 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.450
 actually already we have 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.729
 this folder in the network released 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.790
 can use it on other devices 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.530
 access folder and transfer data 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.009
 I'll show you how it works now 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.009
 mobile 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.210
 yes, we have mine now 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.729
 smartphone with android and what we have now 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.430
 need to do is go to the play store 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.440
 you do not quite see it now and follow it 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.440
 app download the ds file explorer 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.869
 then it will be downloaded 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.370
 will now be installed 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.590
 then we go open 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.600
 so we see ours here now 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.310
 Structure of the cell phone the folder structure 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.010
 and what we are doing now is on this 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.570
 small symbols up here 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.210
 press this and go on network 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.320
 then lame 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.290
 important is that you are in the same 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.890
 connected as well as the network 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.160
 calculator 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.980
 where you have cleared the folder clear 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.990
 so then we go down here 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.440
 search 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:17.209
 So now the network is being searched 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:21.850
 for shared folders, we have 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.850
 already a computer from my network 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.510
 so that should be mine then now 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.530
 I have to enter the password once 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.879
 So now that I have the password 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.890
 I've already seen enter here 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.599
 the shared folders on my 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.269
 Calculator, of course, I had to 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.700
 with my data if your computer is a 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.319
 local user has with a password 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.280
 Of course, I have to deal with these data 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.989
 Sign in 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.090
 logical and everyone could easily care 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.230
 access and now I can to 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.060
 for example also with folders download them 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.670
 have not released go and 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.870
 can then open this picture here 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.209
 it can save 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.769
 data from the phone in this folder 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.560
 cramming or the other way around 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.670
 and that is very useful as I said it 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.200
 goes extremely fast 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.180
 One needs to in this 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.579
 file explorer no other apps and 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.990
 I always use it that way and I hope so 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.550
 could help you with that a bit 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.380
 maybe you have learned something new 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.380
 see you next time
