00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
mine is that it was stuck in there for

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.679 
mine is that it was stuck in there for
three<00:03:39.340> weeks<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.879> my<00:03:39.970> computer<00:03:40.389> was<00:03:40.509> going

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
three weeks and my computer was going

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.080 
three weeks and my computer was going
apeshit<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:42.310> finally<00:03:42.519> got<00:03:42.729> it<00:03:42.790> out<00:03:42.939> I

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
apeshit and I finally got it out I

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.640 
apeshit and I finally got it out I
probably<00:03:43.569> damaged<00:03:43.900> my<00:03:44.049> computer<00:03:44.439> more

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
probably damaged my computer more

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.229 
probably damaged my computer more
because<00:03:44.829> I<00:03:44.889> kept<00:03:45.099> stabbing<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.639> with<00:03:45.759> this<00:03:45.909> and

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
because I kept stabbing it with this and

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.539 
because I kept stabbing it with this and
like<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:47.259> I<00:03:47.409> thought<00:03:47.829> it<00:03:47.949> was<00:03:48.040> hooked<00:03:48.250> on<00:03:48.370> to

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
like so I thought it was hooked on to

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.520 
like so I thought it was hooked on to
the<00:03:48.639> cd-rom<00:03:48.970> but<00:03:49.299> it<00:03:49.359> wasn't<00:03:49.659> okay<00:03:49.900> I'm<00:03:50.439> gonna

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530
