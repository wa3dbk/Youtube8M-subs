because I play a lot of money player
games<00:03:13.769> on<00:03:14.070> them<00:03:14.400> I'm<00:03:15.030> just<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:15.870> far<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.380> know

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
games on them I'm just so far I know

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.979

it's<00:03:17.010> early<00:03:17.130> days<00:03:17.400> bomb<00:03:17.760> disappointed<00:03:18.690> at

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
it's early days bomb disappointed at

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.050 
it's early days bomb disappointed at

least the moment is really bugging me
and<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.410> thought<00:03:22.799> this<00:03:22.890> game<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.310> going<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.489> be

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
and I I thought this game is going to be

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.090 
and I I thought this game is going to be
so<00:03:23.760> much<00:03:23.910> better<00:03:24.150> than<00:03:24.390> coldie<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.680> game

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
so much better than coldie and this game

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.990 
so much better than coldie and this game
does<00:03:26.459> have<00:03:26.720> them<00:03:27.950> this<00:03:28.950> have<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.640> have<00:03:29.850> the
