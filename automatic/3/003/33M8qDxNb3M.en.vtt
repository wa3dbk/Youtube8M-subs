 center half turn that does not work 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.940

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.140
 There is no doubt that when you have 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.850
 insistence when you have possession 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.250
 of good ball because many are achieved 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.710
 things for the team that is driving 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.540
 the game was charged a half 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.910
 the pitch and there comes the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.159
 dialing by sergio morals 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.260
 you are looking over the sector on the right 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.180
 it seems to me that I'm julian rangel if the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.550
 that ends up winning the ball reaches 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.979

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.320
 half- turn israel silva hits her hard 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.570
 down to leave without any 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.610
 possibility to the goal kings of power 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.500
 avoid giving that annotation like this 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.530
 that one by zero wins the table 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.450
 subversive manuel where are you shooting from 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.090
 corner of agreeing palaces there is the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.160
 movement within the area there is 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.009
 movement within the team area 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.190
 xelajú mario camposeco the shot is coming 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.630
 corner looking for the heart of the area 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.630
 go to mars

 of the kelvin payment list port 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.850
 valuation 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.430
 deconcentration in the back and the goalkeeper 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.090
 do not take advantage of the visiting team in the 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.409
 minute 5 manages to tie the match only 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.050
 one the shrimpers a good one when it 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.209
 they leave those spaces when they get lost 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.239
 brands like those of what has just 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.459
 happen in this in this play is what 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.860
 you can come is an annotation and there 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.080
 is you see how it appears is just 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.730
 the player on the second post and I 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.130
 it seems that it is ending is capable not 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.650
 also the goalie who tries to do 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.260
 some opposition but that does not get that 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.300
 the ball does not enter the goal 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.910
 there is the annotation one by one the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.590
 marker but the marks were lost and 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.510
 this has been one of the deficiencies that 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.239
 have shown the team will be some 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.459
 of the parties where in others it has 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.140
 corrected but unfortunately now 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.710
 it does not go with 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.710
 what 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:03.730
 several dry edges 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:07.270
 with the goal of israel the whistle of souza 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.310
 the Brazilian gets doublet tonight 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.099
 xelajú quickly turns the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.400
 score 2 to 1 against the team of 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.530
 port of iztapa when they conjugate 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.900
 factors like the ones we just finished 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.110
 observe in this the goal that makes Israel 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.480
 silva speed precision simplicity and 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.760
 Good effectiveness, because it can not be done 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.400
 a lot because they see how the play is 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.950
 wilber caal an impressive precision 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.620
 well the movement by israel 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.510
 whistle the hammer down nothing that 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.390
 do for the goalkeeper the king is for 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.130
 put the 2 to 1 and immediately because then 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.620
 get to win the super goat box 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.510
 after what we told them in that 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.310
 error that had been committed in the 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.230
 annotation by the port of this 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.030
 peace and that is now winning the 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.519
 super goat team comes a little bit others 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.709
 like manuel león manuel opening for 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.599
 July the center prepares the ball 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.280
 wants the program to cover you 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.280
 crossbar against auction and goal 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.140
 what 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:19.430
 where mario camposeco fills 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.949
 with goal with goal by the Mexican ulises 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.419
 mendívil his goal number 13 comes that 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:29.020
 the present contest 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:31.750
 xelajú 3 the iztapa 1 team 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.120
 we were talking to you brief moments ago 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.250
 that on the right side in 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.080
 relation to the attack of the super team 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.270
 were leaving the spaces and there 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.520
 the play is generated for this third 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.470
 note because in July I think that 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.629
 sum well for that sector taking advantage 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.550
 that are leaving the spaces you take 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.440
 of the center well is anticipated ulises 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.599
 beggar and the post was denying him 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.150
 again that possibility but 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.830
 fortunately the bounce is there and 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.919
 with his head he sends it to the bottom of the 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.360
 networks for 3 to 1 at this time in 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.090
 favor of the team of xelajú mario 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.580
 camposeco took off the mark he advanced 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.039
 Luis Rodas who steals the ball is coming 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.960
 bingo it is not right to take 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.650
 the brand has space takes out this auction 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.650
 header and goal 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.630
 with 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.529
 he escapes 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:31.939
 with a goal of port equipment iztapa 

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:31.939
 late discount 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.110
 of that tension in the rear this costs 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.880
 the second the team xelajú mario 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.150
 camposeco the comment the voice of 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.070
 alfredo where are you from 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.590
 I am from here as a yoga friend 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.930
 better beer we mentioned it in two 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.270
 previous opportunities that you had 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.820
 to be careful and well it happened 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.770
 this is because you try to go out playing 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.320
 leaving one player then another and you 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.300
 loses the ball and there recovered it the 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.430
 Insta port equipment for 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.340
 they lost the marks they asked for something outside 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.920
 of game but see was totally 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.530
 enabled so that 5 goals have already fallen 3 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.650
 of xela 2 from iztapa the ball has it 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:20.150
 Israeli could not connect chinchilla 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:20.150
 lack and red card for chinchilla 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.880
 regrettable 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:30.080
 unfortunately chinchilla will have to 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:33.259
 leave the field entered 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.490
 a few minutes to show him in the 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:38.009
 cardboard 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.259
 it seems that it is not for so much but neither way 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.330
 the referee is closer we will have 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:46.289
 the opportunity to observe the repetition 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.060
 to be able to later have a better judgment 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.190
 a comment there 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.330
 good thing is that if it arrives with the iron 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.330
 and messages that I 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:59.009
 the iron on the left leg and that 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.889
 because it caused the referee to reign 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.960
 it will show the red card it can be 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:06.030
 damage the team xelajú mario camposeco ya 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.400
 we are 4 I think this is going to be what 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.240
 latest 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.610
 the ball that is falling reaches 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.940
 there the Colombian now if the referee 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.919
 says that this is over the game ends 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.210
 team victory xelajú mario 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:22.210
 camposeco 3 a 2
