00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
what I'm talking about better Wi-Fi is

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.400 
what I'm talking about better Wi-Fi is
in<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.410> bigboss<00:02:56.770> repo<00:02:57.070> as<00:02:57.490> well<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.260> what<00:02:59.260> it

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
in the bigboss repo as well and what it

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.540 
in the bigboss repo as well and what it
does<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.070> actually<00:03:02.100> has<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.130> lot<00:03:03.520> of

does is it actually has a lot of
different<00:03:04.060> good<00:03:04.360> features<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.140> better<00:03:05.470> Wi-Fi

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
different good features so better Wi-Fi

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.840 
different good features so better Wi-Fi
not<00:03:07.390> only<00:03:07.630> will<00:03:07.960> it<00:03:08.110> display<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:09.310> wipe<00:03:09.550> the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
not only will it display the wipe the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.270 
not only will it display the wipe the
Wi-Fi<00:03:10.330> connections<00:03:11.080> that<00:03:11.320> are<00:03:11.470> available<00:03:11.620> to

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
like the smart passcode lock okay i

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.699 
like the smart passcode lock okay i
currently<00:03:35.410> have<00:03:35.770> my<00:03:36.130> passcode<00:03:37.000> enabled<00:03:37.930> but

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
currently have my passcode enabled but

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.670 
currently have my passcode enabled but
since<00:03:39.010> i<00:03:39.190> have<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.730> tweak<00:03:40.180> i<00:03:40.600> can<00:03:41.200> turn<00:03:41.410> this

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
since i have this tweak i can turn this

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.199 
since i have this tweak i can turn this
feature<00:03:42.160> own<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:43.140> actually<00:03:44.140> lock<00:03:44.410> my<00:03:44.709> device

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
feature own and actually lock my device

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.550 
feature own and actually lock my device
and<00:03:46.709> when<00:03:47.709> i<00:03:47.740> slide<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.580> unlock<00:03:48.630> i<00:03:49.630> don't<00:03:50.290> have

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
and when i slide to unlock i don't have

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.880 
and when i slide to unlock i don't have
to<00:03:50.740> put<00:03:50.950> in<00:03:51.220> my<00:03:51.640> passcode<00:03:52.270> as<00:03:52.600> long<00:03:53.380> as<00:03:53.410> i'm

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
to put in my passcode as long as i'm

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.690 
to put in my passcode as long as i'm
connected<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.620> Wi-Fi<00:03:56.620> connection<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.670> I

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
connected to the Wi-Fi connection that I

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.210 
connected to the Wi-Fi connection that I
have<00:03:57.970> chosen<00:03:58.000> here<00:03:58.900> inside<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.650> tweak<00:04:00.010> and

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
have chosen here inside the tweak and

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.400 
have chosen here inside the tweak and
you<00:04:00.340> see<00:04:00.580> right<00:04:00.820> here<00:04:01.150> that's<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.170> name<00:04:02.380> of

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
you see right here that's the name of

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.100 
you see right here that's the name of
the<00:04:02.620> Wi-Fi<00:04:03.100> connection<00:04:03.160> i<00:04:03.850> got<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:04.750> if<00:04:04.900> i<00:04:05.050> turn

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
the Wi-Fi connection i got so if i turn

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.930 
the Wi-Fi connection i got so if i turn
that<00:04:05.530> off<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:07.500> now<00:04:08.500> if<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.520> lock<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.820> device

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
that off and now if I lock the device

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.940 
that off and now if I lock the device
slide<00:04:12.940> to<00:04:13.180> unlock<00:04:13.209> you<00:04:13.989> see<00:04:14.170> we<00:04:14.320> get<00:04:14.440> this<00:04:14.650> pop

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
slide to unlock you see we get this pop

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.360 
slide to unlock you see we get this pop
up<00:04:14.980> for<00:04:15.610> the<00:04:15.760> passcode<00:04:16.330> so<00:04:17.200> I<00:04:17.230> think<00:04:17.560> that's<00:04:18.160> an

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
up for the passcode so I think that's an

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.820 
up for the passcode so I think that's an
awesome<00:04:18.549> feature<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:19.570> have<00:04:19.780> included<00:04:20.169> in<00:04:20.590> that

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
awesome feature to have included in that

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.850 
awesome feature to have included in that
as<00:04:21.130> well<00:04:21.240> as<00:04:22.240> be
