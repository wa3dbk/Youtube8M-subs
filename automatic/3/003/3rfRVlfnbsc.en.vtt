a<00:00:25.740> teeny<00:00:26.160> tiny<00:00:26.550> bit<00:00:26.730> more<00:00:26.910> than<00:00:27.330> cartilage

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
a teeny tiny bit more than cartilage

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.049 
a teeny tiny bit more than cartilage
with<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.279> actual<00:00:29.670> needle<00:00:30.019> um<00:00:31.040> it's<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.340> tongue

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
with the actual needle um it's a tongue

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.590 
with the actual needle um it's a tongue
like<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.020> mofo<00:00:34.590> afterwards<00:00:36.739> um<00:00:38.420> it's<00:00:39.420> pretty

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
like a mofo afterwards um it's pretty

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.540 
like a mofo afterwards um it's pretty
close<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.230> cartilage<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.190> little<00:00:41.430> bit

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
close to cartilage it's a little bit

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.069 
close to cartilage it's a little bit
thicker<00:00:41.730> where<00:00:42.000> she's<00:00:42.120> probably<00:00:42.329> want<00:00:42.719> some

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
thicker where she's probably want some

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.090 
thicker where she's probably want some
more<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.789> procedures<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:46.170> how<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.920> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
more but procedures of how they do it is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920 
more but procedures of how they do it is
about<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.520> same<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.000> make<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> dot<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:48.840> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
about the same and make a dot see if you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.720 
about the same and make a dot see if you
like<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.530> then<00:00:50.100> shut<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.399> needle<00:00:50.700> through

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
like it and then shut the needle through

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.209 
like it and then shut the needle through
and<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.440> they<00:00:52.440> use<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> small<00:00:53.070> little

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
and there they use a small little

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.860 
and there they use a small little
barbell<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:54.780> baby<00:00:55.410> barbell<00:00:56.180> put<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
barbell a baby barbell put in that the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.529 
barbell a baby barbell put in that the
ball<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.320> screech<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> back<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.670> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
ball just screech on the back and so the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.260 
ball just screech on the back and so the
hollow<00:01:00.930> needle<00:01:01.379> has<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.949> barbell<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
hollow needle has the barbell in the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.920 
hollow needle has the barbell in the
back<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:05.339> that's<00:01:05.549> how<00:01:05.640> big<00:01:06.000> got<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.900> then

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
back so that's how big got that and then

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.679 
back so that's how big got that and then
all<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.189> use<00:01:08.460> sea<00:01:09.060> salt<00:01:09.090> like

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
all you have to do is use sea salt like

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.830 
all you have to do is use sea salt like
cartilage<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.860> clean<00:01:11.040> around<00:01:11.159> holes<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.000> um

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
cartilage just clean around holes and um

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.890 
cartilage just clean around holes and um
so<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.830> healed<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> little

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
so this is healed so I have a little

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.960 
so this is healed so I have a little
earring<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.530> because<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.280> don't<00:01:17.759> want<00:01:17.790> to
