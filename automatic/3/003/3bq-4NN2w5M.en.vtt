how<00:00:16.730> many<00:00:16.910> generators<00:00:17.360> does<00:00:17.750> it<00:00:17.869> take<00:00:18.080> to

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
how many generators does it take to

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.590 
how many generators does it take to
power<00:00:18.470> a<00:00:18.500> light<00:00:18.770> bulb<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.550> answer<00:00:19.940> just<00:00:20.510> one

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
power a light bulb the answer just one

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.380 
power a light bulb the answer just one
you<00:00:21.410> see<00:00:21.619> any<00:00:21.890> generator<00:00:22.460> will<00:00:22.670> power<00:00:22.910> a<00:00:23.060> light

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
you see any generator will power a light

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.120 
you see any generator will power a light
bulb<00:00:23.599> but<00:00:24.140> if<00:00:24.230> you<00:00:24.290> want<00:00:24.439> to<00:00:24.500> power<00:00:24.680> more<00:00:24.950> than

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
bulb but if you want to power more than

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.010 
bulb but if you want to power more than
that<00:00:25.279> you<00:00:25.700> might<00:00:26.000> need<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:26.330> consider<00:00:26.450> a<00:00:26.779> few

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020
