around<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.420> web<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.869> went<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> bunch

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
around on the web and I went to a bunch

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
around on the web and I went to a bunch
of<00:00:31.650> different<00:00:31.949> friends<00:00:32.160> shops<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:33.000> check<00:00:33.239> out

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
of different friends shops to check out

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.520 
of different friends shops to check out
their<00:00:33.540> chassis<00:00:33.989> tables

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
their chassis tables

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.680 
their chassis tables
I<00:00:34.559> saw<00:00:34.949> everything<00:00:35.250> from<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> most<00:00:35.910> wild<00:00:36.510> all

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
I saw everything from the most wild all

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.299 
I saw everything from the most wild all
the<00:00:36.930> way<00:00:37.019> down<00:00:37.199> to<00:00:37.350> something<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.890> simple<00:00:38.129> that

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the way down to something so simple that

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.740 
the way down to something so simple that
they<00:00:38.460> were<00:00:38.519> basically<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.030> using<00:00:39.360> jack

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
they were basically just using jack

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.900 
they were basically just using jack
stands<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.410> decided<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> put<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:41.489> those<00:00:41.699> ideas

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
stands I decided to put all those ideas

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.939 
stands I decided to put all those ideas
together<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.750> come<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.409> design<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
together and come up with a design that

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.219 
together and come up with a design that
would<00:00:44.250> fit<00:00:44.519> my<00:00:44.670> needs<00:00:44.729> most<00:00:45.540> important<00:00:46.049> thing

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:46.229 
would fit my needs most important thing

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.410 
would fit my needs most important thing
was<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.739> needed<00:00:47.040> to<00:00:47.159> be<00:00:47.280> mobile<00:00:47.729> and<00:00:47.909> needed<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
was it needed to be mobile and needed to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420 
was it needed to be mobile and needed to
be<00:00:48.540> able<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.839> adjust<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.500> height<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.159> I<00:00:50.190> could

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
be able to adjust the height so I could

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.160 
be able to adjust the height so I could
get<00:00:50.519> everything<00:00:50.760> exactly<00:00:51.089> how<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:51.659> wanted<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
get everything exactly how I wanted and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
get everything exactly how I wanted and
really<00:00:52.470> level<00:00:53.040> you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.299> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
really level you can see I have the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.479 
really level you can see I have the
design<00:00:54.750> laid<00:00:55.019> out<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.710> basically<00:00:56.309> how

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
design laid out here of basically how

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.070 
design laid out here of basically how
it's<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.909> to<00:00:57.000> look<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.479> we<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.900> our

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
it's going to look and we have our

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.530 
it's going to look and we have our
casters<00:00:58.769> and<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.489> also<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.879> some<00:01:00.059> feet<00:01:00.330> that

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
casters and we also have some feet that

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.270 
casters and we also have some feet that
are<00:01:00.629> adjustable<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.379> raise<00:01:01.619> the<00:01:01.799> table<00:01:02.010> up

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
are adjustable that raise the table up

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.009 
are adjustable that raise the table up
up<00:01:02.460> front<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.089> material<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.659> we're<00:01:03.780> using

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
up front the material that we're using

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.719 
up front the material that we're using
is<00:01:04.320> pretty<00:01:04.559> heavy<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.250> we're<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> be

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
is pretty heavy and we're going to be

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
is pretty heavy and we're going to be
doing<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.060> lot<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.570> welding<00:01:06.750> that's<00:01:07.380> why<00:01:07.590> I

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
doing a lot of welding that's why I

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.190 
doing a lot of welding that's why I
chose<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.130> Eastwood<00:01:08.610> MIG<00:01:09.000> 250<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
chose the Eastwood MIG 250 to be the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.929 
chose the Eastwood MIG 250 to be the
workhorse<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.979> project<00:01:11.220> now<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
workhorse for this project now the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.760 
workhorse for this project now the
design<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.450> pretty<00:01:12.659> simple<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.320> everything

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
design is pretty simple and everything

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
design is pretty simple and everything
should<00:01:13.979> go<00:01:14.010> together<00:01:14.310> pretty<00:01:14.640> easily<00:01:14.790> but

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
should go together pretty easily but

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.730 
should go together pretty easily but
we're<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.870> to<00:01:15.930> show<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> some<00:01:16.350> tips<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
we're going to show you some tips and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.470 
we're going to show you some tips and
tricks<00:01:16.920> along<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.370> way<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.120> let's<00:01:18.300> get

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
tricks along the way so let's get

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
tricks along the way so let's get
started

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.170 

almost<00:01:32.500> no<00:01:32.740> shop<00:01:33.040> floors<00:01:33.400> are<00:01:33.640> completely

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
almost no shop floors are completely

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.539 
almost no shop floors are completely
flat<00:01:34.390> we<00:01:35.080> decided<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.619> build<00:01:35.770> each<00:01:36.070> half<00:01:36.369> of

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
flat we decided to build each half of

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.520 
flat we decided to build each half of
the<00:01:36.640> table<00:01:37.060> on<00:01:37.150> top<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:37.570> each<00:01:37.689> other<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:38.170> take

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
the table on top of each other to take

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.499 
the table on top of each other to take
out<00:01:38.710> some<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.130> inconsistencies<00:01:39.939> in<00:01:40.119> the

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
out some of the inconsistencies in the

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:47.110 
out some of the inconsistencies in the
floor

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.580 

we<00:01:48.120> started<00:01:48.480> by<00:01:48.600> squaring<00:01:49.080> up<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> first

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
we started by squaring up the first

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.350 
we started by squaring up the first
corner<00:01:49.980> of<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.160> table<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.730> also<00:01:51.030> check<00:01:51.330> to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
corner of the table and also check to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
corner of the table and also check to
make<00:01:51.660> sure<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.080> seam<00:01:52.350> was<00:01:52.530> flat<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.340> clamp

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
make sure the seam was flat and we clamp

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.150 
make sure the seam was flat and we clamp
the<00:01:53.850> beams<00:01:54.060> together<00:01:56.900> here's<00:01:57.900> a<00:01:58.020> tip<00:01:58.320> cut

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
the beams together here's a tip cut

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.950 
the beams together here's a tip cut

our clamps in place the parts were still
square<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.550> we<00:02:38.700> could<00:02:38.880> finish<00:02:39.060> tack<00:02:39.420> welding

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
square and we could finish tack welding

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:52.430 
square and we could finish tack welding
around<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> beams

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.899 

we<00:02:53.440> prepared<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.950> next<00:02:53.980> two<00:02:54.370> beams<00:02:54.640> and

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
we prepared the next two beams and

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.509 
we prepared the next two beams and
sanded<00:02:55.510> any<00:02:55.690> proud<00:02:56.080> welds<00:02:56.590> or<00:02:56.830> weld<00:02:57.190> spatter

sanded any proud welds or weld spatter
down<00:02:57.879> from<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.239> first<00:02:58.480> two<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.409> we<00:02:59.530> could

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
down from the first two so that we could

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:38.730 
down from the first two so that we could
use<00:02:59.920> them<00:03:00.159> for<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.370> flat<00:03:00.700> base<00:03:00.909> to<00:03:01.209> build<00:03:01.420> off<00:03:01.569> of

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.699 

then<00:03:50.270> we<00:03:50.450> repeated<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.140> tack<00:03:51.349> welding

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
then we repeated the tack welding

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.830 
then we repeated the tack welding
process<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.250> secured<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.060> last<00:03:53.270> two<00:03:53.569> beams

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
the two halves were set up on square box

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.140 
the two halves were set up on square box
tubing<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.830> try<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.250> build<00:04:12.400> off<00:04:12.610> of<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.910> more

uniform<00:04:13.630> surface<00:04:13.990> again<00:04:16.050> we<00:04:17.050> then<00:04:17.260> went

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
uniform surface again we then went

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.530 
uniform surface again we then went
