00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 one thing I have left over is 6 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.370
 loose in my drawer and instead of playing 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.839
 out 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:14.460
 keep watching this video for you 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:18.210
 know what to do with them a stop 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.150
 very easy to do is a little 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.650
 your sock because that part here she 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.189
 will be perfect 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.760
 the big toe and then I say you have to do 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.759
 here is cut that part to the fingers 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.630
 stay out so you go there and measure 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.630
 short 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.920
 and this part here you will make a 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.870
 screw the thumb out 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.980
 I do not do it for exaggerated because it goes 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.230
 steal too much 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.710
 I'm not going to tell the size of the hole for 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.710
 do not be inelegant 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.320
 hello, perfect coffee 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.510
 if you prefer to glove with the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.210
 fingers and can give a 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.280
 Here the culture dinho between each finger and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.040
 if you prefer you can also cut 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.920
 pick up a half socket that iacc 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.440
 part of the sleeve will be smaller or 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.840
 you want you can cut here too and 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.420
 there it does the same thing on the other side and it's 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.190
 to make a controversy in what is the 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.010
 second thing I think is cool to do 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.259
 with a stocking and loose elastic is 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.259
 very simple, just cut the bottom 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.230
 I think it's cool to leave the elastic 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.910
 facing down and this part 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.850
 fofinha card face up because he did not 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.640
 will you be squeezing your cinnamon will you vote? 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.860
 up to 5 or inside the sneakers is flat 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.350
 You're hot, there you go. 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.540
 to the gym if you want to be cool 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.880
 and customizing the piece is so easy it 's just 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.730
 cutting and turning the opposite was already that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.430
 same sock you cut the pout 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.470
 To make Poland, just cut the tip. 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.190
 from above 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.530
 and you will have a hair elastic 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.410
 and it's good because it has no 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.170
 that the fuck that stay 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.850
 chewing and breaking all his 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.530
 hair hour make a wristband 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.030
 but I also think this is no longer 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.540
 in fashion it's not cool to wear 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.540
 right here
