back-to-back molex if not this life it's
another<00:02:19.280> one<00:02:19.489> could<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.180> get<00:02:20.300> another<00:02:20.510> mother

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
that's a huge thing too if you rip all

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.259 
that's a huge thing too if you rip all
your<00:03:36.980> guys<00:03:37.160> out<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.430> spawn<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.180> you've

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
your guys out of the spawn and you've

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.759 
your guys out of the spawn and you've
got<00:03:38.359> a<00:03:38.420> completely<00:03:38.840> reform<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.410> spawn<00:03:39.590> trap

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
got a completely reform the spawn trap

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.470 
got a completely reform the spawn trap
and<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:39.920> don't<00:03:40.070> want<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.250> do<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.480> another

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
and you don't want to do that another

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.000 
and you don't want to do that another
thing<00:03:41.750> is<00:03:41.780> don't<00:03:42.079> use<00:03:42.290> air<00:03:42.440> support<00:03:42.799> on<00:03:42.890> these

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
thing is don't use air support on these

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.800 
thing is don't use air support on these
maps<00:03:43.250> dome<00:03:43.850> is<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.090> bad<00:03:44.269> map<00:03:44.480> for<00:03:44.690> air<00:03:44.780> support

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
maps dome is a bad map for air support

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.750 
maps dome is a bad map for air support
and<00:03:45.260> when<00:03:45.769> they're<00:03:45.920> in<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.100> spawn<00:03:46.340> trap<00:03:46.579> they've

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
and when they're in a spawn trap they've

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.699 
and when they're in a spawn trap they've
got<00:03:46.940> spawn<00:03:47.239> protection<00:03:47.810> for<00:03:48.019> five<00:03:48.290> or<00:03:48.320> ten

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
got spawn protection for five or ten

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.380 
got spawn protection for five or ten
seconds<00:03:49.100> I'm<00:03:49.130> not<00:03:49.280> sure<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.549> exact<00:03:49.880> number<00:03:50.209> of

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
seconds I'm not sure the exact number of

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.940 
seconds I'm not sure the exact number of
seconds<00:03:51.049> if<00:03:51.109> they<00:03:51.200> have<00:03:51.290> some<00:03:51.440> protection<00:03:51.620> for

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
seconds if they have some protection for

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.289 
seconds if they have some protection for
but<00:03:52.519> basically<00:03:52.670> what<00:03:52.880> this<00:03:52.970> means<00:03:53.180> is

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
but basically what this means is

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.970 
but basically what this means is
completely<00:03:54.170> just<00:03:54.319> missed<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.530> guy<00:03:54.650> hiding<00:03:54.859> in

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
completely just missed a guy hiding in

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.039 
completely just missed a guy hiding in
the<00:03:55.069> corners<00:03:55.370> now<00:03:55.780> they<00:03:56.780> have<00:03:56.870> some

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
the corners now they have some

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.449 
the corners now they have some
protection<00:03:57.200> which<00:03:57.620> what<00:03:57.859> this<00:03:57.980> means<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.310> when

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
protection which what this means is when

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.160 
protection which what this means is when
when<00:03:58.700> they<00:03:58.819> spawn<00:03:59.120> in<00:03:59.299> there<00:03:59.900> are<00:04:00.019> not

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
when they spawn in there are not

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
can see how effective it is um I've

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.530 
can see how effective it is um I've
already<00:05:54.610> got<00:05:54.820> a<00:05:54.850> MOAB<00:05:55.090> up<00:05:55.210> and<00:05:55.300> when<00:05:55.390> you<00:05:55.450> get

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
already got a MOAB up and when you get

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.880 
already got a MOAB up and when you get
em<00:05:55.600> up<00:05:55.780> if<00:05:55.900> you<00:05:55.960> get<00:05:56.080> double<00:05:56.320> xp<00:05:56.530> for<00:05:56.560> the<00:05:56.740> rest

em up if you get double xp for the rest
of<00:05:56.950> the<00:05:57.070> game<00:05:57.220> so<00:05:57.820> that's<00:05:58.240> it<00:05:58.360> even<00:05:58.780> makes<00:05:58.930> it
