00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
let's move on to this one now this is

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.410 
let's move on to this one now this is
the<00:01:07.530> Cutlass<00:01:08.100> now<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> interesting<00:01:09.030> thing<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the Cutlass now the interesting thing is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.230 
the Cutlass now the interesting thing is
that<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.869> other<00:01:09.900> one<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.470> called<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.860> cones

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
that the other one is called the cones

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.420 
that the other one is called the cones
cuttles<00:01:12.240> which<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> remark<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.860> think

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
cuttles which is a remark to I think

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.880 
cuttles which is a remark to I think
jellyfish<00:01:15.299> got<00:01:15.479> no<00:01:15.900> no<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.229> jellyfish<00:01:16.650> sorry

jellyfish got no no not jellyfish sorry
I'm<00:01:17.430> squid<00:01:17.850> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> thing<00:01:18.360> cuddles<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
I'm squid kind of thing cuddles and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.350 
I'm squid kind of thing cuddles and
that's<00:01:20.520> why<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> don't<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
that's why I don't really get the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.450 
that's why I don't really get the
Cutlass<00:01:21.840> although<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> bigger<00:01:23.040> version

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
Cutlass although is the bigger version

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.230 
Cutlass although is the bigger version
so<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.420> kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.580> it<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
so I kind of get it but it is just a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.140 
so I kind of get it but it is just a
normal<00:01:27.570> sounding<00:01:28.189> sea<00:01:29.189> kind<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.610> sore<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
normal sounding sea kind of sore like it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.760 
normal sounding sea kind of sore like it
could<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.450> pirate<00:01:30.810> sword<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.650> named

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
could be a pirate sword just named

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.399 
could be a pirate sword just named
Cutlass<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.880> again<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.570> kind<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> awkward

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
Cutlass so again it is kind of awkward

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.499 
Cutlass so again it is kind of awkward
themed<00:01:35.070> although<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.610> more<00:01:35.700> pirates<00:01:36.299> than

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
themed although it's more pirates than

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.899 
themed although it's more pirates than
anything<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.799> guess<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.310> passes<00:01:38.759> because

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
anything but I I guess it passes because

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.990 
anything but I I guess it passes because
wall<00:01:39.270> look<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.290> passes<00:01:40.710> okay<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.579> doesn't<00:01:41.880> have

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
wall look it passes okay it doesn't have

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
wall look it passes okay it doesn't have
to<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> super<00:01:43.110> clever<00:01:43.320> name<00:01:43.619> or

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
to have like a super clever name or

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
to have like a super clever name or
anything<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.090> nice<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:45.479> least

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
anything it would be nice at least

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.300 
anything it would be nice at least
anyway<00:01:45.960> let's<00:01:46.409> move<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.950> stats<00:01:47.189> on

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
anyway let's move on to the stats on

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.080 
anyway let's move on to the stats on
this<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.990> 940<00:01:48.990> TPS<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:49.680> point<00:01:49.950> 43<00:01:50.729> swing

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
this one 940 TPS one point 43 swing

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.780 
this one 940 TPS one point 43 swing
speed<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.570> damage<00:01:51.720> per<00:01:51.990> swing<00:01:52.229> 640<00:01:52.950> which<00:01:53.579> is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
speed and damage per swing 640 which is

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.639 
speed and damage per swing 640 which is
a<00:01:53.820> steep<00:01:54.180> drop<00:01:54.420> from<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.079> as<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> can

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
a steep drop from this one as you can

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.350 
a steep drop from this one as you can
see<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.219> that's<00:01:56.340> what<00:01:56.549> all<00:01:56.729> tiers<00:01:57.210> are

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
see but that's what all tiers are

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.179 
see but that's what all tiers are
actually<00:01:57.630> most<00:01:57.810> years<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.469> mesas<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
actually most years like the mesas the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.679 
actually most years like the mesas the
two-handed<00:01:59.670> hammers<00:01:59.969> are<00:02:00.090> always<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
two-handed hammers are always the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.140 
two-handed hammers are always the
strongest<00:02:01.020> ones

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
strongest ones

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.120 
strongest ones
so<00:02:02.720> let's<00:02:02.930> move<00:02:03.080> on<00:02:03.260> to<00:02:03.290> this<00:02:03.620> one<00:02:03.830> which<00:02:03.980> does

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
so let's move on to this one which does

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.310 
so let's move on to this one which does
have<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.700> pretty<00:02:04.820> cool<00:02:05.120> name<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.840> propeller

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
have a pretty cool name the propeller

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.050 
have a pretty cool name the propeller
why<00:02:06.650> is<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:06.980> cool<00:02:07.160> name<00:02:07.310> well<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:07.730> basically

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
why is it a cool name well it basically

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.090 
why is it a cool name well it basically
means<00:02:08.540> propeller<00:02:09.050> on<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.290> ship<00:02:09.560> or<00:02:09.680> something

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
means propeller on a ship or something

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.760 
means propeller on a ship or something
propeller<00:02:10.850> on<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> boaters<00:02:11.930> stuff<00:02:12.560> like<00:02:12.740> that

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
propeller on a boaters stuff like that

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.860 
propeller on a boaters stuff like that
and<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.820> imagine<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.360> high<00:02:14.480> load<00:02:14.630> will<00:02:14.750> have

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
and I imagine the high load will have

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.870 
and I imagine the high load will have
underwater<00:02:15.350> ships<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.040> stuff<00:02:16.280> because<00:02:16.460> I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
underwater ships and stuff because I

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.000 
underwater ships and stuff because I
don't<00:02:17.780> think<00:02:17.870> they<00:02:18.140> have<00:02:18.290> full<00:02:18.530> underwater

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
don't think they have full underwater

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.820 
don't think they have full underwater
breathing<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.510> yeah<00:02:20.780> that's<00:02:21.020> my<00:02:21.230> logic<00:02:21.530> behind

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
breathing so yeah that's my logic behind

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.320 
breathing so yeah that's my logic behind
this<00:02:21.980> one<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.400> let's<00:02:22.520> go<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.880> stats<00:02:23.120> out

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
this one and let's go to the stats out

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.630 
this one and let's go to the stats out
thirteen<00:02:24.170> hundred<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.710> thirty-four<00:02:25.280> and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
thirteen hundred and thirty-four and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.440 
thirteen hundred and thirty-four and
swing<00:02:26.240> speed<00:02:26.450> one<00:02:26.720> point<00:02:26.960> 25<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.650> thousand<00:02:28.640> 67

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
swing speed one point 25 and thousand 67

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.720 
swing speed one point 25 and thousand 67
damage<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.650> compare<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.310> cucumber

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
damage you compare that to the cucumber

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.790 
damage you compare that to the cucumber
Prime<00:02:32.030> you're<00:02:32.660> actually<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.990> bit<00:02:33.350> better<00:02:33.500> off

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
Prime you're actually a bit better off

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.140 
Prime you're actually a bit better off
with<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.280> attack<00:02:34.520> speed<00:02:34.760> although<00:02:34.940> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
with the attack speed although the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.210 
with the attack speed although the
cucumber<00:02:35.570> Prime<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:35.990> hits<00:02:36.170> harder<00:02:36.650> okay

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
cucumber Prime just hits harder okay

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.150 
cucumber Prime just hits harder okay
just<00:02:37.459> hits<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.820> way<00:02:38.000> harder<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:39.530> even<00:02:39.740> seems

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
just hits a way harder and it even seems

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.920 
just hits a way harder and it even seems
like<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.459> cucumber<00:02:40.910> prior<00:02:41.150> has<00:02:41.420> sup<00:02:41.750> yeah

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
like the cucumber prior has sup yeah

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.020 
like the cucumber prior has sup yeah
even<00:02:42.440> has<00:02:42.560> some<00:02:42.590> range<00:02:42.980> over<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.370> one<00:02:43.520> so

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
even has some range over that one so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.790 
even has some range over that one so
let's<00:02:44.180> move<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.690> next<00:02:44.720> one<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:45.230> is

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
let's move on to the next one this is

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.830 
let's move on to the next one this is
the<00:02:46.040> Trident<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:47.150> don't<00:02:47.360> even<00:02:47.600> need<00:02:47.690> to

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
the Trident and I don't even need to

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.540 
the Trident and I don't even need to
explain<00:02:48.110> this<00:02:48.230> name<00:02:48.440> okay<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:48.890> don't<00:02:49.310> even<00:02:49.430> need

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
explain this name okay I don't even need

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.220 
explain this name okay I don't even need
to<00:02:49.670> explain<00:02:49.940> why<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.540> typical<00:02:50.959> hi<00:02:51.050> lots

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
to explain why this is typical hi lots

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.590 
to explain why this is typical hi lots
of<00:02:51.350> weaponry<00:02:51.650> because<00:02:52.459> while<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.850> look<00:02:53.420> it

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
of weaponry because while it look it

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.500 
of weaponry because while it look it
pretty<00:02:53.810> much<00:02:53.959> is<00:02:53.990> like<00:02:54.440> our<00:02:55.220> co<00:02:55.490> weapon<00:02:55.880> 101<00:02:56.360> a

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
pretty much is like our co weapon 101 a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.949 
pretty much is like our co weapon 101 a
trident<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.709> aqua<00:02:58.400> theme<00:02:58.610> trident<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.690> is

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
trident it is a aqua theme trident it is

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.050 
trident it is a aqua theme trident it is
bright<00:03:00.410> purple<00:03:00.920> it's<00:03:01.250> very<00:03:01.520> bright<00:03:01.700> purple

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
bright purple it's very bright purple

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.520 
bright purple it's very bright purple
actually<00:03:02.330> it's<00:03:02.480> not<00:03:02.600> even<00:03:02.810> dark<00:03:02.930> purple<00:03:03.350> and

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
actually it's not even dark purple and

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.060 
actually it's not even dark purple and
the<00:03:04.070> dps<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:05.260> 1334<00:03:06.260> much<00:03:06.650> like<00:03:06.860> this<00:03:07.010> one

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
the dps is 1334 much like this one

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.060 
the dps is 1334 much like this one
actually<00:03:07.340> which<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.260> quite<00:03:09.260> curious<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.890> need

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
actually which is quite curious the need

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.990 
actually which is quite curious the need
and<00:03:10.540> 125<00:03:11.540> speed<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.230> thousand<00:03:12.950> 67<00:03:13.730> damage

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
and 125 speed and thousand 67 damage

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.210 
and 125 speed and thousand 67 damage
from<00:03:14.090> swinging<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.570> so<00:03:14.750> it's<00:03:14.930> it's<00:03:15.709> exactly

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
from swinging it so it's it's exactly

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.310 
from swinging it so it's it's exactly
the<00:03:16.370> same<00:03:16.519> as<00:03:16.700> this<00:03:16.850> one<00:03:17.030> only<00:03:17.239> it's<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.690> polearm

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
the same as this one only it's a polearm

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.979 
the same as this one only it's a polearm
it's<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.100> polearm<00:03:19.430> with<00:03:19.610> limited<00:03:20.000> range<00:03:20.239> which

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
it's a polearm with limited range which

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.229 
it's a polearm with limited range which

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
cool because well it's pretty much a

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.320 
cool because well it's pretty much a
one-handed<00:03:48.590> can<00:03:49.190> i<00:03:49.220> call<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.610> Scimitar<00:03:50.060> or

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
one-handed can i call the Scimitar or

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.870 
one-handed can i call the Scimitar or
should<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:51.019> just<00:03:51.049> call<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.680> cutlass<00:03:52.040> I<00:03:52.250> think

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
should I just call the cutlass I think

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.430 
should I just call the cutlass I think
we<00:03:52.970> should<00:03:53.000> just<00:03:53.420> call<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:53.780> like<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.959> cutlass

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
we should just call it like a cutlass

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.610 
we should just call it like a cutlass
because<00:03:54.680> it's<00:03:54.830> not<00:03:54.950> really<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> scimitar<00:03:55.850> and

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.970 
can actually combine it with the cuttles
but<00:05:02.900> it<00:05:03.050> would<00:05:03.260> make<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.440> lot<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:03.650> sense<00:05:03.740> because

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
but it would make a lot of sense because

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.580 
but it would make a lot of sense because
well<00:05:04.370> but<00:05:05.210> it<00:05:05.450> actually<00:05:05.660> could<00:05:06.080> make<00:05:06.230> some

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
well but it actually could make some

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.080 
well but it actually could make some
sense<00:05:06.830> because<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.400> does<00:05:07.610> fall<00:05:07.820> a<00:05:07.850> bit<00:05:08.030> short

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090
