00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
there there really is a fine line

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.700 
there there really is a fine line
difference<00:00:33.510> between<00:00:33.809> call<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.170> duty<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.440> this

really like choose your shot wisely but
you<00:01:11.670> also<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.299> thing<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.600> brings<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.900> down

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
you also one thing that brings it down

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.570 
you also one thing that brings it down
is<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.740> really<00:01:14.040> close<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
is you have to get really close to the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.730 
is you have to get really close to the
enemy<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.119> hit<00:01:15.299> them<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.930> whereas<00:01:16.350> even<00:01:16.650> though

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
enemy to hit them so whereas even though

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.289 
enemy to hit them so whereas even though
it<00:01:16.799> has<00:01:16.890> increased<00:01:17.369> damage<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.180> get

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it has increased damage you have to get

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.090 
it has increased damage you have to get
so<00:01:18.540> close<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.869> sometimes<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.830> even

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
so close that sometimes it's not even

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.609 
so close that sometimes it's not even
worth<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.060> uh<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.810> me<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
worth it but uh for me I just I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.289 
worth it but uh for me I just I
personally<00:01:23.369> preferred<00:01:23.729> over<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
personally preferred over it and

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.940 
personally preferred over it and
obviously<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:25.049> works<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.380> me<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.710> game

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
obviously it works for me in this game

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.359 
obviously it works for me in this game
play<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.420> judging<00:01:28.380> by<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.560> I'd<00:01:28.920> also<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
answer I prefer although just using the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.510 
answer I prefer although just using the
regular<00:01:55.020> Lancer<00:01:55.619> because<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.399> how

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
regular Lancer because I just like how

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.569 
regular Lancer because I just like how
as<00:01:56.820> sorry<00:01:57.719> increased<00:01:58.500> range<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> recoil

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
as sorry increased range and the recoil

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.700 
as sorry increased range and the recoil
isn't<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.030> bad<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.320> lot<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.590> people

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
isn't that bad on it but a lot of people

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.899 
isn't that bad on it but a lot of people
are<00:02:01.829> using<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.130> retro<00:02:02.430> answer<00:02:02.670> because<00:02:02.820> they

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
are using the retro answer because they

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.280 
are using the retro answer because they
feel<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> router<00:02:03.390> get<00:02:03.570> those<00:02:03.689> extra<00:02:03.930> of

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
feel the router get those extra of

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.109 
feel the router get those extra of
damage<00:02:04.740> points<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.189> thinking<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.729> pull<00:02:06.000> off

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
damage points so thinking like pull off

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.029 
damage points so thinking like pull off
a<00:02:06.149> couple<00:02:06.390> s<00:02:06.659> shots<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.200> kill<00:02:07.380> them<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:07.979> I

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
a couple s shots and kill them but I

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.650 
a couple s shots and kill them but I
mean<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.369> all<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.729> preference<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.629> I

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
mean it's all just preference and that I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.119 
mean it's all just preference and that I
think<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.020> really<00:02:10.080> cool<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.979> itself

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
think is really cool in and of itself

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.559 
think is really cool in and of itself
that<00:02:11.580> they<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.819> all<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.060> creativity

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
that they have all that creativity

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.520 
that they have all that creativity
something

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
something

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.140 
something
that<00:02:13.680> really<00:02:14.040> wasn't<00:02:14.310> there<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.730> Gears<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.030> War

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
that really wasn't there in Gears of War

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.900 
that really wasn't there in Gears of War
two<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.770> I've<00:02:16.770> noticed<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.340> lot<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.640> games

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
two and I've noticed that a lot of games

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.400 
two and I've noticed that a lot of games
have<00:02:18.180> been<00:02:18.240> doing<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.660> specifically

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
have been doing that specifically

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.650 
have been doing that specifically
boys'll<00:02:20.040> ones<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.459> course<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.970> call<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.390> duty

boys'll ones of course is call of duty
kind<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.470> guess<00:02:22.680> Elks<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.400> call<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.790> duty<00:02:24.030> was

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
kind of I guess Elks a call of duty was

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.000 
kind of I guess Elks a call of duty was
the<00:02:24.690> one<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.080> first<00:02:25.260> games<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.680> do<00:02:25.800> that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the one of the first games to do that

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.130 
the one of the first games to do that
we're<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.459> almost<00:02:27.180> complete<00:02:27.660> customization

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
we're like almost complete customization

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.900 
we're like almost complete customization
of<00:02:28.590> weapons<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.190> things<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.580> and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
of weapons and things like that and

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.000 
of weapons and things like that and
whereas<00:02:30.630> gears<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.110> war<00:02:31.290> may<00:02:31.470> not<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.830> that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
whereas gears of war may not have that

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.620 
whereas gears of war may not have that
full<00:02:32.250> customization<00:02:32.730> yet<00:02:33.270> such<00:02:33.510> as

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
full customization yet such as

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.690 
full customization yet such as
attachments<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.350> things<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.860> feel<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:35.370> we're

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
attachments and things I feel like we're

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.979 
attachments and things I feel like we're
getting<00:02:36.030> there<00:02:36.180> i<00:02:36.209> feel<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> community

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
getting there i feel like the community

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.190 
getting there i feel like the community
forward<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.650> really<00:02:38.190> it's<00:02:38.910> picking<00:02:39.330> up<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.690> lot

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
forward is really it's picking up a lot

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.140 
forward is really it's picking up a lot
I<00:02:40.530> think<00:02:40.830> it's<00:02:40.950> really<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.430> its<00:02:41.580> way<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.760> kind

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
I think it's really on its way to kind

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.690 
I think it's really on its way to kind
of<00:02:42.270> just<00:02:42.569> growing<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.380> i<00:02:43.590> don't<00:02:44.459> know<00:02:44.550> i<00:02:44.580> think

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
of just growing and i don't know i think

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.840 
of just growing and i don't know i think
it'll<00:02:45.000> turn<00:02:45.120> out<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.390> be<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.510> great<00:02:45.930> success<00:02:46.140> and

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
it'll turn out to be a great success and

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.670 
it'll turn out to be a great success and
i<00:02:47.850> mean<00:02:48.269> overall<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.989> my<00:02:49.019> opinion<00:02:49.170> i<00:02:49.650> think

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
i mean overall in my opinion i think

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.680 
i mean overall in my opinion i think
that<00:02:50.010> gears<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.400> war<00:02:50.550> 3<00:02:50.580> will<00:02:51.000> be<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.150> pilot<00:02:51.480> for

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
that gears of war 3 will be a pilot for

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.660 
that gears of war 3 will be a pilot for
many<00:02:51.989> more<00:02:52.200> gears<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.709> come<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.280> really

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
many more gears to come and I really

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.400 
many more gears to come and I really
think<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.940> it's<00:02:54.209> it's<00:02:54.930> really<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.320> to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
think that it's it's really going to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.530 
think that it's it's really going to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
bridge it to the next games and it's

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.000 
bridge it to the next games and it's
really<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.870> kind<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.080> set<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.350> standard

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
really going to kind of set the standard

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
of war with the weapons is that I've

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.059 
of war with the weapons is that I've
noticed<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.050> they<00:03:16.230> haven't<00:03:16.500> really<00:03:16.769> done

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
noticed that they haven't really done

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.650 
noticed that they haven't really done
much<00:03:17.130> difference<00:03:17.790> with<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.090> weapons<00:03:18.420> like<00:03:18.540> in

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
much difference with the weapons like in

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.050 
much difference with the weapons like in
terms<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.959> damage<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.560> range<00:03:19.739> besides<00:03:20.280> adding

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
terms of damage and range besides adding

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.910 
terms of damage and range besides adding
more<00:03:21.299> ones<00:03:21.570> i<00:03:21.810> feel<00:03:22.230> like<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.440> old<00:03:22.590> ones

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
more ones i feel like the old ones

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.530 
more ones i feel like the old ones
they've<00:03:23.130> kind<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.519> kept<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.880> same<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.480> terms

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
they've kind of kept the same in terms

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.660 
they've kind of kept the same in terms
of<00:03:25.140> their<00:03:25.290> abilities<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.010> i<00:03:26.250> think<00:03:26.459> that's<00:03:26.610> a

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
of their abilities and i think that's a

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.729 
of their abilities and i think that's a
really<00:03:27.120> great<00:03:27.360> thing<00:03:27.630> because<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.380> mean<00:03:28.530> for

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
I mean it doesn't have the same fan

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.650 
I mean it doesn't have the same fan
bases<00:04:27.550> are<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.790> same<00:04:27.940> following<00:04:28.510> because

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
bases are the same following because

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.630 
bases are the same following because
it's<00:04:28.840> just<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.110> changed<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:29.830> much<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.460> that's

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
it's just it changed so much and that's

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.190 
it's just it changed so much and that's
really<00:04:30.880> unfortunate<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.660> they<00:04:31.780> did<00:04:31.990> that

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
really unfortunate that they did that

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.050 
really unfortunate that they did that
and<00:04:32.410> I<00:04:32.800> feel<00:04:33.040> like<00:04:33.070> Gears<00:04:33.400> of<00:04:33.460> War<00:04:33.580> 3<00:04:33.730> on<00:04:34.000> the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
and I feel like Gears of War 3 on the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.700 
and I feel like Gears of War 3 on the
other<00:04:34.210> hand<00:04:34.390> will<00:04:34.780> still<00:04:35.110> keep<00:04:35.290> its<00:04:35.500> backing

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
other hand will still keep its backing

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.770 
other hand will still keep its backing
from<00:04:36.010> Gears<00:04:36.340> of<00:04:36.460> War<00:04:36.520> two<00:04:36.850> but<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.450> will<00:04:37.600> also

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
from Gears of War two but it will also

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.570 
from Gears of War two but it will also
take<00:04:38.080> in<00:04:38.260> some<00:04:38.470> new<00:04:38.650> crowd<00:04:38.950> because<00:04:39.310> it's<00:04:39.460> kind

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
take in some new crowd because it's kind

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.150 
take in some new crowd because it's kind
of<00:04:39.760> perfecting<00:04:40.630> are<00:04:40.840> already<00:04:41.350> good<00:04:41.560> thing<00:04:41.920> and

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
of perfecting are already good thing and

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.620 
of perfecting are already good thing and
I<00:04:42.310> think<00:04:42.340> that's<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.670> good<00:04:42.850> idea<00:04:43.030> instead<00:04:43.510> of

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
I think that's a good idea instead of

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.720 
I think that's a good idea instead of
just<00:04:43.780> trying<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.200> throw<00:04:44.740> out<00:04:44.890> a<00:04:44.920> new<00:04:45.190> game<00:04:45.430> and

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
just trying to throw out a new game and

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.880 
just trying to throw out a new game and
trying<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.030> change<00:04:46.390> it<00:04:46.600> so<00:04:46.840> much<00:04:47.080> because<00:04:47.290> to

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
trying to change it so much because to

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.470 
trying to change it so much because to
be<00:04:48.010> honest<00:04:48.340> different<00:04:48.880> games<00:04:49.090> sometimes

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
be honest different games sometimes

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.090 
be honest different games sometimes
aren't<00:04:49.690> meant<00:04:49.990> for<00:04:50.080> all<00:04:50.350> those<00:04:50.620> things<00:04:50.890> they

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
aren't meant for all those things they

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.650 
aren't meant for all those things they
aren't<00:04:51.280> meant<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.640> do<00:04:51.790> multiple<00:04:52.330> tasks

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
aren't meant to do multiple tasks

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.110 
aren't meant to do multiple tasks
they're<00:04:53.260> meant<00:04:53.410> for<00:04:53.590> their<00:04:54.040> original<00:04:54.580> one<00:04:54.730> so

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
they're meant for their original one so

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.240 
they're meant for their original one so
it<00:04:55.600> seems<00:04:56.020> like<00:04:56.200> your<00:04:56.380> support<00:04:56.710> three<00:04:56.890> kind<00:04:57.100> of

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
it seems like your support three kind of

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.700 
it seems like your support three kind of
nail<00:04:57.550> bed<00:04:57.850> in<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.350> some<00:04:59.350> things<00:04:59.500> that<00:04:59.590> have

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
nail bed in and some things that have

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.200 
nail bed in and some things that have
also<00:04:59.980> been<00:05:00.100> satisfied<00:05:00.520> with<00:05:00.730> our<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:01.030> new

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
also been satisfied with our the new

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.210 
also been satisfied with our the new
game<00:05:01.450> modes<00:05:01.780> I<00:05:02.020> don't<00:05:02.500> know<00:05:02.680> if<00:05:02.890> it's<00:05:03.040> going<00:05:03.160> to

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
game modes I don't know if it's going to

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.400 
game modes I don't know if it's going to
happen<00:05:03.400> just<00:05:03.700> kind<00:05:03.910> of<00:05:03.940> my<00:05:04.090> speculation<00:05:04.960> that

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
happen just kind of my speculation that

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.110 
happen just kind of my speculation that
Guardian<00:05:06.040> is<00:05:06.160> going<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.370> be<00:05:06.490> replaced<00:05:06.940> by

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
Guardian is going to be replaced by

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.520 
Guardian is going to be replaced by
capture<00:05:07.480> leader<00:05:07.810> completely<00:05:08.200> like<00:05:08.350> I<00:05:08.470> don't

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
capture leader completely like I don't

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.450 
capture leader completely like I don't
think<00:05:08.620> there's<00:05:08.830> going<00:05:08.920> to<00:05:09.010> be<00:05:09.040> a<00:05:09.130> guardian

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
think there's going to be a guardian

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.980 
think there's going to be a guardian

as a meat shield and hold them for 30
seconds<00:05:31.660> or<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:32.860> know<00:05:32.950> they<00:05:33.100> do<00:05:33.160> it<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.460> you

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
seconds or you know they do it to you

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.070 
seconds or you know they do it to you
too<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:34.030> that's<00:05:34.270> kind<00:05:34.480> of<00:05:34.540> just<00:05:34.720> how<00:05:34.810> you<00:05:34.870> play

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
too and that's kind of just how you play

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.320 
too and that's kind of just how you play
the<00:05:35.110> game<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:35.620> it<00:05:36.100> seems<00:05:36.460> as<00:05:36.640> if<00:05:36.670> that<00:05:37.000> may<00:05:37.270> be

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
the game and it seems as if that may be

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.170 
the game and it seems as if that may be
the<00:05:37.660> new<00:05:37.840> uh<00:05:38.010> that<00:05:39.010> might<00:05:39.160> be<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.460> new<00:05:39.610> game

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
the new uh that might be the new game

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.880 
the new uh that might be the new game
mode<00:05:40.390> or<00:05:40.540> the<00:05:40.570> new<00:05:40.780> Guardian<00:05:41.200> so<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.500> don't<00:05:41.830> know

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
mode or the new Guardian so I don't know

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.200 
mode or the new Guardian so I don't know
we'll<00:05:42.070> have<00:05:42.190> to<00:05:42.340> see<00:05:42.550> when<00:05:42.730> the<00:05:42.820> full<00:05:43.000> game

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
we'll have to see when the full game

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.870 
we'll have to see when the full game
comes<00:05:43.510> out<00:05:43.660> but<00:05:44.290> a<00:05:44.430> part<00:05:45.430> of<00:05:45.490> me<00:05:45.550> is<00:05:45.730> thinking

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
comes out but a part of me is thinking

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.430 
comes out but a part of me is thinking
that's<00:05:46.150> really<00:05:46.510> cool<00:05:46.750> and<00:05:47.020> part<00:05:47.230> of<00:05:47.290> me<00:05:47.380> is

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
that's really cool and part of me is

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.960 
that's really cool and part of me is
wishing<00:05:47.650> that<00:05:47.920> perhaps<00:05:48.220> they<00:05:48.550> still<00:05:48.790> keep

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
wishing that perhaps they still keep

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.940 
wishing that perhaps they still keep
guardian<00:05:49.450> because<00:05:49.570> Guardian<00:05:50.320> did<00:05:50.530> have<00:05:50.680> a<00:05:50.710> few

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
guardian because Guardian did have a few

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.560 
guardian because Guardian did have a few
little<00:05:51.130> differences<00:05:51.700> that<00:05:51.880> I<00:05:51.940> liked<00:05:52.270> about<00:05:52.390> it

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
little differences that I liked about it

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.000 
little differences that I liked about it
but<00:05:53.140> the<00:05:53.200> thing<00:05:53.350> would<00:05:53.440> capture<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:53.890> leader

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
but the thing would capture the leader

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.250 
but the thing would capture the leader
that<00:05:54.280> I<00:05:54.340> do<00:05:54.400> like<00:05:54.670> is<00:05:54.850> it<00:05:55.000> tends<00:05:55.270> to<00:05:55.480> last<00:05:55.720> a<00:05:55.960> lot

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
that I do like is it tends to last a lot

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.590 
that I do like is it tends to last a lot
shorter<00:05:56.680> than<00:05:57.070> did<00:05:57.280> Guardian<00:05:57.790> could<00:05:58.330> just<00:05:58.480> be

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
shorter than did Guardian could just be

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.360 
shorter than did Guardian could just be
my<00:05:58.750> opinion<00:05:59.230> and<00:05:59.440> of<00:05:59.530> course<00:05:59.740> is<00:05:59.890> all<00:06:00.040> luck<00:06:00.250> of

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
my opinion and of course is all luck of

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.680 
my opinion and of course is all luck of
the<00:06:00.400> draw<00:06:00.640> because<00:06:00.910> there's<00:06:01.060> no<00:06:01.180> real<00:06:01.420> time

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
the draw because there's no real time

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.450 
the draw because there's no real time
limit<00:06:02.020> on<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.230> game<00:06:02.380> it<00:06:02.560> kind<00:06:02.770> of<00:06:02.800> just<00:06:02.950> last

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
limit on the game it kind of just last

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.190 
limit on the game it kind of just last
as<00:06:03.640> long<00:06:03.670> as<00:06:03.880> it<00:06:04.000> does<00:06:04.180> but<00:06:04.480> I<00:06:04.630> guess<00:06:04.840> just<00:06:04.990> as<00:06:05.170> a

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
as long as it does but I guess just as a

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.310 
as long as it does but I guess just as a
game<00:06:05.470> mode<00:06:05.710> as<00:06:05.830> a<00:06:05.860> whole<00:06:06.100> it<00:06:06.370> kind<00:06:06.880> of<00:06:07.030> it<00:06:07.840> lasts

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
game mode as a whole it kind of it lasts

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.170

a<00:06:08.380> lot<00:06:08.500> shorter<00:06:08.980> and<00:06:09.220> to<00:06:09.490> be<00:06:09.580> honest<00:06:09.820> I<00:06:09.880> kind<00:06:10.030> of

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
a lot shorter and to be honest I kind of

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.880 
a lot shorter and to be honest I kind of
like<00:06:10.420> the<00:06:10.600> long<00:06:10.780> game<00:06:11.020> modes<00:06:11.290> like<00:06:11.380> I<00:06:11.560> kind<00:06:11.800> of

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
like the long game modes like I kind of

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.680 
like the long game modes like I kind of
like<00:06:12.100> going<00:06:12.280> at<00:06:12.460> a<00:06:12.520> guardian<00:06:12.940> knowing<00:06:13.540> that
