regards one of them being the fact that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.040 
regards one of them being the fact that
USB<00:00:49.580> does<00:00:50.580> not<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:51.030> error<00:00:51.360> checking<00:00:53.150> so

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
USB does not do error checking so

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.150 
USB does not do error checking so

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
step one you just simply if you know the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.149 
step one you just simply if you know the
actual<00:01:08.229> setup<00:01:08.740> if<00:01:09.159> you<00:01:09.369> know<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.990> details

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
actual setup if you know the details

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.649 
actual setup if you know the details
about<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.520> raid<00:01:12.700> array<00:01:13.210> you're<00:01:13.390> trying<00:01:13.600> to

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
about the raid array you're trying to

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.499 
about the raid array you're trying to
recover<00:01:13.869> you<00:01:14.619> put<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.890> drive<00:01:15.220> order<00:01:15.520> in<00:01:15.670> to

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
recover you put the drive order in to

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.830 
recover you put the drive order in to
the<00:01:16.600> best<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:16.869> your<00:01:16.960> knowledge<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.530> step<00:01:17.890> one

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the best of your knowledge and step one

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.820 
the best of your knowledge and step one
down<00:01:19.840> here<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:22.060> set<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.390> block<00:01:22.570> size<00:01:22.840> again

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
down here you set the block size again

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.990 
down here you set the block size again
to<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.130> best<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.490> your<00:01:24.670> knowledge<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
to the best of your knowledge in the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.290 
to the best of your knowledge in the
actual<00:01:28.270> parity<00:01:29.940> then<00:01:30.940> in<00:01:31.240> step<00:01:31.869> two<00:01:32.170> which<00:01:32.740> is

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
actual parity then in step two which is

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.980 
actual parity then in step two which is
recommended<00:01:34.300> you<00:01:34.840> would<00:01:35.020> do<00:01:35.229> an<00:01:35.350> analyzation

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
recommended you would do an analyzation

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.630 
recommended you would do an analyzation
now<00:01:37.990> we're<00:01:38.380> going<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.649> basically<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:41.380> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
now we're going to basically do a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.969 
now we're going to basically do a
pretest<00:01:42.640> here<00:01:43.440> which<00:01:44.440> is<00:01:44.619> going<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.800> do

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
pretest here which is going to do

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.940 
pretest here which is going to do
surface<00:01:45.940> scan<00:01:46.890> drive<00:01:47.890> detection<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.950> it's

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
surface scan drive detection and it's

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.370 
surface scan drive detection and it's
taken<00:01:51.550> away

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.030 

this<00:01:54.979> quite<00:01:55.250> disc

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.760 

now<00:01:58.610> in<00:01:58.790> this<00:01:58.880> particular<00:01:59.090> step<00:01:59.660> it's<00:02:00.590> going

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
now in this particular step it's going

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
now in this particular step it's going
to<00:02:00.830> ask<00:02:01.010> you<00:02:01.250> for<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:02.150> actual<00:02:02.300> parameters

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
to ask you for the the actual parameters

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.600 
to ask you for the the actual parameters
now<00:02:05.590> I'm<00:02:06.590> not<00:02:06.680> going<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.950> go<00:02:07.100> into<00:02:07.190> crazy

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
now I'm not going to go into crazy

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.910 
now I'm not going to go into crazy
detail<00:02:08.030> about<00:02:08.240> this<00:02:08.450> because<00:02:08.750> every<00:02:09.710> raid

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
detail about this because every raid

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.800 
detail about this because every raid
configuration<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:10.850> different<00:02:12.550> but<00:02:13.660> if<00:02:14.660> you

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
configuration is different but if you

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.940 
configuration is different but if you
have<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.020> raid<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:18.020> using<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.620> hardware

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
have a raid that is using a hardware

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.360 
have a raid that is using a hardware
controller<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.780> want<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.350> set<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.100> start

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
controller you want to set the start

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.700 
controller you want to set the start
sector<00:02:22.640> 20<00:02:22.910> that's<00:02:23.630> usually<00:02:24.020> what<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.410> if

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
sector 20 that's usually what it is if

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.080 
sector 20 that's usually what it is if
it's<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.920> software<00:02:25.220> raid<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.640> want<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:25.970> do

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
it's a software raid you want to do

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.270 
it's a software raid you want to do
especially<00:02:26.660> Microsoft<00:02:27.500> one<00:02:27.740> you<00:02:27.920> want<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.190> do

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
especially Microsoft one you want to do

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.990 
especially Microsoft one you want to do
around<00:02:28.400> 63<00:02:29.090> or<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:31.160> know<00:02:31.310> block<00:02:31.550> size<00:02:31.790> to

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
around 63 or so you know block size to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.060 
around 63 or so you know block size to
probe<00:02:32.209> again<00:02:32.930> if<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.200> know<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.530> basics<00:02:33.980> about

ability<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:51.920> hit<00:02:52.070> next<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.760> if<00:02:55.760> now<00:02:56.060> it's

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
ability you hit next the if now it's

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.590 
ability you hit next the if now it's
performing<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.810> entropy<00:02:57.350> test<00:02:58.390> entropy<00:02:59.390> is

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
performing the entropy test entropy is

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.030 
performing the entropy test entropy is
nothing<00:03:00.080> more<00:03:00.200> than<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.610> calculated<00:03:01.610> guess<00:03:01.870> so

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
nothing more than a calculated guess so

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.840 
nothing more than a calculated guess so
you<00:03:04.040> know<00:03:04.190> basically<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:06.500> could<00:03:06.739> guess<00:03:07.580> right

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
you know basically it could guess right

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.870 
you know basically it could guess right
or<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.810> could<00:03:09.019> guess<00:03:09.200> wrong<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:10.190> there's<00:03:10.730> going

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
or it could guess wrong so there's going

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.370 
or it could guess wrong so there's going
to<00:03:10.970> be<00:03:11.030> some<00:03:11.239> trial<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.630> error<00:03:11.780> here<00:03:12.580> but<00:03:13.580> as

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
to be some trial and error here but as

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.949 
to be some trial and error here but as
its<00:03:15.380> working<00:03:15.799> here<00:03:16.630> what<00:03:17.630> you're<00:03:17.780> going<00:03:17.900> to

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
its working here what you're going to

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:25.560 
its working here what you're going to
look<00:03:18.260> for<00:03:18.590> in<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.700> entropy<00:03:20.120> column<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:22.120> OS<00:03:23.120> for

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
look for in the entropy column is OS for

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.990 
look for in the entropy column is OS for
you're<00:03:26.570> going<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.840> want<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.110> make<00:03:27.260> sure<00:03:28.000> that

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
you're going to want to make sure that

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.900 
you're going to want to make sure that
whatever<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:30.110> recommends<00:03:30.769> if<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:31.730> does

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
whatever it recommends if it does

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.509 
whatever it recommends if it does
recommend<00:03:32.299> anything<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:33.590> is<00:03:33.799> says<00:03:33.980> OS<00:03:34.250> for

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
recommend anything that is says OS for

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.320 
recommend anything that is says OS for
next<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:36.730> basically<00:03:37.730> right<00:03:38.269> now<00:03:38.590> it's

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
next to it and basically right now it's

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.000 
next to it and basically right now it's
still<00:03:41.330> tickin<00:03:41.720> away<00:03:41.810> here<00:03:42.489> so

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
still tickin away here so

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.339 
still tickin away here so
we're<00:03:45.939> going<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.180> see<00:03:46.330> here<00:03:46.540> pretty<00:03:46.750> soon<00:03:46.989> and

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
we're going to see here pretty soon and

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.309 
we're going to see here pretty soon and
it's<00:03:47.500> going<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.739> have

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:17.879 

you<00:03:52.620> know<00:03:52.769> an<00:03:52.859> answer

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:25.250 

though<00:04:18.599> this<00:04:19.599> usually<00:04:20.049> takes<00:04:21.479> good<00:04:22.479> minute<00:04:23.280> so

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
though this usually takes good minute so

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.850 
though this usually takes good minute so
sometimes<00:04:26.070> faster<00:04:26.310> sometimes<00:04:26.790> not

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.200 

alright

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
alright

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.740 
alright
it's<00:04:34.780> basically<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:36.090> first<00:04:37.090> option<00:04:37.389> as

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
it's basically the first option as

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.059 
it's basically the first option as
you've<00:04:38.680> noticed<00:04:39.009> has<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.340> OS<00:04:39.520> for<00:04:39.850> next<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.360> it

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
you've noticed has the OS for next to it

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:47.640 
you've noticed has the OS for next to it
as<00:04:42.069> well<00:04:42.310> as<00:04:43.229> what<00:04:44.229> it<00:04:44.349> estimates<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:46.650> block

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
as well as what it estimates the block

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.770 
as well as what it estimates the block
size<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:48.099> be<00:04:48.250> start<00:04:48.849> sector<00:04:49.090> so<00:04:49.449> on<00:04:49.569> and<00:04:49.720> so

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
size to be start sector so on and so

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.470 
size to be start sector so on and so
forth<00:04:51.870> so

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.070 

basically<00:04:56.290> from<00:04:56.470> here<00:04:57.600> you<00:04:58.600> take<00:04:58.840> it<00:04:59.050> the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
basically from here you take it the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.720 
basically from here you take it the
first<00:04:59.290> recommendation<00:04:59.650> hit<00:05:00.160> finish<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:03.400> then

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
first recommendation hit finish and then

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.500 
first recommendation hit finish and then
you<00:05:03.940> output<00:05:05.790> what<00:05:06.790> it<00:05:06.940> is<00:05:07.120> able<00:05:07.270> to

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
you output what it is able to

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.220 
you output what it is able to
reconstruct<00:05:08.880> into<00:05:09.880> a<00:05:09.910> virtual<00:05:10.210> image<00:05:10.570> file<00:05:10.780> or

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
reconstruct into a virtual image file or

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.490 
reconstruct into a virtual image file or
an<00:05:11.410> image<00:05:11.530> file<00:05:11.860> i<00:05:12.330> chose<00:05:13.330> image<00:05:13.630> file<00:05:13.840> because

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
an image file i chose image file because

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.650 
an image file i chose image file because
of<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.770> risk<00:05:14.950> of<00:05:15.220> you<00:05:15.760> know<00:05:15.790> drive<00:05:16.980> /<00:05:17.980> hardware

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
of the risk of you know drive / hardware

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.380 
of the risk of you know drive / hardware
concerns<00:05:19.660> so<00:05:20.470> i<00:05:20.500> was<00:05:20.860> able<00:05:20.950> to<00:05:21.220> chop<00:05:21.700> put<00:05:21.970> the

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
concerns so i was able to chop put the

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.900 
concerns so i was able to chop put the
image<00:05:22.870> directly<00:05:23.290> to<00:05:23.530> another<00:05:23.710> desk<00:05:24.660> so<00:05:26.910> once

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
image directly to another desk so once

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.480 
image directly to another desk so once
it<00:05:28.060> finishes<00:05:28.300> which<00:05:29.290> you<00:05:29.860> know<00:05:30.010> depending<00:05:30.370> on

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
it finishes which you know depending on

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.520 
it finishes which you know depending on
your<00:05:30.610> hardware<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:31.030> your<00:05:31.270> setup<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:32.290> if<00:05:32.470> you

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
your hardware and your setup and if you

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.350 
your hardware and your setup and if you
do<00:05:32.650> a<00:05:32.680> right<00:05:32.980> or<00:05:33.160> wrong<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.850> if<00:05:34.060> you<00:05:34.180> do<00:05:34.270> it

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
do a right or wrong and if you do it

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.640 
do a right or wrong and if you do it
wrong<00:05:34.480> like<00:05:34.720> me<00:05:34.930> it's<00:05:35.140> going<00:05:35.260> to<00:05:35.350> take<00:05:35.500> longer

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
wrong like me it's going to take longer

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.800 
wrong like me it's going to take longer
if<00:05:35.860> you<00:05:35.950> do<00:05:36.070> it<00:05:36.190> right<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:37.090> you<00:05:37.180> actually<00:05:37.360> use

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
if you do it right and you actually use

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.850 
if you do it right and you actually use
you<00:05:38.440> know<00:05:38.500> internal<00:05:39.430> hard<00:05:40.590> hardware<00:05:41.590> drive

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
you know internal hard hardware drive

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.970 
you know internal hard hardware drive
controllers<00:05:42.430> you<00:05:43.270> should<00:05:43.450> get<00:05:43.600> it<00:05:44.110> to<00:05:44.440> dispel

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
controllers you should get it to dispel

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.910 
controllers you should get it to dispel
the<00:05:45.960> image<00:05:46.960> faster<00:05:47.530> but<00:05:48.030> at<00:05:49.030> any<00:05:49.180> rate

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
the image faster but at any rate

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.400 
the image faster but at any rate
basically<00:05:51.690> you<00:05:52.690> then<00:05:52.960> would<00:05:53.200> take<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:55.410> image

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
basically you then would take the image

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.130 
basically you then would take the image
into<00:05:57.280> another<00:05:57.820> piece<00:05:58.060> of<00:05:58.210> software<00:05:58.540> that<00:05:58.810> is

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
into another piece of software that is

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:05.030 
into another piece of software that is
able<00:05:59.320> to<00:06:00.690> analyze<00:06:01.690> the<00:06:02.560> NTFS<00:06:03.160> image<00:06:03.550> and

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
able to analyze the NTFS image and

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.240 
able to analyze the NTFS image and
depending<00:06:06.040> on<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.610> file<00:06:06.760> system<00:06:06.970> quality<00:06:08.250> you

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
depending on the file system quality you

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.610 
depending on the file system quality you
could<00:06:09.840> be<00:06:11.190> able<00:06:12.190> to<00:06:12.490> determine<00:06:13.260> how<00:06:14.260> much<00:06:14.380> data

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
could be able to determine how much data

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.930 
could be able to determine how much data
you're<00:06:14.800> able<00:06:15.100> to<00:06:15.190> get<00:06:15.310> back<00:06:15.960> or<00:06:17.190> if<00:06:18.190> it's

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
you're able to get back or if it's

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.850 
you're able to get back or if it's
someone<00:06:19.120> messed<00:06:19.390> up<00:06:19.630> you're<00:06:20.530> going<00:06:20.680> to<00:06:20.740> have

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
someone messed up you're going to have

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.770 
someone messed up you're going to have
to<00:06:20.980> take<00:06:21.340> it<00:06:21.490> into<00:06:21.610> a<00:06:22.000> piece<00:06:22.180> of<00:06:22.210> software<00:06:22.690> that

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
to take it into a piece of software that

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.530 
to take it into a piece of software that
is<00:06:23.100> going<00:06:24.100> to<00:06:24.160> basically<00:06:24.520> reconstruct<00:06:25.300> that

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
is going to basically reconstruct that

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.740 
is going to basically reconstruct that
file<00:06:25.840> system

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
file system

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.380 
file system
using<00:06:28.530> that<00:06:28.650> image<00:06:29.010> for<00:06:29.850> that<00:06:30.030> I<00:06:30.060> would

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
using that image for that I would

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.870 
using that image for that I would
recommend<00:06:30.690> get<00:06:31.320> data<00:06:31.530> back<00:06:31.620> it's<00:06:32.580> another

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
recommend get data back it's another

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.950 
recommend get data back it's another
runtime<00:06:33.480> software<00:06:33.900> product<00:06:34.550> but<00:06:35.690> that<00:06:36.690> pretty

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
runtime software product but that pretty

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.770 
runtime software product but that pretty
much<00:06:37.140> concludes<00:06:37.320> it<00:06:37.740> again<00:06:38.340> basically<00:06:39.150> I<00:06:39.390> was

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
much concludes it again basically I was

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.550 
much concludes it again basically I was
able<00:06:39.930> to<00:06:40.080> take<00:06:41.010> a<00:06:41.040> hardware<00:06:41.460> raid<00:06:42.450> 5<00:06:42.690> from<00:06:43.440> the

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
able to take a hardware raid 5 from the

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.330 
able to take a hardware raid 5 from the
server<00:06:43.800> and<00:06:44.990> recover<00:06:45.990> the<00:06:46.110> data<00:06:46.470> using<00:06:47.130> only

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
server and recover the data using only

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.620 
server and recover the data using only
my<00:06:47.700> personal<00:06:47.880> laptop<00:06:48.620> thanks
