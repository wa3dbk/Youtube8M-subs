00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:06.400 
in chunk you can just hear how that you

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.990 
in chunk you can just hear how that you
hold<00:00:06.610> it<00:00:06.790> yeah<00:00:07.830> sorry<00:00:08.830> that's<00:00:09.280> all<00:00:09.430> right

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.610 

okay<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.060> this<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.660> frankly<00:00:16.020> with<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.200> non-tech

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:16.620 
okay so this is frankly with a non-tech

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.290 
okay so this is frankly with a non-tech
and<00:00:16.770> we're<00:00:16.860> taking<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.190> look<00:00:17.280> at<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> iphone<00:00:17.550> 5s

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and we're taking a look at the iphone 5s

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.330 
and we're taking a look at the iphone 5s
so<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.200> have<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.440> the<00:00:19.590> champagne<00:00:20.040> gold<00:00:20.250> color

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
so we have is the champagne gold color

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.690 
so we have is the champagne gold color
model<00:00:20.880> which<00:00:21.689> as<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.020> can<00:00:22.050> see<00:00:22.200> as<00:00:22.560> gold<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
model which as you can see as gold the

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.839 
model which as you can see as gold the
cafard<00:00:24.119> edge<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:25.310> everywhere<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.580> still

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
cafard edge and everywhere that we still

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.029 
cafard edge and everywhere that we still
remove<00:00:27.119> our<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> aluminum

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
remove our on the aluminum

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.370 
remove our on the aluminum
but<00:00:28.339> it's<00:00:28.460> otherwise<00:00:29.089> got<00:00:29.419> white<00:00:29.599> accents

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
but it's otherwise got white accents

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.130 
but it's otherwise got white accents
aquaponics<00:00:31.189> on<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.180> front<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:32.899> have<00:00:33.020> the

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
aquaponics on the front you have the

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.130 
aquaponics on the front you have the
fingerprint<00:00:33.620> detection<00:00:34.149> sensor<00:00:35.149> guess<00:00:35.960> imma

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
fingerprint detection sensor guess imma

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.880 
fingerprint detection sensor guess imma
need<00:00:36.230> your<00:00:36.469> fingerprint<00:00:36.920> to<00:00:37.010> turn<00:00:37.190> it<00:00:37.309> on<00:00:38.890> so

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
need your fingerprint to turn it on so

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.520 
need your fingerprint to turn it on so
strangely<00:00:42.100> tips<00:00:43.100> work<00:00:43.309> pretty<00:00:43.519> fast

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.290 

so<00:00:47.530> if<00:00:47.620> i<00:00:47.740> press<00:00:47.980> it<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.340> it's<00:00:48.580> not<00:00:48.790> it's<00:00:49.210> not

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
so if i press it and it's not it's not

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.160 
so if i press it and it's not it's not
accepted<00:00:49.780> than<00:00:49.870> what<00:00:49.990> happens<00:00:50.290> it

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
accepted than what happens it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.340 
accepted than what happens it
you<00:00:52.010> won't<00:00:52.219> be<00:00:52.399> able<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.640> get<00:00:52.760> in<00:00:53.109> it's<00:00:54.109> locked

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
you won't be able to get in it's locked

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.240 
you won't be able to get in it's locked
down<00:00:55.449> so<00:00:56.449> it<00:00:56.899> seems<00:00:57.109> pretty<00:00:57.260> smooth<00:00:57.620> let's

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
down so it seems pretty smooth let's

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.520 
down so it seems pretty smooth let's
take<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.429> look<00:00:58.579> at<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.730> new<00:00:58.850> camera<00:00:59.350> so<00:01:00.350> one<00:01:00.500> of

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
take a look at the new camera so one of

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.689 
take a look at the new camera so one of
the<00:01:00.649> improvements<00:01:00.920> with<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.309> camera<00:01:01.640> is

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
the improvements with the camera is

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.469 
the improvements with the camera is
first<00:01:02.059> F<00:01:02.239> 2.2<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.050> 1.5<00:01:03.620> micron<00:01:03.859> fixings

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
first F 2.2 and 1.5 micron fixings

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.300 
first F 2.2 and 1.5 micron fixings
before<00:01:05.479> was<00:01:05.689> one<00:01:05.869> way<00:01:06.020> for<00:01:06.259> micron

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.149 

let's<00:01:10.310> do<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:12.430> reason<00:01:13.430> just<00:01:13.700> keeps<00:01:13.880> going<00:01:14.060> Wow

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
let's do the reason just keeps going Wow

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.910 
let's do the reason just keeps going Wow
see<00:01:16.159> when<00:01:16.280> we<00:01:16.399> go<00:01:16.549> to<00:01:18.549> just<00:01:19.549> call<00:01:19.729> this<00:01:19.850> up

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
see when we go to just call this up

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.890 
see when we go to just call this up
and<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.130> person<00:01:23.280> they<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.900> high

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and then in person they have a high

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.160 
and then in person they have a high
frame<00:01:25.170> rate<00:01:25.350> FPS<00:01:26.040> video<00:01:26.689> I'm<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.840> quite<00:01:28.140> sure

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
frame rate FPS video I'm not quite sure

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.430 
frame rate FPS video I'm not quite sure
how<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.530> exposure<00:01:29.040> excel<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.290> always

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
how that exposure excel so is it always

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.280 
how that exposure excel so is it always
recording<00:01:32.040> my<00:01:32.340> FPS<00:01:32.880> video<00:01:35.780> right<00:01:36.780> now<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.960> guess

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
recording my FPS video right now I guess

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.150 
recording my FPS video right now I guess
we<00:01:38.990> stopped

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.680 

you're<00:01:44.160> not<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.520> slow<00:01:44.820> motion<00:01:45.030> here<00:01:45.420> you're<00:01:45.600> in

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
you're not in slow motion here you're in

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.400 
you're not in slow motion here you're in
video<00:01:46.850> just<00:01:47.850> love<00:01:48.060> ever<00:01:48.300> exactly<00:01:48.690> this<00:01:49.230> is<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
video just love ever exactly this is a

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.220 
video just love ever exactly this is a
kindle<00:01:49.680> slide<00:01:50.010> I<00:01:50.220> see<00:01:50.550> now<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.330> tells<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.630> 120

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
kindle slide I see now it tells you 120

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.430 
kindle slide I see now it tells you 120
up<00:01:52.320> yes<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> before<00:01:53.820> gear<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.110> even<00:01:55.170> see

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
up yes so before gear you can even see

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.170 
up yes so before gear you can even see
the<00:01:55.560> preview<00:01:55.920> already<00:01:56.220> is<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.610> higher<00:01:56.850> frame

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the preview already is much higher frame

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.210 
the preview already is much higher frame
rate<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:58.350> doesn't<00:01:58.740> come<00:01:58.860> through<00:01:59.010> on<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
rate which doesn't come through on the

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.220 
rate which doesn't come through on the
camera<00:01:59.550> but<00:01:59.580> it<00:01:59.790> looks<00:01:59.940> way<00:02:00.090> over<00:02:00.360> there

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
camera but it looks way over there

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.870 
camera but it looks way over there
become

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.839 

on<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.329> part<00:02:07.630> is<00:02:07.719> slow<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:09.009> part<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.700> is

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
on this part is slow so part of it is

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:18.630 
on this part is slow so part of it is
normal<00:02:10.270> freeway<00:02:16.890> that's<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.980> cool<00:02:18.130> way<00:02:18.280> because

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
normal freeway that's a cool way because

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.100 
normal freeway that's a cool way because
generally<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.300> know<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.599> want<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.870> show<00:02:19.989> the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
generally you know you want to show the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.720 
generally you know you want to show the
action<00:02:20.440> leading<00:02:20.709> up<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:21.010> keep<00:02:21.280> track<00:02:21.489> right

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
action leading up to keep track right

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.850 
action leading up to keep track right
you<00:02:21.970> can<00:02:22.120> figure<00:02:22.269> out<00:02:22.390> how<00:02:22.599> much<00:02:22.930> how<00:02:23.200> long

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.350 

what<00:02:26.860> else<00:02:27.010> we<00:02:27.190> take<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.430> look<00:02:27.640> at<00:02:27.819> inside

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
what else we take a look at inside

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.390 
what else we take a look at inside
settings<00:02:28.810> there's<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.260> fingerprint

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
settings there's the fingerprint

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.050 
settings there's the fingerprint
hey<00:02:31.790> Chris<00:02:32.060> yeah<00:02:32.209> enter<00:02:32.510> your<00:02:32.629> back<00:02:36.879> you<00:02:37.879> want

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
hey Chris yeah enter your back you want

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.929 
hey Chris yeah enter your back you want
to<00:02:38.120> give<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.599> you<00:02:38.780> get<00:02:38.989> fingerprints

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
to give it to that you get fingerprints

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.220

here<00:06:06.159> at<00:06:06.280> 30fps<00:06:06.669> but<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.330> seems<00:06:07.569> to<00:06:07.750> be<00:06:07.870> a<00:06:07.900> way

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
here at 30fps but it seems to be a way

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.239 
here at 30fps but it seems to be a way
about<00:06:08.400> 30<00:06:09.400> almost

00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:11.249 
about 30 almost

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:14.050 
about 30 almost
obviously<00:06:11.729> just<00:06:11.909> that<00:06:12.059> these<00:06:12.239> things

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
obviously just that these things

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.220 
obviously just that these things
I<00:06:15.970> don't<00:06:16.970> really<00:06:17.060> know<00:06:17.240> I<00:06:17.270> think<00:06:17.570> we'll<00:06:18.050> take<00:06:18.200> a

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
I don't really know I think we'll take a

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.290 
I don't really know I think we'll take a
look<00:06:18.350> at<00:06:18.470> iOS<00:06:18.590> 7<00:06:19.160> and<00:06:19.250> more<00:06:19.460> depth<00:06:19.669> okay

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
look at iOS 7 and more depth okay

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.409 
look at iOS 7 and more depth okay
obviously<00:06:20.720> the<00:06:20.930> champagne<00:06:21.380> color<00:06:21.620> is<00:06:21.860> awesome

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
obviously the champagne color is awesome

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.000 
obviously the champagne color is awesome
dual<00:06:23.419> LED<00:06:23.630> flash<00:06:23.900> I<00:06:24.410> guess<00:06:24.560> we<00:06:24.710> can<00:06:24.830> look<00:06:24.919> at

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
dual LED flash I guess we can look at

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.550 
dual LED flash I guess we can look at
that<00:06:25.190> see<00:06:26.030> if<00:06:26.090> we<00:06:26.150> can<00:06:26.330> see<00:06:26.510> it<00:06:26.540> light<00:06:26.840> up<00:06:26.870> turn

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
that see if we can see it light up turn

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.710 
that see if we can see it light up turn
the<00:06:27.650> flash<00:06:27.889> off

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
the flash off

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.409 
the flash off
warmer<00:06:29.260> in<00:06:29.320> the<00:06:29.440> photos

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.820 

we'll<00:06:36.419> try<00:06:36.600> that<00:06:36.630> again<00:06:36.870> you<00:06:37.320> can<00:06:37.440> even<00:06:37.530> tell

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
we'll try that again you can even tell

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.900 
we'll try that again you can even tell
right<00:06:38.009> there<00:06:38.039> yes

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.300 

so<00:06:42.540> you<00:06:42.600> see<00:06:42.870> the<00:06:42.990> two<00:06:43.140> LEDs<00:06:43.560> come<00:06:43.770> on<00:06:43.920> so<00:06:44.130> they

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
so you see the two LEDs come on so they

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.470 
so you see the two LEDs come on so they
can<00:06:44.490> mix<00:06:44.700> and<00:06:44.910> get<00:06:45.060> the<00:06:45.180> right<00:06:45.330> color

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
can mix and get the right color

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.439 
can mix and get the right color
temperature

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:53.260 

see

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.030 

used<00:06:53.750> to<00:06:53.840> go<00:06:53.960> pretty<00:06:54.110> fast<00:06:54.320> even<00:06:54.740> then<00:06:54.860> it's

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040 
used to go pretty fast even then it's

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.290 
used to go pretty fast even then it's
doing<00:06:55.310> its<00:06:55.490> metering

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.240 

yeah<00:06:59.300> that's<00:07:00.140> the<00:07:00.260> thing<00:07:00.290> I<00:07:00.770> think<00:07:01.130> you'll

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
yeah that's the thing I think you'll

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.770 
yeah that's the thing I think you'll
really<00:07:01.340> have<00:07:01.670> to<00:07:01.820> spend<00:07:02.030> a<00:07:02.060> lot<00:07:02.210> more<00:07:02.240> time<00:07:02.570> to

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:02.780 
really have to spend a lot more time to

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.900 
really have to spend a lot more time to
the<00:07:03.410> edge<00:07:03.590> performance<00:07:03.830> but<00:07:04.370> obviously<00:07:04.730> the

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.910 
the edge performance but obviously the

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.700 
the edge performance but obviously the
ports<00:07:05.150> of<00:07:05.240> iOS<00:07:05.660> that<00:07:05.840> are<00:07:05.960> smooth<00:07:06.230> are<00:07:06.470> still

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
ports of iOS that are smooth are still

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.650 
ports of iOS that are smooth are still
smooth

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
smooth

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:28.940 
smooth
love<00:07:08.140> like<00:07:08.410> coming<00:07:08.770> to<00:07:08.860> photos<00:07:09.220> me

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:28.950
