a<00:03:04.890> big<00:03:05.190> heat<00:03:05.430> for<00:03:05.730> for<00:03:06.300> Sean<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:06.870> would<00:03:07.020> have

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
a big heat for for Sean it would have

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.970 
a big heat for for Sean it would have
meant<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.620> lot<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.340> him<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:09.090> me<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.690> he<00:03:09.980> will

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
meant a lot to him to me that he will

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.820 
meant a lot to him to me that he will
see<00:03:11.220> what<00:03:11.250> happens<00:03:11.760> because<00:03:11.910> right<00:03:12.750> now<00:03:13.020> lecco

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
see what happens because right now lecco

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.830 
see what happens because right now lecco
is<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:14.460> position<00:03:14.850> for<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.180> title<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:15.810> that

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
is in position for the title so that

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.830 
is in position for the title so that
means<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:17.010> he<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.700> take<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:18.090> event<00:03:18.450> he

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
means if he is to take this event he

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.310 
means if he is to take this event he
will<00:03:19.140> be<00:03:19.710> world<00:03:20.190> champion<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.870> think

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
will be world champion and I think

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.710 
will be world champion and I think
Sean's<00:03:22.800> probably<00:03:23.370> biting<00:03:23.670> his<00:03:23.760> nails<00:03:23.790> to

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
Sean's probably biting his nails to

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.710 
Sean's probably biting his nails to
watch<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.200> final<00:03:25.590> for<00:03:25.770> this<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.270> yeah<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.570> was

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
watch the final for this and yeah it was

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.150 
watch the final for this and yeah it was
a<00:03:27.750> heavy<00:03:28.080> Heat<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.530> mean<00:03:28.680> Lecco

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
a heavy Heat I mean Lecco

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.220 
a heavy Heat I mean Lecco
pretty<00:03:29.520> much<00:03:29.730> dominated<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.630> at<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.050> end

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
pretty much dominated it at the end

pretty much dominated it at the end
there<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.800> think<00:03:31.980> Sean<00:03:32.520> needed<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.970> 10<00:03:33.240> and<00:03:33.480> no

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
there I think Sean needed a 10 and no

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.460 
there I think Sean needed a 10 and no
one<00:03:34.080> wants<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.590> news<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:35.100> needing<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:36.000> 10<00:03:36.470> that
