this<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.660> where<00:00:09.780> we<00:00:09.809> left<00:00:10.050> off<00:00:10.290> from<00:00:10.320> last<00:00:10.800> time

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
this is where we left off from last time

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.970 
this is where we left off from last time
which<00:00:11.400> was<00:00:11.429> we<00:00:12.120> had<00:00:12.300> broken<00:00:12.570> up<00:00:12.809> our<00:00:13.559> three

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
which was we had broken up our three

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.090 
which was we had broken up our three
view<00:00:14.719> drawing<00:00:15.719> into<00:00:16.289> its<00:00:16.440> three<00:00:16.650> separate

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
view drawing into its three separate

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.599 
view drawing into its three separate
views<00:00:17.869> top<00:00:18.869> front<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.449> side<00:00:22.340> and<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.490> we're

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
views top front and side and what we're

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.310 
views top front and side and what we're
going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.880> today<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.660> we're<00:00:24.810> actually<00:00:24.960> going

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
going to today is we're actually going

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.400 
going to today is we're actually going
to<00:00:25.410> create<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.070> fuselage<00:00:27.140> basically<00:00:28.140> what<00:00:28.289> it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
to create the fuselage basically what it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.950 
to create the fuselage basically what it
will<00:00:28.500> entail<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.400> creating<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.510> primitive

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
will entail is creating a primitive

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.090 
will entail is creating a primitive
object<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.690> breaking<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.780> out<00:00:33.899> into<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.410> into

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
object and breaking it out into it into

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.299 
object and breaking it out into it into
its<00:00:35.550> individual<00:00:36.149> vertices<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:37.739> shaping

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
its individual vertices and then shaping

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
its individual vertices and then shaping
those<00:00:38.399> vertices<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.180> make<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.480> look<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.870> our

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
those vertices to make it look like our

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.410 
those vertices to make it look like our
fuselage<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> very<00:00:41.850> first<00:00:42.149> thing<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
fuselage so the very first thing that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.819 
fuselage so the very first thing that
we're<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.500> we're<00:00:43.680> actually

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
we're going to do is we're actually

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.209 
we're going to do is we're actually
going<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> select<00:00:44.489> our<00:00:44.969> front<00:00:45.719> view<00:00:46.219> that's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
going to select our front view that's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.830 
going to select our front view that's
happen<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> way<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.719> do

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
happen to be the way that I like to do

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.660 
happen to be the way that I like to do
it<00:00:49.020> normally<00:00:49.559> what's<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
it normally what's going to have to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.889 
it normally what's going to have to
happen<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.149> you're<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.690> take

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
happen is you're going to have to take

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.830 
happen is you're going to have to take
your<00:00:52.170> primitive<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.510> manipulate<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> in

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
your primitive and manipulate it in

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.450 
your primitive and manipulate it in
three<00:00:55.170> different<00:00:55.680> views<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:57.030> front<00:00:58.160> side<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
three different views the front side and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.389 
three different views the front side and
the<00:01:00.239> top<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.949> do<00:01:02.070> them<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.280> those

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
the top I like to do them in those

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.240 
the top I like to do them in those
orders<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.960> said<00:01:04.290> before<00:01:04.500> there's<00:01:05.100> no

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
orders but like I said before there's no

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.250 
orders but like I said before there's no
right<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.640> wrong<00:01:05.670> way<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.659> whatever<00:01:06.900> makes

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
right or wrong way it's whatever makes

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.800 
right or wrong way it's whatever makes
it<00:01:07.500> easier<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:09.479> we're<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
it easier for you so what we're going to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.730 
it easier for you so what we're going to
do<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> we're<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> create<00:01:10.590> our<00:01:10.650> first

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
do is we're going to create our first

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.160 
do is we're going to create our first
primitive<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.700> we're<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.810> select

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
primitive and we're going to select

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.830 
primitive and we're going to select
create<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.130> then<00:01:14.520> cylinder<00:01:16.100> now<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> reason

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
create and then cylinder now the reason

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
create and then cylinder now the reason
I<00:01:18.900> use<00:01:19.080> cylinder<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.619> because<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.070> essence<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
I use cylinder is because in essence a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.760 
I use cylinder is because in essence a
fuselage<00:01:21.299> looks<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> cylinder

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
fuselage looks like a cylinder

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.770 
fuselage looks like a cylinder
it's<00:01:23.070> an<00:01:23.159> odd<00:01:23.340> shaped<00:01:23.610> cylinder<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.240> that's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it's an odd shaped cylinder but that's

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.660 
it's an odd shaped cylinder but that's
basically<00:01:25.350> what<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.619> most<00:01:25.890> looked<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.430> out

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
basically what it most looked like out

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.810 
basically what it most looked like out
of<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.030> these<00:01:27.270> primitives<00:01:28.100> also<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.340> prefer

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
of all of these primitives also I prefer

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.149 
of all of these primitives also I prefer
to<00:01:30.060> work<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.479> full-screen<00:01:31.259> mode<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> will

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
to work in full-screen mode so I will

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.010 
to work in full-screen mode so I will
select<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> front<00:01:32.880> view<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:34.159> toggle<00:01:35.159> min/max

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
select the front view and toggle min/max

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.109 
select the front view and toggle min/max
that<00:01:37.020> way<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.770> fullscreen<00:01:38.430> view<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that way I get the fullscreen view of

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.140 
that way I get the fullscreen view of
what<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:39.420> working<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.310> basically<00:01:41.310> how

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
what I'm working on and basically how

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.179 
what I'm working on and basically how
you<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.140> put<00:01:43.409> your<00:01:43.920> cursor

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you do this is you put your cursor

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.770 
you do this is you put your cursor
somewhere<00:01:44.640> around<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.149> center<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.659> your

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
somewhere around the center of your

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.960 
somewhere around the center of your
object<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.799> hold<00:01:47.579> down<00:01:47.670> your<00:01:47.790> left

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
object like this hold down your left

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.840 
object like this hold down your left
mouse<00:01:48.180> button<00:01:48.470> drag<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.680> out<00:01:49.860> until<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
mouse button drag it out until it's the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.170 
mouse button drag it out until it's the
approximate<00:01:51.630> size<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.229> your<00:01:52.380> fuselage<00:01:53.180> now

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
approximate size of your fuselage now

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.359 
approximate size of your fuselage now
the<00:01:55.079> cylinder<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.890> course<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the cylinder of course is a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.010 
the cylinder of course is a
three-dimensional<00:01:57.090> object<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.750> only<00:01:57.930> see

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
three-dimensional object and we only see

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.920 
three-dimensional object and we only see
two<00:01:58.380> dimensions<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.030> we're<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
two dimensions here so we're going to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
two dimensions here so we're going to
change<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.439> two<00:02:01.560> dimensions<00:02:01.710> let<00:02:02.430> go<00:02:02.610> of

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
change it in two dimensions let go of

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.520 
change it in two dimensions let go of
the<00:02:02.820> button<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.299> then<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.930> move<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.320> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the button and then just move it up and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.859 
the button and then just move it up and
down<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.710> bit<00:02:05.009> or<00:02:05.189> up

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
down a bit or up

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.350 
down a bit or up
so<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:07.070> changes<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.789> length<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.239> it

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
so that it changes the length of it

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.089 
so that it changes the length of it
which<00:02:08.539> you<00:02:08.660> don't<00:02:08.869> actually<00:02:09.140> see<00:02:09.440> in<00:02:09.979> this

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
which you don't actually see in this

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.339 
which you don't actually see in this
view<00:02:10.399> in<00:02:10.759> order<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.480> do<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.170> would<00:02:12.290> have

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
view in order to do that you would have

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.860 
view in order to do that you would have
to<00:02:12.650> select<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.160> top<00:02:13.400> view<00:02:13.760> which<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.629> T

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
to select the top view which is the T

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.350 
to select the top view which is the T
key<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.379> now<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:15.980> can<00:02:16.340> see<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:17.120> it's<00:02:17.300> a

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
key and now you can see that it's a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.479 
key and now you can see that it's a
certain<00:02:17.720> length<00:02:17.930> now<00:02:18.709> as<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.099> can<00:02:19.220> tell<00:02:19.459> from

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
certain length now as you can tell from

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.509 
certain length now as you can tell from
this<00:02:19.910> drawing<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:20.599> is<00:02:20.810> not<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.860> proper<00:02:22.160> length

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
this drawing it is not the proper length

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.759 
this drawing it is not the proper length
to<00:02:23.000> eat<00:02:23.180> there's<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.569> easy<00:02:23.959> way<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.440> do<00:02:24.739> this

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
to eat there's a easy way to do this

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.930 
to eat there's a easy way to do this
actually<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.819> is<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.810> go<00:02:26.930> up<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.349> your

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
actually and that is to go up to your

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.600 
actually and that is to go up to your
modify<00:02:28.940> tab<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:30.160> select<00:02:31.160> where<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.400> says

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
modify tab and select where it says

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.990 
modify tab and select where it says
height<00:02:31.910> we<00:02:32.660> know<00:02:33.220> what<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.340> fuselage<00:02:34.760> is

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
height we know what the fuselage is

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.319 
height we know what the fuselage is
actually<00:02:35.360> 32<00:02:35.690> feet<00:02:36.019> long<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.940> we<00:02:38.060> change

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
actually 32 feet long and so we change

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.020 
actually 32 feet long and so we change
it<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.599> 32<00:02:39.079> feet<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:40.220> we<00:02:40.340> do<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.700> line

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
it to 32 feet and we do in the line

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.490 
it to 32 feet and we do in the line
again<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:43.040> top<00:02:43.220> view<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.920> we<00:02:45.920> would<00:02:46.190> go

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
again on the top view and we would go

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.869 
again on the top view and we would go
minimum<00:02:48.500> minimum<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.599> Y<00:02:51.470> position

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
minimum minimum in the Y position

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.220 
minimum minimum in the Y position
takeoff<00:02:52.879> the<00:02:53.090> X<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.420> course<00:02:53.599> to<00:02:53.810> move<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.049> back

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
takeoff the X of course to move it back

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.759 
takeoff the X of course to move it back
and<00:02:54.680> click<00:02:55.519> OK<00:02:55.910> now<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:56.780> perfectly<00:02:57.230> lined<00:02:57.560> up

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
and click OK now it's perfectly lined up

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.990 
and click OK now it's perfectly lined up
lengthwise<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.470> it's<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.650> right<00:03:00.799> length<00:03:01.000> so

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
lengthwise and it's the right length so

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.559 
lengthwise and it's the right length so
now<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.209> go<00:03:02.390> back<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.599> our<00:03:02.750> front<00:03:03.110> view<00:03:03.170> again

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
now we go back to our front view again

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.369 
now we go back to our front view again
now<00:03:05.569> as<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.140> can<00:03:06.290> see<00:03:06.349> from<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.519> front<00:03:07.760> view

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
now as you can see from the front view

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.780 
now as you can see from the front view
the<00:03:09.379> cylinder<00:03:09.920> is<00:03:10.069> obviously<00:03:10.459> number<00:03:10.670> one

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
the cylinder is obviously number one

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.120 
the cylinder is obviously number one
it's<00:03:11.090> not<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.269> right<00:03:11.600> shape<00:03:12.230> perfectly<00:03:12.950> in

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
it's not the right shape perfectly in

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.210 
it's not the right shape perfectly in
the<00:03:13.519> front<00:03:13.730> view<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:14.569> also<00:03:14.780> too<00:03:14.989> big<00:03:15.380> so

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
the front view and it's also too big so

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.620 
the front view and it's also too big so
what<00:03:16.370> we<00:03:16.489> would<00:03:16.579> do<00:03:16.730> in<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:16.940> case<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.600> we

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
what we would do in that case is we

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.819 
what we would do in that case is we
would<00:03:17.959> actually<00:03:18.139> select<00:03:19.540> our<00:03:20.540> modifier<00:03:21.290> scale

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
would actually select our modifier scale

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.699 
would actually select our modifier scale
which<00:03:22.430> would<00:03:22.609> be<00:03:22.760> up<00:03:22.970> here<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.510> we<00:03:24.109> do<00:03:24.260> not<00:03:24.440> we

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
which would be up here and we do not we

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.729 
which would be up here and we do not we
want<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:25.130> non-uniform<00:03:26.030> scale<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:27.560> difference

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
want a non-uniform scale the difference

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.270 
want a non-uniform scale the difference
between<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.549> three<00:03:28.880> is<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:29.480> uniform<00:03:30.139> scale<00:03:30.530> if

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
between the three is a uniform scale if

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.460 
between the three is a uniform scale if
you<00:03:31.340> move<00:03:31.849> it<00:03:32.030> in<00:03:32.209> any<00:03:32.480> direction<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.319> will

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
you move it in any direction it will

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.110 
you move it in any direction it will
change<00:03:33.769> in<00:03:33.980> all<00:03:34.099> three<00:03:34.459> directions

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
change in all three directions

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.640 
change in all three directions
a<00:03:36.609> non-uniform<00:03:37.609> scale<00:03:38.209> means<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.410> you

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
a non-uniform scale means that it you

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.530 
a non-uniform scale means that it you
can<00:03:39.859> change<00:03:40.099> it<00:03:40.280> in<00:03:40.370> one<00:03:40.519> direction<00:03:41.000> only<00:03:41.150> and

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
can change it in one direction only and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.599 
can change it in one direction only and
the<00:03:41.959> squash<00:03:42.290> it'll<00:03:42.980> change<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.370> in<00:03:43.459> two

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
the squash it'll change it in two

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.330 
the squash it'll change it in two
directions<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.840> we<00:03:44.870> want<00:03:45.230> non-uniform<00:03:45.980> scale

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
directions so we want non-uniform scale

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.530 
directions so we want non-uniform scale
we<00:03:47.150> will<00:03:47.299> select<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.959> this<00:03:48.709> axis<00:03:49.609> here<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.060> if

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
we will select the this axis here and if

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.240 
we will select the this axis here and if
you<00:03:50.660> move<00:03:50.810> it<00:03:50.930> left<00:03:51.109> and<00:03:51.349> right<00:03:51.410> you<00:03:51.769> can<00:03:51.950> see

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
you move it left and right you can see

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.330 
you move it left and right you can see
that<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.910> can<00:03:53.060> squash<00:03:53.389> it<00:03:53.440> so<00:03:54.440> what<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.859> do<00:03:55.069> is

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
that you can squash it so what you do is

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.830 
that you can squash it so what you do is
you<00:03:55.489> actually<00:03:55.639> move<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.180> out<00:03:56.299> till<00:03:56.510> it's<00:03:56.690> the

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
you actually move it out till it's the

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.670 
you actually move it out till it's the
right<00:03:57.019> width<00:03:57.410> of<00:03:57.709> your<00:03:58.669> fuselage<00:03:59.329> and<00:03:59.680> then

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
right width of your fuselage and then

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.510 
right width of your fuselage and then
you<00:04:00.829> go<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.459> other<00:04:01.669> axis<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.750> you

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
you go to the other axis and you

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.600 
you go to the other axis and you
shorten<00:04:04.330> it<00:04:04.650> until<00:04:05.650> it's<00:04:05.860> approximately<00:04:06.550> the

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
shorten it until it's approximately the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.250 
shorten it until it's approximately the
right<00:04:06.670> one<00:04:07.000> now<00:04:07.030> you'll<00:04:07.390> notice<00:04:07.630> that<00:04:07.930> this<00:04:08.080> is

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
right one now you'll notice that this is

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.350 
right one now you'll notice that this is
not<00:04:08.410> perfectly<00:04:08.860> centered<00:04:09.310> so<00:04:10.000> what<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.270> would

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
not perfectly centered so what you would

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.030 
not perfectly centered so what you would
do<00:04:10.510> in<00:04:10.630> that<00:04:10.810> case<00:04:11.050> is<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.710> put<00:04:11.950> it

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
do in that case is you put it

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.310 
do in that case is you put it
approximately<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.790> right<00:04:12.850> height<00:04:13.240> and<00:04:13.690> then

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
approximately the right height and then

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.560 
approximately the right height and then
you<00:04:14.440> would<00:04:14.590> go<00:04:14.740> up<00:04:14.770> to<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.160> move<00:04:15.520> select<00:04:16.300> and

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
you would go up to the move select and

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.050 
you would go up to the move select and
move<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.140> move<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.130> down<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.340> little<00:04:18.550> bit<00:04:18.760> and

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
move and move it down a little bit and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.780 
move and move it down a little bit and
now<00:04:19.840> as<00:04:20.050> you<00:04:20.170> can<00:04:20.320> see<00:04:20.380> it's<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.310> right<00:04:21.520> length

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
now as you can see it's the right length

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.300 
now as you can see it's the right length
and<00:04:22.000> it's<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.510> right<00:04:22.660> width<00:04:22.930> but<00:04:23.770> there<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.280> a

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
and it's the right width but there is a

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.220 
and it's the right width but there is a
problem<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:24.880> course<00:04:25.180> it's<00:04:25.420> not<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.780> exact

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
problem of course it's not the exact

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.110 
problem of course it's not the exact
same<00:04:26.440> shape<00:04:26.800> you'll<00:04:27.040> notice<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.970> the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
same shape you'll notice that the

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.300 
same shape you'll notice that the
fuchsia<00:04:28.360> law<00:04:28.570> sticks<00:04:28.900> out<00:04:29.080> here<00:04:29.320> here<00:04:29.680> here

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
fuchsia law sticks out here here here

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.200 
fuchsia law sticks out here here here
and<00:04:30.580> here<00:04:31.230> this<00:04:32.230> is<00:04:32.470> where<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:33.610> will<00:04:33.790> collapse

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
and here this is where you will collapse

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.710 
and here this is where you will collapse
the<00:04:34.630> cylinder<00:04:35.110> into<00:04:35.710> a<00:04:35.920> or<00:04:36.490> convert<00:04:37.480> the

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
the cylinder into a or convert the

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.300 
the cylinder into a or convert the
cylinder<00:04:38.170> into<00:04:38.440> an<00:04:38.950> editable<00:04:39.790> mesh<00:04:41.040> so<00:04:42.040> what

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
cylinder into an editable mesh so what

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.770 
cylinder into an editable mesh so what
you<00:04:42.430> would<00:04:42.520> do<00:04:42.670> in<00:04:42.790> that<00:04:42.820> case<00:04:43.000> is<00:04:43.480> you<00:04:43.600> would

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
you would do in that case is you would

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.080 
you would do in that case is you would
right<00:04:44.020> click<00:04:44.050> on<00:04:44.560> there<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.370> convert<00:04:45.850> to

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
right click on there and convert to

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.740 
right click on there and convert to
editable<00:04:46.300> mesh<00:04:47.850> now<00:04:48.850> what<00:04:49.060> we're<00:04:49.210> going<00:04:49.480> to<00:04:49.510> do

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
editable mesh now what we're going to do

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.450 
editable mesh now what we're going to do
is<00:04:49.900> we're<00:04:50.050> going<00:04:50.170> to<00:04:50.260> select<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.860> individual

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
is we're going to select the individual

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.720 
is we're going to select the individual
vertices<00:04:51.930> by<00:04:53.040> clicking<00:04:54.040> on<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.220> plus<00:04:54.460> sign

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
vertices by clicking on the plus sign

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.880 
vertices by clicking on the plus sign
selecting<00:04:55.510> vertices<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:56.200> as<00:04:56.290> you<00:04:56.470> can<00:04:56.650> see

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
selecting vertices and as you can see

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.420 
selecting vertices and as you can see
now<00:04:57.100> we<00:04:57.790> can<00:04:57.940> select<00:04:58.120> individual<00:04:58.690> vertices<00:04:59.430> so

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
now we can select individual vertices so

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.500 
now we can select individual vertices so
what<00:05:00.580> we're<00:05:00.700> going<00:05:00.850> to<00:05:00.880> do<00:05:01.030> is<00:05:01.180> we're<00:05:01.330> going<00:05:01.450> to

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.930 
what we're going to do is we're going to
actually
