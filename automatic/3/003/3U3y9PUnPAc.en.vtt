when<00:00:00.719> talking<00:00:00.989> about<00:00:01.170> German<00:00:01.740> clocks<00:00:02.010> we

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
when talking about German clocks we

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.800 
when talking about German clocks we
could<00:00:02.550> have<00:00:02.639> talked<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:03.149> anniversary

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
could have talked about anniversary

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.019 
could have talked about anniversary
clocks<00:00:04.110> or<00:00:04.319> 400<00:00:04.830> day<00:00:04.950> clocks<00:00:05.250> but<00:00:05.670> they<00:00:05.790> really

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
clocks or 400 day clocks but they really

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.970 
clocks or 400 day clocks but they really
deserve<00:00:06.330> their<00:00:06.629> own<00:00:06.810> section<00:00:07.680> here<00:00:07.859> to

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
deserve their own section here to

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.640 
deserve their own section here to
discuss<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.570> typical<00:00:10.050> style<00:00:10.290> with

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
discuss this is the typical style with

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.700 
discuss this is the typical style with
the<00:00:10.830> four<00:00:11.219> balls<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:12.120> rotates<00:00:13.080> slowly<00:00:13.500> back

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
the four balls that rotates slowly back

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.890 
the four balls that rotates slowly back
and<00:00:13.740> forth<00:00:14.030> millions<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.210> these<00:00:15.330> were<00:00:15.570> made<00:00:15.750> in

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
and forth millions of these were made in

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.710 
and forth millions of these were made in
Germany<00:00:16.350> millions<00:00:16.830> probably<00:00:17.460> came<00:00:17.820> back<00:00:18.180> as

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
Germany millions probably came back as

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.250 
Germany millions probably came back as
souvenirs<00:00:19.550> with<00:00:20.550> tourists<00:00:21.180> or<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.900> GIS

after World War Two but because there

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920 
after World War Two but because there
were<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:26.550> many<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.970> them<00:00:27.000> these<00:00:27.449> really<00:00:27.810> have

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
were so many of them these really have

no collector value they are fun to watch
I<00:00:30.119> occasionally<00:00:30.599> repair<00:00:31.529> them<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:31.890> people

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
I occasionally repair them for people

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.459 
I occasionally repair them for people
for<00:00:32.309> sentimental<00:00:32.880> reasons<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.899> they're<00:00:34.350> not

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
a clock that series clock collectors

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.020 
a clock that series clock collectors
would<00:00:36.930> collect<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:38.010> exception<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.670> are

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
would collect the exception to that are

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
would collect the exception to that are
the<00:00:39.149> very<00:00:39.360> earliest<00:00:39.930> ones<00:00:40.350> there's<00:00:40.920> an

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the very earliest ones there's an

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.819 
the very earliest ones there's an
example<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:41.910> which<00:00:42.840> instead<00:00:43.770> of

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
example of that here which instead of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.520 
example of that here which instead of
the<00:00:44.040> four<00:00:44.250> balls<00:00:44.579> has<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.120> disc<00:00:45.539> pendulum<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.379> we

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
the four balls has a disc pendulum so we

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.990 
the four balls has a disc pendulum so we
call<00:00:46.860> these<00:00:47.070> disc<00:00:47.460> pendulum<00:00:48.059> 400<00:00:48.960> day<00:00:49.079> clocks

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
call these disc pendulum 400 day clocks

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.910 
call these disc pendulum 400 day clocks
because<00:00:51.000> obviously<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> four<00:00:52.260> ball<00:00:52.500> method

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
because obviously the four ball method

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.189 
because obviously the four ball method
was<00:00:53.039> probably<00:00:53.340> more<00:00:53.550> attractive<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.570> early

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
was probably more attractive but early

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.290 
was probably more attractive but early
on<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.160> way<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.640> they<00:00:56.760> arranged

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
on this was the way that they arranged

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.860 
on this was the way that they arranged
the<00:00:57.690> pendulum<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:59.090> look<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> oscillate

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the pendulum to look and to oscillate

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
the pendulum to look and to oscillate
with<00:01:01.050> adjustments<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.039> slow<00:01:02.280> fast

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
with adjustments on it for slow fast

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.030 
with adjustments on it for slow fast
these<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.420> called<00:01:03.660> anniversary<00:01:04.379> or<00:01:04.470> 400<00:01:04.920> day

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
these are called anniversary or 400 day

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.370 
these are called anniversary or 400 day
clocks<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:05.700> at<00:01:05.850> least<00:01:05.970> theoretically

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
clocks because at least theoretically

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.410 
clocks because at least theoretically
they<00:01:07.380> only<00:01:07.590> need<00:01:07.920> winding<00:01:08.220> once<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.820> year<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
they only need winding once a year and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.929 
they only need winding once a year and
they<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.470> by<00:01:10.710> metering<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.700> power

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
they do this by metering out that power

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090 
they do this by metering out that power
very<00:01:12.330> slowly<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> think<00:01:13.350> about<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.619> regular

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
very slowly if you think about a regular

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you can slow down the pendulum

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.609 
you can slow down the pendulum
oscillation<00:01:24.360> somehow<00:01:24.780> you're<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.470> to

wire and this pendulum disk only goes
back<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.369> forth<00:01:38.430> about<00:01:38.790> eight<00:01:39.090> times<00:01:39.390> a

in most pendulum clocks

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.190

so<00:01:44.130> we're<00:01:44.700> metering<00:01:45.180> out<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.509> power<00:01:45.780> very

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
so we're metering out that power very

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.530 
so we're metering out that power very
slowly<00:01:46.560> enabling<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.880> run<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.329> months

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
slowly enabling this to run for months

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.170 
slowly enabling this to run for months
or<00:01:48.750> perhaps<00:01:48.930> even<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.860> year<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> single
