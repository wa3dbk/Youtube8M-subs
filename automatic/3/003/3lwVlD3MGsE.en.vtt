00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
little bit more over here I'll just

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.240 
little bit more over here I'll just
continue<00:02:41.630> it's<00:02:42.630> really<00:02:42.960> not<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.170> hard<00:02:43.500> it's

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
continue it's really not that hard it's

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.310 
continue it's really not that hard it's
just<00:02:46.400> very<00:02:47.400> very<00:02:47.550> time-consuming<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.989> guess

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
just very very time-consuming I guess

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.820 
just very very time-consuming I guess
you<00:02:49.560> could<00:02:49.739> say<00:02:51.290> yeah<00:02:52.290> it's<00:02:52.620> more

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
you could say yeah it's more

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.150 
you could say yeah it's more
time-consuming<00:02:53.130> than<00:02:53.580> anything<00:02:55.010> not<00:02:56.010> that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
time-consuming than anything not that

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.070 
time-consuming than anything not that
it's<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.400> bad<00:02:56.430> thing<00:02:56.880> because<00:02:57.120> you'll<00:02:57.900> have<00:02:58.020> a

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
it's a bad thing because you'll have a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.449 
it's a bad thing because you'll have a
really<00:02:58.350> pretty<00:02:58.620> brush<00:02:58.950> when<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.310> get

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
really pretty brush when you get

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.729 
really pretty brush when you get
finished<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:01.050> did<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.709> know

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
finished and and you did it you know

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.850 
finished and and you did it you know
it'd<00:03:02.190> be<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.970> your<00:03:03.390> creation<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:06.590> I'm<00:03:07.590> just

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
it'd be it's your creation so I'm just

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.490 
it'd be it's your creation so I'm just
picking<00:03:08.400> up<00:03:08.760> stones<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.660> putting<00:03:10.110> them<00:03:10.290> in

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
picking up stones and putting them in

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.070 
picking up stones and putting them in
between<00:03:11.450> where<00:03:12.450> there<00:03:12.630> are<00:03:12.810> spaces<00:03:13.200> okay<00:03:13.890> and

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
between where there are spaces okay and

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.960 
between where there are spaces okay and
now<00:03:16.080> I<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.440> drop<00:03:16.709> this<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.310> pick<00:03:17.610> up<00:03:17.760> some

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
really not easy to do it doing a

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.000 
really not easy to do it doing a
tutorial<00:04:40.450> because<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.290> have<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.560> look<00:04:41.710> really

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
tutorial because you have to look really

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.210 
tutorial because you have to look really

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
closer you have to look really close to

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.879 
closer you have to look really close to
make<00:04:45.370> sure<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:45.729> don't<00:04:45.910> have<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.150> space<00:04:46.889> between

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.380 
but I mean you still have a little bit
of<00:06:18.620> working<00:06:18.770> time<00:06:19.160> with<00:06:19.460> it<00:06:19.610> while<00:06:20.240> you're

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
of working time with it while you're

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:26.560 
of working time with it while you're
doing<00:06:20.660> this<00:06:21.670> okay<00:06:24.880> so<00:06:25.880> it's<00:06:26.060> not<00:06:26.210> like<00:06:26.390> it's

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
doing this okay so it's not like it's

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.620 
doing this okay so it's not like it's
gonna<00:06:26.630> instantly<00:06:27.080> dry<00:06:27.500> and<00:06:28.010> that's<00:06:28.940> it<00:06:29.240> I<00:06:29.270> mean

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630
