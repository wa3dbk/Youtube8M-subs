00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.910 
warcraft speculation video this time
it's<00:00:03.419> gonna<00:00:03.570> be<00:00:03.659> out<00:00:03.750> Naga<00:00:04.049> as<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.440> playable

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
it's gonna be out Naga as a playable

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.309 
it's gonna be out Naga as a playable
race<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.970> really<00:00:06.299> takes<00:00:06.569> us<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.990> at

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
race and this really takes us to at

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.049 
race and this really takes us to at
least<00:00:07.379> towards<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.980> end<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.250> our<00:00:08.370> speculation

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
least towards the end of our speculation

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.570 
least towards the end of our speculation
sort<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.599> season<00:00:10.290> it's<00:00:10.679> 2<00:00:10.889> a.m.<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.340> morning

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
sort of season it's 2 a.m. the morning

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.700 
sort of season it's 2 a.m. the morning
before<00:00:11.940> bliss<00:00:12.420> calms<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.080> we're<00:00:13.380> here<00:00:13.590> I'm

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
before bliss calms so we're here I'm

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.990 
before bliss calms so we're here I'm
definitely<00:00:13.860> running<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.280> little<00:00:14.429> bit<00:00:14.639> close<00:00:14.849> in

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
definitely running a little bit close in

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.550 
definitely running a little bit close in
this<00:00:15.120> one<00:00:15.330> now<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.020> video<00:00:16.170> I'm<00:00:16.320> gonna

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
this one now in this video I'm gonna

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.170 
this one now in this video I'm gonna
cover<00:00:16.680> what<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.949> think<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.609> what<00:00:17.910> they're<00:00:18.029> like

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
cover what I think and what they're like

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.300 
cover what I think and what they're like
in<00:00:18.390> game<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.840> then<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.109> lore<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.320> their<00:00:19.830> race

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
in game and then the lore of their race

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.010 
in game and then the lore of their race
so<00:00:20.760> as<00:00:20.910> Rahl<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> think<00:00:21.449> honestly<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> don't

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
so as Rahl I think honestly I don't

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.450 
so as Rahl I think honestly I don't
think<00:00:22.320> they're<00:00:22.439> not<00:00:22.590> likely<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:23.010> this

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
think they're not likely for this

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.390 
think they're not likely for this
expansion<00:00:23.910> now<00:00:24.689> I'd<00:00:24.990> say<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.949> South<00:00:26.160> Seas

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
expansion now I'd say in the South Seas

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.490 
expansion now I'd say in the South Seas
expansion<00:00:26.910> set<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.300> will<00:00:27.420> probably<00:00:27.750> get<00:00:28.109> Nagas

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
expansion set we will probably get Nagas

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.839 
expansion set we will probably get Nagas
but<00:00:28.680> right<00:00:28.859> now<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.310> don't<00:00:29.609> think<00:00:29.789> they

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
but right now I just don't think they

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.339 
but right now I just don't think they
make<00:00:30.000> sense<00:00:30.330> well<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> Nagas<00:00:30.900> did<00:00:31.170> leave

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
make sense well the Nagas did leave

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.200 
make sense well the Nagas did leave
Azeroth<00:00:31.830> with<00:00:32.040> Illidan<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.880> largely

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
Azeroth with Illidan they have largely

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.180 
Azeroth with Illidan they have largely
been<00:00:33.390> dealt<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.200> killed<00:00:34.500> lady<00:00:34.710> Vash<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
been dealt with we killed lady Vash and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.180 
been dealt with we killed lady Vash and
her<00:00:35.280> followers<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:35.940> really<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:38.040> just

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
her followers so really if it was I just

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.130 
her followers so really if it was I just
I<00:00:38.520> don't<00:00:38.579> really<00:00:38.969> see<00:00:39.420> how<00:00:39.600> they<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:39.989> be

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
I don't really see how they would be

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.930 
I don't really see how they would be
there<00:00:40.350> anyway<00:00:40.829> let's<00:00:41.340> talk<00:00:41.460> about<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> Naga

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
there anyway let's talk about the Naga

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.299 
there anyway let's talk about the Naga
in-game<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.260> far<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:43.500> classes<00:00:43.920> cope<00:00:44.100> they

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
in-game so as far as classes cope they

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.520 
in-game so as far as classes cope they
fit<00:00:44.579> warriors<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.239> well<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:46.110> paladins

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
fit warriors really well as for paladins

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.170 
fit warriors really well as for paladins
I<00:00:46.770> don't<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.579> fit<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.879> my<00:00:47.969> head

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
I don't think they really fit in my head

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.490 
I don't think they really fit in my head
though<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> could<00:00:48.660> see<00:00:48.809> Blizzard<00:00:49.140> finding<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
though I could see Blizzard finding a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.139 
though I could see Blizzard finding a
way<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.649> sneaking<00:00:49.950> them<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.969> same

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
way of sneaking them in and the same

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.060 
way of sneaking them in and the same
goes<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.360> death<00:00:51.870> Knights<00:00:52.140> often<00:00:52.710> if<00:00:52.860> there's

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
goes for death Knights often if there's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.650 
goes for death Knights often if there's
a<00:00:53.129> race<00:00:53.280> which<00:00:53.550> chronologically<00:00:54.270> doesn't<00:00:54.510> fit

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
a race which chronologically doesn't fit

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.060 
a race which chronologically doesn't fit
death<00:00:54.840> Knights<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:55.260> put<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.559> anyway<00:00:55.860> for

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
death Knights they put in anyway for

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.860 
death Knights they put in anyway for
gameplay<00:00:56.219> reasons<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.300> Congress<00:00:57.719> could

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
gameplay reasons I think Congress could

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.450 
gameplay reasons I think Congress could
probably<00:00:58.109> work<00:00:58.500> although<00:00:58.739> pets<00:00:59.070> might<00:00:59.309> be

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
probably work although pets might be

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.369 
probably work although pets might be
inherently<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.879> bit<00:01:00.059> distrustful<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.870> Naga<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
inherently a bit distrustful of Naga and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.310 
inherently a bit distrustful of Naga and
shamans<00:01:02.250> may<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.640> able<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.030> work<00:01:03.329> fire<00:01:03.840> once

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
shamans may be able to work fire once

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.410 
shamans may be able to work fire once
again<00:01:04.850> Blizzard<00:01:05.850> sort<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.180> lore

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
again Blizzard sort of lore

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.719 
again Blizzard sort of lore
jiggery-pokery<00:01:06.990> kind<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.010> stuff<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.460> think

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
jiggery-pokery kind of stuff I think

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.310 
jiggery-pokery kind of stuff I think
rogues<00:01:08.970> would<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.240> really<00:01:09.540> cool<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.960> monks

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
rogues would be really cool and monks

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.710 
rogues would be really cool and monks
and<00:01:10.409> roads<00:01:10.710> could<00:01:10.890> work<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.460> could<00:01:11.909> there's<00:01:12.600> no

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and roads could work I could there's no

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.000 
and roads could work I could there's no
particular<00:01:12.900> reason<00:01:13.170> why<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:13.590> fit<00:01:13.830> but

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
particular reason why they fit but

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.260 
particular reason why they fit but
there's<00:01:14.220> no<00:01:14.310> particular<00:01:14.760> reason<00:01:14.880> why<00:01:15.060> they

there's no particular reason why they

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.880 
there's no particular reason why they

don't fit and that's usually enough for

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.950 
don't fit and that's usually enough for
Blizzard<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.549> give<00:01:17.700> them<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> class<00:01:18.180> now

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
Blizzard to give them the class now

Blizzard to give them the class now
priests<00:01:19.560> could<00:01:19.799> work<00:01:20.070> via<00:01:20.400> some<00:01:20.640> lore

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
priests could work via some lore

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.700 
priests could work via some lore
skullduggery<00:01:21.479> with<00:01:21.720> maybe<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.200> faction<00:01:22.650> of

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
skullduggery with maybe a faction of

skullduggery with maybe a faction of
them<00:01:22.830> turning<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> light<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> mages<00:01:24.570> are

them turning to the light and mages are

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.570 
them turning to the light and mages are

obviously a perfect fit and warlocks
could<00:01:26.820> work<00:01:26.939> quite<00:01:27.270> well<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.600> well<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.080> my

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
could work quite well as well in my

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.100 
could work quite well as well in my
opinion<00:01:28.729> now<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.570> introducing<00:01:30.840> them

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
opinion now and as for introducing them

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.630 
opinion now and as for introducing them
into<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> game<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.799> don't<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.490> going

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
into the game I don't think it's going

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.249 
into the game I don't think it's going
to<00:01:32.700> happen<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.970> Ward's<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.360> Draenor<00:01:33.720> there

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
to happen a Ward's of Draenor there

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.440 
to happen a Ward's of Draenor there
isn't<00:01:34.740> much<00:01:34.860> sense<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.729> do<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.270> back

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
isn't much sense to do it if we go back

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.719 
isn't much sense to do it if we go back
in<00:01:36.630> time<00:01:36.659> then<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.829> will<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.040> before<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.490> Nagas

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
in time then it will be before the Nagas

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.460 
in time then it will be before the Nagas
even<00:01:39.240> came<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.479> Draenor<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.140> go<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
even came to Draenor and if we go to the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.840 
even came to Draenor and if we go to the
present-day<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.979> won't<00:01:41.130> matter<00:01:41.340> because<00:01:41.729> then

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
present-day it won't matter because then

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.399 
present-day it won't matter because then
I<00:01:41.939> go<00:01:42.090> will<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.360> been<00:01:42.509> killed<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.320> go

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
I go will have been killed and if we go

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
I go will have been killed and if we go
to<00:01:43.439> Argus<00:01:43.890> there<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.220> no<00:01:44.399> damn<00:01:44.610> Nagas

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
to Argus there will be no damn Nagas

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
to Argus there will be no damn Nagas
because<00:01:45.329> they're<00:01:45.509> not<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.020> planet<00:01:46.380> they

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
because they're not on that planet they

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.530 
because they're not on that planet they
could<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.460> introduced<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> South<00:01:48.299> Seas

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
could be introduced in the South Seas

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.270 
could be introduced in the South Seas
expansion<00:01:49.049> though<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.439> Matson<00:01:49.770> did<00:01:49.920> say<00:01:50.130> that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
expansion though and Matson did say that

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.950 
expansion though and Matson did say that
he<00:01:50.369> wanted<00:01:50.640> nagisa<00:01:51.090> noggers<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> eventually

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
he wanted nagisa noggers to eventually

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.870 
he wanted nagisa noggers to eventually
be<00:01:52.079> playable<00:01:52.409> however<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.430> some<00:01:53.670> time

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
be playable however this was some time

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.819 
be playable however this was some time
ago<00:01:53.909> I'd<00:01:54.390> speculate<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.140> perhaps<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.710> could

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
ago I'd speculate that perhaps we could

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.069 
ago I'd speculate that perhaps we could
get<00:01:55.979> augurs<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.579> expansion<00:01:56.969> maybe<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
get augurs in this expansion maybe and

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.920 
get augurs in this expansion maybe and
then<00:01:58.530> naka<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.490> next<00:01:59.880> expansion<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
then naka in the next expansion in the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.319 
then naka in the next expansion in the
the<00:02:01.259> South<00:02:01.469> Seas<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:01.950> anyway<00:02:02.759> let's<00:02:03.119> talk

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
the South Seas one anyway let's talk

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.270 
the South Seas one anyway let's talk
about<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.659> lore<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.140> race<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.130> go

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
about the lore of this race so that I go

about the lore of this race so that I go

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
pre shattering times and they used a lot

pre shattering times and they used a lot
of<00:02:09.209> magic

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the elves and that used so much magic

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.670 
what they done but they have done so
they<00:04:27.480> maybe<00:04:27.630> turned<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.200> light<00:04:28.350> thus

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
they maybe turned to the light thus

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.380 
they maybe turned to the light thus
allowing<00:04:28.980> us<00:04:29.160> tough<00:04:29.340> paladins<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.000> priests

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
allowing us tough paladins and priests

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.120 
allowing us tough paladins and priests
and<00:04:30.420> that<00:04:30.600> sort<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:30.900> thing<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:31.350> then<00:04:32.010> they'd

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
and that sort of thing and then they'd

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.830 
and that sort of thing and then they'd
be<00:04:32.190> able<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.550> be<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.670> playable<00:04:33.030> race<00:04:33.270> I'm<00:04:33.720> not

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
be able to be a playable race I'm not

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.570 
be able to be a playable race I'm not
too<00:04:33.960> sure<00:04:34.140> if<00:04:34.260> that<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.470> suppose<00:04:34.980> yeah<00:04:35.340> there's

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
too sure if that I suppose yeah there's

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.860 
too sure if that I suppose yeah there's
no<00:04:35.670> reason<00:04:35.700> why<00:04:36.030> they<00:04:36.180> couldn't<00:04:36.390> go<00:04:36.540> Alliance

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
no reason why they couldn't go Alliance

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.110 
no reason why they couldn't go Alliance
and<00:04:36.990> horde<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.380> though<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.490> Alliance<00:04:38.880> may<00:04:39.060> be

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
and horde and though the Alliance may be

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.760 
and horde and though the Alliance may be
initially<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.630> little<00:04:39.780> bit<00:04:40.050> distrusting

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
initially a little bit distrusting

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.160 
initially a little bit distrusting
however<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.760> could<00:04:42.150> imagine<00:04:42.360> say<00:04:42.900> if<00:04:42.990> they<00:04:43.140> were

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
however I could imagine say if they were

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.470 
however I could imagine say if they were
strong<00:04:43.890> in<00:04:44.040> their<00:04:44.130> faith<00:04:44.340> of<00:04:44.550> light<00:04:44.790> then<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
strong in their faith of light then the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.450 
strong in their faith of light then the
prophet<00:04:45.810> velen<00:04:46.140> might<00:04:46.710> find<00:04:47.070> a<00:04:47.130> way<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.310> sneak

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
prophet velen might find a way to sneak

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.220 
prophet velen might find a way to sneak
them<00:04:47.730> into<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.030> Alliance<00:04:48.360> at<00:04:48.780> any<00:04:48.990> rate

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
them into the Alliance at any rate

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.450 
them into the Alliance at any rate
