00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
ball the fact that you have two wingers

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
ball the fact that you have two wingers
a<00:01:43.619> central<00:01:44.100> striker<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.030> central

a central striker and a central
attacking<00:01:45.570> midfielder<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:46.229> very<00:01:46.500> very

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
attacking midfielder is very very

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.560 
attacking midfielder is very very
important<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:48.030> central<00:01:48.360> attacking

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
important because your central attacking

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.840 
important because your central attacking
midfielder<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:49.259> spread<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.860> ball<00:01:50.040> wide<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
winger can take a fall back on and then

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.109 
winger can take a fall back on and then
the<00:01:52.799> striker<00:01:53.159> gets<00:01:53.430> into<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> box

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the striker gets into the box

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.929 
the striker gets into the box
normally<00:01:54.869> Abele<00:01:55.380> supported<00:01:55.890> by<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.340> least<00:01:56.670> one

winger heading in from the other side of
the<00:02:00.479> pitch<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.590> well-rounded<00:02:02.189> attack

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the pitch so this well-rounded attack

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.880

four<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.519> very<00:02:32.819> very<00:02:33.030> important<00:02:33.540> as<00:02:33.659> well

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
four is very very important as well

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.720

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
be very very solid and then like I

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.110 
be very very solid and then like I
mentioned<00:02:40.769> earlier<00:02:41.190> because<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.790> those

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
mentioned earlier because of those

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.119 
mentioned earlier because of those
attacking<00:02:42.510> players<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.109> can<00:02:43.230> launch<00:02:43.560> out<00:02:43.890> and

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
attacking players you can launch out and

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.580 
attacking players you can launch out and
provide<00:02:44.790> very<00:02:45.209> very<00:02:45.540> devastating<00:02:45.750> counter

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
provide very very devastating counter

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.710 
provide very very devastating counter
attacks<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.790> abundance<00:02:48.359> of<00:02:48.540> midfield

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
attacks this abundance of midfield

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.839 
attacks this abundance of midfield
players<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.470> also<00:02:49.829> very<00:02:50.159> important<00:02:50.730> in

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
players is also very important in

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.789 
players is also very important in
defending<00:02:51.269> against<00:02:51.750> enemy<00:02:52.139> counter-attacks

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
defending against enemy counter-attacks

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.979 
defending against enemy counter-attacks
because<00:02:53.250> whilst<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.180> formation<00:02:54.690> gives<00:02:54.870> you

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
because whilst the formation gives you

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.899 
because whilst the formation gives you
plenty<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.470> options<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.980> attack<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.489> isn't

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
plenty of options in attack it isn't

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.250

attacking midfielder is equally vital

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.749
