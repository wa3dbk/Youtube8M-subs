00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:15.009
 In the midst of the forest, this guy named Mr. Pooh was hanging. 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.079
 Mr. Mitsubachi comes to a place where there is delicious honey. 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:28.589
 Mr. Mitsubachi, you have a hungry stomach. I want to eat delicious honey, and eat a lot of it. 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.410
 Well then, Pooh. Let's go out whenever delicious honey is eaten. 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.900
 Mitsubachi-san and Pooh-san, who are full of good morning snacks, decided to go there. 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.930
 ♪ Uta-o for the bear ♪ Uta-o Let's take a break 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.630
 ♪ Uta-o for the bear ♪ Uta-o Let's take a break 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:04.190
 The place I used to eat is Ichigo Bake. There I met a rabbit, Nakayoshi Rabbit. 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.060
 There are a lot of snacks, so I'm happy. 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.620
 Usagi-san could see Mushi-san, who is at the mercy of Pooh. But Pooh is ... 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:22.000
 I am already hungry. How much it is just eating. 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.930
 Good morning Robin came over there. 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.100
 Pooh. I made honey. Let's eat together. 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.900
 Robin was good. 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.450
 looks delicious! 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.700
 Pooh was happy and put a lot of honey on the strawberry and ate a lot. 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.770
 I have not eaten yet 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.999
 That's what Pooh said, and now Mitsubachi will come along with Mint's chopsticks. 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.310
 When I got to mint, I had a good piglet. 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.260
 Piglet! You have delicious, mint honey! 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.980
 Pooh said, they decided to eat together. 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.819
 The mint honey is so hungry. Piglet was good. 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:17.509
 When the two were doing well, Tigger, who is the best in the woods, came. 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.939
 There is honey, it looks like it's delicious! 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:26.199
 As Tyger said, Pooh, who still wanted to eat, kept up with the rest. 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:32.539
 The place where Tiger came was the best hornet in the world. 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:45.349
 Tigger. It won't hurt, so it's not good if you hit it off. Pooh says, Tigger doesn't care. 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.599
 Then the hornets started to rise. I'm scared! Thank you! 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.139
 Tigger, who should be the best at Mori, will continue to rip it away. 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.039
 Tigger, that's terrible! 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:58.209
 Pooh, as well as Tigger, takes care of himself. 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.209
 As for the two people, we will follow you to the meeting where Mitsubachi-san lives. 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:12.949
 Mr. Mitsubachi, who is called Chamomile, went to the place where the hornets can not come. 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.139
 If you think that it has finally come. 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.659
 When I was able to wait, I was hungry again. 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.019
 Pooh is still eating. 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.999
 It's delicious, chamomile honey. 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:29.449
 Piglet brought me honey. 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.759
 Pooh was happy and had a honey meal. 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:39.759
 Then some kind of belly is ticking. 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.399
 I want to be hungry! ! 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:45.699
 Pooh was so hungry that he was hungry. 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:49.549
 Let's go to a nice place where the stomach will improve. 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:56.269
 That's why Mr. Mitsubachi decided to take everyone to the open space. 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.299
 Everybody is going to sing while she sings Pooh. 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:10.809

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:13.939

 The place I visited was Hirohiro Hara. 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.569
 Pooh. I hope the stomach feels better. 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.479
 Robin said so, he managed to play Pooh. 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.580
 Somehow, my stomach was scratching. 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.439
 Pooh is guilty of being robbed by Robin. 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:09.050
 Also, honey is going to be eaten. What are you saying? 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:16.370
 Pooh, who is getting nervous. I met Kangaroo's mother, Kanga and her children's roux. 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.400
 The most delicious thing is that of lavender, which is honeymoon. 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.129
 I was happy. 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.419
 I would like to eat honey of lavender. 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.460
 Pooh seems to have forgotten the feeling of his stomach. 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.699
 And we decided to go for a search for Lavender. 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:41.360
 As I went there, I met the Pooh of the Bear, who lives in the forest. 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.830
 Are you going to take me to lavender? 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.569
 My pooh was happy. 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.069
 I want to go there. It's a place where you can eat delicious honey. 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.550
 This guy, Pooh, wanted to eat honey very fast. 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.559
 This Pooh and the Pooh are the same. 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:11.059
 ♪ For the song- ♪ Let's have a song. 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:18.439
 ♪ For the song- ♪ Let's have a song. 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:24.330
 This pooh, who is a boy, came to a place of lavender. 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.439
 A delicious lavender honey is eaten. 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.479
 My pooh was happy. 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.060
 Stomach full, is it good to eat? 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.059
 This girl, Pooh, got hungry. 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:41.169
 The two of them ate a lot of delicious lavender honey.
