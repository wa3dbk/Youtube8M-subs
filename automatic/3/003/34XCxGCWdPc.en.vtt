00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
will press V as you can see now I press

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.690 
will press V as you can see now I press
and<00:00:27.840> keep<00:00:28.050> pressing<00:00:28.560> 10<00:00:29.420> it<00:00:30.420> didn't<00:00:30.660> explode

now<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.059> control<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> plane<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.800> control<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
now to control the plane to control the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.590 
now to control the plane to control the
plane<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:36.450> need<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.719> press<00:00:37.640> V<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.360> see

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
plane we need to press V as you can see

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.549 
plane we need to press V as you can see
it<00:00:40.170> goes<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.730> press<00:00:42.059> Q<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.640> a<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:45.570> we

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
and up with this by pressing air and f

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.800 
and up with this by pressing air and f
the<00:01:23.009> controls<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.700> bit<00:01:24.229> complicated

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
the controls are a bit complicated

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.289 
the controls are a bit complicated
meaning<00:01:27.979> they're<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.460> well<00:01:29.670> placed<00:01:29.970> on

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
meaning they're not so well placed on

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.700 
meaning they're not so well placed on
the<00:01:30.890> keyboard<00:01:31.890> by<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.909> invention<00:01:33.360> string<00:01:33.900> now

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the keyboard by the invention string now

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
the keyboard by the invention string now
let's<00:01:35.579> use<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.820> missile<00:01:36.540> over<00:01:36.810> there

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
let's use that missile over there

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.640 
let's use that missile over there

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.270 

the<00:01:55.659> plane<00:01:55.929> looks<00:01:56.200> pretty<00:01:56.469> amazing<00:01:57.070> and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
the plane looks pretty amazing and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.510 
the plane looks pretty amazing and
pretty<00:01:57.490> maneuverable<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.640> pretty<00:02:01.090> resistant

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:17.100

you what I did previously basically I I
dropped<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.530> pole<00:02:38.130> now<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.519> thing<00:02:39.730> with<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
dropped a pole now the thing with the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.110 
dropped a pole now the thing with the
bomb<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:40.780> has<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:41.819> thing<00:02:42.819> is<00:02:42.970> over

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
bomb is that it has this thing is over

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.949 
bomb is that it has this thing is over
here<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.510> helps<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:44.049> fly<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.440> lot<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:46.540> not<00:02:46.660> so

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
here and helps it fly a lot it's not so

00:02:46.959 --> 00:03:06.680 
here and helps it fly a lot it's not so
good<00:02:59.579> so<00:03:00.579> nice<00:03:00.790> Oh

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.140 

the<00:03:07.690> bond<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.170> not<00:03:08.380> always<00:03:08.590> explode<00:03:12.000> which<00:03:13.000> is

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
the bond is not always explode which is

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.910 
the bond is not always explode which is
really<00:03:13.450> weird<00:03:14.760> but<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.970> does<00:03:16.210> explode<00:03:16.920> and

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
really weird but it does explode and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.310 
really weird but it does explode and
let's<00:03:18.220> say<00:03:18.400> ninety<00:03:18.850> percent<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.570> cases<00:03:19.780> it

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
let's say ninety percent of the cases it

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:28.530 
let's say ninety percent of the cases it
depends<00:03:21.010> how<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.430> hits<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:23.490> 000<00:03:24.490> guys<00:03:25.120> guys<00:03:27.540> if

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
depends how it hits the 000 guys guys if

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.290 
depends how it hits the 000 guys guys if
you<00:03:28.870> check<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.260> key<00:03:29.650> here<00:03:30.070> if<00:03:30.490> you<00:03:30.670> press<00:03:31.030> to

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
you check the key here if you press to

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.540 
you check the key here if you press to
you<00:03:31.510> actually<00:03:31.900> release<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.410> bomb<00:03:32.650> okay<00:03:33.490> so

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
you actually release the bomb okay so

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.520 
you actually release the bomb okay so
there's<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.210> more<00:03:35.040> complex<00:03:36.040> concept<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.880> it

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
there's a more complex concept of it

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.980 
there's a more complex concept of it
yeah<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:38.800> I<00:03:38.830> suppose<00:03:39.370> it's<00:03:39.670> not<00:03:39.790> meant<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.390> to

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
yeah so I suppose it's not meant to to

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.290 
yeah so I suppose it's not meant to to
use<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.440> bomb<00:03:42.810> directly<00:03:43.810> with<00:03:45.090> with<00:03:46.090> the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
use this bomb directly with with the

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.360 
use this bomb directly with with the
