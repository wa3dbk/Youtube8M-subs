00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
of clavicle now he knows clavicle is a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.020 
of clavicle now he knows clavicle is a
modified<00:00:06.750> long<00:00:06.960> bone<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.440> it<00:00:08.220> has<00:00:08.400> got<00:00:08.610> two

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
modified long bone and it has got two

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.980 
modified long bone and it has got two
whites<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.540> intervening<00:00:10.349> shaft<00:00:11.240> right<00:00:12.240> so

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
whites and intervening shaft right so

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.950 
whites and intervening shaft right so
here<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.620> case<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.790> clavicle<00:00:15.389> has<00:00:15.540> got<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
here in this case the clavicle has got a

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.109 
here in this case the clavicle has got a
media<00:00:16.440> line<00:00:16.640> which<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> broad<00:00:18.090> and

shaft<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.599> not<00:00:27.630> straight<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.680> concave<00:00:29.310> or

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
shaft is not straight it is concave or

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.790 
shaft is not straight it is concave or
convex<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:32.030> convex<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.390> media<00:00:34.380> 2/3

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
convex so it is convex in media 2/3

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.250 
convex so it is convex in media 2/3
right<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.290> concave<00:00:38.000> entirely<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.540> later<00:00:39.809> 1/3
