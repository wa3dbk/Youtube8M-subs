 realized how the lighting in your 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.270
 garden necessary tools we will have 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.220
 a spade with which we are going 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.110
 make the trenches to pass the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:32.020
 cable 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:34.660
 we need screwdriver key cable 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.300
 trowel allen we use for 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.940
 work the small amounts of 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.940
 lands if you practice spade our 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.739
 spot and we also need to 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.449
 calm it's a specific case to be 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.379
 went to earth this is the case here we 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.780
 hero was 3 x 1 5 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.110
 the first step will be to bring 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.680
 electricity from the house to our spot 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.989
 for that we dug a trench 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.409
 minigun and an electric cable and we 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.540
 let's get to the location of the future spot 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.090
 we are in the presence of a spot a little 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.250
 specific because it 's this model has 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.799
 need a concrete base or slab 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.969
 cement to be fixed first operation 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:21.670
 and the passage of the cable danokles us 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.759
 let's come lay our base on our 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.950
 of asimo that we have already laid a 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.520
 times the base the other spot set on the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.630
 building 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.460
 we will plugged our spot the neutral 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.590
 with the transformer node the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:42.579
 phase and last the earth who she 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.320
 is set on other spots game 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.689
 repositioning transformers that 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.500
 come to be placed in this box here and 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.580
 I come close in this spot 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.050
 and I revisit the installation of the spot being 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.930
 completed we will close the 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.560
 trench we are on the same model 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.270
 spots 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.380
 we still have to adjust the angle of our 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.450
 spot we will choose an angle of 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.550
 lighted way and other plants and 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.340
