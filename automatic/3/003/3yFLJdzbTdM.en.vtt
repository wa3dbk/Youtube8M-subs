00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.630 

well<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.470> right<00:02:44.620> hand<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:44.980> same<00:02:45.250> theory

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640

well the right hand is the same theory
tip<00:02:45.880> but<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.239> go<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.420> other<00:02:46.600> way<00:02:46.660> around

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
obviously bring the car into the left

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.340 
obviously bring the car into the left
and<00:02:48.700> then<00:02:49.390> we<00:02:49.420> take<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.780> longest<00:02:50.230> route

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350

that snaps retreat that seems to be the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
only exit every right hand bag

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.060 
only exit every right hand bag
okay<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.930> same<00:03:07.170> right<00:03:07.500> hand<00:03:07.740> bend

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
okay so the same right hand bend

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.020 
approaching where did the raising line
take<00:03:10.080> me<00:03:10.200> wrong<00:03:10.410> here<00:03:10.770> right<00:03:11.130> here<00:03:11.310> typically

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
take me wrong here right here typically

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.180 
take me wrong here right here typically
now<00:03:12.180> turning<00:03:12.600> towards<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:12.990> apex<00:03:13.080> here<00:03:13.620> you

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
now turning towards the apex here you

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.590 
now turning towards the apex here you
see<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.760> wait<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.240> exit<00:03:15.510> event

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
see that the wait on the exit event

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:24.080 
see that the wait on the exit event
takes<00:03:16.050> us<00:03:16.260> then<00:03:22.670> connect<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.820> here

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090

think<00:03:25.440> we<00:03:25.500> go<00:03:25.590> either<00:03:25.740> on<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.040> exit<00:03:26.340> now<00:03:26.550> the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
think we go either on the exit now the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.910 
think we go either on the exit now the
