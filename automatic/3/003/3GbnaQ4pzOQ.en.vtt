and this car has been around the
Nurburgring<00:01:05.840> in<00:01:06.440> less<00:01:06.500> than<00:01:06.860> eight<00:01:07.010> minutes

Nurburgring in less than eight minutes
which<00:01:07.760> is<00:01:07.790> pretty<00:01:08.420> sensational<00:01:09.110> for<00:01:09.800> a

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
which is pretty sensational for a

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.470 
which is pretty sensational for a
front-wheel<00:01:12.200> drive<00:01:12.350> or<00:01:12.590> hatchback<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.610> the

front-wheel drive or hatchback and the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.610 
front-wheel drive or hatchback and the
fact<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:14.960> goes<00:01:15.050> around<00:01:15.230> their<00:01:15.470> back

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
fact that it goes around their back

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.420 
fact that it goes around their back
quickly<00:01:17.020> is<00:01:18.020> why<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:18.350> car<00:01:18.710> looks<00:01:19.010> like<00:01:19.250> it

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
quickly is why this car looks like it

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.660 
quickly is why this car looks like it
does<00:01:19.610> all<00:01:20.060> wings<00:01:20.390> or<00:01:20.660> vents<00:01:21.050> or<00:01:21.170> spoilers

does all wings or vents or spoilers

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.790 
does all wings or vents or spoilers

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
because it generates genuine downforce

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.000
