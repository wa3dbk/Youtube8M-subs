invention<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:07.020> Minecraft<00:00:07.529> monorail<00:00:08.090> I've

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
invention the Minecraft monorail I've

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.150 
invention the Minecraft monorail I've
been<00:00:09.389> trying<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.870> record<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.530> video<00:00:10.710> for<00:00:11.130> a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
been trying to record this video for a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.430 
been trying to record this video for a
while<00:00:11.219> now<00:00:11.400> my<00:00:12.269> mic<00:00:12.570> wouldn't<00:00:12.929> mess<00:00:13.080> up<00:00:13.259> this

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
while now my mic wouldn't mess up this

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.279 
while now my mic wouldn't mess up this
time<00:00:13.710> does<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.099> be<00:00:14.340> very<00:00:15.030> nice<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.900> let<00:00:16.020> me<00:00:16.109> show

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
time does we be very nice so let me show

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.060 
time does we be very nice so let me show
you<00:00:16.320> how<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.650> works<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:18.470> basically<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.039> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
you how it works so basically we have a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.400 
you how it works so basically we have a
minecart<00:00:20.630> going<00:00:21.680> on<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:23.720> block<00:00:24.720> without<00:00:25.050> any

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
minecart going on a block without any

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.460 
minecart going on a block without any
rail<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.859> all<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:26.970> turn<00:00:27.630> functionally

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
rail at all and it can turn functionally

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.819 
rail at all and it can turn functionally
and<00:00:30.019> basically<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.500> turning<00:00:32.099> because<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
and basically it's turning because I

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.490 
and basically it's turning because I
instead<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.950> people<00:00:35.790> doing<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.780> this

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
instead of people doing it like this

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.889 
instead of people doing it like this
that's<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.460> I've<00:00:38.730> tried<00:00:38.969> I've<00:00:39.210> seen<00:00:39.600> many

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
that's as I've tried I've seen many

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.270 
that's as I've tried I've seen many
people<00:00:39.989> try<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:42.050> like<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.559> put<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:44.040> rail

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
people try to do like just put a rail

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.819 
people try to do like just put a rail
like<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.600> that's<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:45.930> gonna<00:00:46.110> make<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.559> turn

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
like this that's not gonna make it turn

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.420 
like this that's not gonna make it turn
is<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> gonna<00:00:47.820> let<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> escape<00:00:48.420> out<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.050> way

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
is it gonna let it escape out this way

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.670 
is it gonna let it escape out this way
because<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.610> isn't<00:00:50.969> actually<00:00:51.600> very<00:00:51.840> safe<00:00:52.260> at

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
because that isn't actually very safe at

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.959 
because that isn't actually very safe at
all<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.649> make<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.039> turn<00:00:56.280> straight<00:00:56.699> away

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
all so I just make it turn straight away

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.110 
all so I just make it turn straight away
by<00:00:57.960> putting<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.309> straight<00:00:59.670> minecart

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
by putting just a straight minecart

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.359 
by putting just a straight minecart
track<00:01:01.160> again<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:05.159> this

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
track again with that and this so this

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.340 
track again with that and this so this
is<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.850> foolproof<00:01:06.450> way<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> want<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.170> build

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
is the foolproof way you want to build

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.000 
is the foolproof way you want to build
it<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:09.000> want<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.330> start<00:01:09.600> off<00:01:09.750> by<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.799> in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
it you want to start off by going in

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.609 
it you want to start off by going in
either<00:01:11.250> direction<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.970> zero<00:01:12.299> or<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> direction

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
either direction of zero or a direction

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.340 
either direction of zero or a direction
of<00:01:13.860> three<00:01:14.189> that's<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.210> foolproof<00:01:15.600> way<00:01:15.900> you

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
of three that's the foolproof way you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.609 
of three that's the foolproof way you
want<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:18.170> that's<00:01:19.170> how<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.409> want

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
want to do that and that's how you want

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.510 
want to do that and that's how you want
to<00:01:19.680> start<00:01:19.950> off<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.659> then<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.020> want<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.520> when

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
to start off and then you want to when

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.740 
to start off and then you want to when
it<00:01:23.640> head<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.350> go<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> three<00:01:26.750> build

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
it head to here if you go to three build

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.990 
it head to here if you go to three build
the<00:01:27.900> rest<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.670> doesn't

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the rest just like this it doesn't

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
the rest just like this it doesn't
matter<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.689> bus<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.990> doesn't<00:01:31.229> matter<00:01:31.350> all<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
matter the bus it doesn't matter all you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.160 
matter the bus it doesn't matter all you
need<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.460> make<00:01:32.729> sure<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:33.240> not<00:01:33.659> off<00:01:33.869> in

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
need to do is make sure it's not off in

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.679 
need to do is make sure it's not off in
the<00:01:34.259> direction<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.680> zero<00:01:34.979> or<00:01:35.670> three<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> then

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the direction of zero or three and then

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.660 
the direction of zero or three and then
the<00:01:36.869> rest<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.590> build<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:38.430> like

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the rest you can just build just like

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.840 
the rest you can just build just like
this<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.150> regular<00:01:40.049> rail<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.460> powered<00:01:41.820> rail

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
this a regular rail and a powered rail

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.420 
this a regular rail and a powered rail
into<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> block<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:44.000> power<00:01:45.000> source<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> let

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
into a block with a power source so let

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.340 
into a block with a power source so let
me<00:01:47.520> write<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.270> show<00:01:48.479> you

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.110 

let<00:01:55.350> me<00:01:55.530> reload<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.160> minecart<00:01:56.610> actually

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
let me reload the minecart actually

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.500 
let me reload the minecart actually
because<00:01:57.870> uh<00:01:58.430> doesn't<00:01:59.430> work<00:01:59.550> too<00:01:59.790> well<00:01:59.820> if<00:02:00.300> you

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
because uh doesn't work too well if you

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.620 
because uh doesn't work too well if you
just<00:02:00.780> wrote<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> once<00:02:02.130> cuz<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.670> know<00:02:02.820> doesn't

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
just wrote it once cuz you know doesn't

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.730 
just wrote it once cuz you know doesn't
reform<00:02:04.080> correctly<00:02:08.270> looks<00:02:09.270> fine

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.810 

there<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.490> go<00:02:12.780> perfect<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:15.040> break<00:02:15.670> mine<00:02:16.330> cards

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
there you go perfect so break mine cards

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.480 
there you go perfect so break mine cards
you<00:02:18.820> load<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.240> one<00:02:19.630> two<00:02:20.020> three<00:02:20.560> four<00:02:21.130> four<00:02:21.430> the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
you load it one two three four four the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.470 
you load it one two three four four the
next<00:02:21.730> person

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
next person

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.920 
next person
of<00:02:23.320> course<00:02:23.650> without<00:02:23.980> any<00:02:24.280> people<00:02:25.270> at<00:02:25.510> all<00:02:25.690> it

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
of course without any people at all it

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.200 
of course without any people at all it
still<00:02:26.200> works<00:02:26.440> fine<00:02:28.950> because<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.610> this

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
still works fine because this is this

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.120 
still works fine because this is this
was<00:02:31.420> originally<00:02:31.930> made<00:02:32.200> for<00:02:32.440> just<00:02:32.680> minecart

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
was originally made for just minecart

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.520 
was originally made for just minecart
alone<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.760> didn't<00:02:34.570> even<00:02:34.810> need<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:35.140> reload

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
alone I didn't even need to reload

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.640 
alone I didn't even need to reload
because<00:02:35.740> nobody<00:02:36.490> wrote<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.330> before<00:02:37.750> if<00:02:38.350> it's<00:02:38.560> a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
because nobody wrote it before if it's a

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.150 
because nobody wrote it before if it's a
human<00:02:39.100> writing<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.640> then<00:02:39.850> that's<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.390> problem

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.460

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
because you start off a bit faster which

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.930 
because you start off a bit faster which
