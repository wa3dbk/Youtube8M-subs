 bright enough to work indoors 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.709
 and colors are as natural as possible, although 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.469
 viewing angles are not the greatest they are quite 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:34.899
 acceptable for comfortable use

 and the more soft-touch coating is not 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.499
 prone to fingerprints 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.899
 and scratch the angle of the display

 netbook angled to the table 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.799
 thanks to this, the computer is almost not 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.810
