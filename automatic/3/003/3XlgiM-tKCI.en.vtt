nice

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
nice

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.300 
nice
I<00:03:29.780> thought<00:03:29.959> DC<00:03:30.500> day<00:03:30.709> was<00:03:30.980> catchy<00:03:31.250> ER<00:03:31.519> but<00:03:32.019> it

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
I thought DC day was catchy ER but it

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.220 
I thought DC day was catchy ER but it
and<00:03:34.310> with<00:03:34.430> that<00:03:34.459> he<00:03:35.090> was<00:03:35.209> back<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.720> work<00:03:35.900> I

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
and with that he was back to work I

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.259 
and with that he was back to work I
don't<00:03:36.410> think<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:36.980> destroying<00:03:37.400> side<00:03:37.760> bugs<00:03:38.000> is

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
don't think so destroying side bugs is

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.080 
don't think so destroying side bugs is
just<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.660> sideline<00:03:38.900> for<00:03:39.109> us<00:03:39.470> our<00:03:40.220> real<00:03:40.519> job<00:03:40.850> is

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
just a sideline for us our real job is

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.050 
just a sideline for us our real job is
making<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.660> gamers<00:03:41.959> happy<00:03:42.500> one<00:03:43.340> quarter<00:03:43.850> at<00:03:43.970> a

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
making you gamers happy one quarter at a

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.240 
making you gamers happy one quarter at a
time<00:03:44.380> is<00:03:45.380> that<00:03:45.470> really<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.709> end<00:03:45.829> of<00:03:45.920> story

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
time is that really the end of story

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.400 
time is that really the end of story
I'm<00:03:47.820> pretty<00:03:48.120> sure<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.360> saw<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.660> side<00:03:48.960> bug<00:03:49.200> it's

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
I'm pretty sure I saw the side bug it's

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.130

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
not his health was diminished unless it

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.610
