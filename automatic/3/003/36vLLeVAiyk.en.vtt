 the bunches are pointed by a succession 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.809
 using the time line Corn 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.580
 questions the quality guards that haggis 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.260

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.590
 stores go directly to the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.130
 rocks with the smell of smoke is so intense 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.689
 that even quite negative 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.740
 we know to what extent it is not harmful 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.720
 the health 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.430

 which makes the entrance of the air is relatively 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.500
 close to where it left FUNDAC Roses 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.940
 This track was written to sic the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.520
 maintenance plan I with 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.830
 people made by Spanish company that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.710
 book scratch the filters like cats 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.079
 The evaporators seen monthly once 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.199
 per year and the air ducts are cleaned 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.870
 in the general reviews situation with the emtu 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.600
 sp for not preventing gaza from abroad 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:14.160
 between trains in particular during the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:16.500
 the Portuguese passage nelson vieira is the 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.330
 high-end user of the domain but 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.759
 liked that the renewal of the selection of 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.090
 seals extend to the carriages 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.910
 the environment is not very good and the air 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.289
 also if as very old very proud 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.979
 I think he does not have much of a way 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.350
 that besides the bad smell the succession 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.600
 of convoy felt also pointed finger 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.860
 conditions of carriages 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.400
 with almost 30 years evaluate with some 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.170
 are not friends of the doctorate 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.850
 accumulate produced for example never a 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.520
 wheelchair risk them a stand 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.920
 It's going to be very complicated for people. 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.560
 will enter the roses stands the platform is 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.409
 low and the scale are generally high 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.140
 for other detainees there is no reason to 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.530
 major concerns about the yen is not 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.530
 bad 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.220
 It does not smell bad or anything but it happens 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.560
 So much comfort, I'm fine by my side. 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.890
 no complaint so the level of 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.410
 smells and tastes of the account 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.050
 nothing at all easy this trip normally 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.840
 and back twice a week 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.450
 I never have things I think the cold stays 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.070
 Older vines and making you 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.470
 favor or is being good jesus dirt and 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.350
 these parts here do not have much desire 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.450
 to be in the lead in the coming months 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.480
 cpi intends to put into circulation in 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.290
 regional and interregional lines 20 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.690
 also heights these place of spain 14 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.800
 of these trains are of an improved 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.800
 of the current model
