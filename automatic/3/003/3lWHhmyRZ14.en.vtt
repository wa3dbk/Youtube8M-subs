00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
microfiber going on and then an elastic

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.180 
microfiber going on and then an elastic
strap<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.850> hold<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.750> front<00:00:54.930> cover<00:00:55.140> closed<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
strap to hold the front cover closed you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.240 
strap to hold the front cover closed you
slide<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.090> iPad<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.870> hair<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.649> you're

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
slide the iPad in hair like so you're

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.319 
slide the iPad in hair like so you're
going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> want<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.760> careful<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.270> you're

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
going to want to be careful if you're

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.299 
going to want to be careful if you're
using<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.690> screen<00:01:00.960> shield<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.039> doesn't

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
using a screen shield that this doesn't

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.369 
using a screen shield that this doesn't
bubble<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:03.930> you're<00:01:04.080> good<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.260> go

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
bubble it up and then you're good to go

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.070 
bubble it up and then you're good to go
so<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.549> does<00:01:05.820> work<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> sleep/wake

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
so this does work with the sleep/wake

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
so this does work with the sleep/wake
function<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.250> open<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.700> close

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
function you can see as I open and close

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.270 
function you can see as I open and close
the<00:01:09.090> case<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.900> iPad<00:01:10.260> will<00:01:10.500> wake<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the case the iPad will wake up and go to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.859 
the case the iPad will wake up and go to
sleep<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.729> then<00:01:11.790> again<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.540> use<00:01:12.689> this

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
sleep and then again you can use this

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.300 
sleep and then again you can use this
front<00:01:13.200> cover<00:01:14.180> band<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:16.170> keep<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.619> flap

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
front cover band here to keep the flap

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.249 
front cover band here to keep the flap
closed<00:01:17.850> when<00:01:18.479> you're<00:01:18.659> carrying<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> case

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
closed when you're carrying the case

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.499 
closed when you're carrying the case
around<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> doesn't<00:01:20.430> activate<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.210> sleep

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
around so it doesn't activate that sleep

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.690 
around so it doesn't activate that sleep
awake<00:01:21.780> function<00:01:22.130> while<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:23.310> using<00:01:23.400> the
