00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 Hello everyone, I am a wooden squat. 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:02.400
 Today? 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.020
 will 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.760
 Ramen that was eaten in Okinawa before 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.620
 This is what I bought is a spicy taste. 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.540
 Spicy porridge ramen 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.220
 This is the last Okinawa style stewed pork 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.320
 Use this as an ingredient for ramen 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.820
 Still want to do a barbecued pork to eat 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.480
 Then come and do it. 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.340
 Cook boiled eggs beforehand 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.880
 Will put three forks in the ramen and put three 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.820
 Put the eggs in after boiling 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.840
 Cook for 5 minutes 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720
 Let’s make a sauce with a barbecued pork. 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.980
 Three tablespoons of soy sauce 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.580
 Three spoons of miso 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.820
 Sugar is also three tablespoons 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.300
 Cooking wine 1.5 tablespoons 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.680
 Let's cook pork. 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.560
 Add the sauce you just made 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.840
 Start stewing 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.580
 Wow soup smells a bit hot 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.900
 Let’s do a barbecue. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.480
 After the rice is closed, it will not be put in. 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.900
 Put the freshly cooked egg in the middle 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.340
 Semi-cooked just right 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.800
 Then put the chopped green onion 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.580
 finished 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.500
 Put on the barbecue 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.660
 half-cooked egg 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.220
 chopped green onion 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.880
 Spicy miso porpoise porpoise ramen finish 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 will 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.940
 Spicy miso dolphini ramen and 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.240
 Barbecued pork 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.060
 I have to start. 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.640
 Let's drink soup first 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.960
 Completely... although a little spicy 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.800
 Ok 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.340
 But not so spicy 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.500
 Although there is a little bit spicy 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.760
 Have the taste of porridge 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.420
 I feel a bit hot and spicy in my throat. 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800
 Although it is instant noodles, it is still spicy. 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.040
 Generally good 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.140
 a little spicy 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.260
 Come to eat barbecued pork 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.480
 Looks super delicious 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.160
 The sauce also looks super delicious. 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.280
 Wow, it looks so delicious. 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.040
 I have to start. 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.940
 Um~ (laugh) 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.760
 Sweet sauce 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.700
 Stewed pork is very good with white rice 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.420
 The stewed pork here is also delicious. 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.840
 The egg is half cooked and it feels great. 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.500
 flashlight 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.380
 The lights are always off (laugh) 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.380
 A little spicy feeling has been in the throat 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.300
 This amount is a bit 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.340
 Although not so spicy 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.400
 But eating this amount of spicy may die. 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.420
 But it’s delicious and delicious. (laugh) 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.540
 There are also eggs. 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.200
 I feel that this ramen is very long. 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.860
 Amazing 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.740
 It’s better than ordinary instant noodles. 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.720
 Is it my illusion? 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.400
 It is said that ramen is very good with chopped green onion. 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.880
 Although green is delicious 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.180
 But maybe I prefer green onion 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.860
 Spicy to a little hot 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.820
 so spicy 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.320
 Almost finished 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.140
 So hot 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.200
 I really like to eat rice and ramen soup together. 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.140
 If you have a bit of pork, 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.760
 I will leave a lot at the end. 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.460
 Then eat with noodle soup 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.000
 But the pork roast feels too much sauce. 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.720
 I started to say that I would use Sihe’s rice to do it. 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.120
 But when I found out that the rice bowl was cooked, I couldn’t put it down. 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.440
 If you use two, you can feel that the sauce can be halved. 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.060
 Spicy miso porridge noodles have been eaten 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.900
 A little spicy 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.040
 There is also a barbecue 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.000
 Ok 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.820
 Ah, I always said that it is a barbecued pork. 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.740
 Correctly speaking, it’s the stewed pork. 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.320
 It should be the same thing. 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.760
 Have to eat the last bite 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.700
 Stewed pork chop finished 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.140
 The food brought back from Okinawa is finished like this. 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.860
 Okinawa is really fun 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.900
 Still want to go again 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.540
 I want to go to the beach next time. 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.940
 I really want to go to the island to play. 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.100
