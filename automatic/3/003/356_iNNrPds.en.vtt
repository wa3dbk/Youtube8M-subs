00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.240
 Look at them 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.880
 this directive 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.060
 once again a threat to canada 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.060
 there buckle them 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.209
 moussa sow lille and kevin paulus report to parliament 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.839
 but hey he went ahead right away 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.839
 more lost than I want 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.769
 tournament for him 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.769
 over 19 years old 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.269
 it is easy 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.150
 if these melodies 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.370
 it exists 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.390
 I am reassured 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.750
 strongly the efforts are divided 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.050
 wonderful foundation 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.440
 the importers on the ground 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.440
 a little more lightness of what to force to go 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.050
 hated his sex so we made a stop at all parties carried out 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.250
 captain kuhlmann ligaments continues even after his historic reminder 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.560
 while 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.740
 no more 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.740
 but it's at the level of those 2000 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.410
 in the pocket 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.120
 we only take a few minutes 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.120
 presumably it may be more meaningful 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.070
 peaceful bandwidth 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.280
 chopped off 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.760
 after a technical rebound 2010 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.690
 it's safer 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.690
 the other source 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.580
 after that inspires you 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.030
 but only 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 but more than ten nowadays but everywhere 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.910
 what about the julians standing side look 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.710
 I am I am 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.710
 where is the 18th century 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.860
 the one of the sale 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.860
 shooting 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.340
 machined initially 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 in any case I know my client is 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.590
 if you put aside he's in the hospital and houses meanwhile 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.000
 assured he was coming 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 I do not live like other people who will pay 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.240
 we stay a little more hotels 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.209
 we miss him 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:25.869
 at least six days for you to talk about this villainous 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.679
 first we check them replace them 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.499
 he is the little kiss 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.000
 colombo placement 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 like the others it takes two hours more 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.339
 why she is here 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.339
 norman nato no to the nato of the un or goals 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.909
 in the other quarter-finals 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.639
 orlando 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.419
 ran the 100 m 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.719
 like the calendar via 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.409
 if that's not bad 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.279
 appetizing greedy not short 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.389
 the mom time 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:17.439
 - yes we left the city around the world only talking about that 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.499
 does not prevent them from working somehow 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.709
 three million dollars the day before 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.859
 so for once 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.859
 the money diverted to a corner by the deputy spokeswoman marie 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.599
 always the same people 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:33.469
 we can doubt it
