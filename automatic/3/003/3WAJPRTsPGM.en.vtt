seven<00:00:19.890> straight<00:00:20.100> matches<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.490> think<00:00:20.520> or<00:00:20.880> might

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
seven straight matches I think or might

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.790 
seven straight matches I think or might
have<00:00:21.150> been<00:00:21.240> eight<00:00:21.359> he<00:00:21.810> was<00:00:21.990> seven<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.710> he's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
have been eight he was seven but he's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200 
have been eight he was seven but he's
lost<00:00:22.920> seven<00:00:23.250> straight<00:00:23.369> times<00:00:23.490> which<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.000> think

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
lost seven straight times which I think

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.810 
lost seven straight times which I think
three<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.990> them<00:00:25.080> are<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.230> major<00:00:25.439> files<00:00:25.920> which

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
three of them are in major files which

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.339 
three of them are in major files which
is<00:00:26.970> pretty<00:00:27.119> serious<00:00:27.480> because<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.109> mean<00:00:28.260> that's

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
is pretty serious because I mean that's

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.529 
is pretty serious because I mean that's
it's<00:00:28.710> huge<00:00:29.010> he's<00:00:29.640> kept<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.060> from<00:00:30.210> kind<00:00:30.480> of

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
it's huge he's kept it all from kind of

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.139 
it's huge he's kept it all from kind of
extending<00:00:31.019> his<00:00:31.230> winning<00:00:31.980> streak<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.550> it's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
extending his winning streak and it's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.209 
extending his winning streak and it's
pretty<00:00:33.329> impressive<00:00:33.540> i<00:00:33.809> think<00:00:34.020> because<00:00:34.219> just

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
pretty impressive i think because just

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.030 
pretty impressive i think because just
because<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.520> fact<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.850> i<00:00:36.030> mean<00:00:36.210> Djokovic

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
because of the fact that i mean Djokovic

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.760 
because of the fact that i mean Djokovic
just<00:00:38.040> too<00:00:38.160> good<00:00:38.570> he<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:39.840> he<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:40.230> too<00:00:40.530> good<00:00:40.649> and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
just too good he was he was too good and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.930 
just too good he was he was too good and
then<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> dolphin<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.370> figured<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.640> an<00:00:41.700> answer

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
then a dolphin I figured out an answer

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.850 
then a dolphin I figured out an answer
and<00:00:42.329> what<00:00:42.570> better<00:00:42.750> place<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.770> his

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and what better place to do it on his

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.250 
and what better place to do it on his
home<00:00:44.040> turf<00:00:44.070> money<00:00:44.610> Carla<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:46.200> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
home turf money Carla and that's what I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.410 
home turf money Carla and that's what I
find<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> most<00:00:47.100> impressive<00:00:47.670> thing<00:00:47.820> but

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
find to be the most impressive thing but

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.400 
find to be the most impressive thing but
yeah<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:50.210> honestly<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.329> think<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.809> Nadal<00:00:52.140> this

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
yeah so honestly I think that Nadal this

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.720 
yeah so honestly I think that Nadal this
is<00:00:52.500> gonna<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> big<00:00:52.980> confidence<00:00:53.250> booster<00:00:53.699> for

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is gonna be a big confidence booster for

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.580 
is gonna be a big confidence booster for
the<00:00:53.910> doll<00:00:54.059> heading<00:00:54.329> into<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.629> Madrid<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.469> in

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the doll heading into a Madrid and in

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.290 
the doll heading into a Madrid and in
Rome<00:00:55.770> French<00:00:56.370> oh<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.610> obviously<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.149> big

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
Rome French oh but obviously it's big

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.849 
Rome French oh but obviously it's big
confidence<00:00:57.570> booster<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.140> he's<00:00:58.440> always<00:00:58.680> he's

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
confidence booster to he's always he's

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.740 
confidence booster to he's always he's
only<00:00:58.980> lost<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.370> match<00:00:59.550> there<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.600> was

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
only lost one match there and that was

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.209 
only lost one match there and that was
because<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.260> probably<00:01:01.559> sort<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.949> him<00:01:02.039> played

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
because I probably sort of him played

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.130 
because I probably sort of him played
well<00:01:02.250> he<00:01:02.910> didn't<00:01:03.090> play<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.420> well<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.899> couple

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
well he didn't play as well and a couple

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.890 
well he didn't play as well and a couple
other<00:01:04.350> external<00:01:04.890> factors<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:06.030> all<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.630> is

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
other external factors but all I know is

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.679 
other external factors but all I know is
that<00:01:06.930> Djokovic<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.939> still<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.540> he's<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that Djokovic is I still think he's a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.210 
that Djokovic is I still think he's a
favorite<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.110> win<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.260> French<00:01:10.500> Open<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220

to<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.250> difficult<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.790> say<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.270> will<00:01:15.479> happen

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
to be difficult to say what will happen

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.410 
to be difficult to say what will happen
in<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> future<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.350> um<00:01:16.909> all<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.210> in

you<00:01:42.899> definitely<00:01:43.229> lose<00:01:43.320> some<00:01:43.530> points<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
you definitely lose some points and

might<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.280> take<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.329> it's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
might have to take so I think that it's

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.840 
might have to take so I think that it's
definitely<00:01:48.990> important<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.490> dial<00:01:50.729> to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
definitely important for the dial to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.219 
definitely important for the dial to
continue<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.299> play<00:01:51.450> every<00:01:51.689> single<00:01:51.930> toward<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
continue to play every single toward and

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.359 
continue to play every single toward and
get<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.409> many<00:01:52.500> points<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.860> he<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.159> hopefully

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
get as many points as he can hopefully

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.580 
get as many points as he can hopefully
get<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> seat<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.020> front<00:01:55.110> chop<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
get a seat in the front chop and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.410 
get a seat in the front chop and
hopefully<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.430> everything<00:01:56.790> goes<00:01:56.939> well<00:01:57.149> so
