so<00:00:21.350> this<00:00:21.680> is<00:00:21.740> a<00:00:21.890> generic<00:00:22.869> rubber<00:00:23.869> dome

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
so this is a generic rubber dome

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.540 
so this is a generic rubber dome
keyboard<00:00:24.710> if<00:00:24.859> you<00:00:24.920> don't<00:00:25.070> know<00:00:25.189> what<00:00:25.340> rubber

keyboard if you don't know what rubber

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.730 
keyboard if you don't know what rubber
dome<00:00:25.789> means<00:00:26.029> it<00:00:26.210> basically<00:00:26.480> means<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:27.320> rubber

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
dome means it basically means the rubber

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.230 
dome means it basically means the rubber
pieces<00:00:28.220> that<00:00:28.340> are<00:00:28.460> underneath<00:00:28.730> these<00:00:28.970> key

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
pieces that are underneath these key

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.630 
pieces that are underneath these key
caps<00:00:29.510> are<00:00:30.410> just<00:00:30.769> rubber<00:00:31.039> and<00:00:31.250> then<00:00:31.369> that's

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
caps are just rubber and then that's

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.330 
caps are just rubber and then that's
what<00:00:31.880> activates<00:00:32.330> the<00:00:32.750> keys<00:00:33.440> when<00:00:33.980> you<00:00:34.070> press

what activates the keys when you press

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.010 
what activates the keys when you press
and<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.730> reason<00:00:35.000> why<00:00:35.149> that's<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:35.630> reason<00:00:35.899> why

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
and the reason why that's the reason why

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.319 
and the reason why that's the reason why
they<00:00:36.260> are<00:00:36.399> cheap<00:00:37.399> keyboards<00:00:37.850> i<00:00:37.910> think<00:00:38.120> this

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
they are cheap keyboards i think this

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.979 
they are cheap keyboards i think this
one<00:00:38.809> this<00:00:39.620> one<00:00:39.860> actually<00:00:40.250> came<00:00:40.399> with<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:41.629> dell

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
one this one actually came with the dell

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.410 
one this one actually came with the dell
optiplex<00:00:42.350> GX<00:00:42.890> 620<00:00:43.370> I<00:00:43.399> got<00:00:43.700> from<00:00:43.940> Micro<00:00:44.239> Center

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
optiplex GX 620 I got from Micro Center

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.080 
optiplex GX 620 I got from Micro Center
but<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.739> have<00:00:46.129> another<00:00:46.340> keyboard<00:00:46.550> just<00:00:46.910> like

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
but I have another keyboard just like

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.619 
but I have another keyboard just like
this<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:48.530> is<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.980> exact<00:00:49.760> same<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:50.510> was

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
this and it is the exact same and it was

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.240 
this and it is the exact same and it was
just<00:00:50.809> around<00:00:50.899> a<00:00:51.320> little<00:00:51.620> less<00:00:51.890> than<00:00:52.070> ten

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
just around a little less than ten

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.189 
just around a little less than ten
dollars<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:52.760> that<00:00:53.329> explains<00:00:53.600> why<00:00:53.899> they're

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
dollars so that explains why they're

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.869 
dollars so that explains why they're
cheap<00:00:54.440> it<00:00:54.649> still<00:00:54.860> works<00:00:55.070> excellent<00:00:55.610> it's<00:00:55.789> a

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
cheap it still works excellent it's a

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.689 
cheap it still works excellent it's a
good<00:00:56.059> keyboard<00:00:56.270> for<00:00:56.780> doing<00:00:57.620> basic<00:00:58.010> tasks<00:00:58.280> and

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
everything like that but the only

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.529 
everything like that but the only
problem<00:01:01.100> is<00:01:01.190> is<00:01:01.430> there's<00:01:01.609> nothing<00:01:01.789> satisfying

other black computers and stuff like
that<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:32.510> reason<00:02:32.840> why<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.019> got<00:02:33.319> this

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530

that so the reason why I got this
keyboard<00:02:33.769> is<00:02:34.250> because<00:02:35.080> it's<00:02:36.080> white<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.890> stands

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
comparison and this one it's probably

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.870 
comparison and this one it's probably
like<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.269> pound<00:03:26.769> extremely<00:03:27.769> light<00:03:28.040> but<00:03:28.639> as<00:03:28.730> you

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
like a pound extremely light but as you

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.120 
like a pound extremely light but as you
can<00:03:29.000> see<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:30.470> pretty<00:03:30.680> much<00:03:30.769> standard

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
it looks still pretty big to it but if I

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.129 
it looks still pretty big to it but if I
were<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.790> lay<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.060> right<00:03:35.090> there<00:03:35.480> don't<00:03:35.989> just

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
were to lay it right there don't just

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.710 
were to lay it right there don't just
turn<00:03:36.500> on<00:03:36.680> lock<00:03:36.859> it<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.609> quite<00:03:38.000> small

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
turn on lock it is a quite small

up<00:05:31.310> so<00:05:31.849> this<00:05:32.330> was<00:05:32.599> a<00:05:32.930> cover<00:05:33.289> that<00:05:33.560> goes<00:05:33.770> over

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
up so this was a cover that goes over

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.129 
up so this was a cover that goes over
the<00:05:35.860> lights<00:05:36.860> or<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.070> LEDs<00:05:37.580> that<00:05:37.690> LED<00:05:38.690> overlays

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
the lights or the LEDs that LED overlays

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.040 
the lights or the LEDs that LED overlays
that's<00:05:39.409> what<00:05:39.530> it<00:05:39.620> is<00:05:39.650> you<00:05:40.490> can<00:05:40.669> pick<00:05:40.969> these<00:05:41.120> LED

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
that's what it is you can pick these LED

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.589 
that's what it is you can pick these LED
up<00:05:42.229> overlays<00:05:43.159> up<00:05:43.400> for<00:05:43.909> like<00:05:44.030> a<00:05:44.060> little<00:05:44.330> dollar

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
up overlays up for like a little dollar

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.409 
up overlays up for like a little dollar
fifty<00:05:45.020> cents<00:05:45.580> that<00:05:46.580> you<00:05:46.729> can<00:05:46.880> replace<00:05:47.150> there's

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
fifty cents that you can replace there's

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.339 
fifty cents that you can replace there's
like<00:05:47.570> a<00:05:47.599> black<00:05:47.840> version<00:05:48.110> stuff<00:05:48.620> like<00:05:48.830> that<00:05:49.270> so

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
like a black version stuff like that so

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.020 
like a black version stuff like that so
right<00:05:51.349> here<00:05:51.590> it<00:05:51.830> basically<00:05:52.190> covered<00:05:52.729> up<00:05:52.849> the

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
right here it basically covered up the

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.540 
right here it basically covered up the
unit<00:05:53.449> cop<00:05:53.570> logo<00:05:53.960> but<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.620> problem<00:05:55.039> is<00:05:55.190> is<00:05:55.400> it

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
unit cop logo but the problem is is it

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.430 
unit cop logo but the problem is is it
still<00:05:55.880> seeping<00:05:56.539> through<00:05:56.570> you<00:05:56.840> can<00:05:56.990> still<00:05:57.199> see

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
still seeping through you can still see

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.010 
still seeping through you can still see
the<00:05:57.590> original<00:05:57.819> backplate<00:05:58.819> and<00:05:59.030> the<00:05:59.270> keys<00:05:59.750> in

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
the original backplate and the keys in

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.570 
the original backplate and the keys in
there<00:06:00.199> cameras<00:06:00.770> actually<00:06:00.919> picking<00:06:01.219> up<00:06:01.370> quite

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
there cameras actually picking up quite

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.209 
there cameras actually picking up quite
well<00:06:01.810> not<00:06:02.810> too<00:06:02.990> much<00:06:03.139> of<00:06:03.259> a<00:06:03.319> big<00:06:03.500> deal<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:03.919> like

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:04.219 
well not too much of a big deal I like

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.399 
well not too much of a big deal I like
having<00:06:04.580> this<00:06:04.759> cover<00:06:05.150> on<00:06:05.240> there<00:06:05.599> let<00:06:06.050> me<00:06:06.110> see<00:06:06.319> if

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
having this cover on there let me see if

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.529 
having this cover on there let me see if
I<00:06:06.500> turn<00:06:06.560> off<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:06.949> number<00:06:07.159> lock<00:06:07.280> if<00:06:07.520> that<00:06:08.270> shows

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
I turn off the number lock if that shows

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.930 
I turn off the number lock if that shows
it<00:06:08.780> a<00:06:08.840> little<00:06:09.080> bit<00:06:09.229> better<00:06:09.380> but<00:06:09.919> still<00:06:10.159> it's

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
it a little bit better but still it's

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.610 
it a little bit better but still it's
not<00:06:11.150> too<00:06:11.389> much<00:06:11.539> of<00:06:11.719> a<00:06:11.780> big<00:06:11.960> deal<00:06:11.990> and<00:06:12.380> I<00:06:12.469> like

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
not too much of a big deal and I like

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.899 
not too much of a big deal and I like
the<00:06:12.770> way<00:06:12.860> it<00:06:12.979> looks<00:06:13.159> without<00:06:13.400> it<00:06:13.550> but<00:06:13.729> I

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909 
the way it looks without it but I

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:16.629 
the way it looks without it but I
wouldn't<00:06:14.240> mind<00:06:14.360> without<00:06:14.780> it<00:06:14.930> on<00:06:15.050> so<00:06:15.979> pretty

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
wouldn't mind without it on so pretty

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.580 
wouldn't mind without it on so pretty
much<00:06:16.849> standard<00:06:17.569> keyboard<00:06:17.930> if<00:06:18.139> you<00:06:18.259> guys<00:06:18.380> want

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
much standard keyboard if you guys want

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.499 
much standard keyboard if you guys want
to<00:06:18.650> hear<00:06:18.770> some<00:06:19.039> better<00:06:19.310> typing<00:06:19.819> of<00:06:20.300> this

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
to hear some better typing of this

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:22.120 
to hear some better typing of this
keyboard<00:06:20.719> closer<00:06:21.229> up<00:06:21.530> or<00:06:21.710> something<00:06:21.979> with<00:06:22.099> a

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
keyboard closer up or something with a

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.459 
keyboard closer up or something with a
better<00:06:22.310> microphone<00:06:22.819> I<00:06:22.849> can<00:06:23.090> do<00:06:23.210> that<00:06:23.469> I'm

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:24.469 
better microphone I can do that I'm

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:25.719 
better microphone I can do that I'm
trying<00:06:24.710> to<00:06:24.770> think<00:06:24.860> if<00:06:25.009> there's<00:06:25.219> anything<00:06:25.430> else

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
trying to think if there's anything else

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.779 
trying to think if there's anything else
I<00:06:25.849> want<00:06:26.030> to<00:06:26.090> point<00:06:26.270> out<00:06:26.539> not<00:06:27.530> too<00:06:27.800> much<00:06:28.069> but<00:06:28.430> yes

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
I want to point out not too much but yes

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.749 
I want to point out not too much but yes
this<00:06:29.389> is<00:06:29.599> my<00:06:29.780> new<00:06:29.960> keyboard<00:06:30.169> much<00:06:31.159> better<00:06:31.550> than

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 
this is my new keyboard much better than

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.309 
this is my new keyboard much better than
the<00:06:31.909> standard<00:06:32.150> ten<00:06:32.569> dollar<00:06:32.780> keyboard<00:06:33.229> I

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
the standard ten dollar keyboard I

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.170 
the standard ten dollar keyboard I
picked<00:06:33.530> this<00:06:33.620> up<00:06:33.770> for<00:06:34.009> around<00:06:34.190> $80<00:06:34.759> with<00:06:34.969> I

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
picked this up for around $80 with I

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.680 
picked this up for around $80 with I
believe<00:06:35.740> this<00:06:36.740> was<00:06:36.949> not<00:06:37.279> customizable<00:06:38.060> so<00:06:38.330> it

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
believe this was not customizable so it

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.260 
believe this was not customizable so it
all<00:06:39.169> totaled<00:06:39.650> out<00:06:39.770> to<00:06:39.949> I<00:06:39.979> believe<00:06:40.490> around<00:06:40.789> a

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
all totaled out to I believe around a

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.999 
all totaled out to I believe around a
little<00:06:41.870> bit<00:06:42.139> over<00:06:42.349> $80

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
little bit over $80

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.159 
little bit over $80
so<00:06:43.189> they<00:06:43.789> are<00:06:43.909> very<00:06:44.059> well<00:06:44.360> built<00:06:44.599> keyboards

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
so they are very well built keyboards

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.439 
so they are very well built keyboards
don't<00:06:45.439> get<00:06:45.559> me<00:06:45.650> wrong<00:06:45.680> on<00:06:45.919> that<00:06:45.979> may<00:06:46.520> seem<00:06:47.180> like

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:47.449 
don't get me wrong on that may seem like

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.869 
don't get me wrong on that may seem like
it<00:06:47.689> looks<00:06:47.930> like<00:06:48.139> if<00:06:48.800> you're<00:06:49.069> not<00:06:49.099> into

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:49.879 
it looks like if you're not into

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.459 
it looks like if you're not into
keyboards<00:06:50.360> you<00:06:50.449> might<00:06:50.629> think<00:06:50.869> okay<00:06:51.110> this<00:06:51.289> is<00:06:51.439> a

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:51.469 
keyboards you might think okay this is a

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.619 
keyboards you might think okay this is a
really<00:06:51.680> crappy<00:06:52.069> keyboard<00:06:52.849> it's<00:06:53.059> not<00:06:53.270> it's

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:53.629 
really crappy keyboard it's not it's

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:55.480 
really crappy keyboard it's not it's

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
very well built trust me it'll probably

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.029 
very well built trust me it'll probably
last<00:06:55.819> over<00:06:56.509> ten<00:06:56.749> years<00:06:57.020> if<00:06:57.229> not<00:06:57.409> Mullins
