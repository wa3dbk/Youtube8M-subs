 that's right but it should not spoil the fun 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.560
 this became worth more every month 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.000
 Pieter Weening and that worked but I also realize that you are so nice 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.510

 this makes the bank 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.080
 and so ended up in a ditch 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.240
 everyone gets broken ado 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240
