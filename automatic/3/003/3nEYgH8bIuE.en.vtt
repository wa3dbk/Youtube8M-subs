00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.270 

I<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.079> surround<00:02:43.260> people<00:02:43.739> with<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.099> work

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
I like to surround people with the work

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.059 
I like to surround people with the work
so<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.239> they're<00:02:45.599> inside<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.530> peace<00:02:46.739> that

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
so that they're inside of the peace that

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.949 
so that they're inside of the peace that
there<00:02:47.220> was<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> walk<00:02:47.849> in<00:02:48.060> painting<00:02:48.599> or<00:02:48.659> a<00:02:48.750> walk

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
there was a walk in painting or a walk

there was a walk in painting or a walk

that separation minimal so it's hard to

that separation minimal so it's hard to

the conceptual artists I think I still

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.680 
the conceptual artists I think I still
