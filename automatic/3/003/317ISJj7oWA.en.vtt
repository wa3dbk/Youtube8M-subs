sucked up there if it was me he'll be
mentioning<00:07:47.240> it<00:07:47.360> after<00:07:47.870> the<00:07:47.990> game<00:07:48.139> but

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:49.180 
mentioning it after the game but

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.249 
mentioning it after the game but
fantastic<00:07:50.180> result<00:07:50.449> I<00:07:50.569> think<00:07:50.870> it<00:07:50.930> really<00:07:51.139> would

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:51.259 
fantastic result I think it really would

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:52.540 
fantastic result I think it really would
have<00:07:51.349> mattered<00:07:51.650> because<00:07:51.740> Taylor<00:07:52.220> took<00:07:52.400> the

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:52.550 
have mattered because Taylor took the

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.339 
have mattered because Taylor took the
mark<00:07:52.759> and<00:07:53.300> will<00:07:53.479> advise<00:07:53.690> the<00:07:53.930> clock<00:07:54.139> after

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:54.349 
mark and will advise the clock after

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:58.000 
mark and will advise the clock after
that<00:07:54.680> but<00:07:54.889> what<00:07:55.550> a<00:07:55.580> fantastic
