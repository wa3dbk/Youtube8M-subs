00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
all right so I just wanted to do a

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.080 
all right so I just wanted to do a
little<00:00:09.590> quick<00:00:09.950> tip<00:00:10.100> video<00:00:10.309> on<00:00:11.290> why<00:00:12.290> I<00:00:12.799> use<00:00:13.340> TTL

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
little quick tip video on why I use TTL

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.900 
little quick tip video on why I use TTL
flashes<00:00:14.750> and<00:00:14.990> TTL<00:00:15.469> triggers<00:00:15.889> when<00:00:16.190> I<00:00:16.520> almost

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
flashes and TTL triggers when I almost

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.710 
flashes and TTL triggers when I almost
exclusively<00:00:17.869> use<00:00:18.320> full<00:00:19.279> manual<00:00:19.699> when<00:00:20.359> doing

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
exclusively use full manual when doing

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.140 
exclusively use full manual when doing
flash<00:00:21.320> photography

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
flash photography

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.300 
flash photography
now<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.210> reason<00:00:23.810> is<00:00:23.960> because<00:00:24.169> I<00:00:24.410> use<00:00:24.800> Canon

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
now the reason is because I use Canon

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.749 
now the reason is because I use Canon
cameras<00:00:25.759> and<00:00:26.349> what<00:00:27.349> Canon<00:00:27.890> allows<00:00:28.220> you<00:00:28.429> to<00:00:28.609> do

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
cameras and what Canon allows you to do

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.960 
cameras and what Canon allows you to do
is<00:00:29.060> to<00:00:29.509> control<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:30.650> flash<00:00:30.890> power<00:00:31.220> and<00:00:31.640> a

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
is to control the the flash power and a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.990 
is to control the the flash power and a
lot<00:00:32.150> of<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:32.360> settings<00:00:32.630> from<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.050> back<00:00:33.200> ear

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
lot of the settings from the back ear

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.910 
lot of the settings from the back ear
LCD<00:00:35.000> screen<00:00:35.390> rather<00:00:35.720> than<00:00:35.870> going<00:00:36.380> to<00:00:36.680> each

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
LCD screen rather than going to each

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.150 
LCD screen rather than going to each
individual<00:00:38.350> flash<00:00:39.350> that<00:00:39.620> you<00:00:39.710> have<00:00:39.860> set<00:00:40.130> up

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
individual flash that you have set up

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.580 
individual flash that you have set up
and<00:00:40.520> changing<00:00:40.940> them<00:00:41.060> that<00:00:41.240> way<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.350> I'll<00:00:42.410> just

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
and changing them that way so I'll just

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.110 
and changing them that way so I'll just
give<00:00:43.160> you<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:43.280> quick<00:00:43.550> example<00:00:45.970> just<00:00:46.970> get

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
give you a quick example just get

Westcott apollo's they're not like the
typical<00:01:05.119> soft<00:01:05.659> boxes<00:01:06.140> where<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.680> lights<00:01:06.890> are

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
manual change my zoom will go to 70

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.119 
manual change my zoom will go to 70
don't<00:02:19.629> have<00:02:19.780> high-speed<00:02:20.290> sync<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.800> here<00:02:21.099> I

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
don't have high-speed sync on here I

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.500 
don't have high-speed sync on here I
don't<00:02:21.190> know<00:02:21.400> why<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.580> switched<00:02:21.879> up<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.390> we'll

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
don't know why it switched up but we'll

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.479 
don't know why it switched up but we'll
go<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:22.660> rear<00:02:22.900> curtain<00:02:23.170> just<00:02:23.830> popped<00:02:24.069> up<00:02:24.250> there

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
go to rear curtain just popped up there

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.150 
go to rear curtain just popped up there
and<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.989> really<00:02:26.680> really<00:02:26.800> useful

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
and this is the really really useful

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.690 
and this is the really really useful
part<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:29.290> typically<00:02:29.769> I<00:02:29.800> set<00:02:30.099> everything<00:02:30.220> up

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
part is typically I set everything up

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.880 
part is typically I set everything up
prior<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.209> sticking<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.989> into<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.410> softbox

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
prior to sticking it into the softbox

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.420 
prior to sticking it into the softbox
however<00:02:33.550> when<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.150> want<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.629> change<00:02:34.810> my<00:02:35.430> flash

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
however when I want to change my flash

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.100 
however when I want to change my flash
output<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:37.180> don't<00:02:37.630> want<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.840> change<00:02:38.019> my

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
output I don't want to change my

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.750 
output I don't want to change my
aperture<00:02:38.470> because<00:02:38.860> typically<00:02:39.250> I've<00:02:39.459> picked

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
aperture because typically I've picked

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.820 
aperture because typically I've picked
an<00:02:39.880> aperture<00:02:40.180> depth<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:41.080> field<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.530> want

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
an aperture depth of field that I want

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.330 
an aperture depth of field that I want
and<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.069> want<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.310> stick<00:02:42.610> with<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:44.340> we'll

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
and I want to stick with that so we'll

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.880 
and I want to stick with that so we'll
change<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:45.940> way<00:02:46.180> we'll<00:02:47.170> go<00:02:47.319> to<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.500> quarter

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
change it this way we'll go to a quarter

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.280 
change it this way we'll go to a quarter
and<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.849> can<00:02:49.060> see<00:02:49.239> it<00:02:49.360> changes<00:02:49.780> quarter<00:02:50.140> on

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
and you can see it changes quarter on

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.550 
and you can see it changes quarter on
there<00:02:50.730> now<00:02:51.730> if<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.720> my<00:02:52.840> main<00:02:53.049> light<00:02:53.319> let's

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
there now if this is my main light let's

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.080 
there now if this is my main light let's
say<00:02:53.680> my<00:02:53.830> main<00:02:53.980> lights<00:02:54.250> on<00:02:54.430> quarter<00:02:54.760> power<00:02:54.940> I

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
say my main lights on quarter power I

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.600 
say my main lights on quarter power I
want<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.599> use<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.750> fill<00:02:56.110> light<00:02:56.319> take<00:02:57.130> it<00:02:57.310> down<00:02:57.459> to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
want to use a fill light take it down to

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.930 
want to use a fill light take it down to
eight<00:02:57.760> when<00:02:58.510> you've<00:02:58.630> got<00:02:58.750> multiple<00:02:58.959> TTL

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
eight when you've got multiple TTL

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.250 
eight when you've got multiple TTL
flashes<00:03:00.940> set<00:03:01.150> up<00:03:01.299> you<00:03:01.450> can<00:03:01.630> put<00:03:02.019> them<00:03:02.140> in

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
flashes set up you can put them in

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.309 
flashes set up you can put them in
groups<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:02.910> then<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.030> could<00:03:04.239> go<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.420> group<00:03:04.780> B<00:03:05.019> for

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
groups so then I could go to group B for

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.729 
groups so then I could go to group B for
example<00:03:05.349> which<00:03:05.920> would<00:03:06.130> be<00:03:06.340> my<00:03:06.489> fill<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.739> then

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
example which would be my fill and then

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.039 
example which would be my fill and then
I<00:03:08.920> could<00:03:09.130> take<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.549> down<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.970> 1/8<00:03:10.360> for<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.780> stop

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
I could take that down to 1/8 for a stop

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.110 
I could take that down to 1/8 for a stop
lower<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.799> stop<00:03:12.099> slower<00:03:12.459> depending<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:13.000> what

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
lower to stop slower depending on what

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.360 
lower to stop slower depending on what
I'm<00:03:13.209> trying<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.569> do<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.769> switches<00:03:15.040> there

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
I'm trying to do and it switches there

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.240 
I'm trying to do and it switches there
and<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:16.569> can<00:03:16.750> do<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:16.989> for<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.260> third<00:03:17.590> light<00:03:17.890> and

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
and I can do that for a third light and

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.960 
and I can do that for a third light and
what-have-you<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.209> is<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:20.459> very<00:03:21.459> handy<00:03:21.880> to

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
what-have-you so is it very handy to

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.030 
what-have-you so is it very handy to
have<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.870> speeds<00:03:23.230> up<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.590> whole<00:03:23.739> process

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
have and it speeds up the whole process

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.080 
have and it speeds up the whole process
a<00:03:24.310> lot<00:03:24.639> better

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
a lot better

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.090 
a lot better
so<00:03:26.049> unfortunately<00:03:28.290> Nikon<00:03:29.290> doesn't<00:03:29.620> do<00:03:29.709> this<00:03:29.920> I

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
so unfortunately Nikon doesn't do this I

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.819 
so unfortunately Nikon doesn't do this I
don't<00:03:30.400> know<00:03:30.639> why<00:03:30.850> it's<00:03:31.470> something<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.560> think

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
don't know why it's something I think

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.460 
don't know why it's something I think
that<00:03:32.980> they<00:03:33.100> all<00:03:33.370> should<00:03:33.700> do<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.470> surprisingly

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
that they all should do and surprisingly

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.039 
that they all should do and surprisingly
a<00:03:35.560> lot<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.769> people<00:03:35.889> who<00:03:36.370> have<00:03:36.790> canons<00:03:37.540> don't

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
a lot of people who have canons don't

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.390 
a lot of people who have canons don't
realize<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.530> they<00:03:38.889> can<00:03:39.069> do<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:41.400> that's

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
realize that they can do this so that's

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.699 
realize that they can do this so that's
another<00:03:42.670> option<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.450> think<00:03:44.200> about<00:03:44.440> when

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
another option to think about when

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.879 
another option to think about when
purchasing<00:03:45.400> flashes<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.530> don't<00:03:47.530> rule<00:03:47.739> out

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
purchasing flashes is don't rule out

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.059 
purchasing flashes is don't rule out
ETTL<00:03:48.790> flashes<00:03:49.450> right<00:03:49.660> off<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.049> bat<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:50.530> think

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
ETTL flashes right off the bat so think

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.099 
ETTL flashes right off the bat so think
about<00:03:51.190> this<00:03:51.459> functionality<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.420> if<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:52.959> could

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
about this functionality and if it could

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.220 
about this functionality and if it could
serve<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:53.650> purpose<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:55.180> that's<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:56.019> quick

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
serve you a purpose so that's the quick

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.060 
serve you a purpose so that's the quick
tip<00:03:56.410> for<00:03:56.560> now<00:03:56.790> see<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:57.880> later
