 to better 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.119

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.199
 modest and of limited encumbrance not 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.949
 all on the floor some on shelves 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:33.260
 the chandelier army like balloons 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.350
 which is a mysterious and surely gas 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.860
 fetid made it vibrate in every corner 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.860
 of the House 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.270

 just direct is very unique 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.630
 international and also very metaphorical 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.310
 and almost a master and a student passing the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.399
 witness the life that continues here 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.300
 in short , a reason is not a small family 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.860
 bourgeois hello 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.660

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.729
 is told in the show indicates 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.110
 just this father, son and father 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.030
 he tries to be just as one said 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.300
 friend the things psychologists say 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.520
 the most blatant errors that it is 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.660
 can make a mistake to be 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.490
 friend be brother 6 father maybe not 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.070
 father master like there used to be but 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.700
 you have to be maybe not authoritarian but 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.200
 authoritative 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.000
 so here is this happy father looking for 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.910
 be nice 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.540
 friendly friend and makes disasters 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.610
 probably the child does not respond to 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.150
 monosyllables al is a conscious of 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.490
 today 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.560
 obviously and therefore dialogue is beautiful 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.560
 difficult and almost a monologue indeed 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.070
 continues in parliament the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.070
 debate for the revision of the porcellum 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.780
 according to experts, even the law 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.280
 Aztec electoral election which foresaw 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.340
 the election of a single deputy from 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.670
 simplifying the gods at every solstice is 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.790
 the most democratic of the porcellum 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.830
 its maker calderoli however not 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.910
 despair of being able to change it 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.910
 in Belgium 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.410
 the show takes up the book of 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.380
 I would say to the faithful seragli 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.010
 all 80 percent in the sense that they are there 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.860
 states of substantial cuts but 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:59.090
 I repeat not crazy that the book does not 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.739
 it was infinite for now reciting everything 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.660
 became the show too long and 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.209
 we love both me and the director of gallione 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.310
 we have fairly short shows 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.010
 synthetic and a single act lasts but we are 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.519
 20 honor no more would be nice dense 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.230
 desio 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.690
 so I repeat we cut a couple 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.200
 of chapters something of the book and in 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.180
 compensation we added though 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.790
 always agreeing with the greenhouse Michele 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.090
 pieces of michele serra taken from other i 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.519
 his types of subscribers that are things 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.010
 so the people know about it 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.100
 has been elected by tens of thousands of 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.840
 however many people know it for the 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.670
 brand on republic for satire 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.549
 preventive on the espresso here is that type 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.530
 of his writings which then were 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.450
 collected in books that these in 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.959
 particular in one called to tell me 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.400
 comical street we suffered from that 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.579
 from that book two or three moments 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.000
 where the father tries to give himself because the 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.829
 interview is very private and very 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.959
 homely that is almost like father and 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.640
 son in a room in a house instead 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.220
 we also liked to go outside and 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.200
 tell him for example to this child but 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.060
 on trying to get up from this 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.920
 damn sofa no longer lying down 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.030
 go out and see the world to participate 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.900
 of this society of this life 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.039
 political and social 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.660
 look what awaits you by opening the 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.900
 newspaper reads what it is 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.940
 would wait if he ever stood up elect 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.070
 of the disasters of things that so 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.870
 very satirical michele writes on the 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.530
 electoral law on things that happen 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.880
 on tax evaders on what 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.320
 probably what we know 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.750
 well short so they are very moments 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.449
 we have also entered codes for 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.639
 this reason and also for to do yes 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.130
 which then eventually closed them 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.419
 pieces is that maybe you're right you say 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.460
 the father to the son remains a while 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.470
 lying down in fact he will feel nichi a little there 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.330
 it would be a place where he does me 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.380
 so go crazy for me too from almost 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.830
 reason to the son smacks like alcohol e 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.979
 Alaskan 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.389
 we leave Friday morning and Saturday evening 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.770
 you are at home again to go out with yours 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.349
 friends 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.350
 what does school assault have to do with him? 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:11.220
 I ask your mother to please you 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.220
 they are not for me
