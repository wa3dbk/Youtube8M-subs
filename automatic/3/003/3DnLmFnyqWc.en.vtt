00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.300
 as a world first in the electric vehicle sector 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.020
 the bologna tata motor show presents this electric sign with the numbers 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.109
 very interesting such as 120 kilometers per hour of maximum speed 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:18.149
 acceleration from 0 to 60 kilometers per hour in less than 10 seconds autonomy 

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:22.050
 about 200 kilometers with a battery recharge 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.329
 normal table socket 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.899
 these are the most significant numbers of the typical electric 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.950
 developed in collaboration with millet curry volantinoweb ishunt 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.600
 which the nanny european technical center 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.040
 recently acquired 50.3% 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.240
 the Norwegian company that boasts cutting-edge technology and e 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.210
 specialized in the development of innovative solutions 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.160
 for electric propulsion 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.030
 will produce electric vehicles 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.010
 on products 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 the first model now ready for elam series production indicated life 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.879
 capable of carrying four passengers 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.170
 and the relative maraglio in absolute comfort respecting the environment 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.330
 and at an almost non-existent cost per kilometer 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.850
 considering that a complete recharge of the batteries 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.820
 culture - 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.470
 and a couple of liters of gasoline 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.750
 per la indica construction continuing on the path of innovation and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.700
 technology optimization 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.780
 nanny useful evening batteries 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.060
 you have super lithium polymers 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.030
 which guarantee greater energy density and longer duration than water 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.800
 get up and that currently 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.280
 they are used on electric vehicles 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.730
 higher range 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.950
 even the batteries will be produced directly 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.770
 but a brilliant one 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.539
 in the Nordic countries of course say bologna's motor show for motor reptiles if 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.759
 even for star life motor it is to find the professor torello cacciari 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.310
 Hello 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.310
 well found again this year at the motor show people 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.220
 it's always a pleasure for us, too, and the news this year because it hasn't 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.350
 counted informally 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.640
 that cahier some project with the two boys of itis belluzzi 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.530
 heidi do something with friends or never and you will be more than you know 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.119
 the myth specialized in this 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:17.859
 yes yes beautiful I finally found is a mechanical partner 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.839
 because I am a new electronic and electronic technician I know almost everything 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.919
 by mechanics instead a little problem is in fact I found this microbyte that 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.009
 have finally developed 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:34.319
 the god mechanical device even thinks about a device he had 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.199
 the attraction no front petals so you can take full advantage of the 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:43.679
 rear derailleur in order to make very demanding climbs 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:48.139
 and with this system that micropay ca brilliantly solved with gods 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.309
 very simple and cheap mechanical devices 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.429
 so you can apply any bike then 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:58.419
 if you go to the microbyte website and you will see this device that you don't 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.659
 it is an exaggerated cost south fins from a bicycle that works them well 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.239
 can mount this kite to transform your personal bicycle into a 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.019
 fantastic match means 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.529
 electric with which you can also go on tiÃ volo of access san luca 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:17.980
 that has a slope of 20% you can only one that without pedaling and get on 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.419
 without sweating 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.800
 and I know it when I see this interview 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.180
 the frightened face of his boys because they have mamamia be there ago 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.640
 work seriously then when it takes usually the plans with micro wait for 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.210
 the next women love at this point I guess yes certainly because now 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.760
 go I discovered this saying now I have to 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.789
 eternit I see if they are made available 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:45.859
 their me actor we will make a change because and they don't have yet 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.449
 made the electronic braking device i.e. exploit the engine 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:51.399
 electric 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.489
 the descent is braking downhill 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.399
 because I had to and I also sit up I don't want to waste energy 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:04.419
 Finmeccanica in Heat Emma should serve through the engine 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.349
 centering acts like a generator to recharge the batteries 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:14.169
 here this device is done very quietly by putting an engine in the 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.639
 front wheel 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.799
 the front wheel in the must there are mister wheels already made 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.110
 and bay designers that cost 50 euros 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.270
 you can replace hard on the main wheel 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.809
 on the front wheel 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.219
 and that of mind 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.219
 engine that will do the hanging 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:35.119
 clearly clear it will be an addition of a hair 5 6 pounds weighs 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:39.389
 the device however we say that this would be complete 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.749
 also electronic braking 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:44.550
 it is curious everything is relative relationship with your boys 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.139
 so because I saw him also equipped with a motor show of some 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.529
 year ago 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:55.079
 boys arrived while he was working with us with the news and trimoto 

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:59.419
 immediately professor professor is just from a person who is happy to find the 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:00.889
 his professor 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.379
 how do you think they will see this new perspective and kids in your class 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:10.479
 how do you think you will succeed in what time especially in this 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.999
 intent 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:16.259
 we hope to succeed by the end of the school year, certain as many 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.430
 are the commitments 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.039
 but if there's a bit of enthusiasm and I don't say in all the students mail 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.119
 good to have a good collaboration but to produce something 

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:30.559
 every year he and we are always doing something exciting 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:35.170
 I thank you for your motivation and for the motorshow 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.340
 and see you on the hotmail finger the interview for next year 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:42.870
 and how the next year's project went 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.199
 I will certainly show it to you 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.809
 and it will be a pleasure to thank you goodbye 

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:51.919
 professor giuliano cacciari itis belluzzi of poland motor leather goods 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:52.569
 news 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.199
 worldwide ad that opel brought that bologna motor show and this one 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.190
 zafira 1 point you are equipped with 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.570
 it is a turbo engine with methane. of this new opel zafira monovolume e 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.950
 of the German company of the general motors group that you own a 150 engine 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.690
 horses 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.710
 reaches a speed of 200 kilometers per hour with an acceleration 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.990
 from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.279
 in 11, 5 seconds 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:23.709
 consumes only five, 3 kilos of methane every 100 kilometers in the cycle 

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:29.349
 mixed emitting only 144 grams per kilometer tell us you 2 result e 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:34.409
 more power increased by 60% is only 6 grams more emission 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.060
 per kilometer compared to the version with motor 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.249
 aspirated 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:40.930
 the 1 point engine is tu ru gualco n 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.980
 It is designed to run on methane b or methane or any mixture 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.510
 of these two fuels for this purpose has been equipped with special pistons 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.129
 valve seat valves 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:57.789
 the car able to travel up to 390 6 kilometers with the only one 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:01.790
 methane feeding observatory contains a reserve 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.860
 of 14 liters of petrol 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.480
 and guarantees 150 kilometers more 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.789
 of autonomy 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:12.460
 for greater flexibility of use the maximum torque of this car of 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:18.490
 engine of this car and 210 help per meter absorbs 2300 rpm e 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.499
 ensures a high driving thrust in all situations 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.669
 we see here from opel zafira that visually 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:28.050
 it is practically the same and unchanged 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.669
 to the conventional one 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:33.949
 only the game you saw the back of the opening 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:38.389
 because this way we end up with the priceok roll off at hybrid4 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:40.090
 the bet to the number 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.159
 26 bologna electric motor yacht eagle motor show 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.440
 and we will do the number 27 episode of our program dedicated to the world of gods 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.340
 ecological vehicles still from here at the Bologna motor show but for the moment everything 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.889
 then 

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:53.430
 we can only greet you 

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.350
 that will wish you all a good week next week 

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.460
 always think of you 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.759
 hey this time thanks goodbye and good auction to all
