00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
up a B minor 7 arpeggio so B D F sharp a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
up a B minor 7 arpeggio so B D F sharp a
and<00:00:28.260> B<00:00:30.289> we're<00:00:31.289> gonna<00:00:31.380> slide<00:00:31.679> over<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.949> 12<00:00:32.430> on

and<00:01:57.720> then<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.049> did<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> example<00:01:58.740> was

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and then what I did in the example was

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.190 
and then what I did in the example was
just<00:01:59.340> moving<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.670> three<00:01:59.939> frets<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.390> D<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.020> do

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
just moving up three frets to D and do

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.999 
just moving up three frets to D and do
the<00:02:01.320> exact<00:02:01.590> same<00:02:01.619> lick<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:10.410> then<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.860> can

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the exact same lick and then you can

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.530 
the exact same lick and then you can
play<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.340> them<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.670> different<00:02:12.030> keys<00:02:12.330> and
