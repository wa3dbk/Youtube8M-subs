00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
think it's the most newbie class i could

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.990

concoct<00:00:15.500> out<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.890> other<00:00:17.010> ecology<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.730> mean

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
concoct out of the other ecology I mean

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.019 
concoct out of the other ecology I mean
that<00:00:18.180> could<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.449> added<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.840> a12<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:20.189> this

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that could have added the a12 but this

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.800 
that could have added the a12 but this
is<00:00:21.210> what<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.390> got<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:23.660> f2000<00:00:24.660> with

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
we now don't even know what they can

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.260 
we now don't even know what they can
manage<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.610> didn't<00:00:44.969> even<00:00:45.059> know<00:00:45.239> that

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
manage to do so I didn't even know that

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.670 
manage to do so I didn't even know that
they<00:00:45.510> couldn't<00:00:45.750> blow<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:46.020> those<00:00:46.170> claymores

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680

what did that guy didn't want to hit him

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.720 
what did that guy didn't want to hit him
because<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:50.370> f2000<00:00:51.239> has<00:00:51.329> no<00:00:51.510> range<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
because the f2000 has no range and I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.930 
because the f2000 has no range and I
expected<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.480> don't<00:00:54.840> know<00:00:55.370> I'm<00:00:56.370> not<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.879> to
