00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
sort of jam or foul because it is so

sort of jam or foul because it is so
filthy<00:01:03.489> that<00:01:04.140> said<00:01:05.939> I've<00:01:06.939> been<00:01:07.090> having<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.420> lot

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
filthy that said I've been having a lot

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.080 
filthy that said I've been having a lot
of<00:01:07.630> fun<00:01:07.810> with<00:01:07.960> this<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:09.040> is<00:01:09.549> by<00:01:09.670> no<00:01:09.729> means<00:01:09.820> a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
of fun with this it is by no means a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.760 
of fun with this it is by no means a
self-defense<00:01:10.540> weapon<00:01:10.960> I've<00:01:11.170> hardly<00:01:11.530> gotten

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
self-defense weapon I've hardly gotten

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.080 
self-defense weapon I've hardly gotten
through<00:01:12.010> six<00:01:12.250> rounds<00:01:12.549> about<00:01:12.640> having<00:01:12.909> some

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
through six rounds about having some

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.460 
through six rounds about having some
kind<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.330> jamming<00:01:13.689> or<00:01:13.810> fouling<00:01:13.990> but<00:01:14.260> I<00:01:14.290> think

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
kind of jamming or fouling but I think

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.929 
kind of jamming or fouling but I think
that<00:01:14.590> has<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.740> lot<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:15.130> do<00:01:15.280> with<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.549> caps<00:01:15.790> that

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
that has a lot to do with the caps that

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.670 
that has a lot to do with the caps that
I'm<00:01:16.060> using<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.509> think<00:01:17.229> they're<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.380> little<00:01:17.590> bit

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
I'm using I think they're a little bit

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.109 
I'm using I think they're a little bit
too<00:01:17.830> big<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.369> they<00:01:18.520> don't<00:01:18.700> fit<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:19.000> there

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
too big and they don't fit on there

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.020 
too big and they don't fit on there
properly<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:20.430> another<00:01:21.430> thing<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:21.820> the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
properly and another thing is the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.940 
properly and another thing is the
factory<00:01:22.570> nipples<00:01:22.960> are<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.200> little<00:01:23.439> bit<00:01:23.650> narrow

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
factory nipples are a little bit narrow

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.880 
factory nipples are a little bit narrow
on<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.189> inside<00:01:24.580> and<00:01:24.820> they<00:01:24.909> foul<00:01:25.180> quickly<00:01:25.890> so

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
on the inside and they foul quickly so

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.230 
on the inside and they foul quickly so
I've<00:01:27.220> been<00:01:27.340> looking<00:01:27.520> at<00:01:27.759> other<00:01:27.850> YouTube

ahead and just pop some off into the
lake<00:01:52.119> we're<00:01:52.930> not<00:01:53.020> in<00:01:53.110> danger<00:01:53.229> hurting<00:01:53.649> anybody

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.730 

and<00:02:04.420> got<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.450> hang<00:02:05.720> fire<00:02:05.960> just<00:02:06.409> going<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.590> hold

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
and got a hang fire just going to hold

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.410 
and got a hang fire just going to hold
on<00:02:06.890> for<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.159> minute<00:02:07.250> make<00:02:07.820> sure<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.030> doesn't<00:02:08.179> go

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
on for a minute make sure it doesn't go

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.320 
on for a minute make sure it doesn't go
and<00:02:08.690> again<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:09.590> think<00:02:09.740> that's<00:02:09.979> from<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.429> poorly

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
and again I think that's from the poorly

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.900 
and again I think that's from the poorly
fitting<00:02:11.720> nipples<00:02:12.130> or<00:02:13.130> I'm<00:02:13.310> sorry<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.580> poorly

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
fitting nipples or I'm sorry the poorly

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:30.550 
fitting nipples or I'm sorry the poorly
fitting<00:02:14.120> calves<00:02:28.900> we'll<00:02:29.900> just<00:02:30.080> hold<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.290> for

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
fitting calves we'll just hold that for

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.390 
fitting calves we'll just hold that for
a<00:02:30.620> couple<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:30.890> seconds

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
a couple of seconds

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.040 
a couple of seconds
this<00:02:31.610> thing<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.120> filthy<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.540> don't<00:02:32.840> think

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
this thing is so filthy I don't think

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.600 
this thing is so filthy I don't think
that<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.350> hammer<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.860> dropping<00:02:34.340> all<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.580> way

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
that the hammer is dropping all the way

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.270 
that the hammer is dropping all the way
down<00:02:34.910> onto<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:36.200> caps<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.830> caps<00:02:37.040> not

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
down onto the caps and the caps not

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.690 
down onto the caps and the caps not
fitting<00:02:37.670> just<00:02:38.390> kind<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.630> adding<00:02:38.930> up<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:39.700> not

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
fitting just kind of adding up to not

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.040 
fitting just kind of adding up to not
being<00:02:40.910> very<00:02:41.060> reliable<00:02:43.390> however<00:02:46.810> when<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.930> is

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
being very reliable however when it is

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.020 
being very reliable however when it is
working<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.680> can<00:02:49.220> tell<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.640> it's<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.850> lot

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
working I can tell you that it's a lot

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.660 
working I can tell you that it's a lot
of<00:02:50.060> fun<00:02:53.650> try<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.830> first<00:02:55.069> one<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:55.310> didn't<00:02:55.580> go

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
of fun try that first one that didn't go

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.309 
of fun try that first one that didn't go
off<00:02:55.700> again<00:02:57.220> there<00:02:58.220> now<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.750> cap<00:02:59.750> was<00:02:59.930> seated

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
off again there now the cap was seated

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.620 
off again there now the cap was seated
by<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.500> first<00:03:00.860> time<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.220> hammer<00:03:01.400> struck<00:03:01.790> it

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.270 

and<00:03:05.630> this<00:03:06.530> should<00:03:06.739> be<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.950> last<00:03:07.070> one

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
and this should be the last one

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.590 
and this should be the last one
hopefully<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.820> goes<00:03:07.940> off<00:03:10.090> there<00:03:11.090> we<00:03:11.209> go

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
hopefully it goes off there we go

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.569 
hopefully it goes off there we go
so<00:03:12.440> we<00:03:12.560> got<00:03:15.489> all<00:03:16.489> six<00:03:16.850> rounds<00:03:17.030> through<00:03:17.329> it

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
so we got all six rounds through it

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.550 
so we got all six rounds through it
overall<00:03:19.579> I<00:03:19.850> am<00:03:20.150> extremely<00:03:21.019> pleased<00:03:21.290> with<00:03:21.440> a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
overall I am extremely pleased with a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.370 
overall I am extremely pleased with a
gun<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:21.769> think<00:03:22.130> it<00:03:22.250> was<00:03:22.370> an<00:03:22.519> excellent<00:03:23.180> buy<00:03:23.959> for

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
gun I think it was an excellent buy for

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.920 
gun I think it was an excellent buy for
the<00:03:24.470> money<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:25.519> think<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.299> have<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.480> few<00:03:26.750> things

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
the money I think I have a few things

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.270 
the money I think I have a few things
that<00:03:27.109> I'm<00:03:27.200> going<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.380> do<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:27.859> make<00:03:28.070> it<00:03:28.100> a

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
that I'm going to do to it to make it a

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.759 
that I'm going to do to it to make it a
little<00:03:28.459> bit<00:03:28.640> more<00:03:28.820> reliable<00:03:29.560> one<00:03:30.560> of<00:03:30.650> which

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
little bit more reliable one of which

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.400 
little bit more reliable one of which
being<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.100> nipples<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.989> second<00:03:33.290> which

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
being the nipples and the second which

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.990 
being the nipples and the second which
being<00:03:33.739> experimenting<00:03:34.430> with<00:03:34.519> different<00:03:34.790> caps

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
being experimenting with different caps

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.020 
being experimenting with different caps
until<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.390> find<00:03:35.660> ones<00:03:35.840> that<00:03:35.989> I'm<00:03:36.079> happy<00:03:36.380> with

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
until I find ones that I'm happy with

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.750 
until I find ones that I'm happy with
but<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.180> was<00:03:38.359> 20<00:03:38.989> grains<00:03:39.380> of<00:03:39.739> pyro<00:03:40.489> Dex

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
but that was 20 grains of pyro Dex

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.690 
but that was 20 grains of pyro Dex
triple<00:03:41.660> FG<00:03:41.930> equivalent<00:03:42.440> it's<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.459> little<00:03:43.609> bit

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
triple FG equivalent it's a little bit

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.310 
triple FG equivalent it's a little bit
easier<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.090> get<00:03:44.329> here<00:03:44.510> in<00:03:44.600> California<00:03:45.170> than

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
easier to get here in California than

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.060 
easier to get here in California than
real<00:03:45.829> black<00:03:46.070> powder<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:47.530> those<00:03:48.530> were<00:03:48.680> CCI

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
little bit big for this but anyway if
