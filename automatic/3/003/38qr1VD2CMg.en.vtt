00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
there's a lot of deep things about Drake

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.490

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
or whatever his name is that needs to be

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.680 
or whatever his name is that needs to be
revealed<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.130> uncharted<00:03:41.400> for<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.510> is

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
revealed and uncharted for so that is

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.509 
revealed and uncharted for so that is
why<00:03:42.870> it's<00:03:43.230> pretty<00:03:43.380> obvious<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:43.890> uncharted<00:03:44.370> 4

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
why it's pretty obvious that uncharted 4

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.000 
why it's pretty obvious that uncharted 4
might<00:03:44.790> be<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.030> somewhat<00:03:45.690> sad<00:03:46.019> uncharted<00:03:46.709> or

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
might be a somewhat sad uncharted or

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.710 
might be a somewhat sad uncharted or
it's<00:03:47.160> gonna<00:03:47.250> be<00:03:47.400> much<00:03:47.580> deeper<00:03:47.910> than<00:03:48.299> any<00:03:48.510> other

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
it's gonna be much deeper than any other

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600 
it's gonna be much deeper than any other
Uncharted<00:03:49.200> we've<00:03:49.410> played<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:49.860> far<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.519> I

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
really can't wait so I'm really I'm

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.310 
really can't wait so I'm really I'm
gonna<00:03:53.640> be<00:03:53.790> really<00:03:54.060> upset<00:03:54.480> if<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:54.930> the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
gonna be really upset if this is the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.680 
gonna be really upset if this is the
last<00:03:55.470> uncharted<00:03:56.160> now<00:03:56.310> Naughty<00:03:56.549> Dog<00:03:56.820> didn't

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
last uncharted now Naughty Dog didn't

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.170 
last uncharted now Naughty Dog didn't
it's<00:03:58.170> not<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.470> 100%<00:03:58.680> there<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.519> no<00:03:59.700> 100%

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
it's not like 100% there is no 100%

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.810 
it's not like 100% there is no 100%
direct<00:04:01.110> evidence<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.459> last

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
direct evidence that this is the last

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
direct evidence that this is the last
uncharted<00:04:03.360> now<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.690> most<00:04:03.930> likely<00:04:04.049> will<00:04:04.500> be<00:04:04.680> but

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
uncharted now it most likely will be but

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.449 
uncharted now it most likely will be but
if<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.530> last<00:04:07.680> time<00:04:07.799> charted<00:04:08.220> I'm<00:04:08.310> gonna

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.340 
think I missed anything
oh<00:05:58.920> also<00:05:59.220> we<00:06:00.030> know<00:06:00.180> that<00:06:00.210> in<00:06:00.660> the<00:06:00.750> Uncharted<00:06:01.170> 4

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
oh also we know that in the Uncharted 4

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.520 
oh also we know that in the Uncharted 4
gameplay<00:06:02.480> we<00:06:03.480> know<00:06:03.630> that<00:06:03.810> that<00:06:03.990> takes<00:06:04.260> place

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
gameplay we know that that takes place

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.190 
gameplay we know that that takes place
in<00:06:04.890> South<00:06:05.400> Africa<00:06:06.060> because<00:06:06.450> of<00:06:06.600> the<00:06:06.690> accents

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
in South Africa because of the accents

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.990 
in South Africa because of the accents
of<00:06:07.290> the<00:06:07.350> enemies<00:06:07.800> now<00:06:08.010> in<00:06:08.310> that<00:06:08.520> part<00:06:08.760> of<00:06:08.820> the

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
of the enemies now in that part of the

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.400 
of the enemies now in that part of the
game<00:06:09.120> they<00:06:09.390> might<00:06:09.600> actually<00:06:09.840> not<00:06:10.140> be<00:06:10.200> in

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
game they might actually not be in

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.860 
game they might actually not be in
Madagascar<00:06:11.070> yet<00:06:11.250> there<00:06:11.670> might<00:06:11.910> be<00:06:11.940> because<00:06:12.750> I

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
Madagascar yet there might be because I

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.630 
Madagascar yet there might be because I
don't<00:06:13.020> think<00:06:13.200> Madagascar<00:06:13.920> is<00:06:14.040> considered

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
don't think Madagascar is considered

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.310 
don't think Madagascar is considered
part<00:06:14.880> of<00:06:15.060> Africa<00:06:15.480> I'm<00:06:15.630> pretty<00:06:15.840> sure<00:06:15.990> it's<00:06:16.140> just

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
part of Africa I'm pretty sure it's just

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.730 
part of Africa I'm pretty sure it's just
it's<00:06:16.440> own<00:06:16.650> separate<00:06:17.040> island<00:06:17.490> so<00:06:18.210> in<00:06:18.990> that<00:06:19.500> in

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
it's own separate island so in that in

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.740
