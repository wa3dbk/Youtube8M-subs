trying to make sure that they had as
little<00:00:32.180> money<00:00:32.390> as<00:00:32.540> possible<00:00:32.660> cool<00:00:34.630> and<00:00:35.630> that's

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
little money as possible cool and that's

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.270 
little money as possible cool and that's
it<00:00:35.960> I<00:00:36.110> mean<00:00:36.290> that<00:00:36.440> pretty<00:00:36.830> straightforward

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
it I mean that pretty straightforward

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.080 
it I mean that pretty straightforward
that<00:00:37.370> way<00:00:37.490> it's<00:00:37.640> pretty<00:00:37.760> straightforward

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
that way it's pretty straightforward

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.690 
that way it's pretty straightforward
like<00:00:38.930> if<00:00:39.260> your<00:00:39.950> opponent<00:00:40.160> doesn't<00:00:40.490> have

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
like if your opponent doesn't have

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.330 
like if your opponent doesn't have
credits<00:00:41.270> and<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:41.810> do<00:00:42.020> there's<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:42.980> good<00:00:43.100> chance

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
credits and you do there's a good chance

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.670 
credits and you do there's a good chance
you're<00:00:43.490> going<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.700> win<00:00:43.820> cool<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:44.590> did<00:00:45.590> you

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
you're going to win cool and did you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.380
