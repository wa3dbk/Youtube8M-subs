to<00:02:03.660> announce<00:02:03.900> cheese<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.680> then<00:02:05.340> my<00:02:05.700> yogurt<00:02:06.119> is

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
to announce cheese and then my yogurt is

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.749 
to announce cheese and then my yogurt is
chobani<00:02:06.869> greek<00:02:06.990> yogurt<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.429> doesn't<00:02:08.670> have

carbs<00:02:11.430> 15<00:02:11.820> grams<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.209> protein<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.810> get<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.560> at

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
carbs 15 grams of protein I get it at

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.750 
carbs 15 grams of protein I get it at
costco<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.100> think<00:02:14.310> they're<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> little<00:02:14.580> bit

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
costco I think they're a little bit

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.150 
costco I think they're a little bit
bigger<00:02:14.940> than<00:02:15.180> n<00:02:15.360> stores<00:02:15.989> like<00:02:16.620> eight<00:02:16.830> ounces

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
bigger than n stores like eight ounces

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.470 
bigger than n stores like eight ounces
instead<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.580> six<00:02:17.850> or<00:02:18.030> something<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.420> that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
instead of six or something like that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.699 
instead of six or something like that
and<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:20.420> yeah<00:02:21.420> just<00:02:21.959> think<00:02:22.140> healthy<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.680> can

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
and so yeah just think healthy you can

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.310 
and so yeah just think healthy you can
go<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> internals<00:02:23.820> or<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.989> know<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.140> want

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
really hard because most of the items in

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.160 
really hard because most of the items in
the<00:03:14.730> center<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.090> store<00:03:15.299> are<00:03:15.510> packaged<00:03:15.959> and
