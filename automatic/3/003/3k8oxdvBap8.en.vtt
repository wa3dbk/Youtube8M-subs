00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello everyone in this video we are going to 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.090
 learn to do the beat or the pace of 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.120
 samba guitar to accompany 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.860
 Brazilian samba music 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.340
 the rhythm that we are going to learn is a 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.439
 very basic basic pretty easy rhythm 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.970
 but it will allow us to accompany 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.509
 practically any samba that 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.509
 we want to play 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:34.930
 the first thing we're going to try to explain 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:37.000
 it's like the rhythmic base of the samba is 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.390
 it is subdivided 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.489
 four measures these four measures 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.680
 they always start with a strong blow 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.930
 which is what we give with the thumb in a 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.280
 of the thick fat strings of the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.559
 refrain guitar and then another 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.330
 is each one of those bars that at its 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.680
 once it is divided into four parts the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.980
 first as I say where you play 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.340
 always with the fat man and the other three 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.000
 they touch with the three fingers pulling on or 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.950
 well the first bonus the second of 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.690
 the third string or the second the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.180
 third and fourth 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:18.880
 the rhythm as I said are four 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.320
 bars 1 2 3 and 4 which in turn is 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:28.360
 uploaded in four parts 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:32.650
 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.230
 the rhythm of samba or the rhythmic basis of 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.610
 samba is achieved 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.680
 not touching all the parts of those 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.560
 four parts of which we have divided 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.290
 each compass is to say each of these 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.200
 four measures that we are going to learn 2 3 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.219
 and 4 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.020
 in each of them we will play a part 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.130
 of the compass so that we can make an idea 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.810
 let's do what I'm going to do 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.759
 a complete tour of the four 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.789
 bars so that you know where we are going to 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.789
 arrive 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.020
 i 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.569
 you can listen to the four measures that 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.569
 it's 23 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.299
 2. 3 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.129
 well I will go explaining one by one the 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.290
 first of the bars as we have seen 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.319
 let's do it a little more slowly 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.030
 would be touching the first of the parties 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.829
 that we are always going to touch that is the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.489
 refrain as we said with your finger 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.489
 thumb and the third in the say parts 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.880
 two 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.709
 the second measure would be playing the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.300
 thumb again but let's touch the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.319
 second and the fourth part besides the 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.319
 first would be 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.430
 and it is already 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.250
 the third compass we do exactly 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.460
 equal touching the second and the fourth 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.450
 part of the thumb 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.450
 perhaps 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.350
 two 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.530
 and it is already 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.740
 and the last one we will do as we have 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.920
 done the first by touching the thumb and the 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.370
 third part only is to say it would be 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.370
 something like that 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.920
 103 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.700
 together 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.700
 two 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.750
 let's do the first and the second to 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.610
 the time would be as we said the first 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.860
 it would be with the first and third part 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.940
 and the second with the first the second and 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.940
 the fourth is to say 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.819
 two 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.910
 lets try 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.350
 put the third measure below 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.209
 which is the same as the second with the 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.540
 second and the fourth part besides the 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.540
 thumb 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.710
 ah 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.720
 let's put at the end of the last measure 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.200
 and they 're going to try to do it all together 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.200
 would be 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.050
 this with a little more speed 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.410
 it sounds already at a samba rhythm it would sound 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.410
 something like that 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.130
 to make it a little better what 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.140
 they usually do what they usually do 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.780
 playing the guitar in this rhythm with 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.390
 this whipping is the first of those in the 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.250
 first compass dialing it by touching all the 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.390
 strings at the same time along with the staff 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.390
 it would sound something like that 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.520
 playing a little faster there's only 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.520
 something like that 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.710
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.510
 and do not forget to write to my channel and 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.970
 say that I like it if the video has 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.150
 liked and in the second part we will see 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.940
 how the notes changes are made how 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.200
 are the changes of notes within this 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.090
 whipped or this rhythm of samba 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.090
 thank you very much hello
