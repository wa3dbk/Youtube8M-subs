00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.760
 It is definitely nice in question 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.760
 animation quality no 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.220
 us always since it started in 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.340
 the animation production 'la en perÃº 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.560
 has been aimed at a quality level of 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.110
 international animation with this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.730
 movie we think we're going to 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.410
 enter any international market 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.350
 without any problem is what we expect 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.120
 obviously that can happen but 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.680
 the quality of animation and the kind of 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.830
 effects that are being done is what 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.120
 same as you see in blockbusters and 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.190
 the kind of effects speaking already 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.680
 specifically effects for example in 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.150
 this movie is doing but doing 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.860
 but it is one of the most complicated things 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.620
 that exists in the world of animation 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.200
 generated by computer we do not have a 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.580
 dog that has 20 million hairs that 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.220
 It's crazy has been a job 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.949
 tremendous to do the processing of that 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.290
 information is giant but the markets 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.760
 international organizations that demand that today in 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.850
 day if you take a movie where 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.260
 you have animals or you have humans without 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.580
 hair the international market does not 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.580
 Accept is a quality issue 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.159
 and 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.869
 directly is made from outside 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.539
 We are 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.670
 This is an export product that 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.710
 is going to be launched first in Peru but it is 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.409
 a product that has been made thinking 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.890
 in the international market more than in 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.890
 the market 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.330
 a product to export 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.260
 that's where we owe the big 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.260
 possibilities that they have 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.850
 what factors have made it possible for 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.200
 finish 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.360
 when we see each other making me peru 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.250
 I understand that the hand 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.760
 there's a story there's nothing in 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.760
 history 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.270
 this is the fifth movie of the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.219
 experience in a team of people who 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.219
 who knows who knows 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.080
 Y 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.670
 there is also a 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.830
 a group of people that can take us 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.860
 quality there is another issue also direct 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.630
 the technology is going to be cheaper 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.260
 then this and they are because they are each 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.319
 day more 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.959
 available for 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.569
 for the people that allow you to do 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.780
 that is happening 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.760
 today 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.270
 thanks to the digital theme is more can you 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.430
 make a high quality movie 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.430
 with relatively inexpensive equipment 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.000
 It is the first film signed in Paris 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.840
 that can be achieved only because 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.840
 we have 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.480
 that only what the factory 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.190
 place them on final pages and we attend 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.330
 lion animals 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.330
 and all that 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.099
 if we did live to do the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.099
 budgets 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:20.220
 in 2003 we started in 2005 and very 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.620
 few years and they are four movies 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.200
 premiered until 2009 premiered 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.340
 four feature films of 3d animation and 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.190
 if we see until the black of 2012 they are going to 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.230
 see 7 cg animation movies and how 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.269
 it's called in terms of viewers of 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.450
 cinema Peru has grown and now we are 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.740
 about 2 million 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.260
 two 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.260
 and that you feel in you 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.210
 that we have from behind 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.250
 let's say our references are the 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:58.140
 previous films that he has directed 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.260
 Eduardo then makes us 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.510
 our predictions are based on 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.140
 this industry growth 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.120
 there is more cinema penetration there is more 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.840
 rooms and by located in cities 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.270
 new there were not before then 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.269
 definitive organization 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.009
 what is the leader 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.009
 let's say in the production 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.830
 so 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.670
 where is the problem let's say 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.540
 they excluded 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.360
 what are 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.980
 I believe that one of the main two 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:41.360
 problems one get talent 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.800
 to be able to produce and the other is the 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.070
 size of the Peruvian market still 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.110
 you have a Peruvian market size that 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.970
 which makes us say that he does not recover his 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.010
 investment only in terror stores 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.530
 totally but you have to 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.050
 necessarily export it seems good 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.820
 The same is bad because it is more difficult 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.320
 wait for the investment but it's good 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.730
 because it demands you has a standard of 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:08.220
 animation that we say be class 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.720
 global and cared to pay 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.080
 What is missing for me? 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.080
 follow 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.569
 [Music] 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:35.190
 well you have several you have that is not 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:39.580
 that is not aimed at s 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.560
 for a more indirect public some 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.620
 messages sometimes 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.110
 complicated difficult or not is not 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.320
 looking to entertain 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:55.760
 you have that side on the other hand you have the 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:59.030
 animated film made in Peru is going to 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.970
 release between October and January in 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.000
 October 2011 to January 2012 in three 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:08.930
 animation movies produced by 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.140
 three different investors I do not speak 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.140
 which one 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.180
 it definitely gives you 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:19.340
 a guideline of what is of what 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.550
 was happening to the extent that 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.469
 there is enough quality and animation 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.599
 will take you to be recognized in the world 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:28.599
 is what this google can generate 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.460
 of that depends the food in the case the 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.840
 food is good has a quality 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.310
 international that is the offer 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.160
 exportable people travel 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.950
 come and see to come and eat the food 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.430
 Peruvian in the case of animation 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:48.430
 Peruvian would have what 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.670
 already there was some kind of milestone that makes 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:54.480
 that Peruvian animation stands out against 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.480
 the rest animations
