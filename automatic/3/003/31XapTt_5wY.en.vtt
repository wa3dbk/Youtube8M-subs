00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
actual layout which is the floor plan

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.080 
actual layout which is the floor plan
that<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.390> named<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.280> page<00:01:11.580> so

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that we named it so this is this page so

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.410 
that we named it so this is this page so
if<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.750> added<00:01:12.960> detailing<00:01:13.740> by<00:01:14.640> right-clicking

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
if we added detailing by right-clicking

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
if we added detailing by right-clicking
on<00:01:15.570> floor<00:01:15.869> plan<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.710> click<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:16.979> add

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
on floor plan and then click on add

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.810 
on floor plan and then click on add
detail<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:19.650> drag<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.220> rectangle<00:01:20.729> across

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
detail we just drag a rectangle across

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.109 
detail we just drag a rectangle across
and<00:01:22.070> then<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.310> our<00:01:23.430> drawings<00:01:23.759> will<00:01:23.909> pop<00:01:24.090> up

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and then all our drawings will pop up

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.890 
and then all our drawings will pop up
here<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.850> go<00:01:26.939> back<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.210> top<00:01:27.420> view<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
here so if we go back to top view and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.999 
here so if we go back to top view and
let's<00:01:28.860> say<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.220> move<00:01:30.110> all<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.560> drawings<00:01:31.890> up

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
let's say we move all the drawings up

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.940 
let's say we move all the drawings up
for<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> floor<00:01:32.430> plan<00:01:32.869> upwards<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> floor

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
for the floor plan upwards in the floor

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.539 
for the floor plan upwards in the floor
plan<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.400> also<00:01:35.670> moves<00:01:35.970> upward<00:01:36.390> up<00:01:36.630> upwards<00:01:37.549> so

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
plan it also moves upward up upwards so

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.850 
plan it also moves upward up upwards so
if<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.759> move<00:01:38.909> anything<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:40.259> actual

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
if you move anything in your actual

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.819 
if you move anything in your actual
Rhino<00:01:41.159> model<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.420> floor<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.320> layout<00:01:43.590> page

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
Rhino model the floor the layout page

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.609 
Rhino model the floor the layout page
will<00:01:44.009> also<00:01:44.250> move<00:01:44.840> another<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.380> is

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
will also move another way to do this is

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.469 
will also move another way to do this is
right-click<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.340> floor<00:01:47.549> plan<00:01:47.790> click<00:01:48.270> on

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
right-click on floor plan click on

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.990 
right-click on floor plan click on
enable<00:01:48.960> detail<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.710> then<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.549> will<00:01:50.700> ask<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
enable detail and then it will ask the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.420 
enable detail and then it will ask the
selected<00:01:51.360> detail<00:01:51.659> which<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:53.399> now

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
selected detail which is this one so now

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.780 
selected detail which is this one so now
our<00:01:53.579> detail<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.750> our<00:01:55.320> actual<00:01:56.130> model<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.579> now

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
our detail is our actual model is now

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.560 
our detail is our actual model is now
into<00:01:57.180> layout<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.860> now<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.219> manipulate

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
into layout so now I can manipulate

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.819 
into layout so now I can manipulate
without<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:00.840> back<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> top<00:02:01.380> view<00:02:01.619> so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
without going back to the top view so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.149 
without going back to the top view so
I'm<00:02:01.979> gonna<00:02:02.070> turn<00:02:02.159> off<00:02:02.310> my<00:02:02.490> grid<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.890> from<00:02:04.890> here

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
I'm gonna turn off my grid and from here

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.389 
I'm gonna turn off my grid and from here
we<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.149> move<00:02:06.390> things<00:02:06.570> around<00:02:07.069> just<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
we can move things around just like the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.609 
we can move things around just like the
top<00:02:08.610> view<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.959> top<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.440> also

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
top view and if you go to top it's also

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.540 
top view and if you go to top it's also
moved

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
moved

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.910 
moved
so<00:02:13.120> I'm<00:02:13.210> going<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.480> do<00:02:13.540> now<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:14.020> I'm<00:02:14.260> going<00:02:14.560> to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
so I'm going to do now is I'm going to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.940 
so I'm going to do now is I'm going to
enable<00:02:15.910> page<00:02:16.330> or<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.870> it's<00:02:17.140> now<00:02:17.440> back<00:02:17.740> to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
enable page or so be it's now back to

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.840 
enable page or so be it's now back to
the<00:02:18.190> layout<00:02:18.460> page<00:02:18.700> go<00:02:19.480> back<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.780> top<00:02:19.990> view<00:02:20.290> and

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
the layout page go back to top view and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.550 
the layout page go back to top view and
to<00:02:21.850> create<00:02:22.120> line<00:02:22.300> weights<00:02:22.570> I'm<00:02:22.840> going<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.440> add

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
to create line weights I'm going to add

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.250 
to create line weights I'm going to add
a<00:02:23.590> new<00:02:23.800> layer<00:02:24.570> I'm<00:02:25.570> just<00:02:25.870> going<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.020> call<00:02:26.200> it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
a new layer I'm just going to call it

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.920 
a new layer I'm just going to call it
line<00:02:26.500> zero<00:02:26.770> one<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.390> I'm<00:02:28.390> going<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.600> move<00:02:28.750> this

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
line zero one and I'm going to move this

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.740 
line zero one and I'm going to move this
section<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.520> floor<00:02:30.880> plan<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:31.480> layer

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
section of the floor plan to that layer

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.280 
section of the floor plan to that layer
and<00:02:32.700> if<00:02:33.700> we're<00:02:33.850> print<00:02:34.150> width<00:02:34.330> if<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.020> click<00:02:35.200> on

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
and if we're print width if you click on

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.470 
and if we're print width if you click on
default<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:36.580> can<00:02:36.610> actually<00:02:36.970> print<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
default you can actually print the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.720 
default you can actually print the
select<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.290> width<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.680> want<00:02:38.950> for<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.580> line

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
select the width you want for the line

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.440 
select the width you want for the line
so<00:02:40.120> if<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.690> just<00:02:40.870> pick<00:02:41.290> point<00:02:41.860> three<00:02:42.300> you're<00:02:43.300> not

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
so if I just pick point three you're not

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.300 
so if I just pick point three you're not
going<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.660> see<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.990> actual<00:02:44.350> change<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.190> the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
going to see the actual change in the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.450 
going to see the actual change in the
lines<00:02:45.550> until<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.510> print<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:48.160> I'm<00:02:48.280> going<00:02:48.370> to

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
lines until you print it so I'm going to

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.050 
lines until you print it so I'm going to
move<00:02:48.580> this<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.130> on<00:02:51.220> top<00:02:51.400> of<00:02:51.430> my<00:02:51.790> floor

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
move this so it's on top of my floor

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.970 
move this so it's on top of my floor
plan<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.540> now<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.720> two<00:02:55.990> are<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.560> top<00:02:56.740> of<00:02:56.860> each

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
plan so now the two are on top of each

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.920 
plan so now the two are on top of each
other<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.980> section<00:03:00.580> is<00:03:00.670> 0.3<00:03:01.480> print<00:03:01.780> width

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
other and the section is 0.3 print width

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.320 
other and the section is 0.3 print width
and<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.830> actually<00:03:02.980> know<00:03:03.310> what<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.760> sides<00:03:04.000> of

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
and to actually know what the sides of

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.410 
and to actually know what the sides of
the<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:05.560> lines<00:03:05.830> are<00:03:06.070> I<00:03:06.400> suggest<00:03:07.240> you<00:03:07.330> guys

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
the the lines are I suggest you guys

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.080 
the the lines are I suggest you guys
just<00:03:07.690> make<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.530> rhino<00:03:09.250> file<00:03:09.490> with<00:03:09.670> just<00:03:09.850> lines

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
just make a a rhino file with just lines

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.690 
just make a a rhino file with just lines
doing<00:03:10.600> layout<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.320> then<00:03:11.500> print<00:03:11.800> print<00:03:12.550> that

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
doing layout and then print print that

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.630 
doing layout and then print print that
page<00:03:12.970> out<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.420> guys<00:03:13.630> know<00:03:13.900> which<00:03:14.260> line<00:03:15.190> of

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
page out so you guys know which line of

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.150 
page out so you guys know which line of
print<00:03:16.570> with<00:03:16.720> matches<00:03:17.530> with<00:03:17.650> what<00:03:17.740> because

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
print with matches with what because

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.180 
print with matches with what because
point<00:03:18.459> three<00:03:19.150> could<00:03:19.450> be<00:03:19.540> really<00:03:19.959> big<00:03:20.190> counting

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
point three could be really big counting

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.370 
point three could be really big counting
on<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.580> size<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:22.000> your<00:03:22.150> drawing<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:23.170> we'll<00:03:23.290> go

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
on the size of your drawing so we'll go

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.160 
on the size of your drawing so we'll go
back<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.650> floor<00:03:23.860> plan<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:25.570> scale<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:25.990> to

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
back to floor plan and to scale this to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.170 
back to floor plan and to scale this to
the<00:03:26.260> correct<00:03:26.530> scale<00:03:26.800> let's<00:03:27.100> say<00:03:27.190> be<00:03:27.370> 1/8<00:03:27.790> scale

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
the correct scale let's say be 1/8 scale

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.280 
the correct scale let's say be 1/8 scale
floor<00:03:28.810> plan

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
floor plan

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.020 
floor plan
well<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:29.980> click<00:03:30.190> on<00:03:30.310> floor<00:03:30.550> plan<00:03:30.760> the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
well the click on floor plan the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.160 
well the click on floor plan the
top-left<00:03:31.900> corner<00:03:32.250> click<00:03:33.250> on<00:03:33.370> scale<00:03:33.610> detail

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
top-left corner click on scale detail

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.620 
top-left corner click on scale detail
select<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.260> detail<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.620> want<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:35.860> scale<00:03:36.070> and

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
select the detail you want to scale and

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.140 
select the detail you want to scale and
then<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:38.140> distance<00:03:38.560> on<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:38.830> page<00:03:39.430> by<00:03:40.090> default

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
then the distance on the page by default

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.540 
then the distance on the page by default
one<00:03:40.750> so<00:03:40.959> it's<00:03:41.110> fine<00:03:41.320> it<00:03:41.860> will<00:03:41.980> say<00:03:42.130> one<00:03:42.310> inch<00:03:42.459> on

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
one so it's fine it will say one inch on

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.150 
one so it's fine it will say one inch on
the<00:03:42.670> page<00:03:42.880> equals<00:03:43.180> how<00:03:43.840> much<00:03:44.020> distance<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:44.680> the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
the page equals how much distance in the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.740 
the page equals how much distance in the
model<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:46.120> if<00:03:46.240> you<00:03:46.300> want<00:03:46.480> an<00:03:46.540> eighth<00:03:46.720> inch

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
model so if you want an eighth inch

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.190 
model so if you want an eighth inch
scale<00:03:47.440> we'll<00:03:47.770> just<00:03:47.920> type<00:03:48.070> in<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.370> feet<00:03:49.050> so<00:03:50.050> those

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
scale we'll just type in a feet so those

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.980 
scale we'll just type in a feet so those
are<00:03:50.440> our<00:03:50.650> scale<00:03:51.580> drawing<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.690> move<00:03:52.870> it

and then pick enable page so here's our
floor<00:04:05.920> plan<00:04:06.100> we<00:04:06.640> can<00:04:06.760> also<00:04:06.910> add<00:04:07.150> in<00:04:07.180> text<00:04:07.450> by

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
floor plan we can also add in text by

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.390 
floor plan we can also add in text by
using<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.900> text<00:04:11.290> tool<00:04:11.470> under<00:04:12.070> dimensions

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
using the the text tool under dimensions

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.070 
using the the text tool under dimensions
or<00:04:13.560> using<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:15.070> actual<00:04:15.370> text<00:04:15.910> command<00:04:16.299> in<00:04:16.600> text

object<00:04:18.690> so<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:21.160> dimension<00:04:21.640> things<00:04:21.850> if<00:04:22.120> I

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
object so to to dimension things if I

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.590 
object so to to dimension things if I
dimension<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.440> on<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:24.460> layout<00:04:24.760> page

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
dimension it on the layout page

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.570 
dimension it on the layout page
it's<00:04:26.110> going<00:04:26.290> to<00:04:26.380> say<00:04:26.470> 2.75<00:04:27.870> inches<00:04:28.870> or<00:04:29.140> or<00:04:29.830> feet

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
it's going to say 2.75 inches or or feet

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.890 
it's going to say 2.75 inches or or feet
I<00:04:30.730> don't<00:04:30.970> know<00:04:31.060> actually<00:04:31.300> don't<00:04:31.630> know<00:04:31.720> what

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
I don't know actually don't know what

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.930 
I don't know actually don't know what
the<00:04:31.990> dimensions<00:04:32.380> are<00:04:32.620> related<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:33.100> but<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:33.850> get

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
the dimensions are related to but to get

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.710 
the dimensions are related to but to get
to<00:04:34.180> correct<00:04:34.950> dimensions<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:37.360> would<00:04:37.510> just

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
to correct dimensions you would just

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.780 
to correct dimensions you would just
dimension<00:04:38.410> in<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.650> actual<00:04:38.950> Rhino<00:04:39.220> model<00:04:39.610> so

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
dimension in the actual Rhino model so

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.600 
dimension in the actual Rhino model so
let's<00:04:39.940> say<00:04:40.060> 22<00:04:40.480> feet<00:04:41.010> so<00:04:42.010> if<00:04:42.160> you<00:04:42.280> go<00:04:42.370> back<00:04:42.520> to

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
let's say 22 feet so if you go back to

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.320 
let's say 22 feet so if you go back to
floorplan

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
floorplan

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.080 
floorplan
it<00:04:43.570> says<00:04:43.780> 22<00:04:44.230> feet<00:04:44.700> so<00:04:45.700> that's<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:45.940> correct

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
it says 22 feet so that's the correct

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.000 
it says 22 feet so that's the correct
way<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.270> dimension<00:04:46.750> things<00:04:47.170> always<00:04:47.440> do<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.860> in

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
way to dimension things always do it in

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.260 
way to dimension things always do it in
your<00:04:48.160> model<00:04:48.930> never<00:04:49.930> do<00:04:50.140> it<00:04:50.260> on<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.710> page<00:04:50.950> so<00:04:51.280> if

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
your model never do it on the page so if

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.180 
your model never do it on the page so if
you<00:04:52.360> want<00:04:52.510> elevations<00:04:53.080> now<00:04:53.290> we<00:04:53.860> can<00:04:54.010> either

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
you want elevations now we can either

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.710 
you want elevations now we can either

up<00:05:03.840> add<00:05:05.250> detail<00:05:06.480> and<00:05:08.220> then<00:05:09.240> we<00:05:10.240> need<00:05:10.450> to<00:05:10.600> enable

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
up add detail and then we need to enable

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.130 
up add detail and then we need to enable
the<00:05:11.110> detail<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:12.000> then<00:05:13.000> we'll<00:05:13.150> move<00:05:13.360> it<00:05:13.510> in

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.040 

we'll<00:05:17.140> move<00:05:17.290> this<00:05:17.470> out<00:05:17.770> of<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.890> way<00:05:19.020> do<00:05:20.020> not

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
we'll move this out of the way do not

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.660 
we'll move this out of the way do not
move<00:05:20.350> your<00:05:20.410> floor<00:05:20.830> plan<00:05:20.860> since<00:05:21.280> your<00:05:21.430> floor

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
move your floor plan since your floor

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.730 
move your floor plan since your floor
plan<00:05:21.880> is<00:05:22.210> in<00:05:22.600> relationship<00:05:23.170> to<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:26.500> floor

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
plan is in relationship to the the floor

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.070 

so<00:05:42.370> your<00:05:42.520> for<00:05:42.699> plan<00:05:42.910> whatever<00:05:43.120> it<00:05:43.419> is<00:05:43.539> will

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
so your for plan whatever it is will

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.800 
so your for plan whatever it is will
stay<00:05:44.350> there<00:05:44.560> because<00:05:44.949> now<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.610> layout<00:05:46.060> floor

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
details scale one inch you go so eight

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.029 
details scale one inch you go so eight
feet<00:06:09.220> so<00:06:09.940> now<00:06:10.060> that's<00:06:10.240> the<00:06:10.389> scale<00:06:10.750> so<00:06:11.560> we<00:06:11.949> go

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
feet so now that's the scale so we go

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.570 
feet so now that's the scale so we go
back<00:06:12.220> to<00:06:12.340> top<00:06:12.520> view<00:06:12.550> and<00:06:14.009> we<00:06:15.009> can<00:06:15.160> move<00:06:15.340> this

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
back to top view and we can move this

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.650 
back to top view and we can move this
around<00:06:17.160> go<00:06:18.160> back<00:06:18.340> to<00:06:18.430> elevations<00:06:19.000> and<00:06:19.240> it's

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
around go back to elevations and it's

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.110 
around go back to elevations and it's
moved<00:06:19.930> around<00:06:20.169> and<00:06:21.070> we<00:06:21.430> can<00:06:21.580> also<00:06:21.729> do<00:06:21.880> the<00:06:21.970> same

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
moved around and we can also do the same

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.760 
moved around and we can also do the same
thing<00:06:22.180> adding<00:06:23.080> in<00:06:23.289> dimension<00:06:23.860> lines<00:06:24.039> and<00:06:25.770> and

drawings you can also go in and change
each<00:06:32.259> line<00:06:32.560> to<00:06:32.800> a<00:06:32.889> line<00:06:32.979> weight<00:06:33.340> that<00:06:33.520> you

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
each line to a line weight that you

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.430 
each line to a line weight that you
specifically<00:06:34.150> want<00:06:34.419> just<00:06:34.690> remember<00:06:34.750> to<00:06:35.409> put
