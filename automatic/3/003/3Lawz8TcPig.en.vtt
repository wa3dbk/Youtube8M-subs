00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.336
 Here is the Prado Art Museum in Madrid, we are looking at the black paintings of Goya (seeking professional terminology) 

00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:11.440
 Yeah, there is a whole room here. 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.959
 Goya originally painted these paintings to decorate his home in the suburbs of Madrid. 

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:21.527
 These paintings were originally painted on the wall. What we are seeing now is one of the most shocking ones. 

00:00:21.527 --> 00:00:26.102
 Satan, sometimes called the Satan food. 

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:31.144
 There are prophecies that a certain son of Satan will dethrone him. 

00:00:31.144 --> 00:00:40.464
 Satan is the god of time. So in order to prevent the prophecy from happening, his son will be eaten when he is born. 

00:00:40.464 --> 00:00:45.734
 But one child escaped, Jupiter. So, in the end, Satan was deposed. 

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:52.019
 He finally failed to escape the fate of the arrangement. In fact, some people say that it is because he tried to stop the prophecy. 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.100
 It led to the realization of the prophecy. So this is a horrible story in the most terrible way. 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.737
 And this also implies what we are thinking about at the time. 

00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:13.586
 With regard to power, and in order to retain power, how do they treat their children and how to treat themselves. 

00:01:13.586 --> 00:01:19.392
 Goya witnessed the Spanish regime and the Spanish monarchy ruining the country. 

00:01:19.392 --> 00:01:22.792
 Then he also witnessed Napoleon’s army smashing the country. 

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:26.951
 And the destruction of the country after the monarchy revolution 

00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:32.726
 So the reincarnation of this fate, this is for itself 

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:33.918
 For their own offspring 

00:01:33.918 --> 00:01:40.323
 And in the form of prophecy, it is still presented in the most distinctive form, and I can't think of anything more powerful than this. 

00:01:40.323 --> 00:01:44.728
 On the one hand, I saw Satan’s bulging eyes and his clenched hands. 

00:01:44.728 --> 00:01:53.639
 There are also some mad (desperate) gestures, which seem to say "I can't lose my power." 

00:01:53.639 --> 00:02:01.825
 But on the other hand, I think he knows he has to do this, and he knows how terrible it is. 

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:10.788
 I also know that we must adopt this crazy, frantic, and intractable way to do it. As Goya portrays, Satan is almost melted in the painting. 

00:02:11.357 --> 00:02:19.750
 Of course you can see his basic outline, but look at his right elbow and the skin is almost twisted together. 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.764
 His forearm is almost dissolved. His shoulders began to melt 

00:02:24.764 --> 00:02:28.444
 I can also see his thighs being wrapped in the dark. 

00:02:28.444 --> 00:02:33.678
 But they are not like part of the body of Satan, and we can see his left hip again. 

00:02:33.678 --> 00:02:39.258
 So, just use such a way that he is becoming fragmented to express his madness. 

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:43.632
 And this is also a manifestation of the body 

00:02:43.632 --> 00:02:52.160
 Expressing the violence, physicality and its grotesque way in the flesh 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.047
 I think the word body is right. 

00:02:55.047 --> 00:03:01.125
 Something on his body looks like meat, like the meat being slaughtered. 

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:04.973
 At the same time he is also slaughtering and then eating his own son. 

00:03:04.973 --> 00:03:11.321
 This is what Goya saw. This is the portrayal of the world in Goya’s eyes. 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.494
 There is also the human nature he believes, and the consequences of human performance.
