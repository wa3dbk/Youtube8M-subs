00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello Hello everyone I hope you 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.609
 find very well and as they are 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.379
 I had promised I'm going to tell you about the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.690
 clinique products that been using 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.049
 and I really have been working 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.509
 I did not believe that they were going to 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.090
 work as well as they have been 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.449
 doing and these products I use it in the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.279
 morning and at night before going to bed 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.800
 the first thing I use is the cleaner 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.480
 what is this that is here and the first thing 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.289
 What I do is wash my face with water 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.750
 warm and then I grab just grabbed once 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.399
 to the cleaner rice and clean me or 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.309
 put it all over your face and start to 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.879
 do as little bubbles and then I 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.020
 I play the face with water with cold water and 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.140
 this causes the pores to clog 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.740
 and since I know that face with it with my 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.810
 towel very well I wear the toner 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.970
 which is step number 2 which is this that 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.360
 is here and see that almost has not been 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.879
 finished I thought that in six weeks I 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.850
 I was going to finish it but I do not have six 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.680
 weeks and does not even reach half 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.390
 and in the way that the 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.479
 tonifier is what he grabbed in a 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.550
 sponge as it is and I apply it 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.619
 giving me a little light touch like that 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.080
 the entire face and this helps it 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.270
 close the pores 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.170
 then he applied step 3 which is 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.840
 the moisturizer 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.250
 and if you can see here, see that neither has 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.460
 finished either 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.130
 I thought that six weeks later I thought 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.550
 that maybe he was going to arrive as almost 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.770
 in half or less than half and those 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.930
 are the three steps used to 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.190
 clean my face I have not used in any 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.190
 another product nothing nothing or been using 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.500
 cream for which they put me the one 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.210
 ointment that is called since I got the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.390
 I put in all the granites that I had 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.390
 She is wearing nothing but nothing for the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.979
 acne only these products because 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.080
 I wanted to see if they were really going to 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.690
 work and if the cns if they have done 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.200
 but these products is like for the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.290
 hygiene for cleaning the face but 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.709
 It is not a treatment for acne but 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.870
 yes it has worked for me for acne 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.900
 although if you have left one that others 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.180
 but I have not gotten so many common 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.920
 as I was telling you that I was dating 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.440
 I'm going to put the video here 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.900
 from when I was leaving many 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.340
 crimes so that they see that it has 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.340
 there was a big difference 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.480
 clint and also has a treatment that 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.000
 if you focus more on acne and it's this 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.950
 that is here and this I am not 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.349
 using this term is the one that is 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.510
 using this one already leads I think like three 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.900
 weeks using it and he has also noticed 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.540
 a big difference has not come out 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.379
 So many granites is more until they have their 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.569
 more lawful expensive but if it's all 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.849
 you keep using every day is 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.109
 recommended therefore twice a day for 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.349
 I think it's also for six weeks 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.659
 to notice the difference but he takes 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.639
 three weeks and you have noticed that you no longer 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.349
 So many pimples have been coming out and I 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.930
 I have noticed that his face is seen more 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.959
 visit but if you started to resect a 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.659
 little face so it's no longer used two 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.590
 times a day and at most he uses it as a 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:53.500
 once a day at night and this 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.960
 treatment comes with a cleanser 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.110
 also and this is the cleaner 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.440
 and it comes out like a mus 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.050
 and since the same is compost face 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.630
 Apply the cleaner then rinse it 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.850
 one the face and then the 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.490
 tonifier and that toned one has 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.500
 that beat before you put it on it did not 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.570
 the sponge and the toner is applied 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.030
 giving light touches throughout 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.859
 the face and then one step is applied 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.190
 number 3 which is this one that is like the 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.190
 cream 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.770
 and this focuses more on acne because 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.810
 this is a treatment for acne 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.360
 the one I'm using is not a 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.970
 treatment for acne but if it has 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.280
 helped for acne if it has helped me 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.980
 that has removed these black dots 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.870
 that I had in my nose and I have not been 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.360
 been gone so many grains because I 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.520
 they were coming out great so very 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.190
 big and like they were buried 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.080
 inwards and if one has come out that 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.080
 another but they have been very well 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.520
 and they are like targets and at the moment of 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.350
 wash my face instead until I 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.450
 burst 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.170
 but the truth is that if I recommend 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.690
 this trio of the clinic because it has 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.730
 worked wonderfully but for the 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.920
 people who have a lot more nest than 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.230
 this one is coming out a lot here and I 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.260
 I would recommend this which is the treatment 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.610
 of clinique and this one focuses more on the 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.069
 acne 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.930
 I did not like this but as myself 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.629
 only what has already been used and continues 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.719
 working well I think that if 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:34.180
 it works I want to thank all the 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:36.189
 people who have been subscribing 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.460

 thank you all and lately there was no 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.139
 had so much time to upload videos 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.780
 because I have been working and 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.689
 I also had to take some tests and 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.789
 I had to study for those exams 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:53.710
 another little thing also another reason why 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.680
 why I have not done video will be because 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.830
 I get sick with the flu and the truth is 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.849

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:06.849
