00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the quality of the writing to explain

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.060

what happened so so as a by part of that

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.089 
what happened so so as a by part of that
the<00:02:06.420> quality<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.140> writing<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
the quality of the writing is it the

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.770 
the quality of the writing is it the
arcs<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> characters<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
arcs of the characters and the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
arcs of the characters and the
storylines<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.379> be<00:02:10.440> much<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.310> could<00:02:11.459> be

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
storylines can be much you know could be

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.990 
storylines can be much you know could be
lengthened<00:02:11.849> out<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.180> much<00:02:12.330> more<00:02:12.450> subtle

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
lengthened out and much more subtle

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.780 
lengthened out and much more subtle
and<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.900> feels<00:02:14.170> more<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.770> 13<00:02:15.340> hour<00:02:15.430> movie

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
and it feels more like a 13 hour movie

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.370 
and it feels more like a 13 hour movie
and<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.270> think<00:02:16.450> comic<00:02:16.690> book<00:02:16.810> characters<00:02:17.170> lend

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
and you think comic book characters lend

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.570 
and you think comic book characters lend
themselves<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:17.830> kind<00:02:18.100> of<00:02:18.160> format<00:02:18.460> as

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
themselves to that kind of format as

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.680 
themselves to that kind of format as
well<00:02:18.670> because<00:02:18.820> we've<00:02:18.940> not<00:02:19.030> really<00:02:19.270> seen<00:02:19.360> it

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
well because we've not really seen it

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.140 
well because we've not really seen it
done<00:02:20.080> before<00:02:20.110> like<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.830> yeah<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.490> certainly

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
done before like that yeah I I certainly

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.690 
done before like that yeah I I certainly
think<00:02:22.420> some<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.690> them<00:02:22.780> do<00:02:22.930> I'm<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:24.070> one<00:02:24.490> things

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
think some of them do I'm the one things

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.190 
think some of them do I'm the one things

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
wonderful job was dead I well I think if

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.740 
wonderful job was dead I well I think if
you<00:04:32.740> if<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:33.220> if<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.699> watch<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:34.150> film<00:04:34.330> and

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
you if you if you watch that film and

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.839 
you if you if you watch that film and
you<00:04:35.110> think<00:04:35.410> of<00:04:35.530> him<00:04:35.650> as<00:04:35.770> Matt<00:04:35.949> Matt<00:04:36.490> Murdock<00:04:36.759> as

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
you think of him as Matt Matt Murdock as

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.249 
you think of him as Matt Matt Murdock as
you<00:04:36.940> do<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.090> think<00:04:37.210> he<00:04:37.389> did<00:04:37.569> I<00:04:37.810> think<00:04:38.080> he<00:04:38.139> did

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
you do I think he did I think he did

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:42.450 
you do I think he did I think he did
brilliantly<00:04:38.380> I<00:04:38.770> think<00:04:39.250> that<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:41.770> difficulty

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
brilliantly I think that the difficulty

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.279 
brilliantly I think that the difficulty
that<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.729> film<00:04:42.940> had<00:04:43.210> if<00:04:43.389> I'm<00:04:43.569> if<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:43.900> may<00:04:44.080> say<00:04:44.259> so

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
that the film had if I'm if I may say so

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.140 
that the film had if I'm if I may say so
is<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:45.310> when<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.580> get<00:04:45.729> to<00:04:45.910> know<00:04:46.030> the

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
is that that when you get to know the

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.909 
is that that when you get to know the
source<00:04:46.360> material<00:04:46.840> as<00:04:46.990> in<00:04:47.349> the<00:04:47.440> comic<00:04:47.740> books

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
source material as in the comic books

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.520 
source material as in the comic books
you<00:04:48.360> realize<00:04:49.360> that<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.930> dead<00:04:50.139> of<00:04:50.259> all<00:04:50.349> needs

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
you realize that the dead of all needs

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
to exist in a slightly more adult gritty

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.640 
to exist in a slightly more adult gritty

lived and he operates in a different way
you<00:05:00.580> know<00:05:00.849> he<00:05:00.970> got<00:05:01.150> he's<00:05:01.960> not<00:05:02.139> saving<00:05:02.440> the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
universe or saving the world he's he's

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.740 
universe or saving the world he's he's
very<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:06.130> he's<00:05:06.280> very<00:05:06.699> vulnerable<00:05:06.909> he's<00:05:07.569> very

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
very and he's very vulnerable he's very

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.620 
very and he's very vulnerable he's very
fallible<00:05:08.020> as<00:05:08.199> well<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.650> so<00:05:09.130> he's<00:05:10.090> really<00:05:10.479> he's

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
fallible as well and so he's really he's

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.029 
fallible as well and so he's really he's
it's<00:05:10.870> street-level<00:05:11.229> crime<00:05:11.380> he's<00:05:11.770> dealing

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
it's street-level crime he's dealing

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.379 
it's street-level crime he's dealing
with<00:05:12.130> one<00:05:12.280> criminal<00:05:12.610> at<00:05:12.699> a<00:05:12.729> time<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.180> trying

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
with one criminal at a time and trying

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.120 
with one criminal at a time and trying
to<00:05:13.539> clean<00:05:13.900> up<00:05:14.020> his<00:05:14.169> streets<00:05:14.500> as<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:14.770> were<00:05:14.889> and

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
to clean up his streets as it were and

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.850 
to clean up his streets as it were and
so<00:05:15.729> I<00:05:15.759> think<00:05:15.940> tonally<00:05:16.900> and<00:05:17.050> thematically<00:05:17.560> our

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
so I think tonally and thematically our

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.779 
so I think tonally and thematically our
show<00:05:18.099> is<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:19.030> lends<00:05:19.720> itself<00:05:19.990> very<00:05:20.110> well<00:05:20.349> to

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
show is it lends itself very well to

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.219 
show is it lends itself very well to
what<00:05:21.789> the<00:05:21.940> good<00:05:22.150> for<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.419> comics<00:05:22.720> I<00:05:22.900> was<00:05:23.080> going
