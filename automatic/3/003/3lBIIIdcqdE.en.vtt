00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.290
 and lately they have asked me a lot 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.300
 about my hair 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.969
 and I do not know why but they asked me 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.059
 a lot about how I make these curls and they are 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.710
 honestly super easy to do well 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.880
 that today I'm going to show you how I 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.880
 I do my hair 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.460
 and I start with my normal hair that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.680
 is smooth or semi smooth because as in the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.259
 base sometimes you get some waves that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.450
 they bother me so what I do is 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.040
 that I take my hair iron and this 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.020
 what I'm using here is super 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.940
 modern because it has a little screen and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.010
 You can control exactly 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.230
 temperature that arrives and I think super 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 cool because it heats up really fast and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.580
 When it reaches the desired temperature it 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.650
 It turns green and what I do is use 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.480
 this iron only as in the base 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.790
 of my hair to get rid of those 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.920
 waves that part I do not like for 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.750
 nothing and that if I only use my 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.690
 iron on top of the hair 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.760
 because there I do not wave but going 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.739
 the waves itself I am using these 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.380
 bombay products and their collection 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.330
 golden that is incredible the packaging is 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.920
 beautiful but not only that but 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.259
 using your plates 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.330
 that my curls last longer and curls 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.680
 come two one that has one more barrel 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.049
 thick and one that has one more barrel 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.820
 thin and they work basically the same 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.649
 that the iron now to make my 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.020
 curls the first thing I use is a bit 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.000
 of fixative spray and I split the hair 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.950
 in half and I always do like a 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.080
 side first and the other one after but 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.000
 first used a little fixative spray 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.710
 in all my hair so that the curls 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.990
 hold on a bit more and the curls 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.490
 also brings this protective glove to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.080
 Do not hurt yourself when you do your 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.970
 curls that believe me they will thank 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.369
 because I 've burned myself many times 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.960
 then take very small pieces of 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.090
 hair and I from the back 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.710
 I use the thickest barrel of 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.659
 curls and what they want to do is 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.640
 wrap your hair around the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.560
 curler and see that the curl is going to be more 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.840
 open because the barrel is thicker 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.490
 but for the rest of the hair I what 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.959
 I do is use the curler more 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 small and this is a matter of 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.649
 preference of it seems that the curls me 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.959
 last longer in this way and I always the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.580
 curl outward so look here as 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.229
 you see the curl has to be something else or 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.900
 less like that and then in the middle of my 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.630
 hair then the other half and left the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.700
 front part for 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.830
 last because if I can how to control 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.420
 more or less as I want exactly that 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.820
 is the look that I do want to split it 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.470
 half or if I want the bangs or like 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.150
 I want the part to be basically 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.730
 front is like the most important if 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.320
 you want to do them very calmly but the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.390
 true secret so that the ruices are 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.950
 see incredible is to brush it if that 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.700
 It may seem like I'm going to damage them 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.910
 but do not look at the difference 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.910
 then let them relax and already 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.790
 and that's how I like to use the 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.430
 hair on normal days because it's super 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.820
 relaxed but if it's like an occasion 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.820
 special 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.310
 and these came ready but I made them 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.810
 curls so that it complements me and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.940
 what it does is that it makes me a little more 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.610
 of volume so that I see myself as more 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.380
 fabulous and these extensions that I'm 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.690
 using are natural hair that is 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.640
 super important if they want to shape it 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.350
 as they would with their hair and it is a 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.239
 great option for girls that I want a 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.800
 little more volume your hair to 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.510
 special occasions or if you like 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.330
 to walk through life like this with hair 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.330
 fabulous and I put the extensions 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.420
 but actually I never used that much 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.390
 hair like that so I'm going to go back to my 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.610
 normal version and they see that it's super easy 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.069
 at first the curls at me are put so 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.130
 as super closed but then with the 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.770
 time they look like undoing and that gives 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.450
 if a more relaxed look that I think is like 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.459
 the majority likes to do the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.920
 curls do not need all this amount of 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.709
 products but let me tell you that it 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.319
 have greatly facilitated my life so 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.910
 if they can I recommend them absolutely 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.650
 Everything I mentioned is requested because 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.660
 it 's worth a lot of thanks for 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.880
 look I love them too much with many 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.560
 hearts like the one in my shirt and we 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.780
