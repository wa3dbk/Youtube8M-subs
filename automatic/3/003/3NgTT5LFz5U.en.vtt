experienced with this I should be able

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.190 
experienced with this I should be able
to<00:02:19.280> delete<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.790> trouble<00:02:20.390> code<00:02:20.630> from<00:02:20.900> here

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
to delete the trouble code from here

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.270 
to delete the trouble code from here
right<00:02:21.440> sure<00:02:24.100> done<00:02:26.590> it's<00:02:27.590> gonna<00:02:27.739> do<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.010> read

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
right sure done it's gonna do a read

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:37.180 
right sure done it's gonna do a read
again<00:02:32.770> hopefully<00:02:33.770> that'll<00:02:33.980> fix<00:02:35.890> now<00:02:36.890> like

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190
