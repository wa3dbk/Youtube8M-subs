00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:02.360
 know how it is but he left the name to 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.239
 his invention here in the huarache of 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.799
 Jamaica sell 19 varieties plus

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.740
 compadres that are these chiles juÃ¡rez - 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.200
 stuffed with gouda cheese a consommÃ© 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.290

 110 pesos for all 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.630
 non-conforming ram students in 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.970

 As for the huarache there are four keys in 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.560
 the secret of its flavor 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.670
 on the ground floor of the restaurant can 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.459
 see the preparation of the 500 huaraches 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.509
 that they sell in half a day and if they 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.849
 they fix they will hear this noise 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.129
 and because they sound like this because the plant 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.220
 It is very hot and our brand of 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.799

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.519
 water rocket when they sound 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.849
 plates for that reason for all the water that is 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.849

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.079
