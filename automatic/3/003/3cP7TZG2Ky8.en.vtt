00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
these are not these are these are

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.310 
these are not these are these are
synthetic<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:35.180> think<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.930> how<00:01:37.049> good<00:01:37.200> they

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
synthetic I think that's how good they

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
synthetic I think that's how good they
are<00:01:37.350> can't<00:01:37.680> even<00:01:37.829> tell<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.070> they're<00:01:38.220> really

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
are can't even tell if they're really

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.069 
are can't even tell if they're really
synthetic<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:39.810> they're

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
synthetic or not but I think they're

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.359 
synthetic or not but I think they're
synthetic<00:01:40.259> I'm<00:01:40.619> quite<00:01:40.890> sure<00:01:41.040> that's<00:01:41.159> in

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
synthetic I'm quite sure that's in

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.120 
synthetic I'm quite sure that's in
theory<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.299> come<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:43.110> know<00:01:43.259> ten<00:01:43.920> pair

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
theory but they come you know ten pair

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.899 
theory but they come you know ten pair
in<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> Box<00:01:45.320> this<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.590> did<00:01:46.950> wear<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.700> one

in the Box this I did wear this one

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.219 
in the Box this I did wear this one
reminds<00:01:48.210> me<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.659> my<00:01:48.750> favorite<00:01:49.079> styles
