in this video we're gonna take a quick
look<00:00:25.530> at<00:00:25.740> an<00:00:25.950> alternative<00:00:26.520> to<00:00:26.700> track<00:00:26.940> fixing

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
look at an alternative to track fixing

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.260 
look at an alternative to track fixing
pins<00:00:27.620> as<00:00:28.620> you<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.950> see<00:00:29.100> here<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.120> some

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
pins as you can see here we have some

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.620 
pins as you can see here we have some
pea<00:00:31.230> coat<00:00:31.410> rack<00:00:31.680> fixing<00:00:32.040> pins<00:00:32.220> now<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.120> Pico

have<00:00:33.900> very<00:00:34.110> fine<00:00:34.410> track<00:00:34.770> fixing<00:00:35.370> pins<00:00:35.580> and

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
have very fine track fixing pins and

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.960 
have very fine track fixing pins and
even<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.380> drill<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.650> hole<00:00:37.920> through<00:00:38.880> the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
even if you drill a hole through the

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.000 
even if you drill a hole through the
sleepers<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.930> pker<00:00:40.200> sleepers<00:00:40.620> don't<00:00:40.860> have

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
sleepers the pker sleepers don't have

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.510 
sleepers the pker sleepers don't have
the<00:00:41.160> holes<00:00:41.480> but<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> horn<00:00:42.900> bien<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:44.480> ones<00:00:45.480> do

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
the holes but the horn bien and ones do

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.570 
the holes but the horn bien and ones do
and<00:00:47.520> says<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.880> a<00:00:48.059> truck<00:00:48.330> but<00:00:49.230> even<00:00:49.580> through

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
and says it's a truck but even through

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
and a track fixing pan and you can see

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.660 
and a track fixing pan and you can see
it's<00:01:17.399> a<00:01:17.490> little<00:01:17.550> bit<00:01:17.700> thicker<00:01:18.950> but<00:01:19.950> again<00:01:20.280> it's

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
it's a little bit thicker but again it's

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.600 
it's a little bit thicker but again it's
prone<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.420> bending<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.460> unless<00:01:23.460> you're

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
prone to bending like this unless you're

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.359 
prone to bending like this unless you're
putting<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.090> into<00:01:24.300> something<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:26.539> you<00:01:27.539> know

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
putting it into something like you know

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.900 
putting it into something like you know
India<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:32.280> know<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.520> some<00:01:32.670> sort<00:01:32.819> of

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
India for you know it's some sort of

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.139 
India for you know it's some sort of
lighter<00:01:33.200> material<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.590> hardwood

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
lighter material but on this hardwood

lighter material but on this hardwood
plywood<00:01:36.149> type<00:01:36.539> stuff<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:38.009> bang<00:01:38.250> quite

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
plywood type stuff it can bang quite

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.669 
plywood type stuff it can bang quite
frequently<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.380> both<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.410> these<00:01:40.619> things

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
frequently and both of these things

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.070 
frequently and both of these things
included<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.459> hard<00:01:41.640> ones<00:01:41.880> are<00:01:42.660> about<00:01:42.959> as

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
included the hard ones are about as

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.350 
included the hard ones are about as
thick<00:01:43.319> as<00:01:43.440> this<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.800> I<00:01:43.860> actually<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.520> horn

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
thick as this and I actually have a horn

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.020 
thick as this and I actually have a horn
b1<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.780> hand<00:01:46.170> that's<00:01:46.440> not<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.520> derail

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
b1 on hand that's not in the derail

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.469 
b1 on hand that's not in the derail
itself<00:01:49.280> but<00:01:50.280> one<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:50.880> biggest<00:01:51.090> problems

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
itself but one of the biggest problems

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.880 
itself but one of the biggest problems
with<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> harvey<00:01:52.200> ones<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.740> they're

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
with the harvey ones is that they're

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.680 
with the harvey ones is that they're
quite<00:01:53.039> hard<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.280> get<00:01:53.429> into<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.819> hardware

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
quite hard to get into the hardware

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.109 
quite hard to get into the hardware
would<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.410> don't<00:01:55.830> bent<00:01:56.100> say<00:01:56.640> well<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
would really don't bent say well and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.699 
would really don't bent say well and
unfortunately<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.200> one<00:01:58.319> everyone's<00:01:58.590> are

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
unfortunately the one everyone's are

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:03.109 
unfortunately the one everyone's are
quite<00:01:58.890> expensive<00:01:59.690> so<00:02:00.690> two<00:02:01.110> alternatives<00:02:02.119> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
quite expensive so two alternatives to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.680 
quite expensive so two alternatives to
the<00:02:03.240> track<00:02:03.450> fixing<00:02:03.840> pins<00:02:04.080> are<00:02:04.860> actually<00:02:05.690> nails

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
the track fixing pins are actually nails

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.820 
the track fixing pins are actually nails
and<00:02:07.110> Brad's

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
and Brad's

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.510 
and Brad's
that<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.789> use<00:02:09.000> for<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.950> know<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.280> hanging

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that they use for you know just hanging

that they use for you know just hanging
up<00:02:11.640> pictures<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.420> lot<00:02:12.750> sort<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:13.020> thing<00:02:13.200> save

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
get the wire Brad's in Europe but you

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.509 
get the wire Brad's in Europe but you
can<00:02:24.870> get<00:02:25.050> these<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.940> UK<00:02:27.890> either<00:02:28.890> over<00:02:29.310> on

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
can get these in the UK either over on

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.610 
can get these in the UK either over on
internet<00:02:30.239> order<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.689> they're<00:02:31.200> not<00:02:31.470> too
