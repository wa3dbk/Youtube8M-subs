lasting cloak I don't think this map
really<00:01:00.750> good<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> long-range<00:01:01.739> support

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
this will work a lot better on other

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.830 
this will work a lot better on other
maps<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.640> can<00:01:25.790> protect<00:01:26.060> teammates<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:26.630> stuff

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
maps I can protect teammates and stuff

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.590 
maps I can protect teammates and stuff
with<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:26.990> long-range<00:01:27.290> rifle<00:01:27.740> here<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:29.330> better

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
with a long-range rifle here it's better

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.499 
with a long-range rifle here it's better
to<00:01:30.580> do<00:01:31.580> my<00:01:31.729> thing<00:01:32.290> thusly<00:01:34.000> he's<00:01:35.000> got<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.119> purple

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
to do my thing thusly he's got a purple

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.469 
to do my thing thusly he's got a purple
laser<00:01:39.369> all<00:01:40.369> right<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:40.549> we're<00:01:40.670> sitting<00:01:40.759> at<00:01:40.909> 814

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
laser all right so we're sitting at 814

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.490 
laser all right so we're sitting at 814
I<00:01:41.690> think<00:01:41.899> I<00:01:41.960> can<00:01:42.110> turn<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:42.380> around

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
I think I can turn that around

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.800 
I think I can turn that around
single-handedly<00:01:43.190> sounds<00:01:44.180> kind<00:01:44.360> of<00:01:44.390> arrogant

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
through walls and stuff really easy to

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.000 
through walls and stuff really easy to

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:49.650 
get picked off when there's a UAV in the
air<00:04:47.669> gotta<00:04:48.669> keep<00:04:48.880> moving<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.270> keep<00:04:49.330> moving

fast

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:11.800 

are<00:04:59.680> you<00:04:59.860> ideas<00:05:00.310> online

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:24.490 

ah<00:05:12.160> almost<00:05:13.160> got<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.370> meal<00:05:13.580> a<00:05:13.700> hit<00:05:13.850> off<00:05:13.970> on<00:05:14.180> him

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.550 

took<00:05:25.400> out<00:05:25.520> their<00:05:25.640> turret<00:05:26.200> not<00:05:27.200> sure<00:05:27.380> if<00:05:27.440> that

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
took out their turret not sure if that

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.960 
took out their turret not sure if that
was<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.680> best<00:05:27.890> way<00:05:27.980> to<00:05:28.010> do<00:05:28.220> it

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.030 

43<00:05:34.970> to<00:05:35.060> 60<00:05:36.010> but<00:05:37.990> being<00:05:38.990> outnumbered<00:05:39.170> as<00:05:39.680> we<00:05:39.830> are

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040
