00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.959
 this time it is a hardware keylogger 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:12.859
 away directly from poland if you buy it somewhere else poko 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.059
 it will also be much more 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.749
 therefore 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:19.659
 in here we find 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:21.249
 the keylogger 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.390
 it's a reduction for those users who use a ps2 keyboard 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.039
 and they had 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.039
 the computer with vsb attack 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.150
 therefore for users who do not admit it they are a reduction we also have the 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.300
 keylogger with reduction 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.280
 elena let's pretend this 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.300
 yes at the entrance from the computer 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.300
 because he accuses just this brings ps2 here 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 there are also clearly more modern lockers 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.040
 makes vsb but I think ps2 is even more used than new sb 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.330
 lost 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.000
 iki locker let's see how it did it doesn't have too big a size 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.460
 can be put 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 precisely between the computer keyboard 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.360
 the otter stie rho enters here 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.840
 that cures when attached to the computer with the usual ps2 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 so I need to read 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.830
 this way if the keyboard and when 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.990
 I write something 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.710
 whatever I write on the keyboard 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.450
 pass here in the middle 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.200
 and then goes in directly to the computer the user didn't notice anything for 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.340
 what he writes I get to the computer 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.040
 I certainly don't know 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.450
 which is intercepted recorded by this little thing 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.920
 how could he find out by simply looking at the computer if 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.030
 a ruthless little user, maybe newbie, will not notice that he is 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.400
 this thing will not even ask what it is 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.090
 they are not asking 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.509
 if besan a bit more savvy user could also say raymax cabbage 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.579
 and then the newspaper 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.699
 we will say there is nothing written but who I am 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.150
 if a user is a bit crafty if you are so clearly - 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.549
 let's see how a hardware keylogger works on a practical level 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.439
 as you can see i installed keylogger 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.989
 ciaoo keyboard computer 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.309
 and now I sit here 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.079
 as an unsuspecting user 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.309
 that I write something 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.309
 I open a case text editor 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.789
 I write to you 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.789

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.519
 I am 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.819
 albert astorri keynesianism 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.419
 cool address 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.580
 is entitled to 8 tubes 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.580
 founder's name themselves 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.409
 let's see how it handles this kind of errors 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.019
 as you can see this is what I just wrote now let's see what 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.989
 registered nickelodeon 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.959
 the first is the key combination 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.319
 which was previously set not keylogger 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.699
 marco cortesi 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.939
 draw the mask 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.939
 step more memory 1 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.119
 from the last page 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.469
 yes here there are also a couple of things I had written will find out 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:49.419
 houses only 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.169

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.619
 index itself 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:05.229
 in this case I have the possibility in the settings of this chi locker 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:09.959
 to choose whether to record home the extra keys - decided not to record 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.309
 extra keyboard 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:13.139
 in this way the 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.799
 result i love resulting is this therefore do not appear too located 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.650
 square brackets of special keys 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.439
 and these 

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:25.930
