499<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:10.139> know<00:00:10.469> it's<00:00:10.710> pretty<00:00:10.830> steep<00:00:11.160> for<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
499 I know it's pretty steep for the

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.120 
499 I know it's pretty steep for the
price<00:00:11.759> but<00:00:12.090> once<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.929> get<00:00:13.080> like<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.620> thinking

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
price but once you get like to thinking

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.220 
price but once you get like to thinking
about<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.549> actually<00:00:14.700> does<00:00:15.059> fit<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.509> because

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
about it actually does fit it because

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.170 
about it actually does fit it because
there's<00:00:16.410> another<00:00:16.619> tweakin<00:00:17.340> city<00:00:17.550> i<00:00:17.640> recently

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
there's another tweakin city i recently

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.269 
there's another tweakin city i recently
reviewed<00:00:18.570> called<00:00:18.869> TV<00:00:19.230> tube<00:00:19.619> sleep<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.189> that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
reviewed called TV tube sleep and that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.310 
reviewed called TV tube sleep and that
was<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> dollar<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.090> that's<00:00:21.480> just<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.840> one<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
was a dollar and that's just for one and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.019 
was a dollar and that's just for one and
this<00:00:22.710> tweak<00:00:23.070> allows<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.699> multiple

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
this tweak allows you to have multiple

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.960 
this tweak allows you to have multiple
effects<00:00:24.779> like<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.460> only<00:00:26.550> 499

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
effects like that so and it's only 499

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.509 
effects like that so and it's only 499
so<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.689> think<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.019> pretty<00:00:28.289> sweet<00:00:28.560> by<00:00:28.769> so

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
so it's I think it's pretty sweet by so

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.009 
so it's I think it's pretty sweet by so
i<00:00:29.550> know<00:00:29.849> i'm<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.150> little<00:00:30.179> late<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.750> tweak

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
i know i'm a little late on this tweak

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.979 
i know i'm a little late on this tweak
but<00:00:31.199> i<00:00:31.260> thought<00:00:31.470> i'd<00:00:31.619> get<00:00:31.769> into<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.160> anyways<00:00:32.989> so

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
but i thought i'd get into it anyways so

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.450 
but i thought i'd get into it anyways so
like<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.290> said<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.860> basically<00:00:35.430> just

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
like I said this is basically just

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
like I said this is basically just
another<00:00:35.969> way<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.180> put<00:00:36.390> animations<00:00:37.050> when<00:00:37.230> you

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
another way to put animations when you

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.470 
another way to put animations when you
lock<00:00:37.559> your<00:00:37.739> device<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.850> also<00:00:39.000> allows<00:00:39.360> you

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
lock your device and it also allows you

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420 
lock your device and it also allows you
to<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.750> sound<00:00:40.020> enabled<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.129> that's<00:00:41.250> pretty

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
to have sound enabled so that's pretty

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.770 
to have sound enabled so that's pretty
sweet<00:00:41.610> as<00:00:41.820> well<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.420> down<00:00:42.570> here

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
sweet as well so you can go down here

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.240 
sweet as well so you can go down here
and<00:00:42.809> go<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.110> sleep<00:00:43.290> affects<00:00:43.800> after<00:00:44.129> you've

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
here's an experimental mode and this is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.399 
here's an experimental mode and this is
just<00:01:23.820> an<00:01:23.970> experiment<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> beta<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
just an experiment it's like a beta and

this just allows you to have an

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.780 
this just allows you to have an
animation<00:01:28.350> when<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.740> unlock<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.220> device<00:01:29.460> as

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
animation when you unlock your device as

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.060 
animation when you unlock your device as

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
well so you might have to respring every

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
well so you might have to respring every
time<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.640> set<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> new<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.630> guys<00:01:33.810> that's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
time you do set a new one guys that's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.660

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
why I have been on random and it looks
