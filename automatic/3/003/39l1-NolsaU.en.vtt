00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.629
 with the criteria of what to see especially with 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.229
 with the selection of high risk 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.229
 with what was very based on 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.829
 in those authors that I thought from the beginning 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.460
 by 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.390
 for one hundrerd 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.239
 had to do especially with 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.320
 with a script that moved away from everything that could be shown as molds 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.700
 classics of 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.000
 of the genus 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.340
 and that was founded on him the evening the second meter and of course I had to 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.530
 see what they were 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.640
 writers in Spanish 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.920
 i 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.880
 well not so much 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.610
 obviously in nothing 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.960
 corresponds to more with a generation that could be mine 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.820
 although there are other authors of other relationships previous 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.920
 and it was a little sign as his own writing match on the ideas of 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.920
 I tell you that they left these moments 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.570
 The objectives of the book are 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.079
 let's say confirm or verify more intuition than I had previously 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.570
 what 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.950
 that has to do with the idea that on the theory of 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.050
 the queens story has always been used to achieve 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.750
 the great classical ideas or the genre 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.590
 it was not a general theory of the background but a theory of the pont a epoch 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.420
 determined I remembered how much they will leave canceled 19 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.340
 and that goes on throughout the 20th century 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.980
 I hope that I created 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.270
 I have always thought that he 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.270
 for a few decades it was changing and this was coming 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.130
 it was necessary to verify it in politics 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.130
 I saw little sentenced 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.540
 the public before 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.830
 It's destined 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.660
 one would like it to be 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.790
 as numerous as possible or not but I think that 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.280
 it's an audience 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.509
 Of course, a university profile could be a second hector with 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.769
 certain outsourcing 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.379
 and I think it's also useful 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.950
 of course the generic interested reader in the most diverse issues 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.059
 of literature 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.239
 and maybe I plan to sell that 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.879
 a very useful book for writing workshops
