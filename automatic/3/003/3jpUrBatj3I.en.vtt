00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay now we're doing a seam finish that

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.559 
okay now we're doing a seam finish that
I<00:00:03.389> call<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.810> turn<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.529> stitch<00:00:04.890> it<00:00:05.730> has<00:00:06.180> a

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
I call the turn and stitch it has a

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.160 
I call the turn and stitch it has a
neater<00:00:06.839> appearance<00:00:06.930> when<00:00:07.890> you're<00:00:08.099> finished

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
neater appearance when you're finished

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.110 
neater appearance when you're finished
but<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.349> little<00:00:10.500> bit<00:00:10.590> trickier<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.280> do<00:00:11.490> you

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
but it's a little bit trickier to do you

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.720 
but it's a little bit trickier to do you
can't<00:00:12.360> measure<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.900> can't<00:00:13.230> pin<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.559> down

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
can't measure it you can't pin it down

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.939 
can't measure it you can't pin it down
you're<00:00:14.730> going<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.240> turn<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.020> seam<00:00:16.260> allowance

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
you're going to turn the seam allowance

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.859 
you're going to turn the seam allowance
out<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.520> you're<00:00:17.640> looking<00:00:17.910> at<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.300> wrong<00:00:18.510> side

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
out so you're looking at the wrong side

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.800 
out so you're looking at the wrong side
of<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.109> fabric<00:00:19.320> or<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.859> backside<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.810> I'm

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
of the fabric or the backside and I'm

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.540 
of the fabric or the backside and I'm
going<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.140> gradually<00:00:23.150> just<00:00:24.150> turn<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.740> wee

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
going to gradually just turn in a wee

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.870 
going to gradually just turn in a wee
little<00:00:27.119> amount<00:00:28.220> enough<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.609> stitch

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
little amount enough that I can stitch

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.669 
little amount enough that I can stitch
on<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.630> gonna<00:00:30.750> fall<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
on it and it's not gonna fall out and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.370 
on it and it's not gonna fall out and
I'm<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> use<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> straight<00:00:33.420> stitch<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.320> I

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
I'm going to use a straight stitch so I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.810 
I'm going to use a straight stitch so I
need<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.620> make<00:00:34.739> sure<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.010> my<00:00:35.160> Sheen<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.520> my

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
need to make sure that my Sheen is my

need to make sure that my Sheen is my
machines<00:00:36.149> back<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.540> straight<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.550> I<00:00:38.550> start<00:00:39.059> by

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
machines back on straight and I start by

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.660 
machines back on straight and I start by
folding<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.680> over<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.100> putting<00:00:41.399> my<00:00:41.520> needle<00:00:41.850> in

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
folding it over and putting my needle in

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.729 
folding it over and putting my needle in
and<00:00:44.670> I'm<00:00:44.789> gonna<00:00:44.969> hold<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.780> threads<00:00:46.079> tight<00:00:46.440> at

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
and I'm gonna hold the threads tight at

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.700 
and I'm gonna hold the threads tight at
the<00:00:46.860> back<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.219> machine<00:00:47.690> so<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.719> when<00:00:49.260> I

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the back of the machine so that when I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.049 
the back of the machine so that when I
first<00:00:50.520> start<00:00:50.879> stitching<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:53.460> actually<00:00:53.850> goes

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
first start stitching it actually goes

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.720 
first start stitching it actually goes
straight<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.600> doesn't<00:00:54.899> catch<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.500> anything

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
straight and doesn't catch on anything

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.750 
straight and doesn't catch on anything
then<00:00:56.730> I'll<00:00:56.879> come<00:00:57.090> back<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.629> do<00:00:57.899> maybe<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.760> or

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
then I'll come back and do maybe one or

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.810 
then I'll come back and do maybe one or
two<00:00:59.789> small<00:01:00.629> back<00:01:00.870> stitches<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.579> want

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
two small back stitches and then I want

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.000 
two small back stitches and then I want
to<00:01:02.850> go<00:01:02.969> forward<00:01:03.390> again<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:04.439> what<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
to go forward again but what I have to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.920 
to go forward again but what I have to
do<00:01:05.159> since<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.700> such<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> small<00:01:06.240> amount<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
do since this is such a small amount I

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.550 
do since this is such a small amount I
have<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.710> kind<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.490> turn<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.780> then

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
have to kind of turn it as I go and then

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.050 
have to kind of turn it as I go and then
what<00:01:10.740> I'm<00:01:10.860> doing<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.130> I'm<00:01:11.280> stitching<00:01:11.520> really

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
what I'm doing is I'm stitching really

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.499 
what I'm doing is I'm stitching really
close<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.540> fold<00:01:13.790> okay<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.030> stitch

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
close to that fold okay so I stitch

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.140 
close to that fold okay so I stitch
about<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.930> far<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.729> with<00:01:17.729> my<00:01:17.909> needle

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
about as far as I can with my needle

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.990 
about as far as I can with my needle
down<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.869> come<00:01:19.200> back<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.250> regroup<00:01:20.610> turn

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
down I come back I kind of regroup turn

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.690 
down I come back I kind of regroup turn
the<00:01:21.119> fabric<00:01:21.299> over<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> more<00:01:22.700> continue

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the fabric over it more continue

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.770 
the fabric over it more continue
stitching<00:01:25.520> it's<00:01:26.520> hard<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.850> hold<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.540> at<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
stitching it's hard to hold on to at the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.950 
stitching it's hard to hold on to at the
very<00:01:27.990> edge<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.100> do<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.430> best<00:01:29.960> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
very edge so you just do your best and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.840 
very edge so you just do your best and
go<00:01:31.110> ahead<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.740> stitch<00:01:32.100> some<00:01:32.520> more

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.300 

if<00:01:36.850> your<00:01:37.030> fingers<00:01:37.390> get<00:01:37.689> too<00:01:38.649> big<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.979> hold<00:01:39.189> it

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
if your fingers get too big to hold it

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.080 
if your fingers get too big to hold it
in<00:01:39.429> place

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
in place

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.139 
in place
sometimes<00:01:41.079> I<00:01:41.200> even<00:01:41.320> take<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.619> pin<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.149> just

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
sometimes I even take a pin and just

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.169 
sometimes I even take a pin and just
kind<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.570> hold<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:43.869> down<00:01:44.549> until<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.640> get<00:01:45.850> close

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
kind of hold it down until I get close

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.230 
kind of hold it down until I get close
to<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.390> edge<00:01:46.600> there<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:48.159> I<00:01:48.520> can<00:01:48.729> back<00:01:48.909> stitch

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
to the edge there and I can back stitch

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.389 
to the edge there and I can back stitch
again<00:01:49.630> just<00:01:50.409> about<00:01:50.619> one<00:01:50.799> stitch<00:01:51.159> it's

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
again just about one stitch it's

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.800 
again just about one stitch it's
probably<00:01:51.759> about<00:01:51.909> all<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.179> need<00:01:53.340> okay<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
probably about all you need okay and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.880 
probably about all you need okay and
then<00:01:56.049> we'll<00:01:56.409> take<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.619> out<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:59.439> looks<00:01:59.649> like

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
then we'll take it out and it looks like

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.550 
then we'll take it out and it looks like
that<00:02:00.569> and<00:02:01.569> when<00:02:01.750> you<00:02:01.899> would<00:02:02.049> open<00:02:02.259> up<00:02:02.500> the

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
that and when you would open up the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.710 
that and when you would open up the
fabric<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:05.409> looks<00:02:05.500> like<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:06.280> nice<00:02:07.149> finished

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
fabric it looks like a nice finished

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.109 
fabric it looks like a nice finished
flat<00:02:08.049> edge<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.369> then<00:02:09.489> we'll<00:02:09.610> come<00:02:09.789> back<00:02:09.970> and

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
flat edge and then we'll come back and

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.069 
flat edge and then we'll come back and
we'll<00:02:10.239> do<00:02:10.329> the<00:02:10.450> same<00:02:10.509> thing<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.049> other

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
we'll do the same thing to the other

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.759 
we'll do the same thing to the other
side<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.840> you'll<00:02:13.930> be<00:02:13.989> able<00:02:14.079> to<00:02:14.290> see<00:02:14.530> what

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
side so you'll be able to see what

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.770 
side so you'll be able to see what
that's<00:02:14.890> gonna<00:02:15.220> look<00:02:15.310> like<00:02:15.489> when<00:02:16.450> we're<00:02:16.599> done

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
with the backside of the seam allowance

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.930 
with the backside of the seam allowance
only<00:02:23.790> go<00:02:24.790> ahead<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.360> flip<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.810> over<00:02:26.790> start<00:02:27.790> it

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
only go ahead and flip it over start it

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.870

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
by just again with the hand wheel I turn

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.970 
by just again with the hand wheel I turn
it<00:02:31.030> towards<00:02:31.329> myself<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:32.470> bring<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.799> needle

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980

my stitching I've got a spot on my
machine<00:02:53.709> that<00:02:53.889> I'm<00:02:54.010> watching<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.450> I'm

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
machine that I'm watching so that I'm

machine that I'm watching so that I'm
keeping<00:02:56.139> the<00:02:56.380> fabric<00:02:57.450> ready<00:02:58.450> equal<00:02:59.019> and

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
distance over as I stitch so that I'm

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.349 
distance over as I stitch so that I'm
gonna<00:03:02.799> have<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.010> nice<00:03:03.160> uniform<00:03:03.430> stitch<00:03:03.940> not<00:03:04.209> too

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
far not too close to the edge and then

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.379 
far not too close to the edge and then
again<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.810> do<00:03:08.109> a<00:03:08.139> little<00:03:08.349> back<00:03:08.560> stitch

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
sometimes it kind of rumbles up because

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.900 
sometimes it kind of rumbles up because
it's<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:11.889> got<00:03:12.040> such<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.310> small<00:03:12.519> amount<00:03:12.730> of

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
it's you got such a small amount of

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.750 
it's you got such a small amount of
fabric<00:03:13.299> there<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:14.650> that's<00:03:15.099> okay<00:03:15.250> just<00:03:15.670> do

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
fabric there but that's okay just do

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.970 
fabric there but that's okay just do
your<00:03:15.849> best<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:17.290> then<00:03:17.349> we'll<00:03:17.500> take<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:17.799> back

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980

your best and then we'll take that back
out<00:03:18.720> we'll<00:03:19.720> trim<00:03:20.040> both<00:03:21.040> ends<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:23.579> when<00:03:24.579> I<00:03:24.639> open

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
out we'll trim both ends and when I open

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.080 
out we'll trim both ends and when I open
it<00:03:25.060> up<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:27.130> will<00:03:27.160> see<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.549> again<00:03:27.790> we<00:03:27.940> would

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
it up you will see you again we would

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.729

press<00:03:28.329> that<00:03:28.480> open<00:03:28.540> flat<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:29.139> pressed<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.530> one

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
press that open flat I pressed this one

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.379 
press that open flat I pressed this one
a<00:03:29.769> little<00:03:29.950> bit<00:03:30.130> before<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:30.489> stitched<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.180> just

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
a little bit before I stitched it just

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.970 
a little bit before I stitched it just
so<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.720> would<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:32.169> wouldn't<00:03:32.440> lay<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.590> little<00:03:32.769> bit

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
so it would it wouldn't lay a little bit

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.159 
so it would it wouldn't lay a little bit
better<00:03:33.099> for<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.459> see<00:03:33.639> and<00:03:33.880> that<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.750> my

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
turn and stitch seam finish you can see

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.120 
turn and stitch seam finish you can see
it's<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.519> little<00:03:39.880> bit<00:03:40.060> nicer<00:03:40.569> then<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.889> zigzag

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
it's a little bit nicer then the zigzag

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.439 
it's a little bit nicer then the zigzag
as<00:03:42.819> far<00:03:43.630> as<00:03:43.949> looks<00:03:44.949> finished<00:03:45.519> edge<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:46.239> little

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
as far as looks finished edge a little

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.330 
as far as looks finished edge a little
bit<00:03:46.570> more<00:03:46.720> professional-looking<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:48.070> does

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
bit more professional-looking it does

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.369 
bit more professional-looking it does
have<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.700> little<00:03:48.849> looseness<00:03:49.180> here<00:03:49.450> but<00:03:50.200> what

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
have the little looseness here but what

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.650 
have the little looseness here but what
can't<00:03:50.650> happen<00:03:50.860> is<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.519> cannot<00:03:51.819> Ravel<00:03:52.239> out<00:03:52.420> now

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
can't happen is it cannot Ravel out now

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.979 
can't happen is it cannot Ravel out now
when<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.980> garment<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.400> worn<00:03:54.430> or<00:03:55.000> when<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.780> is

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
when the garment is worn or when it is

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.350 
when the garment is worn or when it is
laundered<00:03:59.250> go<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.280> little<00:04:00.550> bit<00:04:00.670> closer<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.090> you

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
laundered go a little bit closer so you

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.870 
laundered go a little bit closer so you
can<00:04:01.510> see
