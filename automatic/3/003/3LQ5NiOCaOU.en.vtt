00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
and some of them fell there and I found

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.580 
and some of them fell there and I found
myself<00:00:33.790> really<00:00:34.570> struggling<00:00:35.079> and<00:00:35.260> almost

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
myself really struggling and almost

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.770 
myself really struggling and almost
flamming<00:00:36.040> between<00:00:36.370> hands<00:00:36.580> and<00:00:36.790> feet<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.180> it

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
flamming between hands and feet and it

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.420 
flamming between hands and feet and it
sounded<00:00:38.140> pretty<00:00:38.260> awful<00:00:38.710> really<00:00:39.130> really<00:00:39.310> awful

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
sounded pretty awful really really awful

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.860 
sounded pretty awful really really awful
so<00:00:39.700> I<00:00:39.730> realized<00:00:40.120> I<00:00:40.180> had<00:00:40.270> to<00:00:40.300> spend<00:00:40.600> a<00:00:40.690> lot<00:00:40.720> of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
so I realized I had to spend a lot of

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.200 
so I realized I had to spend a lot of
time<00:00:41.110> with<00:00:41.560> right<00:00:41.830> foot<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.310> left<00:00:42.550> hand<00:00:42.790> on

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
time with right foot and left hand on

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.330 
time with right foot and left hand on

exercise<00:00:45.700> I<00:00:45.730> devised<00:00:46.150> recently<00:00:46.600> now<00:00:46.800> everyone

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
exercise I devised recently now everyone

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.710 
exercise I devised recently now everyone
counts<00:00:48.100> differently<00:00:48.520> I<00:00:48.550> count<00:00:49.030> completely

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
counts differently I count completely

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.330 
counts differently I count completely
wrong<00:00:49.900> everyone<00:00:50.230> counts<00:00:50.530> one-e-and-a

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
wrong everyone counts one-e-and-a

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.190

two-e-and-a<00:00:51.850> with<00:00:52.000> sixteenth<00:00:52.390> notes<00:00:52.630> I've

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
two-e-and-a with sixteenth notes I've

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.450 
two-e-and-a with sixteenth notes I've
never<00:00:53.410> been<00:00:53.530> known<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.650> do<00:00:53.890> it<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.190> one<00:00:54.430> of

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
never been known to do it and one of

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.890 
never been known to do it and one of
those<00:00:54.580> weird<00:00:54.880> people<00:00:54.970> that's<00:00:55.390> not<00:00:55.510> plugged<00:00:55.780> in

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
those weird people that's not plugged in

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.060 
those weird people that's not plugged in
properly<00:00:55.930> so<00:00:56.380> I've<00:00:56.440> never<00:00:56.590> really<00:00:56.770> be<00:00:56.860> able<00:00:56.980> to

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
properly so I've never really be able to

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.680 
properly so I've never really be able to
do<00:00:57.220> it<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.520> always<00:00:57.850> count<00:00:58.120> every<00:00:58.300> single<00:00:58.420> note

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
do it I always count every single note

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.960 
do it I always count every single note
as<00:00:58.840> 1<00:00:58.990> 2<00:00:59.110> 3<00:00:59.200> 4<00:00:59.410> 5<00:00:59.500> 6<00:00:59.620> 7<00:00:59.890> 8<00:00:59.950> 9<00:01:00.010> 0<00:01:00.130> onwards<00:01:00.670> and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 onwards and

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.260 
as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 onwards and
upwards

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
upwards

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.300 
upwards
which<00:01:02.110> is<00:01:02.230> pretty<00:01:02.470> tough<00:01:02.710> but<00:01:02.860> I<00:01:02.920> find<00:01:03.220> it

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
which is pretty tough but I find it

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.410 
which is pretty tough but I find it
really<00:01:03.430> really<00:01:03.550> natural<00:01:03.820> so<00:01:04.210> we're<00:01:04.329> gonna

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
really really natural so we're gonna

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.850 
really really natural so we're gonna
take<00:01:04.629> eight<00:01:04.900> sixteenth<00:01:05.470> notes<00:01:05.740> or

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
take eight sixteenth notes or

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.649 
take eight sixteenth notes or
one-e-and-a<00:01:06.490> two-e-and-a<00:01:07.119> so<00:01:07.270> it's<00:01:07.450> simple

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
one-e-and-a two-e-and-a so it's simple

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.970 
one-e-and-a two-e-and-a so it's simple
like<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:13.050> very<00:01:14.050> very<00:01:14.200> simple<00:01:14.470> almost<00:01:14.560> day<00:01:14.800> 1

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
like this very very simple almost day 1

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.860 
like this very very simple almost day 1
of<00:01:15.010> drumming<00:01:15.310> what<00:01:15.850> I'd<00:01:15.940> like<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.180> do<00:01:16.330> is<00:01:16.450> put<00:01:16.720> a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
of drumming what I'd like to do is put a

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:24.260 
of drumming what I'd like to do is put a
bass<00:01:17.200> drum<00:01:17.230> on<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.650> first<00:01:18.010> sixteenth<00:01:18.490> note

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.460 

now<00:01:25.270> we<00:01:25.330> could<00:01:25.570> put<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.870> snare<00:01:26.050> drum<00:01:26.229> on<00:01:26.350> the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
now we could put the snare drum on the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.740 
now we could put the snare drum on the
five<00:01:26.710> or<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:26.950> two<00:01:27.250> one-e-and-a<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.240> make<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.690> a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
five or the two one-e-and-a to make it a

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:36.600 
five or the two one-e-and-a to make it a
groove<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:35.470> is<00:01:35.620> what<00:01:35.740> my<00:01:35.830> problem<00:01:35.979> started

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
that's where the real problems started

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260 
that's where the real problems started
coming<00:01:44.500> in<00:01:44.620> so<00:01:44.830> so<00:01:45.790> I'd<00:01:45.850> like<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.090> play<00:01:46.180> the

left foot on the bass drum and you play

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.610 
left foot on the bass drum and you play
your<00:03:26.060> hands<00:03:26.359> on<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.689> floor<00:03:26.810> Tom<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.109> play

your hands on the floor Tom and play
exactly<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:28.159> same<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.640> I<00:03:28.670> guarantee<00:03:29.180> the

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
exactly the same and I guarantee the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.089 
exactly the same and I guarantee the
left<00:03:29.810> foot<00:03:29.930> will<00:03:30.109> be<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.500> far<00:03:30.739> behind<00:03:30.859> the

left foot will be so far behind the

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.710 
left foot will be so far behind the
right<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:31.760> that's<00:03:31.970> probably<00:03:32.269> where<00:03:32.510> we<00:03:32.569> need

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
right so that's probably where we need

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.300 
right so that's probably where we need
to<00:03:32.750> be<00:03:33.019> regarding<00:03:33.680> getting<00:03:33.799> getting<00:03:34.069> a<00:03:34.129> better

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
player because the the ability of right

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.809

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
down here at the moment we need to get

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.530 
down here at the moment we need to get
them<00:03:39.109> pretty<00:03:39.590> much<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.859> same<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:40.879> really<00:03:41.359> fun

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
them pretty much the same so really fun

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.620
