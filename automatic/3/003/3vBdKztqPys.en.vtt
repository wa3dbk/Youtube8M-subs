as<00:00:09.540> I've<00:00:09.809> mentioned<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.260> part<00:00:10.469> one<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
as I've mentioned in part one of the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.230 
as I've mentioned in part one of the
video<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.490> will<00:00:11.670> show<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.969> breakdown

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
video that I will show you a breakdown

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.509 
video that I will show you a breakdown
on<00:00:12.540> how<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.840> puts<00:00:13.080> together<00:00:13.230> we<00:00:14.130> start<00:00:14.370> out

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
on how this puts together we start out

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.670 
on how this puts together we start out
by<00:00:14.549> some<00:00:14.969> ripstop<00:00:15.389> nylon<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.440> just

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
by some ripstop nylon and I just

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.359 
by some ripstop nylon and I just
purchased<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.190> at<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.670> fabric<00:00:18.150> store<00:00:19.369> this

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
purchased this at the fabric store this

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.689 
purchased this at the fabric store this
is<00:00:20.550> about<00:00:20.730> 28<00:00:21.270> inches<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.810> width<00:00:22.230> by<00:00:22.590> 68<00:00:23.400> inches

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
is about 28 inches in width by 68 inches

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.529 
is about 28 inches in width by 68 inches
in<00:00:23.850> length<00:00:24.119> pretty<00:00:25.019> close<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.320> my<00:00:25.439> hide<00:00:26.359> and<00:00:27.359> I

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
in length pretty close to my hide and I

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.390 
in length pretty close to my hide and I
didn't<00:00:27.869> bother<00:00:27.960> him<00:00:28.320> amiss<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> said<00:00:29.279> this

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
didn't bother him amiss like I said this

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.700 
didn't bother him amiss like I said this
is<00:00:29.550> gonna<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> prototype<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:31.529> this

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
is gonna be the prototype so if this

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.290 
is gonna be the prototype so if this
works<00:00:31.949> out<00:00:32.160> I'll<00:00:32.369> probably<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.910> get<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.090> piece

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
works out I'll probably just get a piece

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.150 
works out I'll probably just get a piece
of<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.110> handle<00:00:34.559> means<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
of it and have it handle means just to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.430 
of it and have it handle means just to
dress<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:37.820> but<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.850> started<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.360> by<00:00:39.750> taking

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
dress it up but I started out by taking

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.790 
dress it up but I started out by taking
the<00:00:40.710> end<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.140> see<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> had

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the end of it and you can see that I had

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.670 
the end of it and you can see that I had
it<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.750> kind<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> folded<00:00:46.200> together<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:49.469> I

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
it just kind of folded together and I

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.069 
it just kind of folded together and I
took<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.309> about<00:00:50.730> four<00:00:51.090> inches<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.780> just

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
took and about four inches of it's just

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.389 
took and about four inches of it's just
been<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.440> over<00:00:52.649> my<00:00:52.770> hand<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.780> little

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
been it over my hand to get a little

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.720 
been it over my hand to get a little
loop<00:00:56.399> started<00:00:56.820> there<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.340> took<00:00:59.399> this

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
loop started there and I took this

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910 
loop started there and I took this
webbing<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:01.079> sling<00:01:01.350> webbing<00:01:01.739> that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
webbing this is some sling webbing that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.189 
webbing this is some sling webbing that
I'd<00:01:02.070> bought<00:01:02.250> at<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.609> outfitter<00:01:03.600> store<00:01:03.930> just

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
I'd bought at the outfitter store just

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.420 
I'd bought at the outfitter store just
used<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.619> rock<00:01:04.830> climbing<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.070> took<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
used in rock climbing and I took that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.920 
used in rock climbing and I took that
and<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:09.090> fed<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.360> through<00:01:09.680> where<00:01:10.680> had<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
and just fed it through where had the

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.730 
and just fed it through where had the
nylon<00:01:12.930> bin<00:01:13.170> over<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> you'll<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
nylon bin over and you'll just have to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.219 
nylon bin over and you'll just have to
take<00:01:17.159> an<00:01:17.310> estimate<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:17.970> much<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.390> want<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
take an estimate of how much you want to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.510 
take an estimate of how much you want to
feed<00:01:19.439> through<00:01:19.710> there<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.100> might<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
feed through there and you might have to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.870 
feed through there and you might have to
tie<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> couple<00:01:21.240> times<00:01:22.490> but<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:23.670> what<00:01:23.850> I

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
tie this a couple times but then what I

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:33.730 
tie this a couple times but then what I
did<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:25.340> loop<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.460> over<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.729> top

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.060 

come<00:01:34.400> around<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.850> bottom<00:01:35.180> again<00:01:35.770> back<00:01:36.770> over

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
come around the bottom again back over

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.960 
come around the bottom again back over
the<00:01:37.189> top<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.259> just<00:01:39.259> pulled<00:01:39.560> this<00:01:39.970> piece

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
the top and I just pulled this piece

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.820 
the top and I just pulled this piece
that<00:01:41.000> I<00:01:41.180> had<00:01:41.360> Luke<00:01:41.540> over<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.930> top<00:01:42.110> up<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.560> fed

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
that I had Luke over the top up and fed

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.240 
that I had Luke over the top up and fed
it<00:01:42.950> through<00:01:43.130> here<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.649> took<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:49.009> top

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
it through here and that took that top

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.060 
it through here and that took that top
loop<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.759> took<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.600> other<00:01:50.890> part<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:51.950> the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
loop and took the other part of the

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:05.370 
loop and took the other part of the
sling<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:53.590> fed<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.740> through<00:01:54.770> it

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.520 

once<00:02:05.980> you<00:02:06.070> got<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.340> through<00:02:06.490> there<00:02:06.730> just<00:02:07.530> dress

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
once you got it through there just dress

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.980 
once you got it through there just dress
up<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.920> sling<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.700> little<00:02:09.940> bit<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:13.450> give

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990

picked up this accessory cord at the
outdoor<00:02:27.610> store<00:02:28.030> also<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.410> four

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
outdoor store also this is four

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.250 
outdoor store also this is four
millimeters<00:02:30.459> in<00:02:30.640> diameter<00:02:30.930> used<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.080> rock

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
millimeters in diameter used in rock

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.300 
millimeters in diameter used in rock
climbing<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:35.350> just<00:02:35.470> start<00:02:35.650> out<00:02:35.800> by<00:02:35.830> tying

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
climbing and you just start out by tying

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.199 
climbing and you just start out by tying
a<00:02:36.459> figure<00:02:36.730> eight<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.700> let's<00:02:40.030> just

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
a figure eight and that and let's just

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:48.030 
a figure eight and that and let's just
make<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.450> guess<00:02:40.810> at<00:02:41.170> where<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.920> tie<00:02:42.220> this<00:02:47.040> you'll

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
make a guess at where to tie this you'll

00:02:48.040 --> 00:03:18.420 
make a guess at where to tie this you'll
take<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.430> end<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.090> webbing

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.339 

okay<00:03:19.299> now<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.569> got<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.750> figure<00:03:20.079> eight<00:03:20.260> in<00:03:20.470> there

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
okay now I got a figure eight in there

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:30.360 
okay now I got a figure eight in there
and<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:25.260> probably<00:03:26.260> have<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:28.620> don't<00:03:29.620> know<00:03:29.769> good

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
and so I probably have I don't know good

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.360 
and so I probably have I don't know good
10<00:03:30.610> or<00:03:30.730> 12<00:03:30.970> feet<00:03:31.150> swing<00:03:31.829> for<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:32.920> end<00:03:33.099> of<00:03:33.220> that

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
10 or 12 feet swing for the end of that

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.839 
10 or 12 feet swing for the end of that
-<00:03:33.579> tied<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.000> tree<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:35.129> then<00:03:36.129> what<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.370> did<00:03:36.609> was

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
- tied to a tree and then what I did was

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.710 
- tied to a tree and then what I did was
took<00:03:37.060> some<00:03:37.329> low<00:03:37.750> residue<00:03:38.200> duct<00:03:38.470> tape<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:40.180> took

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
took some low residue duct tape and took

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.640 
took some low residue duct tape and took
maybe<00:03:42.420> I'd<00:03:43.420> say<00:03:43.599> about<00:03:43.720> three<00:03:44.140> inches<00:03:44.439> four

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
maybe I'd say about three inches four

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:54.629 
maybe I'd say about three inches four
inches<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:51.700> just<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.959> dress<00:03:53.409> up<00:03:53.680> the

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
inches of that and just to dress up the

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:59.270 
inches of that and just to dress up the
end<00:03:54.909> of<00:03:55.030> this<00:03:55.150> where<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.889> nylon<00:03:56.889> is<00:03:57.459> bent<00:03:57.760> back

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
end of this where the nylon is bent back

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.259 
end of this where the nylon is bent back
and<00:04:00.280> like<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.489> said<00:04:00.670> this<00:04:00.819> is<00:04:01.000> just<00:04:01.180> the

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
and like I said this is just the

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.470 
and like I said this is just the
prototype<00:04:02.519> if<00:04:03.519> you<00:04:03.700> wanted<00:04:03.939> to<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.120> guess<00:04:04.299> you

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
prototype if you wanted to I guess you

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.110 
prototype if you wanted to I guess you
could<00:04:04.750> take<00:04:04.930> some<00:04:05.939> heat<00:04:06.939> shrink<00:04:07.470> tubing<00:04:09.120> put

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
could take some heat shrink tubing put

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.970 
could take some heat shrink tubing put
over<00:04:10.359> that<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.780> dress<00:04:11.109> it<00:04:11.230> up<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.409> little<00:04:11.439> nicer

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
over that to dress it up a little nicer

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.530 
over that to dress it up a little nicer
but<00:04:12.129> this<00:04:12.340> this<00:04:12.549> works<00:04:12.790> out<00:04:12.909> pretty<00:04:13.090> well

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
but this this works out pretty well

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.699 
but this this works out pretty well
flex<00:04:14.079> ed<00:04:14.260> this<00:04:14.379> is<00:04:14.439> the<00:04:14.739> prototype<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:17.440> so

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
flex ed this is the prototype and so

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.210 
flex ed this is the prototype and so
that's<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.190> end<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.560> right<00:04:20.590> there<00:04:20.919> and<00:04:21.130> the

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
that's the end of it right there and the

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.140 
that's the end of it right there and the
other<00:04:21.250> yeah<00:04:21.940> I<00:04:23.639> have<00:04:24.639> made<00:04:25.000> up<00:04:25.180> just<00:04:25.570> like<00:04:25.720> it

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
other yeah I have made up just like it

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.580 
other yeah I have made up just like it
and<00:04:28.150> so<00:04:28.479> when<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.810> have<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.169> tied<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.500> the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
and so when you have that tied to the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.689 
and so when you have that tied to the
tree<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:30.130> sits<00:04:30.430> there<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:33.039> way<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.220> do<00:04:33.400> the

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
tree it sits there and the way I do the

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.810 
tree it sits there and the way I do the
cordage<00:04:34.090> is<00:04:34.510> I<00:04:35.320> just<00:04:35.560> take<00:04:35.740> that<00:04:35.919> and<00:04:36.220> I<00:04:36.370> figure

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
cordage is I just take that and I figure

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:48.240 
cordage is I just take that and I figure
eight<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.210> around<00:04:38.080> my<00:04:38.229> fingers

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.820 

and<00:04:49.250> slide<00:04:49.700> this<00:04:49.940> off

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.660 

animal<00:04:55.830> start<00:04:56.100> with<00:04:56.250> doing<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.670> rap<00:04:58.670> just

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
animal start with doing a rap just

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:16.520 
animal start with doing a rap just
around<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.500> figure-eight<00:05:01.500> cord

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.310 

and<00:05:17.010> this<00:05:17.220> keeps<00:05:17.460> it<00:05:17.640> nice<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:18.230> bundled<00:05:19.230> up

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
and this keeps it nice and bundled up

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.220 
and this keeps it nice and bundled up
for<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:20.150> so<00:05:21.150> when<00:05:21.300> you<00:05:21.390> get<00:05:21.510> ready<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.870> use<00:05:22.050> it

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
for you so when you get ready to use it

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.960 
for you so when you get ready to use it
everything's<00:05:22.620> not<00:05:22.800> tangled<00:05:23.220> up<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:23.700> I<00:05:23.760> just

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
everything's not tangled up and I just

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.300 
everything's not tangled up and I just
give<00:05:24.210> that<00:05:24.390> a<00:05:24.420> wrap<00:05:24.630> around<00:05:24.780> my<00:05:25.080> finger<00:05:25.440> and

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
give that a wrap around my finger and

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.400 
give that a wrap around my finger and
just<00:05:27.000> slide<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.600> tail<00:05:27.780> end<00:05:28.050> of<00:05:28.140> it<00:05:28.260> through

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
just slide the tail end of it through

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.920 
just slide the tail end of it through
there<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:31.580> pull<00:05:32.580> it<00:05:32.700> tight<00:05:32.910> so<00:05:33.390> it<00:05:33.630> keeps

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
there and pull it tight so it keeps

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.540 
there and pull it tight so it keeps
everything<00:05:34.170> nice<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:34.590> bundled<00:05:35.160> up<00:05:35.220> for<00:05:35.430> you

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
everything nice and bundled up for you

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.370 
everything nice and bundled up for you
and<00:05:35.700> when<00:05:35.820> you<00:05:35.880> get<00:05:36.000> ready<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.360> use<00:05:36.510> it<00:05:36.690> all<00:05:37.110> you

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
and when you get ready to use it all you

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.970 
and when you get ready to use it all you
do<00:05:37.560> is<00:05:37.710> just<00:05:37.890> give<00:05:38.220> it<00:05:38.340> a<00:05:38.400> tug<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:39.980> everything

do is just give it a tug and everything
pulls<00:05:41.280> right<00:05:42.120> out<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:42.510> you're<00:05:42.690> ready<00:05:42.840> to<00:05:42.960> tie

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
pulls right out so you're ready to tie

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.650 
pulls right out so you're ready to tie
to<00:05:43.200> it<00:05:43.440> real<00:05:43.920> easy<00:05:44.130> to<00:05:44.250> do<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.970> to<00:05:48.180> finish<00:05:48.510> that

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
to it real easy to do and to finish that

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.450 
to it real easy to do and to finish that
off<00:05:48.720> of<00:05:49.080> what<00:05:49.230> I<00:05:49.260> wrap<00:05:49.650> when<00:05:50.010> I<00:05:50.040> fold

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
off of what I wrap when I fold

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.909 
off of what I wrap when I fold
everything<00:05:50.910> up<00:05:51.120> and<00:05:51.360> get<00:05:52.020> it<00:05:52.110> to<00:05:52.320> a<00:05:52.350> bundle<00:05:52.740> I

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
everything up and get it to a bundle I

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.000 
everything up and get it to a bundle I
just<00:05:53.610> have<00:05:53.760> one<00:05:53.970> of<00:05:54.060> these<00:05:54.120> bungee<00:05:54.630> straps

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
just have one of these bungee straps

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.830 
just have one of these bungee straps
that<00:05:56.010> I<00:05:56.040> picked<00:05:56.310> up<00:05:56.430> at<00:05:56.760> I<00:05:57.000> think<00:05:57.660> it<00:05:57.750> was

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
that I picked up at I think it was

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.870 
that I picked up at I think it was
Gander<00:05:58.200> Mountain<00:05:58.230> so<00:05:58.770> it's<00:05:59.130> it<00:05:59.400> has<00:05:59.430> some

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
Gander Mountain so it's it has some

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.630 
Gander Mountain so it's it has some
elastic<00:06:00.780> to<00:06:00.930> it<00:06:01.110> when<00:06:01.830> you<00:06:01.950> had<00:06:02.100> this<00:06:02.250> rolled

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
elastic to it when you had this rolled

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.790 
elastic to it when you had this rolled
up<00:06:02.790> in<00:06:02.970> a<00:06:03.060> nice<00:06:03.240> bundle<00:06:03.540> you<00:06:04.050> just<00:06:04.230> wrap<00:06:04.440> around

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
up in a nice bundle you just wrap around
