00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.060
 in the sojasun team 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.680
 we use the complex regularly this 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.539
 either in recovery warm up 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.890
 hard work but also in the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.030
 management of pathologies 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.869
 is brought to meet all along 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.720
 the season on the last tour de France 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.129
 of our runners on a fall in a 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.629
 massive sprint met a big 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.899
 hematoma and a large dose m at the level 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.360
 the quadriceps and the amazement 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.010
 muscle could be lifted the same evening 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.290
 about the use of the complex him 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.820
 allowed to leave next day without what 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.790
 I'm not sure he could have finished 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.440
 step 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.440
 we have seen in recent years 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.360
 an upsurge of low back pain by 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.370
 compared to a material that is becoming 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.239
 more rigid the use of frames 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.549
 carbon red carbon cij carbon salt 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.530
 generates a lot of vibration and back 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.820
 runners therefore suffers the use 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.110
 of the endorphin program he told us 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.100
 allowed to break the vicious circle 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.060
 pain contracture contracture pain 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.429
 the amyotrophy caused by 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.280
 immobilization following a fracture 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.049
 especially where the runner can not 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.939
 practice his sport anyway in the 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.159
 first days settle very 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.469
 quickly and use of the complex 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.479
 will allow us to save time by 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.550
 recovery term avoid melting 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.900
 muscular 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.060
 who can settle in the third 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.590
 day last season I got myself I got 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.160
 am injured I fractured the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.320
 clavicle 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.370
 ten days after the championship 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.750
 of the world so 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.720
 I did not necessarily want to stay 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.240
 a long time in convalescence is fast 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.250
 back on my bike so I was using the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.950
 complex to see just not lose 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.390
 of muscle is really losing a 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.850
 minimum in my workout 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.760
 so I use them and help my 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.580
 back from the operating room in my room 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.410
 hospital and that's it I went back six 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.480
 days later on my bike and I had 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.890
 the impression of restarting as before 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.570
 and not to have lost much we have 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.370
 Frequently encountered at our runners 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.540
 immobilized as a result of injuries 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.820
 patellar syndrome problems 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.130
 we will use the program of 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.860
 why this support 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.560
 the complex a particular contribution 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.350
 effective in stimulating 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.440
 of the vast internal of things that me 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.760
 is not feasible on a voluntary basis 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.760
 during electrostimulation 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.250
 taking care of the salembre you come 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.130
 at our runners is done in three 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.170
 phases a first phase 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.740
 awakening of the muscular stunting of 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.680
 the amyotrophy we meet regularly 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.690
 following fixed assets a 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.890
 second phase where we will work on 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.510
 dynamic work 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.910
 always infra-painful in 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.540
 amplitudes finally then at 30 degrees of 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.900
 flexion and a third phase where there one 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.140
 is going to be in complete studies 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:23.120
 knee extension and will increase 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.760
 gradually work in force and 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.470
 in intensity with a dissociation that 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.370
 this electrostimulation allows to do 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.970
 between the West at term and the bass player 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.430
 this type of session is part of a 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.129
 global protocol their education 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.000
 we associate the stretching work 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.099
 hamstrings 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.900
 proprioceptive work what is 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.760
 important is to respect the rule of 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.840
 the nand or their to respect the 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.430
 working amplitudes 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.959
 and then especially to register in a 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.220
 therapeutic approach with a 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.819
 diagnosis that has been previously 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.079
 asked and a protocol of education 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.079
 which will have been fixed with the medical profession 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.900
 but
