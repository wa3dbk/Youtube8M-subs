00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.539 
keep your bottom down and you make your
chest<00:02:23.290> do<00:02:23.439> it<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.709> get<00:02:23.829> a<00:02:23.889> lot<00:02:24.129> more<00:02:24.159> out<00:02:24.519> of

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
chest do it you get a lot more out of

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.140 
chest do it you get a lot more out of
the<00:02:24.730> exercise<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.430> did<00:02:27.639> three<00:02:27.849> sets<00:02:28.060> of

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
the exercise so I did three sets of

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.000 
the exercise so I did three sets of
those<00:02:28.329> and<00:02:28.569> then<00:02:28.629> I<00:02:28.689> moved<00:02:28.959> on<00:02:29.109> to<00:02:29.319> incline

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
those and then I moved on to incline

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.270 
those and then I moved on to incline
dumbbell<00:02:30.310> press<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.920> bench

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
dumbbell press and I have the bench

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.069 
dumbbell press and I have the bench
elevated<00:02:34.120> where<00:02:34.329> I<00:02:34.359> have<00:02:34.629> three<00:02:34.930> holes

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
elevated where I have three holes

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.390 
elevated where I have three holes
showing<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:35.829> it's<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.040> little<00:02:36.280> higher<00:02:37.180> incline

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
showing so it's a little higher incline

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.690 
showing so it's a little higher incline
then<00:02:39.400> just<00:02:40.560> than<00:02:41.560> what<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.739> just<00:02:41.829> did<00:02:42.159> on<00:02:42.489> the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
then just than what I just did on the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.759 
then just than what I just did on the
incline<00:02:43.030> bench<00:02:43.780> press<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:45.250> when<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:46.769> make

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
incline bench press but when you make

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.709 
incline bench press but when you make
the<00:02:47.919> incline<00:02:48.219> a<00:02:48.250> little<00:02:48.489> steeper<00:02:48.909> you<00:02:49.449> work<00:02:49.599> a

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:49.719 
the incline a little steeper you work a

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.280 
the incline a little steeper you work a
little<00:02:49.870> higher<00:02:50.109> on<00:02:50.139> your<00:02:50.409> chest<00:02:50.859> and<00:02:52.290> these

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
little higher on your chest and these

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.140 
little higher on your chest and these
were<00:02:53.500> 20<00:02:53.889> pound<00:02:54.069> dumbbells<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.900> did<00:02:56.620> about<00:02:57.489> 17

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
were 20 pound dumbbells I did about 17

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.860 
were 20 pound dumbbells I did about 17
reps<00:02:58.449> or<00:02:58.659> so<00:02:58.870> and<00:03:00.000> usually<00:03:01.000> when<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.329> start<00:03:01.750> with

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
reps or so and usually when I start with

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.750 
reps or so and usually when I start with
these<00:03:01.989> I'll<00:03:02.199> probably<00:03:02.409> start<00:03:02.769> with<00:03:02.919> 15<00:03:03.489> s

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
these I'll probably start with 15 s

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.110 
these I'll probably start with 15 s
usually<00:03:04.829> but<00:03:05.829> since<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.159> was<00:03:06.340> warmed<00:03:06.699> up<00:03:06.819> I<00:03:06.939> went

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
usually but since I was warmed up I went

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.939 
usually but since I was warmed up I went
ahead<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.299> started<00:03:07.629> with<00:03:07.900> 20<00:03:08.260> s<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:10.590> my<00:03:11.590> next

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:11.949 
ahead and started with 20 s and my next

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:17.689 
ahead and started with 20 s and my next
set<00:03:12.069> I<00:03:12.250> jumped<00:03:12.549> up<00:03:12.609> to<00:03:13.019> 25<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:15.819> did<00:03:16.000> about<00:03:16.419> 11

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
set I jumped up to 25 and I did about 11

gripping<00:04:04.750> too<00:04:05.109> hard<00:04:05.349> because<00:04:05.829> that'll<00:04:06.219> put<00:04:06.370> it

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
gripping too hard because that'll put it

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
chest this was 20 pounds i decided to

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.110 
chest this was 20 pounds i decided to
drop<00:04:12.009> back<00:04:12.219> down<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:13.019> i<00:04:14.019> did<00:04:14.169> about<00:04:14.289> 14<00:04:15.120> reps

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
drop back down and i did about 14 reps

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.569 
drop back down and i did about 14 reps
here<00:04:16.509> and<00:04:16.799> my<00:04:17.799> chest<00:04:18.010> was<00:04:18.159> just<00:04:18.370> getting

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
here and my chest was just getting

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.179 
here and my chest was just getting
really<00:04:18.729> tired

00:04:20.179 --> 00:04:20.189 
really tired

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:29.040 
really tired
so<00:04:21.240> um<00:04:22.949> third<00:04:23.949> exercise<00:04:25.080> flat<00:04:26.080> bench<00:04:26.490> and<00:04:28.050> I

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
so um third exercise flat bench and I

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.450 
so um third exercise flat bench and I
had<00:04:29.289> 65<00:04:29.889> pounds<00:04:30.400> on<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:33.870> four<00:04:34.870> flat<00:04:35.050> bench<00:04:35.460> one

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
had 65 pounds on and four flat bench one

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.379 
had 65 pounds on and four flat bench one
I<00:04:36.490> think<00:04:36.849> it's<00:04:36.969> because<00:04:37.060> I'm<00:04:37.389> short<00:04:39.120> it's<00:04:40.120> hard

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
I think it's because I'm short it's hard

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.260 
I think it's because I'm short it's hard
for<00:04:40.449> me<00:04:40.629> to<00:04:40.780> kind<00:04:40.990> of<00:04:41.050> reach<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.469> ground<00:04:42.270> but

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
for me to kind of reach the ground but
