00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
on and you can see that moves around

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.899 
on and you can see that moves around
with<00:01:36.869> my<00:01:37.020> view<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.220> ahead<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.549> move<00:01:38.700> it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
with my view as I go ahead and move it

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.660 
with my view as I go ahead and move it
and<00:01:39.479> again<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> camera<00:01:41.250> we've<00:01:41.490> got<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
and again with the camera we've got the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.130

and<00:03:33.609> edit<00:03:33.730> my<00:03:34.030> scene<00:03:34.359> and<00:03:34.900> I've<00:03:34.989> got<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.200> few

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
and edit my scene and I've got a few

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.289 
and edit my scene and I've got a few
tabs<00:03:35.680> here<00:03:35.859> on<00:03:35.920> my<00:03:36.069> basic<00:03:36.489> tab<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.090> change

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
tabs here on my basic tab you can change

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.509 
tabs here on my basic tab you can change
for<00:03:37.540> example<00:03:37.989> you<00:03:38.530> can<00:03:38.680> have<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:38.859> basic<00:03:39.310> color

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
for example you can have a basic color

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.680 
for example you can have a basic color
as<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.790> background<00:03:39.910> or<00:03:40.269> you<00:03:40.390> can<00:03:40.510> have<00:03:40.660> a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
as the background or you can have a

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.650 
as the background or you can have a
gradient<00:03:40.989> so<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.590> can<00:03:41.799> change<00:03:42.100> my<00:03:42.459> top<00:03:43.120> gradient

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
gradient so I can change my top gradient

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.449 
gradient so I can change my top gradient
I'm<00:03:43.840> gonna<00:03:44.109> go<00:03:44.260> for<00:03:44.410> this<00:03:44.500> light<00:03:44.799> gray<00:03:45.130> here

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
I'm gonna go for this light gray here

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.300 
I'm gonna go for this light gray here
and<00:03:45.880> for<00:03:46.569> my<00:03:46.690> base<00:03:46.900> gradient<00:03:47.440> I'm<00:03:47.859> gonna<00:03:48.069> go

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
and for my base gradient I'm gonna go

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.180 
and for my base gradient I'm gonna go
for<00:03:48.639> this<00:03:49.269> darker<00:03:49.720> gray<00:03:49.930> color<00:03:50.200> here<00:03:50.500> we<00:03:51.040> can

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
for this darker gray color here we can

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.640 
for this darker gray color here we can
see<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.459> applies<00:03:51.819> over<00:03:52.569> on<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.959> side<00:03:53.200> here<00:03:53.500> on

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
see it applies over on the side here on

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.440 
see it applies over on the side here on
the<00:03:53.739> right<00:03:53.950> hand<00:03:53.980> side<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.209> can<00:03:55.269> also

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
the right hand side and you can also

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.080 
the right hand side and you can also
control<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.989> floor<00:03:56.380> reflections<00:03:57.010> etc<00:03:57.700> and

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
control the floor reflections etc and

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.610 
control the floor reflections etc and
where<00:03:58.420> your<00:03:58.600> bottom<00:03:58.810> view<00:03:59.079> plane<00:03:59.380> will<00:03:59.590> be

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
where your bottom view plane will be

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.990 
where your bottom view plane will be
we're<00:03:59.920> not<00:04:00.040> going<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.220> take<00:04:00.549> a<00:04:00.579> look<00:04:00.760> at<00:04:00.910> that

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
we're not going to take a look at that

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.390 
we're not going to take a look at that
right<00:04:01.209> now<00:04:01.389> though<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:02.500> if<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.680> skip<00:04:02.920> over<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.220> my

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
right now though so if I skip over to my

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.970 
right now though so if I skip over to my
illuminations<00:04:04.209> tab<00:04:04.600> we've<00:04:05.290> got<00:04:05.440> control<00:04:05.950> of

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
illuminations tab we've got control of

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.740 
illuminations tab we've got control of
the<00:04:06.310> background<00:04:06.730> illumination<00:04:06.970> which<00:04:07.510> makes

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
the background illumination which makes

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.140 
the background illumination which makes
it<00:04:07.900> lighter<00:04:08.170> or<00:04:08.859> darker<00:04:08.920> so<00:04:09.850> I'm<00:04:09.880> just<00:04:10.030> going

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
it lighter or darker so I'm just going

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.479 
it lighter or darker so I'm just going
to<00:04:10.239> turn<00:04:10.359> that<00:04:10.510> down<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.780> about<00:04:10.930> 1.2<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:11.799> then

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
to turn that down to about 1.2 and then

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.860 
to turn that down to about 1.2 and then
the<00:04:12.579> rendering<00:04:12.940> brightness<00:04:13.269> controls<00:04:13.720> the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
the rendering brightness controls the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.500 
the rendering brightness controls the
brightness<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.319> your<00:04:14.440> actual<00:04:14.680> model<00:04:15.010> itself

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
brightness of your actual model itself

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.779 
brightness of your actual model itself
I'm<00:04:16.510> gonna<00:04:16.720> again<00:04:17.350> if<00:04:18.039> I<00:04:18.190> throw<00:04:18.340> in<00:04:18.400> that<00:04:18.549> too

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
I'm gonna again if I throw in that too

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.240 
I'm gonna again if I throw in that too
much<00:04:18.970> I'll<00:04:19.239> leave<00:04:19.419> it<00:04:19.600> down<00:04:19.900> at<00:04:20.019> about<00:04:20.229> 1.5<00:04:20.889> and

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
much I'll leave it down at about 1.5 and

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.250 
much I'll leave it down at about 1.5 and
then<00:04:21.849> you've<00:04:22.000> got<00:04:22.120> scene<00:04:22.450> reflectivity<00:04:23.020> which

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
then you've got scene reflectivity which

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.800 
then you've got scene reflectivity which
you<00:04:23.500> can<00:04:23.650> turn<00:04:23.860> up<00:04:24.039> or<00:04:24.220> down<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.789> again<00:04:25.240> we

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
you can turn up or down and again we

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.700 
you can turn up or down and again we
won't<00:04:25.960> modify

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
won't modify

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.290 
won't modify
like<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:26.979> today<00:04:27.340> but<00:04:27.669> that's<00:04:27.850> where<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.240> is

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
ahead now in terms of lights if we

ahead now in terms of lights if we
expand<00:04:36.280> our<00:04:36.430> lights<00:04:36.580> we<00:04:36.759> can<00:04:36.880> see<00:04:37.000> we've<00:04:37.090> got

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
expand our lights we can see we've got

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.700 
expand our lights we can see we've got
the<00:04:37.300> ambient<00:04:37.750> light<00:04:37.960> which<00:04:38.139> is<00:04:38.289> kind<00:04:38.500> of<00:04:38.560> your

the ambient light which is kind of your

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.850 
the ambient light which is kind of your
general<00:04:39.160> sunlight<00:04:40.319> and<00:04:41.319> then<00:04:41.470> we've<00:04:41.560> got<00:04:41.680> two

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
general sunlight and then we've got two

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.040 
general sunlight and then we've got two
directional<00:04:42.430> lights<00:04:42.669> now<00:04:42.940> currently<00:04:43.389> these

two items are yellow which means they're

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.939 
two items are yellow which means they're

small<00:06:29.409> here<00:06:29.590> but<00:06:29.710> as<00:06:29.830> you<00:06:29.919> can<00:06:30.039> see<00:06:30.219> you<00:06:30.310> can<00:06:30.460> do

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
small here but as you can see you can do

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.820 
small here but as you can see you can do
larger<00:06:31.000> images<00:06:31.389> obviously<00:06:31.840> be<00:06:32.020> aware<00:06:32.229> that

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
larger images obviously be aware that

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.769 
larger images obviously be aware that
the<00:06:33.099> larger<00:06:33.460> image<00:06:33.610> size<00:06:33.940> you<00:06:34.090> go<00:06:34.270> for<00:06:34.570> it<00:06:34.659> the

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779 
the larger image size you go for it the

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.160 
the larger image size you go for it the
longer<00:06:35.080> it's<00:06:35.229> going<00:06:35.349> to<00:06:35.409> take<00:06:35.650> to<00:06:36.159> render

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170 
longer it's going to take to render

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.140

now I'm ready to go ahead and produce a
final<00:06:46.620> render<00:06:47.100> of<00:06:47.250> that<00:06:47.460> so<00:06:48.300> I'll<00:06:48.450> take<00:06:49.020> a

things<00:07:09.030> before<00:07:09.210> we<00:07:09.480> do<00:07:09.630> that<00:07:09.660> you<00:07:10.320> could<00:07:10.440> see

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
things before we do that you could see

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.230 
things before we do that you could see
the<00:07:10.710> nice<00:07:10.890> crisp<00:07:11.280> shadow<00:07:11.610> that's<00:07:11.820> appeared<00:07:12.150> to

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
the nice crisp shadow that's appeared to

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.909 
the nice crisp shadow that's appeared to
the<00:07:12.330> right-hand<00:07:12.750> side<00:07:12.990> we<00:07:13.200> got<00:07:13.320> a<00:07:13.380> softer

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 
the right-hand side we got a softer

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.130 
the right-hand side we got a softer
shadow<00:07:14.160> over<00:07:15.060> to<00:07:15.180> the<00:07:15.270> left<00:07:15.540> we<00:07:15.750> can<00:07:15.870> see<00:07:16.020> the

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.140 
shadow over to the left we can see the

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.140 
shadow over to the left we can see the
reflectivities<00:07:16.650> on<00:07:17.010> the<00:07:17.100> grass<00:07:17.340> there's<00:07:17.970> also

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
reflectivities on the grass there's also

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.850 
reflectivities on the grass there's also
a<00:07:18.300> bit<00:07:18.480> of<00:07:18.570> reflection<00:07:18.840> in<00:07:19.230> the<00:07:19.290> ground<00:07:19.560> there

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
a bit of reflection in the ground there

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.860 
a bit of reflection in the ground there
so<00:07:20.160> these<00:07:20.760> are<00:07:20.910> all<00:07:20.970> settings<00:07:21.390> that<00:07:21.510> we've<00:07:21.660> got

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
so these are all settings that we've got

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.200 
so these are all settings that we've got
control<00:07:22.080> over<00:07:22.350> and<00:07:23.160> now<00:07:23.340> I<00:07:23.370> can<00:07:23.610> go<00:07:23.760> ahead<00:07:24.030> and

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
control over and now I can go ahead and

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.650 
control over and now I can go ahead and
save<00:07:24.660> this<00:07:24.840> image<00:07:25.140> out<00:07:25.350> and<00:07:26.330> as<00:07:27.330> you<00:07:27.480> can<00:07:27.600> see

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.260 
save this image out and as you can see
you<00:07:28.560> can<00:07:28.710> save<00:07:28.950> it<00:07:29.100> out<00:07:29.250> turn<00:07:29.550> to<00:07:29.910> various

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270
