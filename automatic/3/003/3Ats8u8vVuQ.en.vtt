pockets<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.500> air<00:01:51.710> beaten<00:01:52.400> into<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.790> butter

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
pockets of air beaten into the butter

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.930 
pockets of air beaten into the butter
via<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.810> sugar<00:01:54.220> I'm<00:01:55.220> going<00:01:55.400> to<00:01:55.460> go<00:01:55.550> ahead<00:01:55.580> and

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
via the sugar I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.090 
via the sugar I'm going to go ahead and
take<00:01:56.060> my<00:01:56.270> dry<00:01:56.570> ingredients<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:57.320> sift<00:01:57.950> them

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
take my dry ingredients and sift them

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.670 
take my dry ingredients and sift them
together<00:01:58.550> cake<00:01:59.030> flour<00:02:01.690> soda<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:03.050> powder

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.740 

cocoa<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:07.990> last<00:02:08.990> are<00:02:09.260> salt<00:02:10.630> sifting<00:02:11.630> is

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
cocoa and last are salt sifting is

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.240 
cocoa and last are salt sifting is
really<00:02:12.020> important<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.500> help<00:02:12.709> blend<00:02:12.980> all<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
really important to help blend all the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.910 
really important to help blend all the
ingredients<00:02:13.400> together<00:02:14.170> once<00:02:15.170> our<00:02:15.380> sugar<00:02:15.650> gets

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
ingredients together once our sugar gets

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.340 
ingredients together once our sugar gets
creamed<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.390> same<00:02:17.600> fashion<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.080> I've

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
creamed in the same fashion that I've

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.260 
creamed in the same fashion that I've
gradually<00:02:19.010> added<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.459> sugar<00:02:19.790> into<00:02:20.150> the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
gradually added in the sugar into the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.970 
gradually added in the sugar into the
mixer<00:02:20.630> it's<00:02:21.050> really<00:02:21.320> important<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:21.800> the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
mixer it's really important that the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.890 
mixer it's really important that the
eggs<00:02:22.160> be<00:02:22.400> added<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:22.790> one<00:02:23.120> at<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.330> time<00:02:23.600> because

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
eggs be added in one at a time because

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.660 
eggs be added in one at a time because
the<00:02:24.140> butter<00:02:24.350> can<00:02:24.530> only<00:02:24.680> absorb<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.250> eggs<00:02:25.459> at<00:02:25.640> a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
the butter can only absorb the eggs at a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.090 
the butter can only absorb the eggs at a
certain<00:02:25.940> rate<00:02:26.410> having<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.530> eggs<00:02:27.740> out<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:28.040> the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
certain rate having the eggs out of the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.770 
certain rate having the eggs out of the
shell<00:02:28.370> really<00:02:28.670> allows<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.300> just<00:02:29.510> go<00:02:29.630> ahead

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
shell really allows you to just go ahead

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.890 
shell really allows you to just go ahead
and<00:02:29.900> pour<00:02:30.230> once<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.130> yolk<00:02:31.340> drops<00:02:31.670> in<00:02:31.940> let<00:02:32.780> it

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
and pour once a yolk drops in let it

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.790 
and pour once a yolk drops in let it
beat<00:02:33.050> around<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.950> let<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.160> get<00:02:34.340> absorbed<00:02:35.800> and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
beat around and let it get absorbed and

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.560 
beat around and let it get absorbed and
once<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.160> starts<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.550> get<00:02:37.640> incorporated<00:02:37.970> add

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
once it starts to get incorporated add

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.259 
once it starts to get incorporated add
in<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.500> next<00:02:39.769> day<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.280> we<00:02:40.340> basically<00:02:40.519> have<00:02:41.030> our

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
in the next day so we basically have our

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.110 
in the next day so we basically have our
dry<00:02:41.570> ingredients<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.980> bowl<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.430> then<00:02:44.030> we

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
dry ingredients in a bowl and then we

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.670 
dry ingredients in a bowl and then we
have<00:02:44.269> our<00:02:44.450> wet<00:02:44.630> ingredients<00:02:44.660> or<00:02:45.410> buttermilk

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
have our wet ingredients or buttermilk

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.810 
have our wet ingredients or buttermilk
and<00:02:46.070> our<00:02:46.310> coffee<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:47.380> our<00:02:48.380> vanilla<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:49.550> wet

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
and our coffee and our vanilla is wet

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.520 
and our coffee and our vanilla is wet
ingredients<00:02:50.420> can<00:02:50.630> be<00:02:50.690> combined<00:02:52.810> way<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:54.140> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
ingredients can be combined way that the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.110 
ingredients can be combined way that the
mixture<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.010> incorporated<00:02:55.670> as<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.880> wind<00:02:56.030> up

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
mixture is incorporated as you wind up

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.300 
mixture is incorporated as you wind up
taking<00:02:56.269> about<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.660> third<00:02:57.050> of<00:02:57.320> your<00:02:58.040> dry

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
taking about a third of your dry

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.060 
taking about a third of your dry
ingredients<00:02:58.340> just<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.060> third<00:02:59.300> by<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.950> get<00:03:00.950> them

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
ingredients just the third by I get them

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.470 
ingredients just the third by I get them
blend<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.430> into<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.850> egg<00:03:02.000> yolk<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.390> the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
blend it into the egg yolk and the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.710 
blend it into the egg yolk and the
butter<00:03:02.690> mixture<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:04.160> mix<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:06.320> just<00:03:06.650> until<00:03:07.720> it

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
butter mixture and mix it just until it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.009 
butter mixture and mix it just until it
gets<00:03:09.440> combined<00:03:09.920> don't<00:03:10.670> overmix<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.510> really

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
gets combined don't overmix it really

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.130 
gets combined don't overmix it really
important

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.140 

don't<00:03:17.770> turn<00:03:17.950> up<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.190> speed<00:03:18.460> too<00:03:18.700> high<00:03:18.910> either

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
don't turn up the speed too high either

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.820 
don't turn up the speed too high either
if<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.569> really<00:03:19.810> crank<00:03:20.080> up<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.350> speed<00:03:20.380> you

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
if you really crank up the speed you

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.470 
if you really crank up the speed you
have<00:03:20.860> flour<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.520> there<00:03:21.700> you're<00:03:22.090> just<00:03:22.120> going<00:03:22.420> to

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
have flour in there you're just going to

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.059 
have flour in there you're just going to
send<00:03:22.660> flour<00:03:22.959> all<00:03:23.200> over<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.560> place<00:03:23.770> and<00:03:23.920> make<00:03:24.040> a

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
send flour all over the place and make a

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.430 
send flour all over the place and make a
big<00:03:24.310> mess<00:03:24.490> then<00:03:25.240> our<00:03:25.390> next<00:03:25.450> step<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:25.990> add<00:03:26.140> in

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
big mess then our next step is to add in

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.260 
big mess then our next step is to add in
some<00:03:26.830> of<00:03:26.950> our<00:03:27.040> liquids<00:03:27.520> we're<00:03:27.880> going<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.060> take

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
some of our liquids we're going to take

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.040 
some of our liquids we're going to take
half<00:03:28.480> of<00:03:28.690> our<00:03:28.870> liquid<00:03:29.520> and<00:03:30.520> add<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:30.910> in<00:03:31.050> again

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
half of our liquid and add it in again

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.000 
half of our liquid and add it in again
just<00:03:32.350> by<00:03:32.500> eye<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.740> fine<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:35.470> then<00:03:35.590> mix<00:03:35.860> that

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
just by eye is fine and then mix that

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.050 
just by eye is fine and then mix that
until<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.459> gets<00:03:36.640> combined<00:03:38.550> then<00:03:39.550> once<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:39.880> gets

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
until it gets combined then once it gets

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.540 
until it gets combined then once it gets
combined<00:03:40.510> we<00:03:41.200> just<00:03:41.440> simply<00:03:41.800> repeat<00:03:42.520> the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
combined we just simply repeat the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.880 
combined we just simply repeat the
process<00:03:42.850> than<00:03:43.540> another<00:03:44.260> third<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.650> dry

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
process than another third of dry

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.460 
process than another third of dry
ingredients<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.940> following<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.930> last<00:03:47.080> half

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
ingredients the following the last half

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.990 
ingredients the following the last half
of<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.620> wet<00:03:47.800> ingredients<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.550> then<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.850> last

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
of the wet ingredients and then the last

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.270 
of the wet ingredients and then the last
third<00:03:49.390> of<00:03:49.540> dry<00:03:49.750> ingredients<00:03:49.900> once<00:03:50.860> everything

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
third of dry ingredients once everything

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.400 
third of dry ingredients once everything
gets<00:03:51.310> just<00:03:52.060> combined<00:03:52.450> then<00:03:52.840> we<00:03:52.959> go<00:03:53.080> ahead<00:03:53.200> and

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
gets just combined then we go ahead and

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.259 
gets just combined then we go ahead and
get<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.650> into<00:03:53.770> our<00:03:53.890> cupcake<00:03:54.340> pans<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:54.910> we<00:03:55.090> bake

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
get it into our cupcake pans and we bake
