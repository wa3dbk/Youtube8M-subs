00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.440
 hello everyone you read and watch gonzam 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.180
 ag.ru 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.880
 we have a very unusual guest today 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.880
 perhaps the most expected of the flagships 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.090
 mobile line of 2012 is likely 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.890
 it will be the best selling flagship in 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.130
 this year if you have not guessed that 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.130
 this is samsung galaxy s4 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.370
 the first thing I would like to mention is 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.230
 device design is used here 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.600
 polycarbonate plastic 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.610
 to be exact the design is not strong 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.440
 changed in comparison with the previous one 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.649
 samsung galaxy s3 model 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.790
 but all the same some differences 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.469
 there are at least physical ones 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.070
 device dimensions as it stands here 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.200
 the screen is 5 inches so design 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.059
 a little bit modified yet 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.980
 the device is much nicer in the hand 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.609
 it really is so they 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.729
 feel like some kind of crazy here 

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:09.560
 there is light plastic which is very fragile 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.920
 he really feels like 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.600
 qualitatively assembled machine again 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.600
 back panel so we can remove it 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.010
 she is very thin and very light she 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.960
 literally in the hands of the same bend that is 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.920
 You can say that it is enough 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 strong and not fragile also inside we 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.240
 see this 2600 milliamp battery 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.280
 Hours sufficiently capacious will tell later 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.160
 slot for micro sd card using 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.620
 which can extend memory by 64 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.590
 gigabyte three also slot for micro sim 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.410
 cards and of course everything is now 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.320
 use it exactly speaker speaker 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.440
 projects and also later on 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.060
 actually putting the cover which 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.869
 pretty tight sits down there is no 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.350
 no backlash 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.900
 assembly is very high quality again there 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.540
 the ability to always buy back 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.070
 wall back panel in this way 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.640
 do something like there with the device well and 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.590
 Of course you can note to notice on 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.580
 the flip cover urinals which are very 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.050
 it will be convenient to go to the top panel 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.480
 As for the screen the screen is very us 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.610
 pleasantly surprised here is 5 inches 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:27.060
 amoled full hd 1920 by 1080 pixels 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.410
 which has excellent viewing angles i 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.060
 try to show you 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.340
 Glazysh really crazy there 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.220
 feeling that before you is this 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.140
 Here is a plastic sample under which 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.910
 the glass of which is printed 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.770
 the image on paper is very good and 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.470
 very juicy and really his 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.360
 almost from all sides can be seen and from 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.700
 all parties considered it not 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.490
 whitish screen no he really 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.160
 That's very good and the main thing is that only 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.340
 this is very aha christmas tree 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.050
 we conducted tests last comment can even 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.050
 here on the device open the screenshot 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.360
 it can be seen here 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.720
 30 percent battery charge and screen 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.819
 five hours and 46 minutes 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.160
 accordingly, the apparatus worked like that 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.250
 am the screen worked about six hours 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.880
 it really is so with brightness 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.870
 It was set to maximum when the machine 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.750
 the sound gives this one here is small 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.319
 column but the sound is very pleasant 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.940
 very juicy very interesting of course his 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.239
 Difficult to compare with AC di van 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.230
 flagship corporation from taiwan 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.090
 because there is beats audio and 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.920
 stereo system but still no sound 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.320
 very clean and if you take calls 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.190
 if you want to be notified 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.830
 then this is quite enough hayloft 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.080
 smartphone features basically this of course 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.730
 let's not hide this marketing 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.610
 moves from the management of the eyes of control 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.720
 gestures cornering 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.630
 all this is not the main thing 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.900
 have samsung galaxy s4 today samsung 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.680
 galaxy s4 today is a great fast 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.260
 flagship that works great fast 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.700
 which is nice to hold in your hand 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.870
 which call nicely 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.289
 nice to write with but where m Sorry 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.890
 without a drop of tar in a barrel of honey 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:25.229
 there are very convenient touch keys but 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.530
 the only physical key in this 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.120
 the phone 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.520
 which is centered and which 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.240
 slightly increased in size compared 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.520
 from 3 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.810
 but with me it is not convenient especially 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.380
 uncomfortable instagram 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:42.389
 where are you trying to get out can very easily 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.389
 click on joint new knowledge 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:48.060
 that's what happens after using 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.129
 phone two days can literally 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.500
 say one smartphone holds battery 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.909
 great it has a great screen and very 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.379
 nice column that gives out 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.689
 excellent sound pressure 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:00.120
 everything is very nice everything is very fast 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:02.189
 Essentially it's a samsung galaxy s3 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.129
 this smartphone fascinates literally right away 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:07.259
 you take it in hand you can twist in 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.020
 hands would understand that the smartphone is evil because 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.879
 that he is really very different 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.190
 smartphones I can not say this for a long time 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:16.560
 because lately everything 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.050
 they are measured by the same great 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.360
 the number of pixels per inch we have is super 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.389
 there is a mega processor with eight cores 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.960
 yes here it is 10 to 10 pixels 1 to 10 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.430
 Sick but all this is not to suit when you 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.120
 you take in hand and the smartphone starts 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.120
 like 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.639
 samsung galaxy s4 smartphone which 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:40.440
 like there are some cons in this 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.450
 nas andrade 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.680
 but unfortunately the only physical 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.230
 button that is in this device 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.060
 us on this panel this is this 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.940
 home button as it is called 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.860
 done well let's say not very well 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.280
 because by clicking on it you can 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.210
 do anything you put 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.890
 finger differently 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.660
 you can for example call some 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.570
 application i like several times 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.610
 called contacts called messages here 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.750
 these instagram apps whenever you want 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.240
 get out you start 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.980
 taking pictures and this is unfortunately very 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.630
 conveniently from the touch keys on the contrary 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.340
 I want to highlight they are very good and 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.470
 very pleasant disappear literally right there 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.980
 Very soon a smartphone will appear for sale 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.320
 the price will start from 29 thousand 990 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.180
