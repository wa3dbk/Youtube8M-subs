 hi my name is jaqueline the gates 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.359
 party decorator and I'll show you today 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.280
 for you some tips on how to decorate 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.349
 your birthday party 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.670
 The first tip will be a little bag 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.340
 with a good 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.090
 a chocolate truffle the materials that 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.500
 we will use it is so good, is not it? 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.949
 chocolate truffle 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.800
 the satin ribbon buttons and the fabric the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.820
 first step we'll take a compass 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.770
 on average it at 11 centimeters because 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.399
 with this opening we will do 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.020
 the circle to then cut 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.579
 center the compass in the middle of the fabric 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.489
 Let's turn the detail to 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.129
 it does not appear we do not cut 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.250
 centralized agent in the middle of 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.250
 fabric and make 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.770
 We're going to use the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.780
 pecking because it gives a finish 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.820
 better when the bundle has 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.640
 finished 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.390
 so now we just cut it up 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.310
 of the circle we made 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.300
 He does not have to be right and on time. 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.340
 close 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.340
 He already gives a beautiful detail. 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.230
 Now we get the bongo put in the middle. 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.960
 and to close we will use the tape 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.960
 satin 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.100
 and to give the finishing touch we can 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.450
 choose any button I 'll choose the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:12.369
 pearl gets delicate puts a little 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:12.369
 hot glue place in the middle of the acim 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.840
 and this is our finished pack 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.710
 the next tip I'm going to give you 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.300
 it's like making a weathervane it can be 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.120
 used to decorate the table of 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.560
 invited guests or the main table that 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.780
 you do a smaller size alone 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.790
 you can even decorate the souvenirs too 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.910
 that you will read the guests 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.940
 the materials used are double paper 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.820
 face 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.820
 I put on a barbecue stick 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.209
 so the first step is going to be 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.370
 export the paper you can make in 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.130
 different sizes we will use this 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.240
 first 10 by 10 centimeters 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:13.030
 so let's put it here is 10 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:15.570
 centimeters use the stylus title for 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.570
 cut 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:27.010
 he is double faced then both sides 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:29.380
 they are colorful next step to us 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.410
 will put diagonally and make a 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.420
 cut with stiletto can not to center 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.320
 More or less, it's not that it's a little 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.690
 less than half on all sides 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.760
 now we're going to pick up every part that the 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:48.880
 people have imported it and it goes up to 16 with the glue 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.590
 hot setting a little glue 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.690
 hot in the middle and put from above to paste 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.019
 so you're putting a yes or no and 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.019
 put this on and jump to the next 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:13.470
 Choose a button that matches up 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:13.470
 cool checks a hot school 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.310
 to tighten it, do not let go. 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.960
 We'll get the toothpick later. 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:37.030
 barbecue and the weathervane a bit 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:40.350
 hot glue finishes to dry and 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.350
 This is the weathervane ready
