with jean de sette and in bulb art hall
where<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.500> looked<00:00:10.889> at<00:00:10.980> empathy<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.759> helping

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
where we looked at empathy and helping

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.810 
where we looked at empathy and helping
behavior<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.780> rats

behavior in rats

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.730 
behavior in rats
we've<00:00:14.820> known<00:00:15.089> for<00:00:15.120> some<00:00:15.389> time<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.809> rats<00:00:16.289> show

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
we've known for some time that rats show

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.859 
we've known for some time that rats show
the<00:00:16.949> simplest<00:00:17.400> form<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.850> empathy<00:00:18.270> emotional

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the simplest form of empathy emotional

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.950 
the simplest form of empathy emotional
contagion<00:00:19.460> such<00:00:20.460> as<00:00:20.670> one<00:00:21.029> baby<00:00:21.270> cries<00:00:21.600> all<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
contagion such as one baby cries all the

contagion such as one baby cries all the
babies<00:00:22.380> cry<00:00:23.119> we<00:00:24.119> wanted<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.539> see<00:00:24.750> if<00:00:24.840> rats

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
babies cry we wanted to see if rats

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.349 
babies cry we wanted to see if rats
would<00:00:25.320> go<00:00:25.560> beyond<00:00:25.949> emotional<00:00:26.699> contagion<00:00:27.029> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
would go beyond emotional contagion to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.740 
would go beyond emotional contagion to
actively<00:00:27.779> help<00:00:28.199> another<00:00:28.529> rat<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.010> distress

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
actively help another rat in distress

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.209 
actively help another rat in distress
this<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.960> really<00:00:31.199> asking<00:00:31.560> quite<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> bit<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
this is really asking quite a bit of a

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.639 
this is really asking quite a bit of a
rat<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.610> active<00:00:33.030> helping<00:00:33.450> requires<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
rat as active helping requires that the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.130 
rat as active helping requires that the
helper<00:00:35.070> rat<00:00:35.280> down<00:00:35.730> regulate<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.480> fear<00:00:36.750> he<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
helper rat down regulate the fear he is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.860 
helper rat down regulate the fear he is
experiencing<00:00:38.040> through<00:00:38.820> emotional<00:00:39.510> contagion

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
experiencing through emotional contagion

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.260 
experiencing through emotional contagion
in<00:00:40.860> other<00:00:41.040> words<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.700> helper<00:00:41.969> has<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
in other words the helper has to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.869 
in other words the helper has to
suppress<00:00:42.870> his<00:00:43.170> natural<00:00:43.649> response<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.399> frozen

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
suppress his natural response of frozen

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.690 
suppress his natural response of frozen
immobility<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.930> actually<00:00:46.559> move<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.340> help<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
immobility and actually move to help the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.450 
immobility and actually move to help the
other<00:00:47.850> rat<00:00:48.170> so<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.289> put<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> free<00:00:49.800> rat<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.430> rat

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
other rat so we put a free rat the rat

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.549 
other rat so we put a free rat the rat
with<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> black<00:00:51.030> dot<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.360> his<00:00:51.690> head<00:00:51.899> into<00:00:52.469> an

from<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> outside<00:00:59.910> by<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.750> free<00:01:01.079> rat<00:01:01.340> here

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
from the outside by the free rat here

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.709 
from the outside by the free rat here
you're<00:01:02.520> seeing<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> first<00:01:03.149> five<00:01:03.480> minutes

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you're seeing the first five minutes

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.859 
you're seeing the first five minutes
sped<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.129> first<00:01:05.369> day<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.610> testing<00:01:06.180> even

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
sped up on the first day of testing even

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.080 
sped up on the first day of testing even
though<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> takes<00:01:07.560> quite<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.520> bit<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.880> rat

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
though it takes quite a bit of rat

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.600 
though it takes quite a bit of rat
courage<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.840> venture<00:01:10.229> into<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.680> scary<00:01:11.100> arena

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
courage to venture into the scary arena

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.359 
courage to venture into the scary arena
center<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.689> free<00:01:12.900> rat<00:01:13.110> persists<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.950> moving

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
center the free rat persists in moving

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.100 
center the free rat persists in moving
to<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> center<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.150> trying<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.659> figure<00:01:15.930> this

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to the center and trying to figure this

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.109 
to the center and trying to figure this
restrainer<00:01:16.650> thing<00:01:16.979> out<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.400> he<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.670> help<00:01:17.909> his

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
restrainer thing out so he can help his

restrainer thing out so he can help his
cage<00:01:18.360> mate

cage mate

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.280 
cage mate
so<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.360> clip<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> rats<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.259> been

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
so now in this clip the rats have been

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.410 
so now in this clip the rats have been
in<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.680> paradigm<00:01:23.130> several<00:01:23.580> times<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.240> is

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
in this paradigm several times this is

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.450 
in this paradigm several times this is
the<00:01:24.570> fifth<00:01:24.840> day<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.110> testing<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.310> we're

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the fifth day of testing and we're

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.460 
the fifth day of testing and we're
viewing<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.119> session<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.689> real<00:01:27.900> time<00:01:28.200> but

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
viewing the session in real time but

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.190 
viewing the session in real time but
after<00:01:28.650> 25<00:01:29.340> minutes<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.820> elapsed<00:01:30.360> what<00:01:31.079> you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
after 25 minutes have elapsed what you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
after 25 minutes have elapsed what you
see<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> free<00:01:32.189> rat<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.670> very<00:01:32.939> focused

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
see is that the free rat is very focused

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420 
see is that the free rat is very focused
on<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.689> door<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.500> will<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.829> him<00:01:34.920> open<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
on the door you will see him open the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.910 
on the door you will see him open the
door<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.000> first<00:01:36.210> time<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.810> moment<00:01:37.200> what

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
door for the first time in a moment what

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.590 
door for the first time in a moment what
I<00:01:37.950> want<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.430> notice<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.390> free

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
I want you to notice is that the free

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.440 
I want you to notice is that the free
rat<00:01:39.840> freezes<00:01:40.530> he<00:01:41.070> freezes<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> door

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
rat freezes he freezes because the door

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.630 
rat freezes he freezes because the door
falls<00:01:42.810> over<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.409> since<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.159> first<00:01:44.430> time

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
falls over and since it's the first time

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.819
