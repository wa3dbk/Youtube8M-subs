well<00:00:08.550> here<00:00:09.550> we<00:00:09.670> are<00:00:09.700> with<00:00:10.180> the<00:00:10.420> ar<00:00:10.930> e<00:00:11.580> process

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
well here we are with the ar e process

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.930 
well here we are with the ar e process
which<00:00:12.760> is<00:00:12.940> acoustic<00:00:13.860> resonance<00:00:14.940> enhancement

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
which is acoustic resonance enhancement

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.480 
which is acoustic resonance enhancement
most<00:00:16.930> people<00:00:17.230> like<00:00:17.410> older<00:00:17.860> instruments<00:00:18.369> they

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
most people like older instruments they

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.520 
most people like older instruments they
sound<00:00:18.789> great<00:00:19.030> but<00:00:19.930> there<00:00:20.050> was<00:00:20.170> a<00:00:20.199> little<00:00:20.350> bit

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.530 
sound great but there was a little bit

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.439 
sound great but there was a little bit
of<00:00:20.650> a<00:00:20.740> dilemma<00:00:21.130> with<00:00:21.430> Yamaha<00:00:21.670> as<00:00:22.119> they<00:00:22.270> make

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
of a dilemma with Yamaha as they make

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.240 
of a dilemma with Yamaha as they make
new<00:00:22.690> instruments<00:00:23.230> you<00:00:23.650> can't<00:00:23.830> make<00:00:23.980> an<00:00:24.100> old

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
new instruments you can't make an old

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.910 
new instruments you can't make an old
instrument<00:00:24.430> so<00:00:25.240> they<00:00:25.600> went<00:00:26.260> on<00:00:26.440> quite<00:00:26.859> a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
instrument so they went on quite a

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.069 
instrument so they went on quite a
course<00:00:27.310> of<00:00:28.619> research<00:00:29.619> and<00:00:30.510> an<00:00:31.510> adventurous

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
course of research and an adventurous

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.000 
course of research and an adventurous
research<00:00:32.499> into<00:00:32.949> how<00:00:33.609> can<00:00:33.850> we<00:00:33.999> make<00:00:34.420> would

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
research into how can we make would

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.219 
research into how can we make would
behave<00:00:36.010> and<00:00:36.429> sound<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:37.239> way<00:00:37.359> old<00:00:37.629> wood<00:00:37.929> does

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:38.229 
behave and sound the way old wood does

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:40.139 
behave and sound the way old wood does
and<00:00:38.589> they<00:00:38.920> did<00:00:39.249> come<00:00:39.489> up<00:00:39.639> with<00:00:39.789> an<00:00:39.879> actual

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
and they did come up with an actual

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.270 
and they did come up with an actual
process<00:00:40.449> that<00:00:41.199> they<00:00:41.289> can<00:00:41.440> do<00:00:41.530> that<00:00:41.710> which<00:00:42.129> is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
process that they can do that which is

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.789 
process that they can do that which is
the<00:00:42.399> ar<00:00:42.699> e<00:00:42.729> process<00:00:43.269> the<00:00:43.989> bass<00:00:44.170> I'm<00:00:44.350> playing<00:00:44.589> on

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:44.799 
the ar e process the bass I'm playing on

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:46.590 
the ar e process the bass I'm playing on
the<00:00:44.829> tour<00:00:45.190> amount<00:00:45.519> currently<00:00:45.909> is<00:00:46.210> of<00:00:46.389> course

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
the tour amount currently is of course

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.509 
the tour amount currently is of course
made<00:00:46.839> of<00:00:47.109> this<00:00:47.409> wood<00:00:47.679> know<00:00:47.829> and<00:00:48.159> it's<00:00:48.429> just

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
made of this wood know and it's just

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.209 
made of this wood know and it's just
alive<00:00:49.149> it's<00:00:49.690> got<00:00:49.870> an<00:00:49.929> aliveness<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.799> it<00:00:50.949> and<00:00:51.129> a

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
alive it's got an aliveness to it and a

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.779 
alive it's got an aliveness to it and a
sound<00:00:51.519> and<00:00:51.789> the<00:00:51.850> sonic<00:00:53.010> bounce<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.489> it<00:00:54.609> if<00:00:54.699> you

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
sound and the sonic bounce to it if you

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.449 
sound and the sonic bounce to it if you
will<00:00:55.109> that's<00:00:56.109> like<00:00:56.620> no<00:00:56.769> other<00:00:56.889> bass<00:00:57.100> I've<00:00:57.280> had

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:57.459 
will that's like no other bass I've had

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:59.340 
will that's like no other bass I've had
I<00:00:57.729> love<00:00:58.089> all<00:00:58.239> my<00:00:58.389> attitude<00:00:58.869> basses<00:00:59.229> the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
I love all my attitude basses the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.569 
I love all my attitude basses the
earlier<00:00:59.589> ones<00:00:59.769> as<00:00:59.889> well<00:01:00.069> but<00:01:00.190> this<00:01:00.339> new<00:01:00.549> one

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
earlier ones as well but this new one

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.359 
earlier ones as well but this new one
with<00:01:01.179> this<00:01:01.359> process<00:01:01.869> really<00:01:02.619> it<00:01:02.889> really<00:01:03.069> puts

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:03.369 
with this process really it really puts

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.780 
with this process really it really puts
it<00:01:03.459> over<00:01:03.549> the<00:01:03.670> top<00:01:03.760> Wood<00:01:04.750> has<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:06.430> to<00:01:06.610> some

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
it over the top Wood has it's to some

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.690 
it over the top Wood has it's to some
degree<00:01:07.120> even<00:01:07.630> old<00:01:07.870> wood<00:01:08.080> has<00:01:08.260> SAP<00:01:08.740> in<00:01:09.220> it<00:01:09.490> from

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
degree even old wood has SAP in it from

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.690 
degree even old wood has SAP in it from
when<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.000> tree<00:01:10.300> was<00:01:10.450> alive<00:01:10.750> and<00:01:11.050> as<00:01:11.920> as<00:01:12.310> the

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
when the tree was alive and as as the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.720 
when the tree was alive and as as the
wood<00:01:13.060> ages<00:01:13.540> it<00:01:13.690> crystallizes<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:14.730> changes

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
wood ages it crystallizes and changes

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.830 
wood ages it crystallizes and changes
the<00:01:15.850> whole<00:01:16.000> character<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:16.570> wood<00:01:16.690> that's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
the whole character of the wood that's

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.660 
the whole character of the wood that's
why<00:01:17.020> old<00:01:17.200> instruments<00:01:17.860> sounds<00:01:18.100> so<00:01:18.220> great

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
why old instruments sounds so great

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.280 
why old instruments sounds so great
and<00:01:18.760> that's<00:01:19.300> one<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.900> things<00:01:20.110> that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
and that's one of the things that

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.990 
and that's one of the things that
happens<00:01:20.620> with<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.860> ar<00:01:21.130> e<00:01:21.160> process<00:01:21.700> on<00:01:21.850> this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
happens with the ar e process on this

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.590 
happens with the ar e process on this
wood

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.149 

okay<00:01:31.600> we're<00:01:31.750> inside<00:01:32.020> Yamaha<00:01:32.469> music<00:01:32.770> craft<00:01:32.979> and

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
okay we're inside Yamaha music craft and

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.429 
okay we're inside Yamaha music craft and
we're<00:01:33.250> gonna<00:01:33.369> see<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.090> Assembly<00:01:34.689> of<00:01:34.719> the<00:01:35.079> body

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
we're gonna see the Assembly of the body

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.459 
we're gonna see the Assembly of the body
of<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.310> Yamaha<00:01:36.609> attitude<00:01:37.060> bass<00:01:37.409> okay<00:01:38.409> so

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
of the Yamaha attitude bass okay so

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.169 
of the Yamaha attitude bass okay so
here's<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.799> slabs<00:01:39.189> of<00:01:39.490> wood<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.850> are<00:01:40.060> gonna

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
here's the slabs of wood that are gonna

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.569 
here's the slabs of wood that are gonna
be<00:01:40.329> made<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.689> Yamaha<00:01:40.990> attitude<00:01:41.380> body<00:01:42.280> and

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
be made in the Yamaha attitude body and

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.580 
be made in the Yamaha attitude body and
you<00:01:43.119> as<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.479> can<00:01:43.569> see<00:01:43.780> they're<00:01:44.020> they're<00:01:44.380> cut

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
you as you can see they're they're cut

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.889 
you as you can see they're they're cut
out<00:01:44.740> ready<00:01:45.130> for<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.460> spline<00:01:45.789> piece<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.600> go<00:01:46.719> in

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
out ready for the spline piece to go in

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.679 
out ready for the spline piece to go in
but<00:01:47.619> one<00:01:47.979> important<00:01:48.429> thing<00:01:48.490> is<00:01:49.420> they're

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
but one important thing is they're

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.410 
but one important thing is they're
already<00:01:50.020> lined<00:01:50.649> up<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:52.000> that<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:52.270> wood

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
already lined up and so that the wood

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.520 
already lined up and so that the wood
grain<00:01:53.819> corresponds<00:01:54.819> to<00:01:54.850> each<00:01:55.060> other<00:01:55.299> piece<00:01:55.539> so

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
grain corresponds to each other piece so

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.240 
grain corresponds to each other piece so
this<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:57.039> wood<00:01:57.490> grain<00:01:57.520> here<00:01:58.030> is<00:01:58.179> in<00:01:58.360> this

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
this this wood grain here is in this

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.639 
this this wood grain here is in this
direction<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.969> one<00:02:01.209> is<00:02:01.420> reverse<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.439> this

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
direction this one is reverse and this

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.289 
direction this one is reverse and this
one<00:02:02.829> is<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.039> same<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.670> we<00:02:03.759> have<00:02:03.880> three<00:02:04.119> pieces

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
one is the same so we have three pieces

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.160 
one is the same so we have three pieces
of<00:02:04.479> wood<00:02:05.099> acting<00:02:06.099> as<00:02:06.250> one<00:02:06.819> not<00:02:07.390> only<00:02:07.450> sonically

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
of wood acting as one not only sonically

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.800 
of wood acting as one not only sonically
but<00:02:08.649> also<00:02:08.769> mechanically<00:02:09.569> because<00:02:10.569> they're

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
but also mechanically because they're

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.229 
but also mechanically because they're
they're<00:02:11.079> grains<00:02:11.709> are<00:02:11.980> lined<00:02:12.579> up<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.940> it's

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
they're grains are lined up and it's

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.390 
they're grains are lined up and it's
much<00:02:13.450> less<00:02:13.660> likely<00:02:13.720> for<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.319> body<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.739> warp<00:02:15.160> or

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
much less likely for a body to warp or

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.309 
much less likely for a body to warp or
change<00:02:15.730> over<00:02:15.880> time<00:02:16.239> in<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.840> way<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.049> don't<00:02:17.200> want

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
change over time in a way you don't want

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.229 
change over time in a way you don't want
it<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.709> when<00:02:18.610> they're<00:02:18.730> lined<00:02:18.940> up<00:02:19.060> properly

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
it to when they're lined up properly

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:27.840 
it to when they're lined up properly
like<00:02:19.630> this

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.550 

here<00:02:28.850> we<00:02:28.970> are<00:02:29.000> with<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.300> yet<00:02:29.660> another<00:02:29.870> step<00:02:30.230> in

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
here we are with a yet another step in

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.480 
here we are with a yet another step in
the<00:02:30.950> process<00:02:31.150> this<00:02:32.150> gentleman<00:02:32.540> here<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:33.020> uh

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
the process this gentleman here is uh

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.740 
the process this gentleman here is uh
gonna<00:02:34.490> be<00:02:34.640> drilling<00:02:34.850> some<00:02:35.060> holes<00:02:35.120> in<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.570> body

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
gonna be drilling some holes in the body

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.780 
gonna be drilling some holes in the body
and<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.170> very<00:02:36.380> special<00:02:36.770> holes<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.670> I'll

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
and a very special holes that I'll

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.090 
and a very special holes that I'll
explain<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:39.410> other<00:02:39.560> ones<00:02:39.770> were<00:02:39.950> done

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
explain to you the other ones were done

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.580 
explain to you the other ones were done
a<00:02:40.130> little<00:02:40.430> bit<00:02:40.520> different<00:02:41.050> inside<00:02:42.050> we<00:02:42.260> had<00:02:42.440> the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
a little bit different inside we had the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.340 
a little bit different inside we had the
some<00:02:43.160> bolts<00:02:43.520> holding<00:02:43.850> it<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.780> neck<00:02:44.960> on<00:02:45.170> the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
some bolts holding it the neck on the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.860 
some bolts holding it the neck on the
body<00:02:45.530> was<00:02:46.070> excited<00:02:46.730> rock<00:02:46.940> solid<00:02:47.180> great<00:02:47.600> neck

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
body was excited rock solid great neck

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.230 
body was excited rock solid great neck
the<00:02:47.990> body<00:02:48.170> joint<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.650> best<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.760> know<00:02:49.910> of

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
the body joint the best that I know of

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.660 
the body joint the best that I know of
but<00:02:50.420> now<00:02:50.960> this<00:02:51.410> time<00:02:51.470> we<00:02:51.800> actually<00:02:51.980> took<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.550> a

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
but now this time we actually took it a

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.040 
but now this time we actually took it a
little<00:02:52.700> bit<00:02:52.970> farther<00:02:53.120> we<00:02:53.420> got<00:02:53.540> three<00:02:53.750> bolts

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
little bit farther we got three bolts

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.330 
little bit farther we got three bolts
going<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.410> back<00:02:54.560> into<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.890> neck<00:02:55.100> as

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
going in the back into the neck as

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.120 
going in the back into the neck as
you'll<00:02:56.000> see<00:02:56.180> as<00:02:56.540> we<00:02:56.690> move<00:02:56.870> along<00:02:57.230> but<00:02:57.830> these

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
you'll see as we move along but these

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.460 
you'll see as we move along but these
two<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.580> see<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.240> was<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.540> an<00:02:59.630> angle<00:03:00.110> they

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
two you see that it was on an angle they

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.090 
two you see that it was on an angle they
go<00:03:00.650> in<00:03:00.920> on<00:03:01.160> an<00:03:01.580> angle<00:03:01.760> so<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.420> neck<00:03:02.660> is

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
go in on an angle so that the neck is

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.460 
go in on an angle so that the neck is
grabbed<00:03:04.100> by<00:03:04.550> two<00:03:04.880> screws<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.600> pull<00:03:05.990> its<00:03:06.230> end

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
grabbed by two screws and pull its end

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.220 
grabbed by two screws and pull its end
grain<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.220> pulled<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:08.090> meet<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.420> end<00:03:08.600> grain<00:03:08.990> of

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
grain is pulled to meet the end grain of

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.500 
grain is pulled to meet the end grain of
the<00:03:09.410> slot<00:03:09.650> inside<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.280> body<00:03:10.490> so<00:03:11.090> it's<00:03:11.240> almost

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
the slot inside the body so it's almost

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:21.490 
the slot inside the body so it's almost
like<00:03:11.750> it's<00:03:11.990> a<00:03:12.080> one-piece<00:03:12.680> instrument

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.710 

ok<00:03:22.400> so<00:03:22.460> now<00:03:22.820> we're<00:03:23.090> going<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.300> go<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.480> the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
ok so now we're going to go to the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.050 
ok so now we're going to go to the
second<00:03:24.320> most<00:03:24.470> important<00:03:25.010> wooden<00:03:25.490> component

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
second most important wooden component

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.000 
second most important wooden component
on<00:03:26.210> the<00:03:26.420> base<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:27.650> neck

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
on the base the neck

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.040 
on the base the neck
these<00:03:28.130> are<00:03:28.280> neck<00:03:28.460> blanks<00:03:28.880> my<00:03:29.390> friend<00:03:29.720> Inagaki

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
these are neck blanks my friend Inagaki

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.990 
these are neck blanks my friend Inagaki
here<00:03:30.530> will<00:03:30.740> show<00:03:30.770> you<00:03:31.010> how<00:03:31.340> they<00:03:31.610> put<00:03:31.910> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
here will show you how they put the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.790 
here will show you how they put the
truss<00:03:32.240> rod<00:03:32.330> in<00:03:32.720> but<00:03:33.140> before<00:03:33.500> he<00:03:33.590> does<00:03:33.770> that

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
truss rod in but before he does that

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.250 
truss rod in but before he does that
this<00:03:34.670> is<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.970> old<00:03:35.120> truss<00:03:35.510> rod<00:03:35.750> from<00:03:36.140> the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
this is the old truss rod from the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.680 
this is the old truss rod from the
original<00:03:36.710> Yamaha<00:03:37.070> attitude<00:03:37.490> base<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.240> it's<00:03:38.600> a

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
original Yamaha attitude base and it's a

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.300 
original Yamaha attitude base and it's a
fine<00:03:38.870> truss<00:03:39.140> rod<00:03:39.350> but<00:03:39.740> it's<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:39.890> single-action

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
fine truss rod but it's a single-action

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.520 
fine truss rod but it's a single-action
it<00:03:40.580> only<00:03:40.700> bends<00:03:40.940> one<00:03:41.150> way<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:41.660> it's<00:03:42.320> a<00:03:42.350> little

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
it only bends one way and it's a little

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.010 
it only bends one way and it's a little
large<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:43.580> new<00:03:43.760> truss<00:03:44.030> rod<00:03:44.270> is<00:03:44.510> double-action

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
large the new truss rod is double-action

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.150 
large the new truss rod is double-action
bends<00:03:45.590> both<00:03:45.830> ways<00:03:46.130> it's<00:03:46.880> smaller<00:03:47.270> and<00:03:48.160> allows

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
bends both ways it's smaller and allows

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.730 
bends both ways it's smaller and allows
us<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.490> use<00:03:49.610> more<00:03:50.090> wood<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.660> less<00:03:51.230> metal<00:03:51.590> which

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
us to use more wood and less metal which

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.350 
us to use more wood and less metal which
of<00:03:51.830> course<00:03:51.860> makes<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.280> finer<00:03:52.520> instrument<00:03:52.970> so

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
of course makes a finer instrument so

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.570 
of course makes a finer instrument so
yeah<00:03:53.510> nageki<00:03:54.080> here<00:03:54.350> will<00:03:54.530> show<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:55.250> how<00:03:55.430> they

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
yeah nageki here will show you how they

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.870 
yeah nageki here will show you how they
do<00:03:55.640> this<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.280> truss<00:03:58.489> rod<00:03:58.520> is<00:03:58.730> very

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
do this and the truss rod is very

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.070 
do this and the truss rod is very
important<00:03:59.239> because<00:03:59.360> that<00:03:59.630> keeps<00:03:59.750> your<00:03:59.900> neck

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
important because that keeps your neck

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.720 
important because that keeps your neck
aligned<00:04:00.410> sometimes<00:04:01.130> as<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.340> weather<00:04:01.520> gets

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
aligned sometimes as the weather gets

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.300 
aligned sometimes as the weather gets
wet<00:04:02.030> or<00:04:02.239> dry<00:04:02.810> or<00:04:03.200> hot<00:04:03.470> or<00:04:03.500> cold<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.160> can

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
wet or dry or hot or cold and that can

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.440 
wet or dry or hot or cold and that can
change<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.730> might<00:04:04.880> need<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.150> do<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.270> little

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
change you might need to do a little

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.660 
change you might need to do a little
tweak<00:04:05.720> once<00:04:05.930> in<00:04:06.020> a<00:04:06.080> while<00:04:06.230> and<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:07.430> truss<00:04:07.640> rod

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
tweak once in a while and the truss rod

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.190 
tweak once in a while and the truss rod
allows<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.330> do<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:12.050> newer

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
allows you to do that and the newer

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.720 
allows you to do that and the newer
truss<00:04:12.530> rod<00:04:12.739> makes<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.160> base<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.310> little<00:04:13.610> bit

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
truss rod makes the base a little bit

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.820 
truss rod makes the base a little bit
lighter<00:04:13.970> makes<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:15.080> infinitely<00:04:15.410> more

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
lighter makes it infinitely more

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.800 
lighter makes it infinitely more

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
adjustable by the double action truss

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.440

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
rod and results again in a base that's

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.200 
rod and results again in a base that's
easy<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.320> adjust<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:22.190> it<00:04:22.310> can<00:04:22.460> be<00:04:22.550> made<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:22.790> play

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:35.150 
easy to adjust so it can be made to play
easier<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:23.990> of<00:04:24.320> course<00:04:24.530> it<00:04:24.680> sounds<00:04:24.800> great

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.310 

okay<00:04:36.160> very<00:04:36.550> very<00:04:36.790> important<00:04:37.120> step<00:04:37.300> is<00:04:37.630> the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
okay very very important step is the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.820 
okay very very important step is the
frets<00:04:38.820> that's<00:04:39.820> what<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.300> string<00:04:41.080> touches<00:04:41.620> to

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
frets that's what the string touches to

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.680 
frets that's what the string touches to
get<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.160> right<00:04:42.370> note<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:42.880> hopefully<00:04:43.360> the

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
get the right note and hopefully the

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.920 
get the right note and hopefully the
right<00:04:43.840> note<00:04:44.820> putting<00:04:45.820> frets<00:04:46.090> in<00:04:46.270> is<00:04:46.420> very<00:04:46.690> fine

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
right note putting frets in is very fine

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.560 
right note putting frets in is very fine
work<00:04:47.170> I've<00:04:47.710> done<00:04:47.950> all<00:04:48.430> my<00:04:48.490> own<00:04:49.030> work<00:04:49.270> on<00:04:49.390> my

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
work I've done all my own work on my

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.750 
work I've done all my own work on my
bases<00:04:50.020> except<00:04:50.890> for<00:04:51.070> reef<00:04:51.190> reading<00:04:51.490> because

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
bases except for reef reading because

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.610 
bases except for reef reading because
this<00:04:51.880> really<00:04:52.360> requires<00:04:52.620> supreme

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
this really requires supreme

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.470 
this really requires supreme
craftsmanship<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.850> frets<00:04:55.060> he's<00:04:55.180> putting

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
craftsmanship and the frets he's putting

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.530 
craftsmanship and the frets he's putting
in<00:04:55.570> now<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.750> very<00:04:56.080> top<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.940> top<00:04:58.210> five

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
in now the very top the the top five

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.040 
in now the very top the the top five
frets<00:04:58.900> are<00:04:59.410> actually<00:04:59.830> smaller<00:05:00.280> fret<00:05:00.760> wire

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
frets are actually smaller fret wire

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.960 
frets are actually smaller fret wire
than<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.200> frets<00:05:02.440> below<00:05:02.890> it<00:05:03.190> years<00:05:03.760> and<00:05:03.820> years

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
than the frets below it years and years

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.000 
than the frets below it years and years
ago<00:05:04.240> I<00:05:04.360> had<00:05:04.570> a<00:05:04.600> reef<00:05:04.840> fret<00:05:05.080> done<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.800> friend

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
ago I had a reef fret done and a friend

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.350 
ago I had a reef fret done and a friend
of<00:05:06.100> mine<00:05:06.190> was<00:05:06.340> doing<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:06.730> it<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:06.940> we<00:05:07.210> decided

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
of mine was doing in it and we decided

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.910 
of mine was doing in it and we decided
to<00:05:07.660> try<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:07.870> experiment<00:05:08.230> it<00:05:08.410> used<00:05:08.530> a<00:05:08.620> smaller

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
to try and experiment it used a smaller

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.040 
to try and experiment it used a smaller
fret<00:05:09.190> wire<00:05:09.370> up<00:05:09.610> top<00:05:09.880> for<00:05:10.180> sharper<00:05:10.600> intonation

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
fret wire up top for sharper intonation

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.830 
fret wire up top for sharper intonation
a<00:05:11.500> little<00:05:12.340> bit<00:05:12.430> more<00:05:12.550> accuracy<00:05:12.970> so<00:05:13.510> that's<00:05:13.690> one

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
a little bit more accuracy so that's one

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.090 
a little bit more accuracy so that's one
of<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:13.990> features<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.410> attitude<00:05:14.710> base<00:05:14.890> has

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
of the features the attitude base has

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.710 
of the features the attitude base has
always<00:05:15.250> had<00:05:15.490> it's<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:15.940> top<00:05:16.090> five<00:05:16.270> frets<00:05:16.570> are

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
always had it's the top five frets are

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.410 
always had it's the top five frets are
smaller<00:05:16.990> fret<00:05:17.260> wire
