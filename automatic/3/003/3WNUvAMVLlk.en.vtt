00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
up on the lights and the purpose of this

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.110 
up on the lights and the purpose of this
is<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.049> show<00:00:13.170> people<00:00:13.380> why<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.130> videos<00:00:14.730> look

the way they do the ones that I shoot of
these<00:00:17.880> UFOs<00:00:18.420> flying<00:00:18.660> around<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.140> our

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
these UFOs flying around in our

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.679 
these UFOs flying around in our
atmosphere<00:00:19.939> you'll<00:00:20.939> notice<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.420> video

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
atmosphere you'll notice the video

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.300 
atmosphere you'll notice the video
distortion<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.650> pretty<00:00:22.830> hard<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
distortion this is pretty hard on the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.179 
distortion this is pretty hard on the
camera<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.820> point<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.180> right<00:00:24.210> at<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> Sun<00:00:25.189> with

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
camera to point it right at the Sun with

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.490 
camera to point it right at the Sun with
regular<00:00:26.670> settings<00:00:27.150> now<00:00:27.720> I'm<00:00:27.840> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.199> stop

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
regular settings now I'm going to stop

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.780 
regular settings now I'm going to stop
the<00:00:28.680> iris<00:00:29.070> down<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:30.349> as<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.309> brightness

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the iris down and as I do the brightness

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.490 
the iris down and as I do the brightness
will<00:00:32.969> go<00:00:33.120> away<00:00:33.210> all<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.510> video<00:00:33.960> distortion

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
will go away all that video distortion

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.250 
will go away all that video distortion
will<00:00:34.680> go<00:00:34.829> away<00:00:35.540> still<00:00:36.540> be<00:00:36.660> able<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.960> see<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
will go away still be able to see the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.470 
will go away still be able to see the
birds<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:37.800> you'll<00:00:37.920> also<00:00:38.129> see<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> spacecraft

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
birds but you'll also see the spacecraft

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.470 
birds but you'll also see the spacecraft
flying<00:00:39.989> around<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.410> our<00:00:40.530> atmosphere<00:00:41.210> there<00:00:42.210> we

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
flying around in our atmosphere there we

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:54.439 
flying around in our atmosphere there we
go<00:00:48.590> that<00:00:49.590> was<00:00:49.710> an<00:00:49.829> insect<00:00:52.879> these<00:00:53.879> two<00:00:54.090> craft

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
go that was an insect these two craft

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.430 
go that was an insect these two craft
are<00:00:54.600> flying<00:00:54.930> slowly<00:00:56.539> basically<00:00:57.539> against<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
are flying slowly basically against the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.110 
are flying slowly basically against the
other<00:00:58.590> traffic<00:00:59.160> notice<00:00:59.460> everything<00:00:59.670> else<00:00:59.940> is

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
other traffic notice everything else is

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
other traffic notice everything else is
going<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> other<00:01:00.480> way<00:01:01.100> there<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.219> another

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
going the other way there was another

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.719 
going the other way there was another
insect<00:01:03.409> now<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.559> i<00:01:04.680> zoom<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.250> see<00:01:05.549> them

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
insect now as i zoom in you can see them

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.390 
insect now as i zoom in you can see them
spinning<00:01:06.210> these<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.380> dust<00:01:07.860> particles

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400

intelligently controlled crafts notice

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.109 
intelligently controlled crafts notice
all<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> other<00:01:14.100> traffic<00:01:14.640> zooming<00:01:15.119> around

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
all the other traffic zooming around

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.910 
all the other traffic zooming around
watch<00:01:18.119> those<00:01:18.450> spin<00:01:18.900> isn't<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.470> amazing<00:01:21.920> if

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
watch those spin isn't that amazing if

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.160 
watch those spin isn't that amazing if
you<00:01:23.100> look<00:01:23.310> carefully<00:01:23.610> top<00:01:24.450> left<00:01:24.780> there's<00:01:25.110> a

camera to we could get even closer get

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.380 
camera to we could get even closer get
better<00:02:07.439> evidence<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:08.160> what's<00:02:08.369> going<00:02:08.580> on

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
better evidence of what's going on

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.010 
better evidence of what's going on
and<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:10.200> wind<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.560> blowing<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.100> light<00:02:11.310> stand

solution to our energy crisis right

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.640 
solution to our energy crisis right
there<00:03:07.019> because<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.350> know<00:03:07.470> they're<00:03:07.620> not
