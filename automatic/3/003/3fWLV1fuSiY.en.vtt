 Good afternoon, today is the day of your life without 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.320
 violence 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.989
 I'm very well welcomed. Welcome to one more. 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.190
 of the series of reports on the 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.010
 Lessons from the proerd 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.440
 today we are in renato pradi school here 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.960
 in the neighborhood are luiz in jaraguÃ¡ do sul 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.309
 to talk about lesson number 8 at 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.289
 bases of friendship 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.569
 now watch a little bit about what the 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:01:10.550
 police officer proerd in classroom passes 

00:00:47.569 --> 00:01:13.940
 for students not only my friend of mine 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.030
 name is jaqueline 8 years and did PROERD and 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.760
 4th grade and helped a lot in my life 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.950
 It was with him that I learned that it creates 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.370
 friendships with whom I owe with 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.230
 raise and the proerd and village forest life 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.390
 all the lessons I've learned 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.330
 the purpose of the foundation lesson of friendship 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.670
 has as main focus the child in 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.920
 identify your friends by means of 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.830
 qualities by observing what is 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.050
 and the importance of this 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.570
 dialogue with what she does with a good 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.530
 citizen and getting rid of it 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.300
 of drugs 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.620
 Another very important factor is 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.250
 which we saw on page 47 is the question 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.140
 self - esteem is when the activity asks 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.780
 so that the child puts his or her 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.880
 name inside the star ne and around 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.280
 there is a universe of institutions 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.890
 which are inserted with the family the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.299
 neighbors to the school so she 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.129
 identify in those locations who 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.230
 really are your friends are the 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.640
 students learn to have this contact through 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.590
 middle of the theater 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.340
 identify how to train the issue of 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.660
 reaction response we just then 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.459
 working model making decision 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.650
 PROERD which is one of the main foci 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.450
 makes the child stop to think so 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.420
 through the response response that is 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.630
 worked in the theater, it makes the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.880
 child notice better do not have that 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.370
 eye contact having clear voice and 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.500
 objective being made to understand what 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.480
 She wants that moment for her and 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.600
 developing the issue of 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.660
 aware that that supply 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.220
 Is not something so good so positive she 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.890
 will identify this of course is the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.260
 licit or illicit drugs and 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.410
 she will have her own decision-making 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.090
 in this influence, let us say thus of other 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.160
 people who are not in the moment 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.790
 They are important in her life as are the 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.790
 parents and educators 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.360

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.980

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.360
 we did not expect much uncertainty 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.020
 legal or illegal was to have a night in a 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.020
 problem 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.620
 has presented itself we will still have the 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:48.069
 Good, but a good save. 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.700

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.159
 and in the media 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.680
 you have to be careful only for later 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.069

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.060
