have just gone to

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.280 
have just gone to
parboil<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:31.270> let's<00:02:31.480> keep<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.870> water<00:02:32.050> for

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
parboil it so let's keep the water for

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.230 
parboil it so let's keep the water for
boiling<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.860> once<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.430> starts<00:02:33.730> boiling<00:02:33.880> let's

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
boiling and once it starts boiling let's

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.050 
boiling and once it starts boiling let's
add<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.990> masalas<00:02:35.710> to<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.070> as<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.550> can<00:02:36.730> see<00:02:36.880> the

add the masalas to it as you can see the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.750 
add the masalas to it as you can see the
water<00:02:37.270> is<00:02:37.450> boiling<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.320> let's<00:02:38.530> add<00:02:38.770> some<00:02:39.190> salt

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
to it the whole masalas bay leaves some

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.920 
to it the whole masalas bay leaves some
green<00:02:44.860> cardamom<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.610> brown<00:02:46.030> cardamom<00:02:46.390> let's

garnishing again drizzle it with ghee by

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.000 
garnishing again drizzle it with ghee by
cooking<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.670> rice<00:03:54.880> we<00:03:55.630> had<00:03:55.840> taken<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.440> cup<00:03:56.860> of

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
cooking the rice we had taken a cup of

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.000 
cooking the rice we had taken a cup of
rice<00:03:57.220> aside<00:03:57.880> before<00:03:58.360> even<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:59.320> water<00:03:59.530> started

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
rice aside before even the water started

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.390 
rice aside before even the water started
boiling<00:04:00.490> so<00:04:01.180> this<00:04:01.360> is<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.750> very<00:04:02.110> raw<00:04:02.740> rice<00:04:03.070> so

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
boiling so this is a very raw rice so

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.390 
boiling so this is a very raw rice so
put<00:04:03.580> it<00:04:03.700> at<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:04.120> bottom<00:04:04.480> layer<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:05.230> rice<00:04:06.100> was

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
put it at the bottom layer the rice was

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.170 
put it at the bottom layer the rice was
cooked<00:04:06.490> in<00:04:06.790> two<00:04:07.140> stages<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:09.670> reason<00:04:10.030> is<00:04:10.150> that

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
cooked in two stages the reason is that

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.840 
cooked in two stages the reason is that
when<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:10.930> goes<00:04:11.050> into<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.470> dum<00:04:11.740> we<00:04:12.400> don't<00:04:12.610> want

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
when it goes into the dum we don't want

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.490 
when it goes into the dum we don't want
the<00:04:12.970> rice<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.420> be<00:04:13.540> overcooked

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
the rice to be overcooked

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.620 
the rice to be overcooked
we<00:04:14.680> want<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.010> grain<00:04:15.250> separated<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.090> nice<00:04:16.359> and

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
we want the grain separated and nice and

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.229 
we want the grain separated and nice and
fluffy<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.230> what<00:04:17.950> we<00:04:18.100> do<00:04:18.280> is<00:04:18.430> when<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:19.060> water

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
fluffy so what we do is when the water

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.400 
fluffy so what we do is when the water
was<00:04:19.480> nicely<00:04:20.020> hot<00:04:20.830> we<00:04:21.580> put<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.000> rice<00:04:22.810> in<00:04:23.050> it<00:04:23.140> and

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
was nicely hot we put the rice in it and

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.280 
was nicely hot we put the rice in it and
I've<00:04:23.890> taken<00:04:24.130> out<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.550> cup<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:24.970> rice<00:04:25.290> immediately

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
I've taken out a cup of rice immediately
