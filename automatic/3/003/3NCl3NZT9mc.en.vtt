procedure itself can be understood very
simply<00:00:27.210> let<00:00:27.960> me<00:00:28.050> start<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> few<00:00:28.740> basic

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
simply let me start with a few basic

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.820 
simply let me start with a few basic
concepts<00:00:29.810> LASIK<00:00:30.810> essentially<00:00:31.380> takes<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
concepts LASIK essentially takes the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.950 
concepts LASIK essentially takes the
curve<00:00:32.250> from<00:00:32.730> your<00:00:32.969> glasses<00:00:33.420> or<00:00:33.540> contact

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
curve from your glasses or contact

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.560 
curve from your glasses or contact
lenses<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.670> reshapes<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> inner<00:00:36.030> layer<00:00:36.390> of

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
lenses and reshapes the inner layer of

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.600 
lenses and reshapes the inner layer of
your<00:00:36.690> cornea<00:00:37.079> with<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.380> same<00:00:37.770> curve<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
your cornea with that same curve to

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.639 
your cornea with that same curve to
enable<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.360> clearly<00:00:39.809> if<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> think

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
enable you to see clearly if you think

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.619 
enable you to see clearly if you think
of<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:40.860> cornea<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.790> front<00:00:42.059> surface<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.510> your

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
of your cornea the front surface of your

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.680 
of your cornea the front surface of your
eye<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> book<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:44.040> has<00:00:44.219> about<00:00:44.370> 550<00:00:45.239> pages

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
eye like a book that has about 550 pages

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.049 
eye like a book that has about 550 pages
with<00:00:45.960> lasik<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.890> surgeon<00:00:47.250> opens<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.730> book<00:00:47.879> at

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
with lasik the surgeon opens the book at

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.869 
with lasik the surgeon opens the book at
page<00:00:48.270> 100<00:00:48.960> then<00:00:49.590> removes<00:00:49.920> 50<00:00:50.309> or<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.610> pages

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
page 100 then removes 50 or so pages

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.119 
page 100 then removes 50 or so pages
depending<00:00:51.539> upon<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:51.930> prescription<00:00:52.500> then

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
depending upon your prescription then

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.369 
depending upon your prescription then
the<00:00:53.250> book<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.550> closed<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.420> looks<00:00:54.660> completely

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the book is closed and looks completely

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.099 
the book is closed and looks completely
untouched<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.850> when<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.149> think<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> lasik

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
untouched so when you think of the lasik

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.439 
untouched so when you think of the lasik
procedure<00:00:58.370> there<00:00:59.370> are<00:00:59.399> two<00:00:59.820> steps<00:01:00.120> that

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
procedure there are two steps that

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.990 
procedure there are two steps that
utilize<00:01:00.870> these<00:01:01.079> concepts<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.190> first<00:01:02.520> step<00:01:02.789> is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
utilize these concepts the first step is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.840 
utilize these concepts the first step is
to<00:01:03.210> create<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:04.170> corneal<00:01:04.680> flap<00:01:04.860> which<00:01:05.700> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
to create that corneal flap which is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.149 
to create that corneal flap which is
like<00:01:05.970> opening<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> book<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.560> create<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
like opening the book you can create the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
like opening the book you can create the
flap<00:01:08.400> with<00:01:08.610> either<00:01:08.790> mechanical<00:01:09.150> blade<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
flap with either mechanical blade or a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.820 
flap with either mechanical blade or a
femtosecond<00:01:11.070> laser<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.840> second<00:01:13.320> step<00:01:13.530> we

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
femtosecond laser in the second step we

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.100 
femtosecond laser in the second step we
treat<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.700> prescription<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.930> is

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
treat your prescription which is

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.649 
treat your prescription which is
removing<00:01:16.500> pages<00:01:16.950> from<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> book<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.570> be

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
removing pages from the book this can be

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.179 
removing pages from the book this can be
accomplished<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.259> either<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.590> standard

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
accomplished with either a standard

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.880 
accomplished with either a standard
x-ray<00:01:20.580> laser<00:01:20.790> pattern<00:01:21.330> or<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.900> customized<00:01:22.650> or

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
procedure the rates of success vary

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
procedure the rates of success vary
significantly<00:01:28.049> depending<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.490> which
