00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.900
 in this video tutorial we will see how 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.480
 Share a photograph in something that 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.220
 look like a drawing for that let's take 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.419
 the photograph of this car that 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.429
 we have open 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:39.519
 The first thing we are going to do is go to the 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:39.519
 window of layers windows layers 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.950
 as we see we have a background layer 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.240
 let's do with the right button of the 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:52.250
 mouse click and let's double layer 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.280
 we do it again because we need 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.890
 another layer plus duplicate layer again 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.440
 let's see we have three layers one 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.020
 a copy of another copy is called 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.030
 background to one and another is background if they wanted 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.890
 ok we could put a name here I do not 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.320
 I will always leave so well without using 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.780
 problems come on and do not go to the first 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.300
 layer of which we duplicate that is called 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.300
 the background copy and we're going to apply 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.260
 in the colors tab in the bar 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.100
 top door tools 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.310
 we open the threshold as we see we are marked 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.610
 in black and white the edges here we go to 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.610
 to choose 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.530
 more or less the definition that we want 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.780
 it does not matter that it is not very defined 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.780
 because later we will give the detail 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.300
 fine in the other layer I 'm not going to choose 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.220
 there as to give me a base this 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.870
 we are going to try after we will go 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.540
 seeing the results and let's go 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.770
 surely learning more come to 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.539
 to accept 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.539
 I go to the new window layers 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.710
 as we see we have copies of the background 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.930
 and it went black and white in the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.300
 sharp edges should do a click 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.670
 in the icon of the eye that was here to the 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.039
 left so that this layer does not look and 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.049
 so we can work on the second 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.049
 in the second layer background copy 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.910
 I'm going to the filters tab 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.910
 detect edges 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.519
 and measure unlike bonds 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.140
 here we have several parameters which 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.420
 surely we can follow you can go 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.209
 trying to achieve better result I 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.710
 I chose to put the radius one of 25 and the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.640
 radio 2 of 2 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.560
 I'll give you to accept 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.760
 on some computers it may take a 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.000
 little bit according to the memory that 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.680
 I have there is already made the effect 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.280
 As you can see, we have already detected the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.010
 edges with a little bit of color that what 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.590
 let's now modify from here we go 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.660
 again the threshold colors threshold 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.040
 we see that they were erased almost everything but 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.300
 here where we shadow we will go 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.080
 looking for the point 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.500
 to find 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.360
 something as similar as possible a drawing 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.380
 with the level of detail we want 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.819
 dadle 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.510
 we can accept 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.379
 we already have it back again to layers 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.989
 that we can call it here windows 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.690
 recessed theologians layers or squeezing 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.319
 the control key plus he 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.599
 we go back to the layers window 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.519
 the yin has this the little windows 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.690
 open and close sometimes is a little 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.480
 Tiring but good is like that 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.940
 we stand on a copy of the background and 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.860
 we are going to give from here of the same window 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.800
 of layers where it says normal we're going to 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.060
 put multiply 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.459
 we see that the lines were more marked 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.650
 and now this copy of the fund we do 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.370
 Right click we can combine 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.270
 down and they will join us the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.830
 top layer with the one below that 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.260
 they are black and white 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.610
 and let's get the drawing well 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.950
 definite 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.859
 now on this same layer we're going to go to 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.620
 the value window 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.120
 and there we will see that we have already been 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.740
 painted 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.740
 and the drawing we had made 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.480
 once we have it painted like this 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.400
 simply 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.880
 we keep combining down until 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.460
 be a single layer and here we go to 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.990
 have the possibility to modify the 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.550
 colors if necessary 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.190
 here we have tone and saturation 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.360
 let's modify the luminosity we can 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.360
 modify the saturation 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.530
 we can also the color balance 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.130
 we can modify the colors if 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.130
 we want to do 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.129
 they are options if we want to apply them 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:05.409
 we can use 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:08.810
 Now let's talk a little bit about 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:12.560
 texture to be similar to paper 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.060
 in this drawing we have done for that 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.030
 let's go to the tab again of 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.030
 filters we will go artistic in loom 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:27.150
 for this I chose to give it a blur x 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:30.389
 of 4 defocus and from 4 to 12 50 elevation 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.919
 75 depth 2 then these 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:36.200
 parameters of agreement as we go 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:38.660
 modifying will give us different 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.970
 So much tone because it does not obscure the image 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.430
 as the type of granulate that the 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.830
 let's say this is going to be able to 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.170
 you surely I keep trying 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.720
 I will leave well in these measures if 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.380
 they want to try with them and I'm going to 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.380
 give to accept 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.630
 let's see what a texture was made 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.630
 similar to that of a paper 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:08.580
 and I'm still going to apply to this photo 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.560
 that appears in drawing one more effect 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.180
 so that it is as if the paper were a 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.280
 little aged for that to go back to 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:19.009
 filters 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.199
 and I'm going to give decorative old photo 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.180
 in old fonts select all 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.249
 Above all it is important that 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.559
 we select to work on copies so we 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:31.629
 will open the result a little window 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:31.629
 new we give to accept 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.620
 here we have it would be the old photo 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.190
 of the drawing we made 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.440
 in this window wench copy edition 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:50.880
 we minimize the window and the previous one 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.870
 we were working we make edition 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.630
 paste 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:59.010
 as we see it is stuck on top of the 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:03.610
 image we had if we go to windows 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:05.199
 layers let's see what we have 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.379
 a new layer called selection 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:10.509
 floating or layer attached we will leave 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:13.530
 well selected and we're just going 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:13.530
 to lower the opacity 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.729
 until we achieve the effect that 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.569
 we want once we achieve the effect 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:25.169
 we click on the layer 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:29.350
 and when you put it to anchor the layer everything is 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:31.960
 will convert into a single layer 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.850
 and we already have the drawing from the 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.560
 photo I am eligible car but what 

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.320
 we could do with any other 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.270
 drawing the more defined you are in the 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.580
 edges possibly better we stay and 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.880
 we can do it on faces and good what 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.160
 question of experiencing 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.650
 and this was all for today and we 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.890
 we will find in the next video 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.890
 tutorial
