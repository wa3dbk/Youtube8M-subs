in<00:00:14.840> the<00:00:14.930> US<00:00:15.230> since<00:00:15.800> the<00:00:15.890> game<00:00:16.070> features

vegetables<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:17.300> prominently<00:00:17.840> we<00:00:18.080> thought

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
vegetables so prominently we thought

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.810 
vegetables so prominently we thought
we'd<00:00:18.470> ask<00:00:18.619> Kevin<00:00:18.920> here<00:00:19.220> what<00:00:19.400> he<00:00:19.490> thought<00:00:19.700> of

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
we'd ask Kevin here what he thought of

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.130 
we'd ask Kevin here what he thought of
it<00:00:19.910> but<00:00:20.150> then<00:00:20.390> we<00:00:20.539> realized<00:00:20.900> that<00:00:21.020> his

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
it but then we realized that his

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.900 
it but then we realized that his
attention<00:00:21.619> span<00:00:21.740> might<00:00:22.160> not<00:00:22.340> be<00:00:22.550> up<00:00:22.699> to<00:00:22.850> snuff

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
attention span might not be up to snuff

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.090 
attention span might not be up to snuff
so<00:00:23.480> I<00:00:23.510> guess<00:00:23.750> it's<00:00:23.930> up<00:00:24.050> to<00:00:24.080> me<00:00:24.199> it's<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:24.860> burden

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
so I guess it's up to me it's the burden

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:40.569 
so I guess it's up to me it's the burden
I<00:00:25.340> carry<00:00:25.369> I<00:00:25.820> suppose
