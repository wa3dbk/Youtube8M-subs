00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.269
 100% of the winners have tried their luck 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.699
 for three days this slogan 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.169
 advertising became our two 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.800

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.950
 we decided to stick together 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.070
 always putting cream 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.960

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.960
 there it is past arnaud 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.940

 everywhere for an hour and a half 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 I escaped from 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.199
 picnic 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.810
 dudes it's in the crates and then 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.380
 after the junta created twelve terminals what 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.510
 and then to him alone he is optimistic 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.990
 alex it's normal it's the regional of 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:25.290
 step 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:26.040

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.200
 will be alex 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.050
 unless chavanel tries something 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.040
 sophie chavanel thing 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.990
 I am a child but I believe that 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.310
 mechanics did not make a super eagle a 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.130
 motor scene of these candle by 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.210
 report to yesterday 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.640
 it's not there I'll do everything we do not know 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.010
 nothing 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.540
 in sophie has something else to do and 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.370
 it's alex slips into 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.290
 the breakaway of six from the first 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.100
 kilometer 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.100
 the race in the lead 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.330
 in the bus on arrival marc and freight a 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.640
 started out of college 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.480
 but the katusha and the peloton go 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.060
 set in motion 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.670
 and anyway 14 km from the line 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.740
 alex tired by the tour of italy does 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.460
 can not follow his companions 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.460
 there it is 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:31.600
 yes there is this caja caja 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:35.800
 because the platoon came back too early it's 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.870
 true arnaud and defeated van avermaet 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.140
 is needed 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.780
 pity it's a bit far 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.690
 I hold on well 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.360
 but it's of course speed and a micro 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.190
 sd 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.010
 so the man of the day is always 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.370

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.110

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.489
 is even more after the finish 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.490
 today three will recall jasper 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.490

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.490

 low wounds that helps repair them 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.549
