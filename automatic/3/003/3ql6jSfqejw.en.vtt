going to go down which is going to make
trading<00:04:08.669> the<00:04:09.329> some<00:04:09.599> of<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.750> more<00:04:09.900> expensive

that's<00:04:12.690> not<00:04:12.840> always<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.260> case<00:04:13.380> because<00:04:14.250> that

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
that's not always the case because that

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.069 
that's not always the case because that
means<00:04:14.579> that<00:04:14.849> more<00:04:15.060> people<00:04:15.239> won't<00:04:15.660> be<00:04:15.810> selling

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
means that more people won't be selling

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.479 
means that more people won't be selling
as<00:04:16.349> well<00:04:16.590> which<00:04:16.829> means<00:04:17.039> there's<00:04:17.280> going<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.459> be

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
as well which means there's going to be

as well which means there's going to be
the<00:04:17.609> possibility<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.930> might<00:04:19.109> get<00:04:19.440> a

the possibility that you might get a

the possibility that you might get a

good<00:04:54.300> tackle<00:04:55.020> except<00:04:55.470> maybe<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:56.190> handball<00:04:56.700> ish

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030
