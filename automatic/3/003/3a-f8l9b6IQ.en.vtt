00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 even matteo as I see there is a made 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.210
 in china yes they are the factory of the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.280
 world 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.559
 the same curious fact today comes from ching 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.670
 from indiano in fact that 15 follows from the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.099
 another power with more than one billion 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.929
 inhabitants because it has been known in the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.150
 the world's cheapest pcs tablet that 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.400
 sell at 60 dollars which is a 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.260
 curiosity and hate as it happens with many 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.580
 technological products start in a 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.380
 price and then they end at a price 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.390
 which is roughly 5 to 10 percent 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.210
 of what it was but let's see the data 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.040
 how is this tablet possible the pc that is 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.680
 the cheapest in the world good is a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.739
 price 60 dollars sold subsidized 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.960
 in some sectors at $ 35 first 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.940
 will be for 100,000 students in the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.510
 Indian something similar to what was done by 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.210
 example with notebooks sorry with the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.160
 netbooks here in argentina in uruguay and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.780
 in so many other countries I do not say but in 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.910
 place of a netbook gives you a 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.320
 tablet pc and the cost to which the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.020
 Chinese government for its students are 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.239
 50 dollars the truth is a cost more than 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.399
 promising now does not have all the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.769
 services and benefits 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.360
 normal tablet or at least the most 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.670
 known then I got india 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.190
 what is the offer in argentina 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.440
 let's start the amazon bet which is what 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.810
 newest the kindle fire that is finished to 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.930
 know very recently at a very low price 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.730
 competitive 199 dollars less than the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.740
 half of what the ipad comes out that is 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.920
 just the brand that created the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.920
 category but they start to that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.330
 begins the finite information for the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.670
 person who takes a nation and buy 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.510
 one of these products the screen is of 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.430
 7 inches on the iPad is 10 is 10 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.840
 inches is a little bit bigger than all 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.220
 good way there are more than 5 million 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.410
 units sold good strength 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.660
 commercial of a manson is very important 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.570
 and besides being a smaller screen 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.490
 that the ipad has no 3g connection and 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.740
 has no microphone that is 3g connection 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.960
 that you can put the telephone 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.930
 you want media because it really is 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.520
 for example the kindle fire has wifi its 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.050
 voice is in its place in which there is wifi 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.670
 free or with password you can access but 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.040
 you have no connection through a 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.450
 phone or generally the ipads 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.690
 they are sold liberated and then you 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.610
 purchases 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.030
 an ipad to each argentina or in another country 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.590
 you bring it and hire the service of the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.380
 telephony you want to have access 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.510
 to internet what I am explaining is 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.520
 obvious to the users of this product 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.350
 but like his way he does not see people who do not 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.560
 is user this product I think that 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.840
 also apply it now yes yes 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.960
 you the variety of offer in prices 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.110
 that Argentina is impressive not because 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.080
 I say that made in china but they sell 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.150
 here almost all with 7 screen 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.990
 inches and the prices start just like 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.620
 that the kindle fire start in 999 pesos 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.170
 and they carry up to 2 thousand 199 that is to say 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.470
 you can get a tablet pc for less 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.180
 thousand pesos now they are 10 out of 10 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.410
 inches for the most expensive price start 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.400
 in two thousand 699 pesos and end in three 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.439
 thousand 499 another topic is 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.019
 what amount and gas are available 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:14.019
 that there is the theme of memory in 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.739
 this case is generally from 2 to 8 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.989
 gigas it's weird that they are more than that now 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.670
 when I say 2 to 8 gigs we go to 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.640
 compare with the brand that created the 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.609
 category just with the ipad created 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.909
 by steve jobs and out there by apple 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:34.359
 fish you on the screen is 10 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:38.409
 has from 16 gb has no less and 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:41.170
 reaches up to 64 has 16 gigs arrives 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:47.230
 up to 64 and a total connectivity and the 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:50.049
 price is 3 thousand 599 pesos to 5 thousand 799 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.290
 now let's compare let's see 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.829
 if we find the other if we have it here 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:01.860
 to see between a tablet that is not the one 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:05.370
 created the category of 3.499 and the ipad 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.590
 3,599 with which you stay 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.450
 the truth is not specified now yes that 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.440
 I do not want to transform this you 're 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.840
 doing because he's doing it very 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.840
 well in a commercial notice 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.079
 but there is a brand that has a 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.100
 very big technical difference over the 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.840
 others but they say I do not know I do not want 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.760
 communicate clearly what maybe is not like this 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.620
 the technological issue except for the one that is 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.330
 an expert really knows what happens 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.050
 with going to the doctor what he says 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.669
 the clear 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.620
 exact but that what happens with the 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.590
 very technological issues that there are many 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.550
 in love with brands and they sell you 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.930
 wonders of a brand and when the 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.910
 It turns out that the brand goes back 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.530
 a model based mostly on the belt of 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.449
 Product Not not not think it's that the 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.830
 but I do not think that this is the 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.870
 case anyway I think that what 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.510
 what you have to compare is what use are you going to 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.150
 Also clear that if you want to have 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.669
 simply a virtual library the 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.260
 cheapest tablets of reach now if 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.360
 you want to watch internet television 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.040
 behind to have it as a company 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.710
 gesa meringue 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.140
 it depends also I insist what is the use 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.730
 you're going to want to if good we 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.070
 It serves to get to write a 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.670
 monograph of no pages not for that you 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.670
 a netbook is convenient 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.910
 that great dilemma did not give for example 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.040
 some of you said you do not want a tablet 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.920
 silvio has also been me now 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.980
 write in addition delegate has won the 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.410
 ads and you already have a smartphone if 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.410
 it makes sense that you have an ipad or what 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.760
 that outside I say ipad portable to see if 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.670
 you are already seeing it by the smartphone 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.470
 I say it also depends on your performance what 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:46.620
 I need a lot of situations yes 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.620
 please
