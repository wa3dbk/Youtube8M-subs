00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.019
 hello every year the opportunity to speak to you to take stock 

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.240
 on the state of negotiations between the autonomous federation of education 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.169
 and that's what she is 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:11.889
 you have surely heard in the last days 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.039
 an agreement would have occurred against the other federation fsl 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.720
 and the government of quebec 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.240
 it was extremely important and you understand that 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.760
 there is no death of man we speak finally speak and the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.489
 government 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.519
 so the agreement therefore in fact states in the immediate national does not concern us 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.239
 not 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.309
 we still actively negotiate to actually 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.929
 that the moving employer part showing us a great 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:37.220
 availability 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.330
 why then met the employer party to reach an agreement 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.240
 thigh 60 passed in the shortest time 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.680
 however we are not ready for any kind of compromise we are 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.190
 respectful of the salespeople you have given us 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.630
 improving the working conditions of precariousness 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.600
 improving services for students in difficulty 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.880
 and also improving the conditions of work-life balance 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.140
 professional 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.170
 to get back to the deal in an intense by members of the fsf 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.250
 I invite you to my daughters from misleading ads of flu 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.040
 which seems apparently interesting 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.180
 we talk a lot about student reduction 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.580
 of this number of students in classes I remind you that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.540
 all measures concerning primaries were already provided for by the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.170
 gc school project for its part the minister last september 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.220
 in 21 warriors does this exclusively concern students of 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.010
 first and second secondary so that there was an effective decrease 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.050
 of 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.990
 in e the number of pupils per class 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.780
 however the priority for him the test of adult education he has 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.570
 was founded by the 3rd 4th Secondary 5th 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.980
 yoshi no longer for the preschool test which are at the status quo of 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.150
 same as the practitioners and express themselves either for the words of welcome 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.100
 who yet we find a stretcher 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.000
 that few relations with my idol considering the reality of a piano 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.810
 I invite you to look at this year 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.470
 it is this eventual intention request of our work 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.749
 because we're not there too some cinemas 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:08.739
 The employer's advantage has been taken to impose a standard of 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.319
 continuing education obliged the parties to maintain a certain level of the sea 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.319
 skills, its part no more and no less than a professional order 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.540
 and who will have the door on teacher evaluation 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.699
 term 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.769
 we also talk about this annualization agreement your task 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.989
 for the test indeed trained spared their working time on a 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.770
 discrete annual basis so that 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.260
 the time we make a start to the year make me some 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.120
 utility we will try to help us to dare others money to fill 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.140
 the share of the ump 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.810
 the work we love our era while we know for a fact that in the beginning 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.030
 of year we need this money to make the preparation of the 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.979
 planning to meet our colleagues 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.519
 put in order his notes in eco class 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.440
 establish a working climate with joseph stiglitz 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.939
 as stable as possible to start the school year 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.760
 despite the interesting appearances of this agreement the man did not get lost 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.650
 this season 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.559
 besides we proposed to represent 20 years 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.739
 for members of the federal council it's negotiations the greens are always 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.519
 present in our proceedings and representing you reject it so 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.129
 unanimous 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.900
 it must be considered that there is no progress but what matters is not 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.260
 Sweden seems like a hunger strike it's stressful 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.489
 who had us so much state 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.079
 continue the negotiation 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.079
 content and mobilization to make sure that we achieve our goals 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.900
 he is above I wish we could meet 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.790
 52 'next events I invite you to continue the fight in 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.899
 this edition 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:36.220
 because I think that united health we are able to shift reporter 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.740
 and that's what has also led raids in his favor creating the 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.689
 federation 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.569
 it was to give oneself the means to be able to put forward another 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.859
 message put forth we occupy it's true that apart from attempting to 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.579
 meet our needs 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.299
 so we meet up in the next days or in 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.300
 next weeks 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.489
 I have all the attentions 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.269
 but neither at the pressure in your establishments addressing the 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.229
 necessary to be that it leaves the woman and her six feet 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:03.889
 the determination shown by the members of the federation 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.159
 international 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.879
 rothen and no country plunges into the present negotiations 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.750
