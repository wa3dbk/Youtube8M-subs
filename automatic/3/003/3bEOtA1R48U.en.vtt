again<00:03:46.120> with<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.810> edge<00:03:46.900> grills<00:03:47.200> if<00:03:47.530> we<00:03:47.680> take<00:03:47.830> a

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
again with the edge grills if we take a

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.250 
again with the edge grills if we take a
look<00:03:48.070> at<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.310> roof<00:03:48.489> now<00:03:49.480> I've<00:03:49.720> got<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.080> say

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
look at the roof now I've got to say

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.490 
look at the roof now I've got to say
that<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.860> very<00:03:51.250> very<00:03:52.590> nice<00:03:53.910> effect<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:56.290> I'm

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
that is a very very nice effect and I'm

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:05.070 
that is a very very nice effect and I'm
absolutely<00:03:59.610> group<00:04:00.610> well<00:04:00.970> I<00:04:02.820> can't<00:04:03.820> really<00:04:04.080> say

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
absolutely group well I can't really say

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.380 
absolutely group well I can't really say
really<00:04:05.290> but<00:04:05.560> I<00:04:05.860> just<00:04:06.280> think<00:04:06.370> it's<00:04:06.730> just<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:07.120> nice

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
really but I just think it's just a nice

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.370 
really but I just think it's just a nice
touch<00:04:07.750> because<00:04:08.680> it's<00:04:08.830> hatched<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.460> I<00:04:10.380> think

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
touch because it's hatched and I think

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.830 
touch because it's hatched and I think
the<00:04:11.860> minute<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.190> camp

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
the minute the camp

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.280 
the minute the camp
just<00:04:13.040> plain<00:04:14.040> upon<00:04:14.940> it<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.180> bit<00:04:15.390> as<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:16.019> looks<00:04:16.169> a

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
just plain upon it a bit as it looks a

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.760 
just plain upon it a bit as it looks a
bit<00:04:17.329> wavy<00:04:18.329> from<00:04:18.690> where<00:04:19.199> I'm<00:04:19.290> looking<00:04:19.320> at<00:04:19.739> it

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
bit wavy from where I'm looking at it

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.650 
bit wavy from where I'm looking at it
but<00:04:22.770> it<00:04:22.919> has<00:04:23.070> got<00:04:23.370> quite<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.910> bit<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.180> weight<00:04:24.389> to

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
but it has got quite a bit of weight to

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.140 
but it has got quite a bit of weight to
it<00:04:24.810> as<00:04:24.930> well<00:04:24.960> so<00:04:25.290> it's<00:04:25.500> good<00:04:25.710> for<00:04:25.889> light

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
it as well so it's good for light

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.689 
it as well so it's good for light
polling<00:04:27.169> and<00:04:28.169> obviously<00:04:28.830> if<00:04:29.070> we<00:04:29.220> just<00:04:29.310> take<00:04:29.639> a

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
polling and obviously if we just take a

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.960 
polling and obviously if we just take a
look<00:04:30.020> at<00:04:31.020> this<00:04:31.139> end<00:04:31.410> you<00:04:32.040> can<00:04:32.190> see<00:04:32.400> here<00:04:32.699> I<00:04:32.850> have

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
look at this end you can see here I have

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.689 
look at this end you can see here I have
fitted<00:04:33.949> some<00:04:34.949> detailing<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:37.220> what<00:04:38.220> think

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
fitted some detailing and what think

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.950 
fitted some detailing and what think
it's<00:04:39.419> not<00:04:39.660> stain<00:04:40.290> still<00:04:40.650> as<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:40.860> should<00:04:41.070> do<00:04:41.960> we

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
it's not stain still as it should do we

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.740 
it's not stain still as it should do we
doesn't<00:04:43.139> really<00:04:43.380> matter<00:04:43.650> because<00:04:44.570> what<00:04:45.570> this

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
doesn't really matter because what this

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.300 
doesn't really matter because what this
is<00:04:45.990> going<00:04:46.139> to<00:04:46.260> be<00:04:46.380> pulling<00:04:46.620> are<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.160> new

Batman got models own to do some I think

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.909 
Batman got models own to do some I think
it<00:04:56.790> was<00:04:56.910> last<00:04:57.060> year<00:04:57.320> but<00:04:58.320> they've<00:04:58.560> just<00:04:58.710> bought

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
it was last year but they've just bought

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.250 
it was last year but they've just bought
them<00:04:59.100> out<00:04:59.190> again<00:04:59.479> so<00:05:00.479> that's<00:05:00.810> what<00:05:00.990> this<00:05:01.110> will

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
them out again so that's what this will

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.659 
them out again so that's what this will
be<00:05:01.350> pulling<00:05:01.590> because<00:05:01.979> I've<00:05:02.160> actually<00:05:02.460> got

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
be pulling because I've actually got
