00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.190 

so<00:05:25.880> we've<00:05:26.060> left<00:05:26.270> Havana<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:26.870> reached<00:05:27.020> our

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
so we've left Havana and reached our

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.140 
so we've left Havana and reached our
targets<00:05:27.530> hide<00:05:27.680> out<00:05:27.890> here<00:05:28.100> we<00:05:28.730> can<00:05:28.880> see<00:05:29.000> that

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
targets hide out here we can see that

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.850 
targets hide out here we can see that
ducasse<00:05:29.480> is<00:05:29.720> on<00:05:29.840> that<00:05:29.960> man-of-war<00:05:30.410> off<00:05:30.620> in<00:05:30.800> the

ducasse is on that man-of-war off in the

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.500 
ducasse is on that man-of-war off in the
distance<00:05:31.040> so<00:05:31.820> we'll<00:05:31.970> have<00:05:32.090> to<00:05:32.240> go<00:05:32.330> through

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
distance so we'll have to go through

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.430 
distance so we'll have to go through
this<00:05:32.570> jungle<00:05:32.870> to<00:05:33.200> get<00:05:33.350> to<00:05:33.440> him<00:05:35.260> jungles<00:05:36.260> are
