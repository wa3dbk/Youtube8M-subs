population i get a hatchery and then I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.800 
population i get a hatchery and then I
get<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> drawn<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.130> I'm<00:01:11.460> back<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.939> 909<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.689> then

I make my spawning pool and that puts me
at<00:01:15.869> eight<00:01:16.020> or<00:01:16.049> nine<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:17.040> another

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
drone so I get back 29 / 9 and then I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.190 
drone so I get back 29 / 9 and then I
make<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.070> gas<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.939> i<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.479> taylor<00:01:21.689> nine<00:01:22.020> then

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
make a gas so i get taylor nine then

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.140 
make a gas so i get taylor nine then
make<00:01:22.350> another<00:01:22.500> drone<00:01:22.740> 1909<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.520> then<00:01:23.759> i<00:01:23.790> make

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
make another drone 1909 and then i make

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.789 
make another drone 1909 and then i make
an<00:01:24.240> overlord<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:25.080> after<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> Overlord

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
an overlord and then after the Overlord

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.980 
an overlord and then after the Overlord
and<00:01:25.860> make<00:01:26.040> eight<00:01:26.700> circlings<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.570> reason<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
and make eight circlings the reason this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.920 
and make eight circlings the reason this
builder<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.740> good<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.930> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
builder is really good is because it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
builder is really good is because it
lets<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.770> masters<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.850> zerglings<00:01:33.060> are

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
lets you get masters of zerglings are

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.609 
lets you get masters of zerglings are
really<00:01:33.600> fast<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.320> probably<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
really fast like it's probably the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
really fast like it's probably the
fastest<00:01:34.950> way<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.790> would<00:01:36.119> say<00:01:36.299> 24

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
fastest way to get I would say 24

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.420 
fastest way to get I would say 24
zerglings<00:01:37.110> out<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.950> because<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
zerglings out just because you have to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
zerglings out just because you have to
actually<00:01:38.610> popping<00:01:39.150> struggling<00:01:39.689> right<00:01:40.049> from

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
actually popping struggling right from

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.499 
actually popping struggling right from
when<00:01:40.439> you're<00:01:40.560> spawning<00:01:40.860> pool<00:01:40.979> finishes

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
when you're spawning pool finishes

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.069 
when you're spawning pool finishes
basically<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> spawning<00:01:42.750> pool<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:42.990> your

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
basically a spawning pool on your

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.910 
basically a spawning pool on your
hatchet<00:01:43.290> ii<00:01:43.320> finished<00:01:43.439> at<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.740> same<00:01:43.890> time<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
hatchet ii finished at the same time and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.039 
hatchet ii finished at the same time and
support<00:01:46.920> us<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> bottom<00:01:48.390> left<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.810> zerg

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
support us is a bottom left and the zerg

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.389 
support us is a bottom left and the zerg
is<00:01:52.229> probably<00:01:52.500> going<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> top<00:01:52.950> right<00:01:53.189> well

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
is probably going to be a top right well

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.780 
is probably going to be a top right well
obviously<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> top<00:01:54.479> right<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
obviously going to be a top right and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.760 
obviously going to be a top right and
personally<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> really<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.570> Zerg<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.500> zergs

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
personally I really think Zerg to zergs

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.450 
personally I really think Zerg to zergs
on<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.100> map<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.310> pretty<00:01:59.759> imbalance<00:02:01.460> just

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
on this map is pretty imbalance just

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.770 
on this map is pretty imbalance just
because<00:02:02.729> there's<00:02:02.909> no<00:02:03.030> rampant<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.600> very

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
because there's no rampant it's very

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.660 
because there's no rampant it's very
very<00:02:04.049> easy<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.710> easily<00:02:05.189> break<00:02:05.490> your

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
very easy to just easily break your

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.229 
very easy to just easily break your
opponent<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.689> masses<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.170> zerglings<00:02:08.239> yeah

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
opponent with masses of zerglings yeah

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.780 
opponent with masses of zerglings yeah
sorry<00:02:10.170> about<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.349> whether<00:02:11.310> you're<00:02:11.550> pointing

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
overlord my spawning pool and my hat we

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:18.530 
overlord my spawning pool and my hat we
all<00:02:17.400> finished<00:02:17.700> at<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.879> almost<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.239> same<00:02:18.359> time

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
all finished at the almost the same time

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.030 
all finished at the almost the same time
so<00:02:18.780> now<00:02:18.900> i<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.079> a<00:02:19.200> zerglings<00:02:19.650> out<00:02:19.739> all<00:02:19.920> at

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
so now i have a zerglings out all at

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.099 
so now i have a zerglings out all at
once<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.939> the<00:02:21.180> zerg<00:02:21.390> has<00:02:21.629> gotten<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> song

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
once and the zerg has gotten a song

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.709 
once and the zerg has gotten a song
again<00:02:22.200> if<00:02:22.890> you're<00:02:23.099> as<00:02:23.219> arrogant<00:02:23.310> your

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
again if you're as arrogant your

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.910 
again if you're as arrogant your
partner's<00:02:24.719> approach<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.230> Saturn<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.829> you're

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
partner's approach a Saturn and you're

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.580 
partner's approach a Saturn and you're
facing<00:02:26.099> two<00:02:26.340> eggs<00:02:26.609> you<00:02:27.510> have<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:28.049> get<00:02:28.200> masses

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
facing two eggs you have to get masses

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.410 
facing two eggs you have to get masses
of<00:02:28.620> sunken<00:02:29.040> because<00:02:29.459> honestly<00:02:29.939> even<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:30.269> you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
of sunken because honestly even if you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.080 
of sunken because honestly even if you
get<00:02:30.599> like<00:02:30.719> five<00:02:31.200> seconds<00:02:31.709> well<00:02:32.609> actually<00:02:32.730> five

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
get like five seconds well actually five

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.160 
get like five seconds well actually five
seconds<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.480> probably<00:02:33.719> good<00:02:33.840> enough<00:02:33.930> for

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
seconds is probably good enough for

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.720 
seconds is probably good enough for
anything<00:02:34.349> less<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.859> for<00:02:35.159> sunken<00:02:35.340> is

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
anything less like for sunken is

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.059 
anything less like for sunken is
breakable<00:02:36.209> with<00:02:36.930> tues<00:02:37.139> when<00:02:37.650> you're<00:02:37.769> against

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
breakable with tues when you're against

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.339 
breakable with tues when you're against
two<00:02:38.189> zerks<00:02:38.400> because<00:02:38.819> pretty<00:02:39.659> much<00:02:39.750> if<00:02:40.139> you're

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
two zerks because pretty much if you're

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.440 
two zerks because pretty much if you're
against<00:02:40.620> two<00:02:40.739> Zergs<00:02:41.040> i<00:02:41.340> would<00:02:41.489> say<00:02:41.700> three

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
against two Zergs i would say three

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.660 
against two Zergs i would say three
minutes<00:02:42.750> into<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.109> game<00:02:43.139> you<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.159> be<00:02:44.250> against

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
minutes into the game you can be against

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.990 
minutes into the game you can be against
24<00:02:45.120> zerglings<00:02:45.510> if<00:02:46.290> they<00:02:46.620> do<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:47.040> mass<00:02:47.579> they're

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
24 zerglings if they do a mass they're

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.289 
24 zerglings if they do a mass they're
going<00:02:48.180> build<00:02:48.389> order<00:02:49.639> so<00:02:50.639> you<00:02:50.669> know<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.060> really

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
going build order so you know you really

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.849 
going build order so you know you really
have<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.569> be<00:02:51.599> aware<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.139> you<00:02:52.439> really<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.739> to

everything's going down and the Zerg is

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.929 
everything's going down and the Zerg is
getting<00:04:09.870> inspired<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.439> this<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.370> something<00:04:11.549> I

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939

Tuesday's<00:04:17.400> are<00:04:17.639> pretty<00:04:17.820> imbalanced<00:04:18.329> because

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
Tuesday's are pretty imbalanced because

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.229 
Tuesday's are pretty imbalanced because
basically<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.250> can<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.519> force<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.940> Zerg<00:04:21.120> to

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
basically you can you force the Zerg to

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.420 
basically you can you force the Zerg to
get<00:04:21.389> masses<00:04:21.779> of<00:04:21.810> cat<00:04:22.139> hunkins<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.099> if<00:04:23.310> they

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
get masses of cat hunkins and if they

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.709 
get masses of cat hunkins and if they
don't<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.729> pretty<00:04:23.909> much<00:04:23.940> quit<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.300> Zerg<00:04:24.479> over

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:24.719 
don't you pretty much quit the Zerg over

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.480 
don't you pretty much quit the Zerg over
but<00:04:25.260> if<00:04:25.349> they<00:04:25.500> do<00:04:25.680> that<00:04:25.919> means<00:04:26.070> they<00:04:26.219> have<00:04:26.310> very

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
but if they do that means they have very

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.660 
but if they do that means they have very
the

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
the

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.010 
the
economy<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.240> they've<00:04:27.360> really<00:04:27.390> very<00:04:27.930> little

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
economy and they've really very little

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.540 
economy and they've really very little
zerglings<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.920> they<00:04:29.070> have<00:04:29.190> very<00:04:29.220> little

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
zerglings and they have very little

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.910 
zerglings and they have very little
Jones<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.990> basically<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:31.470> can<00:04:31.620> screw<00:04:31.830> the

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
Jones so basically you can screw the

Jones so basically you can screw the
other<00:04:32.070> important<00:04:32.340> order<00:04:32.460> like<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.970> four<00:04:33.120> toes
