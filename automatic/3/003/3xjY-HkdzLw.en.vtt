00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.690
 five years reading effectively with 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.450
 so many 25 years descendants of the rose 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.350
 says they come and to celebrate it for 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.150
 celebrate this year they will parade with 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.100
 costumes from another year but they are 24 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.240
 previous costumes take everything to 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.070
 beginning 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.810
 there we can go see 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.910
 with which to give a global definition of 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.040
 who are disguised the deserters and we 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.020
 It's very complicated because it 's a 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.400
 hodgepodge is a mixture of all 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.690
 costumes that I have lowered during the 24 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.690
 years the rail here we are seeing 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.980
 a summary of all the work they have 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.720
 called fantasy this year's costume 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:50.660
 they are first prize year 2000 and third 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.260
 award I have targeted 1989 1992 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.190
 also a better banner of the year 2000 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.510
 and the suit was designed by nazaret lopez 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.510
 who is 13 years old 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.580
 which in some cases is no longer that 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.090
 remove to make way but those who 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.700
 they are asking for a step to take us away 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.700
 directly with an artistic 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.760
 then only in four 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.760
 previous participations 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.740
 very nice back and all because 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.030
 a lot of work 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.030
 they are spectacular 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.330
 spectacular 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.430
 and we have the luck of truth that 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.090
 so now they are lucky that they do not 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.509
 It has moved 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.079
 air because not only the caps 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.079
 banners 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.760
 soil elements 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.460
 tremendous and although it is changing us 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.580
 a little the day I will say it for a 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.580
 solid that allowed you to escape from the 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.869
 cars to him only friends of mine like the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.539
 they have already in the good the evil has been 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.230
 gone and we have been left with a core that 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.980
 for nothing prevents this parade carry 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.860
 the force that carries 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.450
 we do not see the choreography and this is the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.879
 proposal of the deserters for this 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.489
 year after seeing this summary of the 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.950
 arms that have been here for 25 years 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.170
 we are seeing then the disguise of which 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.450
 he spoke high selling a fantasy of 600 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.090
 of the rose this is what he has designed 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.950
 a 13-year-old girl if that was left 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.670
 I repeat again if I'm wrong that I 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.670
 they ran and I apologize 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.120
 the choreography mariangeles herb 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.120
 lion lÃ³pez 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.330
 another detail the boots are something more 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.230
 that the boots can see work 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.230
 two months 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.420
 and the comparsas all equally in the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.400
 sense that we may like more 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.810
 some others but I know the work that 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.560
 the dedication months have been 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.599
 worries the messes and this one that 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.360
 always valuing independently 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.400
 You may like a suit or another 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.800
 we are always more we have another opinion 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.560
 we can have a different idea but the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.300
 work is for everyone equally hard and long 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.660
 but in the Venetian world we're 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.310
 watching that comparsa 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.310
 in the layers that the roses carry 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.450
 handkerchiefs in their hands 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.360
 is a complement to choreography 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.420
 and who in the choreography commands 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.760
 percussion the percussion which marks the 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.409
 rhythms and choreography do not adapt 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.909
 little to the rhythms that the boys carry 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.909
 they do not have 456 rhythm 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.300
 and then the dance or depends on the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.340
 thematic and the idea of a choreography in 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.500
 that line was designed all the music 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.000
 all this usually free rhythms 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.800
 us about putting new rhythms 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.330
 you always have about after some 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.800
 year depends on rhythm no but it's already a 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.040
 thing that comes from the rhythms are 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.180
 studied even if you are separating a 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.799
 special theme as we have seen 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.320
 African then go to the formalism more 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.640
 but it's usually music that 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.240
 makes the rhythms and then the choreography 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.240
 it adapts quickly 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.000
 how many jobs how much do I work a lot 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.900
 work 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.370
 in a week but well taken advantage of that 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.950
 I am not working for many months 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.729
 explode for a week 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.700
 how to eat 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.969
 all that 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.659
 the compasses to live it 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.659
 and so not 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.440
 the little ones work 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.440
 or the boxes in front 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.760
 it is essential that the little ones learn 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.140
 to touch 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.530
 these are the ones that in the future will 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.530
 bring in person 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.460
 In the very near future, I'm good at 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.170
 there are all of them since 78 nothing years 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.170
 10 and we already have the following
