00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hey guys welcome back to XDA today we're

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:02.840 
hey guys welcome back to XDA today we're
going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.890> talk<00:00:02.070> about<00:00:02.100> our<00:00:02.399> app<00:00:02.520> called

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
going to talk about our app called

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.789 
going to talk about our app called
ampere<00:00:03.419> it's<00:00:03.659> an<00:00:03.840> application<00:00:03.990> that<00:00:04.470> gives<00:00:04.680> us

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
ampere it's an application that gives us

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.889 
ampere it's an application that gives us
the<00:00:04.920> ability<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.279> understand<00:00:05.790> what<00:00:06.000> rate<00:00:06.779> is

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
the ability to understand what rate is

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.930 
the ability to understand what rate is
our<00:00:07.049> device<00:00:07.259> charging<00:00:07.740> at<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.099> what<00:00:08.580> rate<00:00:08.820> is

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
our device charging at and what rate is

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.270 
our device charging at and what rate is
our<00:00:09.059> device<00:00:09.389> discharging<00:00:10.320> at<00:00:10.469> something<00:00:11.160> new

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
our device discharging at something new

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.590 
our device discharging at something new
let's<00:00:12.030> check<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.300> out

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.880 

when<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:18.720> think<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.020> power<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.470> what<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.710> think

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
when we think of power and what we think

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.200 
when we think of power and what we think
of<00:00:20.010> essentially<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.490> what<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:20.730> do<00:00:20.850> with<00:00:21.000> power

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
of essentially is what we do with power

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.240 
of essentially is what we do with power
we<00:00:21.510> get<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.810> from<00:00:21.960> different<00:00:22.260> sources<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:23.100> get

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
we get it from different sources we get

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.650 
we get it from different sources we get
it<00:00:23.340> from<00:00:23.400> other<00:00:23.580> portable<00:00:24.000> power<00:00:24.210> banks<00:00:24.570> that

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it from other portable power banks that

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.839 
it from other portable power banks that
were<00:00:24.779> able<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.050> charge<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.560> recharge<00:00:25.949> using

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
were able to charge and recharge using

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.460 
were able to charge and recharge using
them<00:00:27.000> we're<00:00:27.599> able<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.050> from<00:00:28.140> regular

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
them we're able to get it from regular

comes with the Nexus 6 next we have USB
cables<00:00:34.829> those<00:00:35.040> are<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> normal

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
cables those are the normal

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.740 
cables those are the normal
run-of-the-mill<00:00:35.790> cables<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.570> usually

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
run-of-the-mill cables that you usually

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.389 
run-of-the-mill cables that you usually
get<00:00:37.079> with<00:00:37.350> your<00:00:37.530> device<00:00:37.739> when<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.070> purchase

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
get with your device when you purchase

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.340 
get with your device when you purchase
it<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.300> you're<00:00:39.480> able<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.719> basically<00:00:39.840> sync

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it and you're able to basically sync

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.170 
it and you're able to basically sync
data<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:40.980> mostly<00:00:41.340> charged<00:00:41.790> with<00:00:42.059> it

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
data with it but mostly charged with it

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.280 
data with it but mostly charged with it
and<00:00:42.300> that's<00:00:42.360> usually<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.899> use<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.230> for

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and that's usually what we use this for

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
and that's usually what we use this for
more<00:00:44.070> than<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.149> thinking

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
more than actually just thinking

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.150 
more than actually just thinking
information<00:00:45.960> over<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.860> course<00:00:46.890> we

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
information over it and of course we

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.889 
information over it and of course we
have<00:00:47.250> different<00:00:47.370> types<00:00:47.789> last<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.660> least

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
have different types last but not least

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.270 
have different types last but not least
we<00:00:49.020> also<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> ability<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> wirelessly

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
we also have the ability of wirelessly

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
we also have the ability of wirelessly
charging<00:00:50.760> our<00:00:50.850> devices<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.140> short

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
charging our devices but the short

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.660

version what I'm trying to get to you

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.700 
version what I'm trying to get to you
guys<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.030> all<00:00:54.539> these<00:00:54.840> things<00:00:54.899> provide<00:00:55.530> us

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
guys is all these things provide us

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.560 
guys is all these things provide us
power<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> fact<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.879> matter<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
power but the fact that matter is the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.630 
power but the fact that matter is the
power<00:00:57.780> stored<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.289> our<00:00:58.350> device<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.489> need

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
power stored in our device and we need

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.979 
power stored in our device and we need
to<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> better<00:01:00.090> understanding<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.750> what

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
to have a better understanding of what

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.900 
to have a better understanding of what
is<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.320> power<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.890> being<00:01:02.070> consumed<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.760> what

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
is this power it being consumed at what

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
is this power it being consumed at what
rate<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> normal

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
rate so as you can see here the normal

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.960 
rate so as you can see here the normal
system<00:01:04.739> right<00:01:04.979> now<00:01:05.040> my<00:01:05.339> device<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.850> not

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
system right now my device is not

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.700 
system right now my device is not
plugged<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.840> charging<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.560> it's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
plugged in it's not charging it and it's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.710 
plugged in it's not charging it and it's
actually<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> discharge<00:01:08.460> rate<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.479> tells

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
actually at the discharge rate it tells

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.000 
actually at the discharge rate it tells
us<00:01:09.840> obviously<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> version<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> device

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
us obviously the version of the device

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.500 
us obviously the version of the device
the<00:01:11.250> version<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.640> operating<00:01:11.939> system<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the version of the operating system the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.210 
the version of the operating system the
model<00:01:12.810> number<00:01:13.080> gives<00:01:13.560> us<00:01:13.680> basically<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
model number gives us basically the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.770 
model number gives us basically the
voltage<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.939> temperature<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
voltage and the temperature and the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.719 
voltage and the temperature and the
health<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> actual<00:01:16.590> overall<00:01:16.770> system<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
health of the actual overall system and

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.640 
health of the actual overall system and
it<00:01:17.970> says<00:01:18.119> basically<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.869> battery<00:01:19.439> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
it says basically it's on battery and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.170 
it says basically it's on battery and
it's<00:01:19.770> discharging<00:01:20.280> that's<00:01:20.549> basically<00:01:20.970> where

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
it's discharging that's basically where

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.929 
it's discharging that's basically where
I<00:01:21.240> am<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.600> now<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.040> what<00:01:23.040> happens<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.580> what

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
I am right now and what happens is what

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.490 
I am right now and what happens is what
happens<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> start<00:01:24.720> charging<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
happens when you start charging what is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.980 
happens when you start charging what is
exactly<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> for<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> percentage<00:01:26.990> first

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
exactly that for a percentage first

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.179 
exactly that for a percentage first
thing<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> go<00:01:28.530> through<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.860> explain

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
thing I'm going to go through is explain

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.230 
thing I'm going to go through is explain
to<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> guys<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:30.000> bit<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to you guys with a little bit of the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
to you guys with a little bit of the
application<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.070> little<00:01:32.250> bit

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
application is we do have a little bit

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.649 
application is we do have a little bit
of<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.729> information<00:01:33.240> rating<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
of just information rating the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.210 
of just information rating the
application<00:01:34.140> there<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.380> really<00:01:34.680> no<00:01:34.829> setup

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
application there is really no setup

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
application there is really no setup
into<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.579> application<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.570> moment<00:01:36.869> you

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
into this application the moment you

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.719 
into this application the moment you
install<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.530> turn<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.159> works<00:01:38.340> right

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
install it and turn it on it works right

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.730 
install it and turn it on it works right
out<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.030> box<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.750> only<00:01:39.930> prerequisite<00:01:40.500> is

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
out of the box the only prerequisite is

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.590 
out of the box the only prerequisite is
it<00:01:40.890> needs<00:01:41.070> about<00:01:41.280> maybe<00:01:41.579> five<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.060> ten<00:01:42.210> seconds

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
it needs about maybe five to ten seconds

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.359 
it needs about maybe five to ten seconds
to<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> measuring<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.770> essentially<00:01:44.189> does

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
to do the measuring and essentially does

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.160 
to do the measuring and essentially does
a<00:01:44.460> quick<00:01:44.909> sample<00:01:45.149> rate<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.659> multiple

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
a quick sample rate of multiple

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.510 
a quick sample rate of multiple
different<00:01:46.320> readings<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.189> gives<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
different readings and it gives you the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.149 
different readings and it gives you the
average<00:01:47.700> over<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.840> time<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> gives<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
average over that time and gives you the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.139 
average over that time and gives you the
ability<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.490> looking<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.909> minimum

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
ability of looking at the minimum

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.139 
ability of looking at the minimum
voltage<00:01:51.659> which<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.409> negative<00:01:52.740> 420<00:01:53.729> distance

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
voltage which is a negative 420 distance

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.300 
voltage which is a negative 420 distance
I<00:01:54.240> turned<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> high<00:01:55.680> voltage<00:01:55.740> of

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
I turned it on and to a high voltage of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.999 
I turned it on and to a high voltage of
negative<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.570> one<00:01:57.899> eleven<00:01:58.530> forty<00:01:58.799> four<00:01:58.979> forty

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
negative one one eleven forty four forty

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.219 
negative one one eleven forty four forty
now<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.390> saying<00:02:00.570> essentially<00:02:01.079> is

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
now what this is saying essentially is

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.499 
now what this is saying essentially is
in<00:02:01.710> my<00:02:02.130> current<00:02:02.399> state<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.180> charts

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
in my current state in that this charts

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.630 
in my current state in that this charts
say<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.350> minimum<00:02:04.829> I've<00:02:05.070> actually<00:02:05.219> been<00:02:05.549> able

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
say the minimum I've actually been able

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.580 
say the minimum I've actually been able
to<00:02:05.790> discharge<00:02:06.299> me<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> system<00:02:07.049> usage<00:02:07.409> as

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
to discharge me in the system usage as

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.320 
to discharge me in the system usage as
I'm<00:02:07.829> talking<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.610> guys<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.910> using<00:02:09.239> it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
I'm talking to you guys in using it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.470 
I'm talking to you guys in using it
right<00:02:09.479> now<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.979> 420<00:02:10.979> amps<00:02:11.129> or<00:02:11.400> milliamps<00:02:12.360> and

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
right now is 420 amps or milliamps and

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.820 
right now is 420 amps or milliamps and
then<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.870> course<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> maximum

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
then of course the maximum

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.830 
then of course the maximum
11:40<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.430> at<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.760> point<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.090> had<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.390> screen

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
11:40 and at that point I had the screen

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.150 
11:40 and at that point I had the screen
brightness<00:02:16.050> fully<00:02:16.470> bright<00:02:16.740> all<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> way<00:02:17.100> to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
brightness fully bright all the way to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.980 
brightness fully bright all the way to
the<00:02:17.310> top<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:18.150> actually<00:02:18.330> kind<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.690> lowered

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
the top and I actually kind of lowered

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.400 
the top and I actually kind of lowered
it<00:02:19.080> down

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
it down

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.900 
it down
so<00:02:19.680> obviously<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.250> more<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.460> use<00:02:20.580> out<00:02:20.880> of

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
so obviously the more you use out of

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.340 
so obviously the more you use out of
your<00:02:21.000> device<00:02:21.330> you're<00:02:21.660> using<00:02:21.690> more<00:02:22.290> power

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
your device you're using more power

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.840 
your device you're using more power
obviously<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.280> that's<00:02:23.340> why<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.610> have<00:02:23.820> a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
obviously and that's why you have a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.390 
obviously and that's why you have a
shorter<00:02:24.210> life<00:02:24.390> battery<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:25.620> what<00:02:26.070> happens

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
shorter life battery but what happens

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.830 
shorter life battery but what happens
when<00:02:26.550> we<00:02:26.670> start<00:02:26.880> basically<00:02:27.330> connecting<00:02:27.750> our

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
when we start basically connecting our

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.330 
when we start basically connecting our
device<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.350> things<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.740> charging<00:02:29.190> things

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
device to things and charging things

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.770 
device to things and charging things
with<00:02:29.580> them<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.120> we're<00:02:30.270> going<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.420> do<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.660> we're

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
with them so we're going to do is we're

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.900 
with them so we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.930> use<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.260> USB<00:02:32.100> cable<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:32.640> we<00:02:32.730> get

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
going to use this USB cable that we get

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.430 
going to use this USB cable that we get
most<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.420> us<00:02:33.510> get<00:02:33.690> them<00:02:33.810> with<00:02:33.900> our<00:02:34.020> device<00:02:34.230> when

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
most of us get them with our device when

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.230 
most of us get them with our device when
we<00:02:34.530> purchase<00:02:34.920> them<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.280> what<00:02:36.030> we<00:02:36.120> do

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
we purchase them and what we do

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.060 
we purchase them and what we do
essentially<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.840> always<00:02:37.140> end<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:37.590> plugging<00:02:37.830> in

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
essentially is always end up plugging in

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.040 
essentially is always end up plugging in
our<00:02:38.130> device<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.580> trying<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.630> charge<00:02:39.870> our

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
our device and trying to charge our

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.110 
our device and trying to charge our
device<00:02:40.290> using<00:02:40.710> those<00:02:40.860> powerful<00:02:41.070> cords<00:02:41.550> so

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
device using those powerful cords so

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.490 
device using those powerful cords so
we're<00:02:42.240> going<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.420> use<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> power<00:02:42.840> bank<00:02:43.020> for<00:02:43.350> this

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
we're going to use a power bank for this

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.350 
we're going to use a power bank for this
example<00:02:43.890> I've<00:02:44.220> charged<00:02:44.670> many<00:02:44.910> things<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
example I've charged many things in the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.480 
example I've charged many things in the
past<00:02:45.570> with<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.860> I'll<00:02:46.980> show<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.130> guys<00:02:47.280> an

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
past with it and I'll show you guys an

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.940 
past with it and I'll show you guys an
example<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:48.030> one<00:02:48.180> second<00:02:48.600> but<00:02:48.720> now<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.830> I've

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
example in one second but now that I've

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.530 
example in one second but now that I've
plugged<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.790> can<00:02:50.940> notice<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
plugged it in you can notice that the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.720 
plugged it in you can notice that the
actual<00:02:52.290> symbol<00:02:52.800> for<00:02:52.920> charging<00:02:53.280> goes<00:02:53.490> up<00:02:53.610> on

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
actual symbol for charging goes up on

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.550 
actual symbol for charging goes up on
the<00:02:53.820> top<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.270> says<00:02:54.330> measuring<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.170> changes

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
the top it says measuring it changes

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.470 
the top it says measuring it changes
color<00:02:55.770> now<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.790> greenish<00:02:57.209> bluish

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
color now it's in the greenish bluish

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.240 
color now it's in the greenish bluish
color<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.500> gives<00:02:58.650> us<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.860> ability<00:02:58.950> of

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
color and it gives us the ability of

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.310 
color and it gives us the ability of
understanding<00:02:59.340> now<00:02:59.850> what<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.420> rating<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
understanding now what the rating of the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.310 
understanding now what the rating of the
charge<00:03:01.590> state<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.130> minimum<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.150> 7:30<00:03:03.660> maximum

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
charge state is minimum is 7:30 maximum

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.560 
charge state is minimum is 7:30 maximum
is<00:03:04.440> 770<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.580> tells<00:03:05.760> us<00:03:05.910> it's<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.180> an<00:03:06.270> AC<00:03:06.390> charger

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
is 770 it tells us it's on an AC charger

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.690 
is 770 it tells us it's on an AC charger
based<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.410> fact<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.920> current<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.580> it's

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
based on the fact the current that it's

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.220 
based on the fact the current that it's
pulling<00:03:08.940> right<00:03:09.150> now<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.510> faster<00:03:10.050> than<00:03:10.200> a

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
pulling right now is faster than a

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.590 
pulling right now is faster than a
normal<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:11.550> know<00:03:11.640> standard<00:03:11.970> one<00:03:12.150> amp<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.420> have

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
normal you know standard one amp I have

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.880 
normal you know standard one amp I have
it<00:03:12.720> on<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> 2.1<00:03:13.410> amp<00:03:13.590> port<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.850> my<00:03:14.880> raft<00:03:15.300> power

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
it on the 2.1 amp port on my raft power

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.430 
it on the 2.1 amp port on my raft power
power<00:03:16.890> brick<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.750> what<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.840> gives<00:03:19.080> us<00:03:19.230> here

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
power brick and what it gives us here

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.170 
power brick and what it gives us here
essentially<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:19.920> again<00:03:20.220> same<00:03:20.610> information<00:03:20.940> we

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
essentially is again same information we

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.490 
essentially is again same information we
had<00:03:21.300> before<00:03:21.450> but<00:03:21.870> now<00:03:21.989> we<00:03:22.050> have<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> better

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
had before but now we have a better

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.170 
had before but now we have a better
understanding<00:03:22.580> how<00:03:23.580> much<00:03:23.730> power<00:03:23.970> I'm

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
understanding how much power I'm

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.509 
understanding how much power I'm
actually<00:03:24.390> getting<00:03:24.720> out<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:26.370> you

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
actually getting out of it if you

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.949 
actually getting out of it if you
actually<00:03:26.640> click<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.120> battery<00:03:27.450> itself<00:03:27.780> here

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
actually click the battery itself here

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.240 
actually click the battery itself here
it<00:03:28.080> just<00:03:28.230> gives<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.620> ability<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.980> looking

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
it just gives you the ability of looking

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.740 
it just gives you the ability of looking
at<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.459> battery<00:03:29.730> history<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.360> is<00:03:30.510> just

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
on the AOSP bass drums how much time is

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.180 
on the AOSP bass drums how much time is
just<00:03:45.570> going<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:45.930> for<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.500> left<00:03:46.769> over<00:03:47.010> for

just going to have for it left over for

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.800 
just going to have for it left over for
it<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.340> charge<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.790> device<00:03:47.970> entirely<00:03:48.510> and

it to charge the device entirely and

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.900 
it to charge the device entirely and
that's<00:03:49.140> because<00:03:49.440> there<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.709> actually<00:03:50.040> metrics

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
that's because there is actually metrics

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.240 
that period I like the fact that
actually<00:04:19.140> it's<00:04:19.290> pretty<00:04:19.440> simple<00:04:19.859> as<00:04:19.979> far<00:04:20.160> as

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
actually it's pretty simple as far as

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.039 
actually it's pretty simple as far as
the<00:04:20.370> interface<00:04:21.090> gives<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:21.720> all<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
the interface gives you all the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.900 
the interface gives you all the
information<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:23.039> also<00:04:23.250> gives<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.729> type

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
information it also gives you the type

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.180 
information it also gives you the type
of<00:04:23.940> charging<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.570> you're<00:04:24.750> doing<00:04:25.050> if<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:26.039> go

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
of charging that you're doing if you go

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.590 
of charging that you're doing if you go
faster<00:04:26.700> or<00:04:26.729> higher<00:04:27.150> level

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
faster or higher level

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.970 
faster or higher level
than<00:04:27.780> one<00:04:27.930> amp<00:04:28.170> or<00:04:28.290> some<00:04:28.470> of<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.650> standard

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
than one amp or some of the standard

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.040 
than one amp or some of the standard
wall<00:04:29.160> wart<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.670> starts<00:04:30.180> recognizing<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.840> as<00:04:30.960> an

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
wall wart it starts recognizing it as an

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.870 
wall wart it starts recognizing it as an
AC<00:04:31.230> adapter<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:31.890> that's<00:04:32.340> mostly<00:04:32.580> because<00:04:32.670> of

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
AC adapter and that's mostly because of

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.100 
AC adapter and that's mostly because of
the<00:04:33.030> rate<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.360> current<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:33.900> actually

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
the rate of the current and it actually

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.290 
the rate of the current and it actually
has<00:04:34.350> a<00:04:34.380> measurement<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.100> kind<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.340> a<00:04:35.490> scale<00:04:36.090> of

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
has a measurement and kind of a scale of

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.490 
has a measurement and kind of a scale of
where<00:04:36.420> it<00:04:36.540> starts<00:04:36.810> measuring<00:04:37.020> itself

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
where it starts measuring itself

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.320 
where it starts measuring itself
wireless<00:04:38.340> charging<00:04:38.640> is<00:04:38.760> also<00:04:39.060> easily

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
wireless charging is also easily

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.880 
wireless charging is also easily
connected<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:39.930> also<00:04:40.080> shows<00:04:40.410> you<00:04:40.560> basically

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
connected and also shows you basically

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.980 
connected and also shows you basically
that<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:41.550> know<00:04:41.670> as<00:04:41.970> we<00:04:42.030> all<00:04:42.270> know<00:04:42.540> wireless

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
that you know as we all know wireless

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.450 
that you know as we all know wireless
charging<00:04:43.290> by<00:04:43.470> default<00:04:43.890> is<00:04:44.040> always<00:04:44.220> going<00:04:44.400> to

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
charging by default is always going to

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.830 
charging by default is always going to
be<00:04:44.520> slower<00:04:44.820> than<00:04:45.090> any<00:04:45.240> other<00:04:45.450> form<00:04:45.750> of

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
be slower than any other form of

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.780 
be slower than any other form of
charging<00:04:46.260> it's<00:04:46.650> convenient<00:04:47.280> but<00:04:47.430> always<00:04:47.580> be

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
charging it's convenient but always be

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.670 
charging it's convenient but always be
slower<00:04:48.210> but<00:04:48.570> anyways<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.080> don't<00:04:49.110> do<00:04:49.530> wireless

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
slower but anyways you don't do wireless

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.290 
slower but anyways you don't do wireless
charging<00:04:50.130> because<00:04:50.340> that's<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.940> best<00:04:51.120> way<00:04:51.270> to

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
charging because that's the best way to

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.600 
charging because that's the best way to
do<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.740> overall<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:52.830> think<00:04:52.980> it's<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:53.310> very<00:04:53.460> nice

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
do it overall I think it's a very nice

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.730 
do it overall I think it's a very nice
application<00:04:53.850> easy<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:55.110> only<00:04:55.320> limitation

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
application easy the only limitation

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.050 
application easy the only limitation
that<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:55.950> has<00:04:56.070> right<00:04:56.250> now<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.640> it<00:04:56.760> actually

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
that it has right now that it actually

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.910 
that it has right now that it actually
only<00:04:57.120> supports<00:04:57.570> lollipop<00:04:58.020> based<00:04:58.200> devices<00:04:58.500> so

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
only supports lollipop based devices so

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.460 
only supports lollipop based devices so
essentially<00:04:59.580> anything<00:04:59.790> prior<00:05:00.420> to<00:05:00.570> Android

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
essentially anything prior to Android

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.350 
essentially anything prior to Android
5.0<00:05:01.950> it's<00:05:02.400> not<00:05:02.640> going<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:02.880> work<00:05:03.000> unfortunately

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
5.0 it's not going to work unfortunately

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.760 
5.0 it's not going to work unfortunately
but<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.780> good<00:05:03.960> thing<00:05:04.140> is<00:05:04.290> a<00:05:04.320> lot<00:05:04.590> of<00:05:04.680> our

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.230 
let me know what you guys think have you
used<00:05:19.590> any<00:05:19.710> other<00:05:19.830> applications<00:05:20.610> in<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.210> past

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
used any other applications in the past

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.090 
used any other applications in the past
I've<00:05:21.630> used<00:05:21.660> battery<00:05:22.140> measuring<00:05:22.530> applications

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
I've used battery measuring applications

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.470 
I've used battery measuring applications
that<00:05:23.280> have<00:05:23.400> only<00:05:23.550> worked<00:05:23.760> on<00:05:23.970> specific

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
that have only worked on specific

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.900 
that have only worked on specific
devices<00:05:24.570> my<00:05:25.530> note<00:05:25.740> 3<00:05:26.010> I<00:05:26.040> have<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.280> battery<00:05:26.520> stat

devices my note 3 I have a battery stat
that<00:05:27.150> I'm<00:05:27.420> actually<00:05:27.600> pretty<00:05:28.350> comfortable

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
that I'm actually pretty comfortable

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.960 
that I'm actually pretty comfortable
with<00:05:28.950> and<00:05:29.130> I've<00:05:29.190> used<00:05:29.370> for<00:05:29.580> quite<00:05:29.760> some<00:05:29.940> time

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
with and I've used for quite some time

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.000 
with and I've used for quite some time
it's<00:05:30.690> a<00:05:30.810> good<00:05:30.930> application<00:05:31.110> but<00:05:31.710> it<00:05:31.890> only

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
it's a good application but it only

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.460 
it's a good application but it only
works<00:05:32.160> on<00:05:32.460> my<00:05:32.610> note<00:05:32.790> 3<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.120> as<00:05:33.480> time<00:05:34.140> goes<00:05:34.350> on

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
works on my note 3 and as time goes on

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.020 
works on my note 3 and as time goes on
and<00:05:34.650> you<00:05:34.770> move<00:05:34.950> on<00:05:35.100> with<00:05:35.160> new<00:05:35.460> devices<00:05:35.730> you're

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
and you move on with new devices you're

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.790 
and you move on with new devices you're
not<00:05:36.180> going<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.390> have<00:05:36.540> all<00:05:36.570> of<00:05:36.810> that<00:05:36.930> so<00:05:37.140> I<00:05:37.350> like
