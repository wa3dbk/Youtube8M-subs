00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.460 
only place that he's vulnerable and then
quickly<00:05:12.940> get<00:05:13.210> away<00:05:13.270> because<00:05:13.810> they<00:05:13.960> swing

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
quickly get away because they swing

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.350 
quickly get away because they swing
around<00:05:14.560> like<00:05:14.800> that<00:05:14.950> as<00:05:15.160> a<00:05:15.220> tail<00:05:15.639> hits<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:16.030> it

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
around like that as a tail hits you it

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.860 
around like that as a tail hits you it
hurts<00:05:16.780> a<00:05:16.900> lot<00:05:16.930> so<00:05:18.450> quickly<00:05:19.450> move<00:05:19.630> out<00:05:19.750> of<00:05:19.780> the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
hurts a lot so quickly move out of the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.839 
hurts a lot so quickly move out of the
way<00:05:19.900> or<00:05:20.680> easiest<00:05:21.010> just<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.340> see<00:05:21.460> target<00:05:21.760> I'm

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
way or easiest just to see target I'm

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.850 
way or easiest just to see target I'm
gonna<00:05:22.000> just<00:05:22.120> keep<00:05:22.330> going<00:05:22.690> back<00:05:22.780> and<00:05:22.840> forth<00:05:22.990> if

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
gonna just keep going back and forth if

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.800 
gonna just keep going back and forth if
you<00:05:23.979> can<00:05:24.160> do<00:05:24.310> jump<00:05:24.580> attack<00:05:24.789> which<00:05:25.000> does<00:05:25.240> twice

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
you can do jump attack which does twice

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.350 
you can do jump attack which does twice
as<00:05:25.930> much<00:05:26.050> damage<00:05:26.880> but<00:05:27.880> you'll<00:05:28.000> see<00:05:28.120> that<00:05:28.150> they

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
as much damage but you'll see that they

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.850 
as much damage but you'll see that they
blow<00:05:28.570> up<00:05:28.660> to<00:05:28.870> when<00:05:29.050> they're<00:05:29.200> killed<00:05:29.590> Lee<00:05:29.770> have

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
blow up to when they're killed Lee have

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.460 
blow up to when they're killed Lee have
a<00:05:29.919> nice<00:05:30.070> big<00:05:30.610> explosion<00:05:31.210> so<00:05:32.169> here's<00:05:32.380> another

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
a nice big explosion so here's another

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.150 
a nice big explosion so here's another
one<00:05:32.650> over<00:05:32.800> here

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
one over here

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.400 
one over here
just<00:05:33.400> MEK<00:05:33.580> it<00:05:33.789> mm-hmm<00:05:34.599> then<00:05:35.110> get<00:05:35.229> out<00:05:35.289> of<00:05:35.349> the

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
just MEK it mm-hmm then get out of the

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.560 
just MEK it mm-hmm then get out of the
way<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:36.130> other<00:05:36.310> way<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:36.580> hurt<00:05:36.910> them<00:05:37.090> is<00:05:37.300> to

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
way the other way to hurt them is to

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.850 
way the other way to hurt them is to
just<00:05:37.870> shoot<00:05:38.110> them<00:05:38.229> with<00:05:38.349> your<00:05:38.440> slingshot<00:05:38.650> you

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
just shoot them with your slingshot you

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.439 
just shoot them with your slingshot you
have<00:05:38.949> to<00:05:39.039> wait<00:05:39.220> until<00:05:39.430> like<00:05:39.880> she<00:05:40.030> watches<00:05:40.330> he

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
have to wait until like she watches he

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:41.310 
have to wait until like she watches he
Wiggles<00:05:40.690> back<00:05:40.720> and<00:05:40.840> forth

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
Wiggles back and forth

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.659 
Wiggles back and forth
that<00:05:41.440> means<00:05:41.590> if<00:05:41.710> he's<00:05:41.830> small<00:05:42.010> verbal<00:05:42.310> guns<00:05:42.460> so

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
that means if he's small verbal guns so

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.560 
that means if he's small verbal guns so
he<00:05:42.699> shoots<00:05:44.130> then<00:05:45.130> he<00:05:45.280> goes<00:05:45.820> down<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.419> he

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
he shoots then he goes down and he

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.390 
he shoots then he goes down and he
starts<00:05:46.750> wiggling<00:05:46.900> there<00:05:47.380> you<00:05:47.530> go<00:05:47.650> he's

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
starts wiggling there you go he's

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.969 
starts wiggling there you go he's
vulnerable<00:05:48.520> again<00:05:49.410> this<00:05:50.410> method<00:05:50.740> takes<00:05:50.889> a

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
vulnerable again this method takes a

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.469 
vulnerable again this method takes a
long<00:05:51.130> time<00:05:51.160> but<00:05:51.669> you<00:05:51.820> know<00:05:51.940> you<00:05:52.000> don't<00:05:52.210> get

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
long time but you know you don't get

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.870 
long time but you know you don't get
hurt<00:05:52.750> this<00:05:52.930> way<00:05:53.110> so<00:05:53.949> whatever<00:05:54.760> your

preference if you're you know not brave

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.939 
preference if you're you know not brave
enough<00:05:58.120> to<00:05:58.330> tackle<00:05:58.750> them<00:05:58.870> then<00:05:59.080> you<00:05:59.199> can<00:05:59.349> get

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
enough to tackle them then you can get

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.120 
enough to tackle them then you can get
them<00:06:00.039> far<00:06:00.160> away<00:06:00.250> if<00:06:00.430> you<00:06:00.520> really<00:06:00.669> want

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
them far away if you really want

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.410 
them far away if you really want
so<00:06:03.130> here<00:06:03.280> I'm<00:06:03.400> find<00:06:03.610> a<00:06:03.730> jump<00:06:04.000> attack<00:06:04.090> and<00:06:04.360> it

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
so here I'm find a jump attack and it

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.880 
so here I'm find a jump attack and it
just<00:06:04.570> keeps<00:06:04.750> not<00:06:04.960> working<00:06:05.320> so<00:06:05.500> fine<00:06:05.650> let<00:06:05.800> us

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
just keeps not working so fine let us

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:12.540 
just keeps not working so fine let us
give<00:06:06.100> up<00:06:06.250> and<00:06:06.490> attack<00:06:07.390> them<00:06:07.510> like<00:06:07.630> regular<00:06:11.550> got

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
give up and attack them like regular got

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.950 
give up and attack them like regular got
to<00:06:12.640> kind<00:06:12.790> of<00:06:12.850> get<00:06:13.060> pretty<00:06:13.270> far<00:06:13.450> back<00:06:13.660> so<00:06:13.720> you

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
to kind of get pretty far back so you

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.660 
to kind of get pretty far back so you
don't<00:06:13.990> excellently<00:06:14.530> hit<00:06:14.710> the<00:06:14.830> top<00:06:15.340> of<00:06:15.370> his

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
don't excellently hit the top of his

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:22.460 
don't excellently hit the top of his
armor<00:06:16.650> so<00:06:17.650> to<00:06:17.710> speak

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.050 

so<00:06:23.470> now<00:06:23.590> once<00:06:24.010> they're<00:06:24.130> all<00:06:24.280> dead<00:06:24.550> then<00:06:25.000> you

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
so now once they're all dead then you

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.280 
so now once they're all dead then you
want<00:06:25.210> to<00:06:25.270> head<00:06:25.360> back<00:06:25.390> towards<00:06:25.930> the<00:06:26.170> beginning

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
want to head back towards the beginning

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.660 
want to head back towards the beginning
of<00:06:26.560> this<00:06:26.710> area<00:06:26.950> and<00:06:27.040> you'll<00:06:27.130> see<00:06:27.220> there's<00:06:27.400> one

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
of this area and you'll see there's one

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.210 
of this area and you'll see there's one
lit<00:06:27.880> torch<00:06:28.180> so<00:06:28.990> go<00:06:29.200> light<00:06:29.380> a<00:06:29.410> Deku<00:06:29.680> stick<00:06:29.890> and

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
lit torch so go light a Deku stick and

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.240 
lit torch so go light a Deku stick and
then<00:06:31.320> go<00:06:32.320> light<00:06:32.500> all<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:32.740> three<00:06:32.980> torches

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
then go light all the three torches

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:40.670 
then go light all the three torches
there<00:06:33.730> just<00:06:33.940> straighten<00:06:34.390> a<00:06:34.420> line<00:06:34.570> right<00:06:34.750> here

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.990 

after<00:06:41.680> this<00:06:41.800> slash<00:06:42.070> your<00:06:42.250> sword<00:06:42.310> is<00:06:42.610> conserve

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
after this slash your sword is conserve

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.380 
after this slash your sword is conserve
the<00:06:43.150> Deku<00:06:43.300> stick<00:06:43.600> then<00:06:44.350> head<00:06:44.500> the<00:06:44.710> door<00:06:45.390> so

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.390 
the Deku stick then head the door so

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.580 
the Deku stick then head the door so
here<00:06:46.540> there's<00:06:46.720> a<00:06:46.810> switch<00:06:47.050> on<00:06:47.200> the<00:06:47.290> ground<00:06:47.470> you

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
here there's a switch on the ground you

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.410 
here there's a switch on the ground you
want<00:06:47.680> to<00:06:47.800> go<00:06:47.860> step<00:06:48.070> on<00:06:48.100> it<00:06:48.340> and<00:06:48.490> this<00:06:48.610> will<00:06:48.880> open

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
want to go step on it and this will open

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.950 
want to go step on it and this will open
a<00:06:49.750> door<00:06:49.960> across<00:06:50.080> the<00:06:50.470> way<00:06:51.390> and<00:06:52.390> so<00:06:52.630> now<00:06:52.870> we're

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
a door across the way and so now we're

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.610 
a door across the way and so now we're
going<00:06:53.050> to<00:06:53.110> head<00:06:53.260> over<00:06:53.410> there<00:06:55.140> so<00:06:56.140> just<00:06:56.410> ignore

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
going to head over there so just ignore

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.890 
going to head over there so just ignore

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:34.690 
is just full of new enemies this is an

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.060 
is just full of new enemies this is an
are<00:07:34.900> most<00:07:35.140> there's<00:07:35.380> two<00:07:35.500> ways<00:07:35.650> to<00:07:35.680> kill<00:07:35.920> them

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.070 
are most there's two ways to kill them

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.220 
are most there's two ways to kill them
they're<00:07:36.880> normally<00:07:37.300> not<00:07:37.510> vulnerable<00:07:37.780> to<00:07:38.050> your

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.230 
they're normally not vulnerable to your

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.170 
they're normally not vulnerable to your
sword<00:07:38.470> so<00:07:38.620> you<00:07:38.680> can<00:07:38.800> either<00:07:38.890> wake<00:07:39.700> them<00:07:39.820> up<00:07:39.880> you

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.180 
sword so you can either wake them up you

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.490 
sword so you can either wake them up you
can<00:07:40.300> either<00:07:40.420> throw<00:07:40.660> a<00:07:40.690> bomb<00:07:40.870> at<00:07:41.020> them<00:07:41.140> or<00:07:41.440> you

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:41.500 
can either throw a bomb at them or you

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.080 
can either throw a bomb at them or you
can<00:07:41.590> stun<00:07:41.890> them<00:07:42.040> with<00:07:42.070> a<00:07:42.190> Deku<00:07:42.340> stick<00:07:42.610> and<00:07:42.790> then

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.090 
can stun them with a Deku stick and then

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.310 
can stun them with a Deku stick and then
they're<00:07:43.270> vulnerable<00:07:43.690> to<00:07:43.780> your<00:07:43.840> swords<00:07:44.200> so

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:44.320 
they're vulnerable to your swords so

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.440 
they're vulnerable to your swords so
right<00:07:44.470> there<00:07:44.680> I<00:07:44.710> use<00:07:45.310> a<00:07:45.340> jump<00:07:45.520> attack<00:07:45.640> I<00:07:46.060> don't

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.450 
right there I use a jump attack I don't

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.450 
right there I use a jump attack I don't
think<00:07:46.690> it<00:07:46.750> really<00:07:46.870> matters<00:07:47.020> a<00:07:47.410> regular<00:07:47.710> just

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:48.460 
think it really matters a regular just

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.000 
think it really matters a regular just
regular<00:07:48.790> slash<00:07:49.030> will<00:07:49.390> do<00:07:49.570> the<00:07:49.660> same<00:07:49.810> thing<00:07:50.010> but

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.010 
regular slash will do the same thing but

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.250 
regular slash will do the same thing but
anyway<00:07:51.100> so<00:07:51.310> that's<00:07:51.520> how<00:07:51.580> you<00:07:51.640> kill<00:07:51.790> them<00:07:52.000> and

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:52.260 
anyway so that's how you kill them and

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.570 
anyway so that's how you kill them and
so<00:07:53.260> then<00:07:53.380> go<00:07:53.530> open<00:07:53.770> the<00:07:53.830> big<00:07:53.980> chest<00:07:54.220> and<00:07:54.490> you

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:54.580 
so then go open the big chest and you

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.340 
so then go open the big chest and you
will<00:07:54.700> get<00:07:54.790> the<00:07:54.970> compass<00:07:55.480> so<00:07:55.840> now<00:07:55.960> we<00:07:56.020> will<00:07:56.200> see

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:56.350 
will get the compass so now we will see

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.230 
will get the compass so now we will see
