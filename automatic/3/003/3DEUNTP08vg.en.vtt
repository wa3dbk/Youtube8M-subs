00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.470
 people my documents are three 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.690
 gigabyte may take a bit 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:04.140
 but i am definitely because 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.140
 get some fun and yes so 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.410
 if you do then has it somewhere in 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.780
 your download folder are 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:18.009

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.979
 winrar files 17 pieces the unpacked 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.210
 Here or I wanted 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.150
 habs now made in the folder since 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.720
 just have a quick extra there 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.909
 grabs you know what you want to do 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.180
 and yes then after that in this 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:38.380
 pakt healed three files once the 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.840
 two down here and this one 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.439
 application up there the call of duty world 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.890
 at war and this is important, the need to 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:51.189
 From here, the other 2000 do not care if 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.780
 that's the way it should have been 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.580
 it just does not seen where I yes 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.880
 In any case , you had to press 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.409
 accept this easily expandable 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.700
 I do not do it now I have that 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.700
 already and then you have that 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.880
 then you can do that directly 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:19.239
 use and that would be it oh well what 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.250
 besides, you have to have one 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.720
 so it has to be fresh 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.720
 be downloaded and then one 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.870
 week hold but it may not 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.750
 to be at a standstill and not a goal either 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.860
 to cash 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.610
 I would have decided that, I say 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.610
 until next time
