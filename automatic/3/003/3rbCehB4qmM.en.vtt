the real-deal guru Baby Whisperer comes
with<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:09.280> certificate<00:02:09.970> saying<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.140> is

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
with the certificate saying that it is

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.809

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.449 
so this is a nano titanium tie this is
one<00:02:16.330> reason<00:02:16.540> why<00:02:16.750> we're<00:02:17.410> not<00:02:17.590> using<00:02:17.920> every<00:02:18.340> day

one reason why we're not using every day

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.430 
one reason why we're not using every day
I<00:02:18.489> don't<00:02:18.819> use<00:02:18.940> every<00:02:19.180> day<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.660> mostly<00:02:20.200> use<00:02:20.410> it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
I don't use every day I mostly use it

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.140 
I don't use every day I mostly use it
the<00:02:20.860> first<00:02:21.160> two<00:02:21.340> days<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.730> when<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:21.910> do<00:02:22.000> a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
the first two days of when I do a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.729 
the first two days of when I do a
straight<00:02:22.569> so<00:02:22.900> in<00:02:23.110> or<00:02:23.260> something<00:02:23.590> like<00:02:23.680> that
