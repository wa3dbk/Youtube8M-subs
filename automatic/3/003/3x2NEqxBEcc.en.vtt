00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.100 
but what I'm trying to say guys with the
way<00:01:14.340> we've<00:01:14.520> designed<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.060> fluff<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.869> gives

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
way we've designed this fluff it gives

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.940 
way we've designed this fluff it gives
you<00:01:16.200> options

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
you options

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.070 
you options
okay<00:01:17.340> gives<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.729> options<00:01:18.119> yeah<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.960> the
