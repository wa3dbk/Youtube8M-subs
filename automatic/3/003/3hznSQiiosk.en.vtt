00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
this right here it releases their

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.310 
this right here it releases their
pressure<00:01:35.830> that's<00:01:36.070> in<00:01:36.250> between<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.320> fill

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
pressure that's in between the fill

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.810 
pressure that's in between the fill
station<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.130> tank<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:42.490> want<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.729> make

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
station and the tank so you want to make

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.210 
station and the tank so you want to make
sure<00:01:42.850> that's<00:01:43.090> tight<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.530> then<00:01:46.229> take<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.259> tight

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
sure that's tight and then take it tight

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.540 
sure that's tight and then take it tight
it<00:01:48.310> up<00:01:48.750> make<00:01:49.750> sure<00:01:49.869> it's<00:01:50.020> tight<00:01:50.170> turn<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:50.979> on<00:01:53.550> as

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
it up make sure it's tight turn it on as

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.540 
it up make sure it's tight turn it on as
you<00:01:54.789> can<00:01:54.940> probably<00:01:55.090> hear<00:01:55.330> my<00:01:55.570> tanks<00:01:56.550> gettin

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
you can probably hear my tanks gettin

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.680 
you can probably hear my tanks gettin
fill<00:01:58.920> these<00:01:59.920> tanks<00:02:00.160> only<00:02:00.640> go<00:02:00.759> up<00:02:00.789> to<00:02:00.880> 3,000<00:02:01.570> psi

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
fill these tanks only go up to 3,000 psi

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.029 
fill these tanks only go up to 3,000 psi
so<00:02:01.990> there's<00:02:02.259> no<00:02:02.979> need<00:02:03.160> to<00:02:03.220> fill<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.700> up<00:02:03.729> to

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
so there's no need to fill it up to

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:14.540 
so there's no need to fill it up to
4,500

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.690 

Oriol<00:02:15.480> seems<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:16.020> they<00:02:16.170> only<00:02:16.320> got<00:02:16.500> 2000<00:02:17.280> psi

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
Oriol seems like they only got 2000 psi

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.590 
Oriol seems like they only got 2000 psi
in<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.600> date<00:02:19.310> then<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.460> take<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.850> little

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
in this date then you take that little

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.330 
in this date then you take that little
mom<00:02:21.870> while<00:02:22.050> you're<00:02:22.200> talking<00:02:22.350> about<00:02:22.590> it

mom while you're talking about it

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.460 
mom while you're talking about it
releases<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.540> pressure<00:02:25.790> then<00:02:27.140> take<00:02:28.140> off<00:02:28.320> your

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
releases the pressure then take off your

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.610 
releases the pressure then take off your
tank<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.920> then<00:02:29.870> your<00:02:30.870> tank<00:02:31.080> should<00:02:31.260> be<00:02:31.320> set<00:02:31.590> to
