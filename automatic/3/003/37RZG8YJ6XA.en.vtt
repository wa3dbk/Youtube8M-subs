00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.170 
tada so this took eight hours to build
but<00:02:10.380> actually<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.860> wasn't<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.340> hard<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
but actually it wasn't that hard the

but actually it wasn't that hard the

and the ship's very cleverly designed I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.780

bound rather than spiral bound so it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.960

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.090 
rotor blades trans blue which is more
reminiscent<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.930> repulsor<00:04:47.500> jets<00:04:47.710> we<00:04:47.890> saw

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
reminiscent to the repulsor jets we saw

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.680 
reminiscent to the repulsor jets we saw
on<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.640> completely<00:04:49.000> different<00:04:49.420> model<00:04:49.540> of

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
on the completely different model of

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.770 
on the completely different model of
Helicarrier<00:04:50.260> in<00:04:50.590> Winter<00:04:50.830> Soldier<00:04:51.570> but<00:04:52.570> these

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
Helicarrier in Winter Soldier but these

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.420 
Helicarrier in Winter Soldier but these
differences<00:04:53.110> actually<00:04:53.470> make<00:04:53.740> perfect<00:04:54.220> sense

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
differences actually make perfect sense

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.430 
differences actually make perfect sense
to<00:04:54.550> me<00:04:54.640> some<00:04:55.480> of<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:55.600> UCS<00:04:55.930> sets<00:04:56.200> were

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
to me some of the UCS sets were

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.460 
to me some of the UCS sets were
criticized<00:04:57.010> for<00:04:57.340> being<00:04:57.490> dull<00:04:57.790> grey<00:04:58.180> slabs<00:04:58.720> and

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
criticized for being dull grey slabs and

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.720 
criticized for being dull grey slabs and
that's<00:04:59.620> because<00:04:59.800> Lego<00:05:00.010> is<00:05:00.190> trying<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.520> create

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
that's because Lego is trying to create

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.240 
that's because Lego is trying to create
movie<00:05:01.540> accurate<00:05:01.900> scale<00:05:02.110> models<00:05:02.530> but<00:05:03.070> with

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
movie accurate scale models but with

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.430 
movie accurate scale models but with
this<00:05:03.580> set<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.150> some<00:05:04.720> of<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.930> other<00:05:05.080> more

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
this set and some of the other more

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.680 
this set and some of the other more
recent<00:05:05.590> UCS<00:05:06.220> sets<00:05:06.520> they're<00:05:07.180> trying<00:05:07.450> to<00:05:07.510> make

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
recent UCS sets they're trying to make

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.790 
recent UCS sets they're trying to make
something<00:05:07.900> that's<00:05:08.110> more<00:05:08.320> visually<00:05:08.770> appealing

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
something that's more visually appealing

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.700 
something that's more visually appealing
and<00:05:09.310> interactive<00:05:10.120> with<00:05:10.840> accessories<00:05:11.440> and

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
and interactive with accessories and

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.680 
and interactive with accessories and
details<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.490> in<00:05:12.970> this<00:05:13.180> case<00:05:13.360> of<00:05:13.510> color

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
details and in this case of color

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.030 
details and in this case of color
palette<00:05:13.990> that<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.110> think<00:05:14.350> was<00:05:14.440> designed<00:05:14.830> to

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
palette that I think was designed to

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.040 
palette that I think was designed to
bring<00:05:15.520> out<00:05:15.669> from<00:05:15.940> Minds<00:05:16.180> of<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:16.480> ship<00:05:16.750> and

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
bring out from Minds of the ship and

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.120 
bring out from Minds of the ship and
that's<00:05:17.230> a<00:05:17.320> smart<00:05:17.590> move<00:05:18.390> except<00:05:19.390> for<00:05:20.080> the<00:05:20.500> studs

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
that's a smart move except for the studs

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.420 
that's a smart move except for the studs
now<00:05:21.910> we've<00:05:22.150> seen<00:05:22.390> some<00:05:22.450> study<00:05:23.080> UCS<00:05:23.710> models

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
now we've seen some study UCS models

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.880 
now we've seen some study UCS models
before<00:05:24.640> but<00:05:25.630> none<00:05:25.810> of<00:05:25.840> them<00:05:26.050> had<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.350> kind<00:05:26.830> of

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
before but none of them had the kind of

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.680 
before but none of them had the kind of
surface<00:05:27.340> detail<00:05:27.730> that<00:05:27.910> this<00:05:28.030> set<00:05:28.240> has<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:28.630> I

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
surface detail that this set has and I

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.810 
surface detail that this set has and I
think<00:05:28.990> this<00:05:29.110> does<00:05:29.350> just<00:05:29.380> make<00:05:30.310> it<00:05:30.460> look<00:05:30.580> a<00:05:30.669> bit

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
think this does just make it look a bit

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.110 
think this does just make it look a bit
noisy<00:05:31.060> up<00:05:31.510> close<00:05:32.340> overall<00:05:33.340> though<00:05:33.580> it's<00:05:33.850> a

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
noisy up close overall though it's a

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.790 
noisy up close overall though it's a
good<00:05:34.330> looking<00:05:34.660> ship<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.230> it's<00:05:35.410> going<00:05:35.530> to<00:05:35.590> make

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
good looking ship and it's going to make

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.540 
good looking ship and it's going to make
a<00:05:35.919> great<00:05:36.400> display<00:05:36.700> model

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.480 

that's<00:06:04.630> a<00:06:04.720> very<00:06:04.930> good<00:06:05.020> question<00:06:05.220> now<00:06:06.220> we<00:06:06.280> know

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
that's a very good question now we know

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.350 
that's a very good question now we know
it<00:06:06.580> has<00:06:07.350> forward<00:06:08.350> rotors<00:06:08.980> and<00:06:09.190> the<00:06:09.850> designers

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
it has forward rotors and the designers

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.030 
it has forward rotors and the designers
have<00:06:10.510> made<00:06:10.540> space<00:06:10.990> to<00:06:11.200> put<00:06:11.380> the<00:06:11.530> lego<00:06:11.680> power

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
have made space to put the lego power

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.980 
have made space to put the lego power
function<00:06:12.550> motor<00:06:12.730> and<00:06:12.910> aside<00:06:13.150> to<00:06:13.300> automate<00:06:13.780> it

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
function motor and aside to automate it

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.560 
function motor and aside to automate it
but<00:06:14.200> I've<00:06:14.920> seen<00:06:15.100> that<00:06:15.160> this<00:06:15.430> car<00:06:15.640> lane<00:06:15.880> I<00:06:16.180> think

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
but I've seen that this car lane I think

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.440 
but I've seen that this car lane I think
I<00:06:17.310> like<00:06:18.310> to<00:06:18.400> try<00:06:18.520> my<00:06:18.670> own<00:06:19.770> power<00:06:20.770> function

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
I like to try my own power function

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.960 
I like to try my own power function
let's<00:06:22.450> pop<00:06:22.690> off<00:06:22.810> the<00:06:23.710> crank<00:06:26.670> and<00:06:27.670> let's<00:06:27.850> see

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
let's pop off the crank and let's see

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:42.140 
let's pop off the crank and let's see
what<00:06:28.120> happens

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.450 

coming<00:06:42.900> in<00:06:42.990> part<00:06:43.199> two<00:06:43.379> of<00:06:43.409> this<00:06:43.560> review<00:06:44.009> we're
