bringing<00:03:52.300> kids<00:03:52.510> there<00:03:54.240> so<00:03:55.240> I<00:03:55.960> might<00:03:56.290> be

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
bringing kids there so I might be

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.680 
bringing kids there so I might be
putting<00:03:56.590> those<00:03:56.770> good<00:03:57.070> frames<00:03:57.400> in<00:03:57.670> there<00:03:57.880> so

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
putting those good frames in there so

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.510 
putting those good frames in there so
what'll<00:03:58.989> s<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.260> do<00:03:59.440> is<00:04:00.090> use<00:04:01.090> my<00:04:01.920> AFA<00:04:02.920> strategy

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
what'll s to do is use my AFA strategy

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.290 
what'll s to do is use my AFA strategy
on<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:03.850> one<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:06.220> just<00:04:06.520> got<00:04:06.670> a<00:04:06.700> bear<00:04:06.970> in<00:04:07.120> mind

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
on this one so just got a bear in mind

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.040 
on this one so just got a bear in mind
this<00:04:07.600> one<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:08.350> made

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.410 

use<00:04:13.770> these<00:04:14.130> frames<00:04:14.490> to<00:04:14.760> strengthen<00:04:15.150> up<00:04:15.240> that

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
use these frames to strengthen up that

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.630 
use these frames to strengthen up that
olive<00:04:15.660> harvest<00:04:16.080> when<00:04:16.230> is<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:19.190> know<00:04:20.190> it's<00:04:20.520> a

olive harvest when is the know it's a

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.320 
olive harvest when is the know it's a
bit<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.720> shame<00:04:24.920> there's<00:04:25.920> even<00:04:26.250> risky<00:04:26.640> using

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
bit of a shame there's even risky using

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.380 
bit of a shame there's even risky using

the same eyes too you should really

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.920 
the same eyes too you should really
watch<00:04:33.390> it

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
watch it

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.900 
watch it
trouble<00:04:34.200> is<00:04:34.290> you<00:04:34.470> don't<00:04:34.500> yeah<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.520> know<00:04:35.640> know

cross-contamination he was found to be

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.730 
cross-contamination he was found to be
bit<00:04:49.200> after<00:04:49.860> a<00:04:49.890> wet<00:04:50.870> cloudy<00:04:51.870> weather<00:04:52.170> with<00:04:52.470> hat

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
first time I've ever seen that happen so

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:20.040 
first time I've ever seen that happen so
it's<00:05:11.070> probably<00:05:11.310> going<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.610> resurface<00:05:12.000> again

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.920 

maybe<00:05:20.740> that<00:05:20.919> dreams<00:05:21.729> I<00:05:21.970> was<00:05:22.090> talking<00:05:22.389> about<00:05:22.449> I

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
maybe that dreams I was talking about I

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.650 
maybe that dreams I was talking about I
might<00:05:23.830> be<00:05:23.979> able<00:05:24.100> to<00:05:24.250> decide<00:05:24.610> I<00:05:25.949> think<00:05:27.660> yeah

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
might be able to decide I think yeah

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.939 
might be able to decide I think yeah
this<00:05:28.990> has<00:05:29.199> dreams

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
this has dreams

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.920 
this has dreams
these<00:05:30.580> are<00:05:30.759> frames<00:05:31.030> that<00:05:31.300> didn't<00:05:31.630> have<00:05:31.750> any

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
these are frames that didn't have any

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.210 
these are frames that didn't have any
foundation<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:33.300> you<00:05:34.300> can<00:05:34.479> see<00:05:34.919> this<00:05:35.919> section

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
foundation and you can see this section

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.659 
foundation and you can see this section
here<00:05:36.639> was<00:05:37.570> all<00:05:37.990> worker<00:05:38.470> and<00:05:38.860> there's<00:05:39.400> a<00:05:39.460> big

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
here was all worker and there's a big

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.570 
here was all worker and there's a big
section<00:05:39.940> there<00:05:40.270> of<00:05:40.389> drone<00:05:41.280> and<00:05:42.280> I<00:05:42.370> think

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
section there of drone and I think

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.670 
section there of drone and I think
there's<00:05:42.789> another<00:05:42.850> frame<00:05:43.389> in<00:05:44.169> the<00:05:44.440> same

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
there's another frame in the same

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:52.689 
there's another frame in the same
situation

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.469 

that<00:05:53.389> one's<00:05:53.569> fan<00:05:54.139> guys<00:05:54.409> you<00:05:54.560> missed<00:05:54.680> but<00:05:54.949> is

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
that one's fan guys you missed but is

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.800 
that one's fan guys you missed but is
practically<00:05:56.479> all<00:05:57.400> old<00:05:58.400> worker<00:05:58.939> or<00:05:59.360> worker

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
practically all old worker or worker

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:06.350 
practically all old worker or worker
that<00:05:59.900> one

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.200 

well<00:06:07.080> you<00:06:07.259> just<00:06:07.639> every<00:06:08.639> time<00:06:08.849> you<00:06:08.970> come<00:06:09.180> down

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
well you just every time you come down

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.700 
well you just every time you come down
to<00:06:09.479> the<00:06:09.569> bees<00:06:09.750> you<00:06:10.020> never<00:06:10.199> matter<00:06:10.439> what<00:06:10.590> you're

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
to the bees you never matter what you're

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.860 
to the bees you never matter what you're
gonna<00:06:10.830> encounter

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
gonna encounter

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.040 
gonna encounter
it's<00:06:12.870> just<00:06:13.110> little<00:06:13.379> traces<00:06:13.889> of<00:06:13.919> AFB

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
it's just little traces of AFB

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.420 
it's just little traces of AFB
just<00:06:16.050> on<00:06:16.259> that<00:06:16.409> one<00:06:16.590> frame<00:06:17.270> so<00:06:19.039> maybe<00:06:20.039> I<00:06:20.159> might

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
just on that one frame so maybe I might

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.309 
just on that one frame so maybe I might
just<00:06:20.699> remove<00:06:21.090> that<00:06:21.120> frame<00:06:21.659> and<00:06:21.689> put<00:06:22.139> it<00:06:22.199> on

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
just remove that frame and put it on

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.149 
just remove that frame and put it on
that<00:06:22.439> other<00:06:22.620> hive<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:24.740> sprinkle<00:06:25.740> up<00:06:25.919> with

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
that other hive and sprinkle up with

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:33.559 
that other hive and sprinkle up with
these<00:06:26.340> other<00:06:26.610> frames<00:06:31.969> there's<00:06:32.969> one<00:06:33.210> a<00:06:33.240> cooled

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
these other frames there's one a cooled
