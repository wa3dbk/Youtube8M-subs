that<00:03:19.200> rancher<00:03:19.860> by<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.519> big<00:03:20.879> shot<00:03:23.420> headlights

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
that rancher by a big shot headlights

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.110 
that rancher by a big shot headlights
are<00:03:24.599> very<00:03:24.810> bright<00:03:25.170> it's<00:03:25.769> got<00:03:25.920> tons<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.489> power<00:03:26.700> I

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
are very bright it's got tons of power I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.589 
are very bright it's got tons of power I
think<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.500> was<00:03:29.250> going<00:03:29.519> like<00:03:29.549> half<00:03:29.910> throttle<00:03:30.269> and

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
think I was going like half throttle and

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.520 
think I was going like half throttle and
probably<00:03:31.110> he<00:03:31.170> was<00:03:31.260> about<00:03:32.040> 35<00:03:32.670> miles<00:03:33.180> per<00:03:33.329> hour

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
probably he was about 35 miles per hour

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.789 
probably he was about 35 miles per hour
so<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.709> Sun<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.209> fast<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.659> that's<00:03:37.200> tons<00:03:37.650> of

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
so the Sun is fast and that's tons of

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.390 
so the Sun is fast and that's tons of
power<00:03:37.980> with<00:03:38.760> 46<00:03:39.450> horsepower<00:03:39.959> which<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.099> a<00:03:41.129> lot

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
power with 46 horsepower which is a lot

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.569 
power with 46 horsepower which is a lot
for<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.640> 500<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:43.760> loved<00:03:44.760> this<00:03:44.940> thing<00:03:45.109> and<00:03:46.459> get<00:03:47.459> you
