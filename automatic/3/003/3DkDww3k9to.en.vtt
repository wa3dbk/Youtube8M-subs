00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.570 

oh<00:02:22.660> that's<00:02:23.660> why<00:02:23.870> that's<00:02:24.080> harder<00:02:24.530> because<00:02:25.160> it's

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.640 

would<00:02:29.050> come<00:02:30.050> on<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:32.050> did<00:02:33.050> never<00:02:33.260> like<00:02:33.500> this

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
would come on I did never like this

mission<00:02:33.980> this<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.250> one<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.550> few<00:02:34.760> missions

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
mission this is one of the few missions

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.590 
mission this is one of the few missions
that<00:02:35.330> just<00:02:35.600> it's<00:02:35.870> pointless<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:38.090> just

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
that just it's pointless and it's just

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
that just it's pointless and it's just
boring<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:41.740> we're<00:02:42.740> winning<00:02:43.070> this<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.620> good

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
boring so we're winning this is a good

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.230 
boring so we're winning this is a good
start<00:02:45.800> way<00:02:46.070> we<00:02:46.250> need<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.460> get<00:02:46.610> up<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:46.970> higher

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
start way we need to get up to a higher

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.300 
start way we need to get up to a higher
level<00:02:47.270> now<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:47.870> think<00:02:49.330> how<00:02:50.330> do<00:02:50.390> we<00:02:50.540> get<00:02:50.660> up<00:02:51.040> aha<00:02:52.040> I

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
level now I think how do we get up aha I

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.800 
level now I think how do we get up aha I
will<00:02:55.310> use<00:02:55.490> that<00:02:55.520> ladder<00:02:55.910> but<00:02:56.240> there<00:02:56.630> might<00:02:56.780> be

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
will use that ladder but there might be

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.660 
will use that ladder but there might be
some<00:02:57.050> stuff<00:02:57.320> up<00:02:57.470> here<00:02:57.710> which<00:02:58.070> will<00:02:58.220> get<00:02:58.460> be

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
some stuff up here which will get be

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.050 
some stuff up here which will get be
easier<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.180> get<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.710> anyway<00:03:02.800> right<00:03:03.800> as<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.760> few

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
easier to get to anyway right as a few

at the end because that's gonna be worth

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:54.230 
at the end because that's gonna be worth
the<00:04:46.350> most<00:04:48.080> there<00:04:49.080> we<00:04:49.200> go<00:04:52.790> right<00:04:53.790> I<00:04:53.820> think<00:04:54.150> we're

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
the most there we go right I think we're

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.540 
the most there we go right I think we're
gonna<00:04:54.360> win<00:04:54.540> it<00:04:54.750> this<00:04:54.870> time<00:04:54.930> which<00:04:55.350> is<00:04:55.500> good<00:04:56.370> to

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
gonna win it this time which is good to

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:03.219 
gonna win it this time which is good to
know<00:04:58.430> because<00:04:59.430> we're<00:04:59.700> miles<00:04:59.970> ahead<00:05:01.130> come<00:05:02.130> on<00:05:02.310> I

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
know because we're miles ahead come on I

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.670 
know because we're miles ahead come on I
think<00:05:04.229> we<00:05:04.320> should<00:05:04.500> use<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.710> weapon<00:05:05.130> maybe<00:05:06.680> we'll

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
think we should use a weapon maybe we'll

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.330 
think we should use a weapon maybe we'll
just<00:05:07.800> use<00:05:07.950> that<00:05:09.740> get<00:05:10.740> that<00:05:10.950> because<00:05:11.190> that's

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
just use that get that because that's

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.260 
just use that get that because that's
the<00:05:11.520> expensive<00:05:11.850> one

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270

know how to have a good time Zoe it

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.270 
know how to have a good time Zoe it
appears<00:05:56.450> we<00:05:56.600> won<00:05:59.560> it<00:06:00.560> would<00:06:00.710> have<00:06:00.800> been<00:06:00.890> cool

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
appears we won it would have been cool

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.190 
appears we won it would have been cool
if<00:06:01.310> we<00:06:01.490> got<00:06:01.610> that<00:06:01.880> amount<00:06:02.150> of<00:06:02.210> money<00:06:02.270> but<00:06:02.750> then

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
if we got that amount of money but then

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.260 
if we got that amount of money but then
i<00:06:03.230> guess<00:06:03.590> that<00:06:04.160> take<00:06:04.460> away<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:04.820> point<00:06:05.060> of<00:06:05.150> all

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
i guess that take away the point of all

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.330 
i guess that take away the point of all
