00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.970
 so here's the video on the first 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.689
 part on verification issues 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.180
 inside the vehicle 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.710
 we will first attack the seers 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.650
 so first question that tells you 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.299
 the blue light the light of 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.120
 blue color indicates operation 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.680
 high beam that tells you a 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.720
 green light 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.580
 by seeing green color indicates the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.029
 operation of the position lights of 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.310
 crossing or fog before shown 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.420
 on the indicators dashboard 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.280
 to control the level of 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.660
 fuel then the indicator of the new 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.020
 fuel it's a dictator who's at 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.670
 right the meaning gauge that's here 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.980
 shown on the dashboard the light 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.930
 warning of minimum fuel level 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.579
 so there to show the seer he 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.670
 just put the ignition so 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.440
 simply turn the key one step 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.660
 in a way to him but all the lights 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.850
 you just turn the key up a notch 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.770
 simply all the lights come on 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.030
 and then if you had time to 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.039
 see you really a second time 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.700
 and you redo and it's the little bridge 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.799
 orange which is right here see do not hesitate 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.750
 not to join once and turned on again 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.140
 contact so as to remonstrate the light 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.960
 to the following questions inspector 1 that 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.900
 tells you to turn on a light 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.640
 red color when the vehicle is rolling 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.750
 a red light indicates a 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.060
 malfunction or danger 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.070
 of what color and the seer who 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.560
 indicates to the driver that the 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.450
 rear fog is on fire 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.100
 rear fog is color 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.439
 orange then we will light it for 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.330
 show so first we have to go through 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.670
 the ignition of the dipped beam 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.560
 position then crossover and then 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.909
 turn the ring upwards to 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.500
 turn on the rear fog lights 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.540
 down for expectations towards the 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.590
 up to light them up and see it from 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.049
 rear fog is the light 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.600
 orange that's here you'll just 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.840
 appoint him to the inspector turn you 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.240
 then down wages being 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.259
 then that tells you a light from 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.299
 Orange color 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.020
 an orange light indicates a 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.840
 important element but 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.459
 dangerous most serving as help 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.590
 memory shown on the dashboard the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.110
 warning light or the red zone of the 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.970
 temperature indicator signaling a 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.250
 high temperature of the liquid 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.060
 cooling then the temperature at 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.640
 coolant level 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.470
 this is the gauge that is left you 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.980
 can show either the red zone that 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.140
 is at the top 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.760
 be shown the red light then for 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.830
 show your red eyes you turn off the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.209
 contact and you put back the contact and 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.920
 you have the little red light that 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.120
 lights down 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.720
 do not hesitate to redo a second one 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.590
 times as needed the red light that is 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.390
 at the bottom shown on the dashboard the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.010
 warning light signaling a defect or 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.400
 a lack of charge of the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.769
 drums 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.790
 it is the seer with the plus and the minus 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.349
 seven seeing there to show 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.430
 inspectors if you do not have the 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.900
 time to see it or if you can not find 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.760
 not you turn off contact you 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.030
 put the contact back and you will go up 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.530
 more light and less battery 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.700
 shown on the dashboard the witness 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.950
 alert signaling a level 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.569
 insufficient brake fluid is the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.069
 witness breaks with the parentheses that 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.420
 just find right here it's this 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.400
 witness there which signals a level 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.930
 insufficient brake fluid 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.329
 it's also the same 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.290
 seeing who warns you to tell you 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.000
 that the handbrake is still 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.380
 switched on okay so seeing himself done 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.290
 both and the handbrake and liquid 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.730
 of brakes shown on the dashboard 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.530
 the warning light signaling a 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.049
 insufficient oil pressure in the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.760
 engine you turn off the contact you 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.440
 put the contact back and it's the seer 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.239
 with the little drop of oil the little 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.230
 reduced bubble that's right here 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.670
 again you reach the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.349
 contact you put the contact back and you 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.780
 go up the indicator the inspector with 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.760
 which drops of oil shown on the 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.440
 dashboard saw him signaling 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.790
 the bad in pack ur of a door 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.060
 so here to succeed that he'll have to 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.410
 start the engine 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.550
 then you open your door well 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.840
 obviously be careful what is 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.490
 people who are missing right now 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.120
 there so look well in your 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.400
 mirror 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.100
 you will have the door and you have the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.250

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.390
 informs you that the door is not properly closed 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.810
 you also have to know that at 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.510
 poorly closed door the ceiling light that 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.100
 stay on if your ceiling light 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.510
 stays on it's also a sign that the 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.510
 poorly closed door simply 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.620
 then a ticket on the dashboard 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.880
 saw him pointing out the absence of 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.930
 seatbelt buckling 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.460
 driver 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.460
 it is enough at that moment of you 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.080
 detach and show the seer who is 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.070

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.170
 inspectors and then you can you 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.060
 then reconnect lit fires 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.070
 crossover and show the seer who 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.360
 matches on the dashboard then 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.580
 I will wait for them to understand 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.170
 bus have been watching come order so 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.610
 anchoring it will be the position lights 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.960
 agree on good man's fires 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.520
 position and well show you the seer 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.840

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.090
 I ask you the low beam 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.890
 you turn a second time and you 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.760
 show the green light that is on the 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.760

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.789
 turn on the high beam and show the 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.439
 seeing that matches on array of 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.869
 board you must first turn on the lights 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:03.580
 crossing and then you pull the

 manage you for him but the fires of 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.919
 road and you take it again 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.020
 turn them off 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.429
 goodnight dash you see it's 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.289
 the blue seers who are just playing here 

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:13.869
 it is the indicator of high beams and 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.979
 made a light call the scheduled time 

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:16.809
 we call bright you will shoot 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.580
 many times the manager you from 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:21.729

 dashboard then you need everything 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.800
 first light the dipped beam 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:31.119
 first go through the fires of 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.349
 crossover and then you turn the ring 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:34.569
 how was explained earlier 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.219
 upward and appoint you the seer

 no celebrations on the front fog 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.639
 208 we did not activate the command 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.559
 the right turn signal and show the indicator 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.019
 corresponding on the dashboard 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:52.300
 briefcase up and designate you 

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:52.889
 the flashing light that is located 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.759
 right here 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.229

 dashboard the holidays features 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.300
 just below the shutters of

 then turn off the hazard lights 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:23.219
