people

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.210 
people
it's<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.819> Colorado<00:02:28.750> she<00:02:29.379> said<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.739> on<00:02:29.920> her

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
it's just Colorado she said it's on her

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.910 
it's just Colorado she said it's on her
mind<00:02:30.459> all<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:31.120> time<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:31.780> she<00:02:32.019> didn't<00:02:32.830> even

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
mind all the time but she didn't even

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.949 
mind all the time but she didn't even
say<00:02:33.340> anything<00:02:33.549> about<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.269> for<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.540> week<00:02:34.720> so<00:02:34.930> I

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
say anything about it for a week so I

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.390 
say anything about it for a week so I
guess<00:02:35.200> it's<00:02:35.410> really<00:02:35.560> not<00:02:35.830> on<00:02:36.010> her<00:02:36.129> mind<00:02:36.310> that

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
guess it's really not on her mind that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.860 
guess it's really not on her mind that
much<00:02:36.700> she<00:02:36.970> says<00:02:37.420> they're<00:02:37.599> taking

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
much she says they're taking

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.630 
much she says they're taking
responsibility<00:02:38.769> for<00:02:38.799> cleaning<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.340> up<00:02:39.459> but

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
responsibility for cleaning it up but

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.850 
responsibility for cleaning it up but
Colorado<00:02:40.180> authorities<00:02:41.049> say<00:02:41.200> that's<00:02:41.410> just<00:02:41.680> not
