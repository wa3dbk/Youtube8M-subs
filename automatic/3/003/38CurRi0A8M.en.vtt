the<00:00:38.320> 12th<00:00:38.589> fret

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.230 

and<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.310> the<00:00:44.430> 15th<00:00:45.000> fret<00:00:45.180> on

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
and here I'm going to the 15th fret on

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.770 
and here I'm going to the 15th fret on
the<00:00:45.360> B<00:00:45.450> string<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:47.270> then<00:00:48.270> down<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the B string and then down to the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.480 
the B string and then down to the

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:01.330 

so<00:00:54.490> the<00:00:54.640> first<00:00:54.850> part<00:00:55.000> is

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.430 

then<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.490> go<00:01:02.580> up<00:01:02.610> to<00:01:02.880> the<00:01:03.050> 14th<00:01:04.050> fret<00:01:04.230> on<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
then back to the south fret so it's like

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.969 
then back to the south fret so it's like
this

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.779

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.150 

then<00:01:49.780> we<00:01:49.930> have<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.260> 15th<00:01:50.680> fret<00:01:50.890> on<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.100> B

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
I'm doing a pre Bend I'm bending up half

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.609 
I'm doing a pre Bend I'm bending up half
a<00:02:03.550> step<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.860> that<00:02:06.510> letting<00:02:07.510> go<00:02:07.540> down<00:02:08.320> to<00:02:08.500> the

on<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.420> g<00:02:21.630> string<00:02:21.660> then<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.290> play<00:02:22.700> apply<00:02:23.700> if<00:02:23.760> I'm

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
on the g string then I play apply if I'm

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:36.410 
on the g string then I play apply if I'm
brought<00:02:24.120> here<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.750> we<00:02:27.870> have<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.260> first<00:02:28.380> part

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:47.190 

and<00:02:37.420> then<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.659> part<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.610> then<00:02:45.760> up<00:02:45.939> to<00:02:46.200> 15th

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
and then this part and then up to 15th

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.810 
and then this part and then up to 15th
fret<00:02:47.349> on<00:02:47.409> the<00:02:47.560> e-string

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:00.700 

and<00:02:53.360> here<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.110> prevail<00:02:56.140> let's<00:02:57.140> go<00:02:57.350> pull<00:02:58.100> off<00:02:59.710> D

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
and here the prevail let's go pull off D

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:34.090 
and here the prevail let's go pull off D
string<00:03:05.710> so<00:03:06.710> let's<00:03:07.190> try<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:07.460> the<00:03:07.550> slow<00:03:07.700> tempo

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.220 

and<00:03:35.100> then<00:03:35.640> you've<00:03:35.820> work<00:03:36.060> up<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.540> speed<00:03:36.900> a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
and then you've work up the speed a
