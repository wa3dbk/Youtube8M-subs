 brush dunk gelatin and apply on 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.960
 this skin area 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.320
 thick layer to better stick our 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.320
 sea 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.520
 We put a lightning and wait for now 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.730
 at the reception I have stuck with me for 5 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.730
 minutes 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.130
 we start to apply gelatin others 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.130
 skin patches 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.700
 and also they stick 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:50.270
 and keeps until freezing can surplus 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.650
 You can take a towel further or 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.610
 we coat our pike 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.610
 our gelatin cheek and attach to it 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.610
 napkin 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.100
 also cause you live 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.450
 and in the same way we repeat with all these 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.450
 in chunks 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.450
 napkins 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.870
 also the more napkins you stick 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.870
 so your skin will look 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.870
 more natural 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.430
 after you have done all 2 cheeks and 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.680
 they are frozen on the bed smile 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.670
 pull the cheeks so that we have a little bit 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.650
 skin has worn off and wrinkles have formed but 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.960
 there is a problem that our real skin 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.850
 different from not real therefore we take 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.850
 tonal framework and smeared all over 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.900
 I smooth everything completely 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.900
 dry out 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.590
 we take powder 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.770
 and the wand start turning it into 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:34.290
 powder take a brush and using 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.860
 brushes we put it all in the same way 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.860
 thick layer 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.060

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.580

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.990

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.090

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.200

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.480
 sprinkled with water or alcohol start 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.710
 slowly peel off our skin not 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.610

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.200
 facial expression and and red cheeks of what 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.200

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.590
 i try to keep my breath on 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.590

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.940
