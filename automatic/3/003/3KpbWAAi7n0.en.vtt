00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.910
 this is the story of a world 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.110
 obsessed with material goods and the 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.119
 history of a system in crisis 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.099
 we're destroying the planet we're in 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.240
 destroying each other and we are not 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.650
 not even having fun the positive thing is 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.420
 that when we begin to understand the system 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.430
 we begin to see so many points on which 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.160
 intervene to transform these 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.820
 problems in solutions history 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.820
 bottled water 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.449
 the difficulty in trying to use less 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.460
 things that sometimes we seem to have 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.960
 really need that you would do if you dress 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.280
 for example in cleveland and wanted a 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.320
 glass of water 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.390
 you would risk taking it from 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.440
 tap or you would look for a bottle 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.589
 of water that comes from the forests 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.820
 downpipes of the fiji the water mark 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.500
 end he thought that the answer to 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.030
 this question was obvious so they have 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.769
 made an entire advertising campaign 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.210
 on this it was one of the most moves 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.489
 stupid in the history of advertising 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.930
 the city of cleveland did not like it 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.000
 be the object of ridicule of the physis 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.680
 so they did tests and guess what 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.910
 these tests showed that a 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.899
 fiji quality water glass 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.789
 lower 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.200
 loses taste test against water 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.340
 of the cleveland faucet and coast 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.109
 thousands of times so much 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.399
 this story is typical of when it is done 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.500
 the comparison between bottled water and 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.600
 tap is cleaner 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.799
 sometimes yes sometimes not in many ways 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.020
 bottled water and less 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.329
 regulated tap water is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.560
 taste issue in the taste test in 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.119
 the whole nation people prefer 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.409
 always tap water 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.789
 in the bottle 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.959
 bottling companies say about 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.579
 to fulfill are the demands of 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.619
 consumers but that would require a 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.810
 less sustainable and less tasty product e 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.069
 far more expensive especially 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.500
 when you can have it practically 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.329
 free bottled water in the kitchen 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.929
 costs 2,000 times that of the 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.909
 tap 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.470
 imagine paying 2 thousand times as much for 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.569
 everything else 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.399
 how about a 10 thousand euro sandwich 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.899
 yet people in the united states 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.030
 they buy more than half a billion 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.799
 water bottles every week are 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.879
 enough to surround the world beyond 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.090
 five times 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:07.709
 how it came to this well all 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.479
 serious how our economy works 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.180
 of materials is one of its factors 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.220
 key known as built demand 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.750
 if companies want to continue 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.099
 grow must continue to sell 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.049
 more and more material goods 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.670
 in the 70s the big producers of 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.170
 soft drinks bothered not to see 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.739
 stabilize their prospects of 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.780
 growth 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.769
 there is a limit to the amount of soda that 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.810
 a person can drink 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.269
 moreover, after a while people would 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.389
 understood that it is not so healthy and it would be 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.130
 back to drinking tap water 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.660
 so the companies found another 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.760
 great idea in a design product 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.250
 fool the most derided as a fad 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.319
 of passage the water is free 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.959
 people answered what else they want 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.609
 sell us the air then how to succeed in 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.880
 sell this niche product 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.989
 simple we build the question like 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.310
 you do 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.260
 imagine you are in charge of 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.549
 bottled water company as 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.019
 people do not queue for 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.150
 exchange their money hard 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.950
 earned with useless products you make me 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.049
 feel afraid of being unsure if 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.549
 they didn't have it and that's exactly it 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.060
 which made the water industry into 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.799
 bottle 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.540
 one of their first tactics of 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.130
 marketing has been scaring people a 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.959
 consume tap water with 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.849
 announcements such as those of the physical campaign 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.959
 when we're done, an executive says 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.819
 bottled water 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.370
 tap water will be relegated to 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.780
 showers to wash dishes then 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.180
 hides the reality of your product 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.890
 behind images of pure fantasy 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.750
 have you ever noticed how the water in 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.280
 bottle tries to seduce us with images 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.090
 of mountain rivulets and nature 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.700
 uncontaminated 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.260
 but guess where a third party comes from 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.560
 of all the water bottles of the USA 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.480
 from the tap the water up to della pepsi 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.330
 and the da coca cola for example 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.410
 it's just filtered tap water 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.989
 but the lie of uncontaminated nature 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.420
 goes much further in a recent announcement a 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.950
 whole page the nestle said the water 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.319
 bottled the consumer product more 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.450
 environmentally friendly to the world that 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.940
 what are they destroying the environment for 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.420
 the entire product life cycle of 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.950
 precise and environmentally friendly 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.110
 the problem starts here with the extraction 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.090
 production where oil is used 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.799
 to make plastic bottles every 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.329
 year to make the bottles used by 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.130
 usa consumes oil and energy 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.349
 enough to fill up a 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.470
 million cars all that energy 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.150
 shopping for making bottles yet 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.729
 more to transport them around the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.280
 world and then we find about two 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.290
 minutes 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.300
 which leads to the big problem 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.370
 the other end of the life cycle 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.420
 waste disposal where they end up 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.490
 all these bottles 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.320
 eighty percent goes to the landfill where 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.090
 they will remain for hundreds of years 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.550
 or in incinerators that burn them 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.370
 releasing toxic substances the rest is 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.620
 collected for recycling 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.760
 I was curious to know where the ends end 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.660
 bottles that I put in the collection 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.490
 differentiated 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.260
 I discovered that naval cargoes were 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.419
 lead to india 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.460
 then I went there I will not forget 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.990
 never when driving to madras I am 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.910
 came face to face with one 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.800
 mountain of plastic bottles from 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.540
 california real recycling 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.550
 would transform these bottles into others 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.229
 bottles but this is not what it was 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.090
 coming here instead of these bottles 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.070
 they were destined to be worse than cycling 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.199
 that is transformed into products of minor 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.240
 qualities destined to become waste in 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.919
 followed the parts that cannot be 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.840
 worse cycled and thrown here 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.520
 transported to India only for 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.940
 be discharged in someone's garden 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.169
 other 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.120
 if bottled water companies 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.919
 they want to use the mountains in theirs 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.090
 labels would be more appropriate to 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.090
 show these mountains 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.110
 to frighten us and induce us into error 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.680
 these strategies are all key parts 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.389
 to build demand 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.300
 once they built it all 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.199
 this demand creating a new market 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.630
 multi-billionaire defend him 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.220
 massacring the competition but in this 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.650
 competition case our right 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.729
 basic human drink clean water e 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.960
 safety 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.180
 Pepsi's deputy said publicly 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.190
 the greatest enemy the water of the 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.900
 tap they want us to think that 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.639
 dirty and that in the bottle is the 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.410
 best alternative in many places 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.820
 public polluted water thanks to 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.100
 polluting companies such as industry 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.630
 of plastic bottles and these 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.250
 there are a lot of bottled water guys 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.320
 happy to offer their expensive ones 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.599
 solutions that keep us slaves of 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.340
 their products 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.530
 and time to go back to tap 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.289
 let's start with the personal commitment of 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.789
 don't buy or drink bottled water 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.919
 unless the water in your community 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.479
 it is not really unhealthy yes it takes a 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.250
 bit of organization to take one 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.200
 disabled bottle leaving home but 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.120
 we can do it 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.950
 so let's go to the next meal 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.750
 let's take part in a campaign that works 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.010
 for real solutions like requesting 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.080
 investments in tap water 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.400
 clean for everyone 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.320
 in uses tap water in 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.940
 debt of 24 billion dollars in 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.680
 part because people think that water 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.020
 to drink comes only from a bottle 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.640
 all over the world right now a 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.300
 billion people do not have access to 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.610
 clean water 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.230
 yet wherever the cities are spending 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.580
 millions of dollars to manage the 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.680
 plastic of the bottles we throw away 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.390
 what it would be like if this money were 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.920
 spent to improve our systems
