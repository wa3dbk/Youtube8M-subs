00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.009
 strange of the hungry number and let's start with 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.689
 the first lepetit chef restaurant 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.609
 famous that has practically the tables 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.039
 fully mapped and all 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.080
 customers who come for lunch or 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.880
 dining cannot attend this 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.160
 beautiful cartoon live on its own 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.599
 on the table and waiting for it to arrive but 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.599

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:53.290

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:56.380
 this cook linguini linguiti raga 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.570
 the animation is beautiful the cost of 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.550
 I do not tell you about dinner or lunch 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.089
 because it is around 2000 dollars 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.180
 something of this yes only from the 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.020

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.760
 so fun things happen from 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.760
 it's really very very nice 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.079
 and every one of every customer has on his 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.600
 head a projector a videoprojector 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.450
 therefore it can assist independently 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.119
 to this to the adventures of this cook 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.890
 bungling adventure and very nice 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.149
 then when it's time to come in with 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.069
 the real courses 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.530
 the nice surprise is that the 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.569
 all similar to that of the cartoon is of the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.090
 everything similar to this monkey is not you 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:47.060
 already the second restaurant there is a game 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.310
 in the restaurant where one of the waiters e 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.030
 I can't do this nice little monkey 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.570
 that fleas like we do every tree 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.330
 oh God it doesn't happen like you do with the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.659
 nice funny whim is not that l 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.580
 fun and so many professions choice 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.070
 he wears this from the mask from 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.649
 young lady in deafness and there 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.230
 are in Japan but in short, yes 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.050
 wanders in the disguised room 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.110
 disguised like this and entertain the customers 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.910
 I mean, I don't know, it's a lot 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.130
 questionable in my opinion though maybe in 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.410
 Japan amuses 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.420
 maybe yes yes it does entertain in a manner 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.100
 nice in japan i wouldn't be able to 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.380
 sleep at night especially to watch 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.220
 this mask but go to this 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.980
 I do not like the exploitation of the sea 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.540
 I don't like it I don't like it enough 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.310
 oh well then it will mean that there is not 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.019
 we would never go to this place here 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.640
 scimmietta will not be happy with 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.500
 wear this mask these fools 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.819
 clothes to make these happy in 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.760
 I guess not 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.959
 I guess he will say but we are moving to gold 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.750
 amsterdam but it's a very colorful place 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.440
 what is this splendid restaurant is made of 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.829
 appropriately for children or just to measure 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.780
 child is beautiful there is the menu for 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.120
 children with all the dishes for 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.920
 rape children someone wait for the light 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.810
 someone comes to light this yes 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.910
 it's a new trend that is 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:19.070
 catching on around the world ie 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.660
 the restaurants totally then this 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.730
 definitely the idea of ​​some 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.060
 restaurateur who has to recycle some 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.709
 leftovers and therefore makes customers eat at 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.519
 dark so they do not notice what 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.980
 is living 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.319
 they lacked cheese skins are eaten 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.870
 the fingers eat 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.480
 but then in my opinion this is really 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.359
 a defeat for the human race that if 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.849
 there are people who are able to pay for 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.889
 go eat at a restaurant in al 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.349
 complete darkness as can be the 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.629
 hands with pieces of tablecloth a thing e 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.969
 we don't deserve to stay on this 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.099
 planet earth i'm sorry guys this 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:56.769
 it is cosmic pessimism I must say that to me 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.209
 He would n't like it though 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.010
 taking hold of a brand new one 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.310
 trend that is said a little throughout the 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.400
 world as there is this in the whole world 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.879
 this brand new fashion you don't 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.000
 let's say 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:13.540
 guess who doesn't dominate that 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.359
 I mean oh well tell her this 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:21.609
 not to wear or lunch in the sky 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.910
 a previous crazy idea takes it 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.450
 to rent this incredible crane 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.950
 very high with 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.230
 a table and chairs special apples exact 6 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.020
 special chairs where you can 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.260
 choose to dine not only in the air 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.020
 open but very at a loss but really in 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.360
 air the very open air here it is then 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.060
 practically one sits down quit 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.980
 belts takes the table to the table 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.700
 it is set ready and then all 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.080
 and go up a lot of meters from the 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.840
 surface of the earth 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.820
 I don't know darling I go for a moment 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.530
 bathroom 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.720
 she got a little hard going to the bathroom 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.030
 more, however, the owners of 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.400
 this crane and you can have lunch in the area but 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.740
 from many parts of the world and from Europe 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.470

 you eat in the most absolute south 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:38.690

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.430
