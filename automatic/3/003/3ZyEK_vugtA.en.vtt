00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.530 
for evolving units you get you know you
can<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.100> these<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.399> time<00:01:44.579> each<00:01:44.610> three<00:01:45.329> metal

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
can get these one time each three metal

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.219 
can get these one time each three metal
gods<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.140> metal<00:01:46.409> gods<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.979> two<00:01:47.729> metal<00:01:47.970> kings

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
gods to metal gods and two metal kings

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
gods to metal gods and two metal kings
unfortunately<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> did<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> bunch<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.210> upgrading

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
unfortunately I did a bunch of upgrading

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.710 
unfortunately I did a bunch of upgrading
before<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.159> um<00:01:53.159> kind<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.149> missed<00:01:54.329> out<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
before and um kind of missed out on the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.389 
before and um kind of missed out on the
bulk<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:56.310> happens<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.020> yeah<00:01:59.009> that

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
bulk of this but it happens so yeah that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.639 
bulk of this but it happens so yeah that
does<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.390> also<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.170> saw<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.560> they

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
does that and then also I saw that they

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.920 
does that and then also I saw that they
were<00:02:01.740> doing<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.159> 500<00:02:02.850> honor<00:02:03.060> points<00:02:03.450> per<00:02:03.689> day

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
were doing the 500 honor points per day

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.499 
were doing the 500 honor points per day
and<00:02:04.229> I'm<00:02:05.070> thinking<00:02:05.310> okay<00:02:05.670> well<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.149> six<00:02:06.329> star

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
and I'm thinking okay well the six star

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.540 
and I'm thinking okay well the six star
star<00:02:07.020> starters<00:02:07.829> are<00:02:07.950> coming<00:02:08.190> out<00:02:08.310> soon<00:02:08.489> so

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
star starters are coming out soon so

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.820 
star starters are coming out soon so
they're<00:02:08.879> probably<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.750> up<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.619> rates

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
they're probably going to up the rates

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.470 
they're probably going to up the rates
for<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.220> starters<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.910> honor<00:02:12.060> gate

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
for the starters in the honor gate

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.809 
for the starters in the honor gate
so<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> probably<00:02:13.620> should<00:02:14.040> start<00:02:14.280> stowing<00:02:14.700> away

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
so I probably should start stowing away

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.059 
so I probably should start stowing away
my<00:02:15.150> honor<00:02:15.450> points<00:02:15.870> well<00:02:16.230> now<00:02:16.680> they're<00:02:16.860> running

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
my honor points well now they're running

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.740 
my honor points well now they're running
that<00:02:17.190> event<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.030> guess<00:02:18.360> they're<00:02:18.540> not<00:02:18.659> going

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
that event so I guess they're not going

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.600 
that event so I guess they're not going
to<00:02:18.810> do<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.409> now<00:02:20.190> I'm<00:02:20.280> not<00:02:20.400> really<00:02:20.519> sure

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
to do that so now I'm not really sure

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.890 
to do that so now I'm not really sure
what<00:02:20.879> I<00:02:20.909> want<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.209> with<00:02:21.299> my<00:02:21.420> honor<00:02:21.569> points

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
what I want to do with my honor points

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.869 
what I want to do with my honor points
but<00:02:22.019> i<00:02:22.049> do<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.409> 12<00:02:23.129> someone's<00:02:23.459> waiting<00:02:23.640> for

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
but i do have 12 someone's waiting for

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.220 
but i do have 12 someone's waiting for
me<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.269> i<00:02:24.299> guess<00:02:24.659> i'll<00:02:24.780> wait<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.959> little<00:02:25.140> longer

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
me so i guess i'll wait a little longer

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780 
me so i guess i'll wait a little longer
just<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.709> case<00:02:25.890> there<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.099> any<00:02:26.370> other<00:02:26.580> word

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
just in case there is any other word

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.640 
just in case there is any other word
with<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.120> when<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.750> gets<00:02:28.200> closer<00:02:28.409> to<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
with that when the gets closer to the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.100 
with that when the gets closer to the
six<00:02:28.860> stars<00:02:29.010> coming<00:02:29.220> out<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.580> major<00:02:29.730> update
