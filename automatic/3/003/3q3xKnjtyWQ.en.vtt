 service you were from Rome or surroundings of 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.390
 could serve for me is just one thing 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.909
 very strange to talk about me and in 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.759
 an interview because obviously 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.259
 interview that the veliterne 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.799
 republic but you have understood what 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.979
 I mean 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.570
 and very high I very difficult metra 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.780
 I stand in front of the camera and say hello 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.670
 my name is giulia i do this i do 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.050
 fatigue and even with the people I love 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.540
 and that I attend to speak 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.840
 there are things about me that even the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.670
 people I love deeply don't know 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.120
 because I don't make them much trouble from 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.160
 I press much better to talk about 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.930
 julian make up artist not from giulia 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:26.640
 woman person daughter mother wife almost 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.650
 desire and indeed I want to strive to 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.530
 give you over time some small piece of 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.380
 me also on my channel because i want to 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.630
 that you do not love just Giulia the artist 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.980
 I want to enjoy a person too but 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.840
 you can't do it unless I give you 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.600
 the opportunity to meet me and this is 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.760
 a limit of mine I have to work on 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.440
 made a video a few months ago on mine 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.180
 problem in the relationship with food and so on 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.770
 and that is a small part of the match e 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.360
 much else 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.190
 I had thought of cardiff having the maybe a 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.640
 video where these ask me some questions 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.910
 and maybe not as they run on youtube a 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.530
 video questions fun but that really 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.150
 some questions concerning who I am and 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.330
 what do I do what you want to know 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.070
 of me is that I'm afraid maybe not 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.950
 I could answer I don't know is a 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.900
 my limit because in life I suffered 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.610
 and I believe that every time you give a 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.260
 piece of you to someone that someone if 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.970
 it is as if it were taken away that 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.730
 piece of you let me explain I don't know if anyway 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.370
 apart from that the note is fantastic st 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.100
 kind available left me full 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.140
 freedom to answer questions and have it 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.030
 published in its entirety as well as 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.010
 I said he didn't cut pieces he didn't 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.390
 modified to make her more pussy more 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.020
 readable and this was the work state 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.570
 lot 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.000
 having said that obviously I leave you all 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.350
 the references in the info bot are made 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.010
 nice to read the interview is from 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.870

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.870
