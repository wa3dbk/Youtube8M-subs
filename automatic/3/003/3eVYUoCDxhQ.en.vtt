tab<00:02:54.380> horizontally<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.620> don't<00:02:55.709> really<00:02:55.920> like

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
tab horizontally and I don't really like

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.770

that<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.370> wish<00:02:56.670> they<00:02:56.790> made<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:56.970> flat<00:02:57.239> back<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.690> it

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
that I wish they made a flat back so it

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.660 
that I wish they made a flat back so it
gives<00:02:57.989> us<00:02:58.050> more<00:02:58.170> options<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:59.250> even<00:02:59.459> in<00:02:59.550> this

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
gives us more options but even in this

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.190 
gives us more options but even in this
mode<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.060> gives<00:03:00.300> us<00:03:00.390> about<00:03:00.600> an<00:03:00.690> inch<00:03:00.840> clearance

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
mode it gives us about an inch clearance

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.570 
mode it gives us about an inch clearance
it's<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.769> little<00:03:01.950> bit<00:03:02.040> too<00:03:02.190> tight<00:03:02.370> for

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
it's a little bit too tight for

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.520 
it's a little bit too tight for
something<00:03:02.790> sick<00:03:02.970> like<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.239> Harley<00:03:03.540> velcro

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.440 
thankfully the magmod which is my
favorite<00:03:10.230> modifier<00:03:10.590> right<00:03:10.769> now<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.760> silicon

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
favorite modifier right now is silicon

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.210 
favorite modifier right now is silicon
and<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.810> stretches<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:13.860> take<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.040> look

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
and it stretches and if you take a look

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.130 
and it stretches and if you take a look
at<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.730> actually<00:03:14.880> thins<00:03:15.269> out<00:03:15.480> because<00:03:15.870> it

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
at that it actually thins out because it

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.350 
at that it actually thins out because it
stretches<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:17.370> perfect<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.209> it

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
stretches and so it's perfect and it

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.440 
stretches and so it's perfect and it
goes<00:03:18.510> right<00:03:18.780> around<00:03:18.959> our<00:03:19.880> little<00:03:20.880> tab<00:03:21.420> there

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
goes right around our little tab there

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.080 
goes right around our little tab there
and<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.530> fits<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.670> gives<00:03:23.880> enough

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
and so it fits and it gives enough

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.539 
and so it fits and it gives enough
clearance<00:03:24.450> for<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.989> for<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.350> actual<00:03:25.560> tab<00:03:25.920> so

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
clearance for the for the actual tab so

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.830 
clearance for the for the actual tab so
that<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.880> go<00:03:26.970> right<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.390> your<00:03:27.540> belt

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
that it can go right on your belt

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.500 
that it can go right on your belt
without<00:03:28.440> interfering<00:03:29.310> or<00:03:29.459> scratching<00:03:30.239> or

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
without interfering or scratching or

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.680 
without interfering or scratching or
breaking<00:03:31.110> any<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:33.150> silicon<00:03:33.510> there

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
breaking any of the the silicon there

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.600 
breaking any of the the silicon there
too<00:03:34.340> um<00:03:35.340> now<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:37.350> actual<00:03:37.799> label<00:03:38.070> they<00:03:38.430> come

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
too um now on the actual label they come

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.810 
too um now on the actual label they come
with<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.239> set<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.540> two<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.410> Y<00:03:40.890> set<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> two<00:03:41.519> and

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
with to a set of two and Y set a two and

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.630 
with to a set of two and Y set a two and
if<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.150> don't<00:03:42.299> have<00:03:42.420> two<00:03:42.510> flashes<00:03:42.959> we<00:03:43.799> put<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
if you don't have two flashes we put the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.660 
if you don't have two flashes we put the
same<00:03:44.790> tab<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:45.930> our<00:03:46.230> radios<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:47.160> we<00:03:47.579> have

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
same tab on our radios and so we have

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.940 
same tab on our radios and so we have
two<00:03:47.850> clips<00:03:48.060> on<00:03:48.180> our<00:03:48.299> belts<00:03:48.570> one<00:03:49.470> for<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.680> Radio

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
two clips on our belts one for a Radio

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.319 
two clips on our belts one for a Radio
one<00:03:50.220> for<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.430> flash<00:03:50.640> we're<00:03:50.910> set<00:03:51.060> for<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.239> whole

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
one for a flash we're set for the whole

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.259 
one for a flash we're set for the whole
day<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:52.410> also<00:03:52.829> on<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.519> actual<00:03:53.850> label<00:03:54.030> you'll

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
day and also on the actual label you'll

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.300 
day and also on the actual label you'll
see<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.810> recommends<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.920> put<00:03:56.190> it

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
see that it recommends that you put it

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.560 
see that it recommends that you put it
about<00:03:57.000> 1<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.480> 7/8<00:03:58.170> inch<00:03:58.680> away<00:03:59.010> from<00:03:59.340> the<00:04:00.120> front

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
about 1 and 7/8 inch away from the front

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.509 
about 1 and 7/8 inch away from the front
of<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.110> flash<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.769> that's<00:04:02.310> just<00:04:02.459> a

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
of the flash and that's just a

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.130 
of the flash and that's just a
recommended<00:04:02.970> setting<00:04:03.239> obviously<00:04:03.989> we're<00:04:04.110> a

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
recommended setting obviously we're a

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.420 
recommended setting obviously we're a
little<00:04:04.200> bit<00:04:04.380> closer<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.890> mutual<00:04:05.100> clasp

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
little bit closer on a mutual clasp

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.910 
little bit closer on a mutual clasp
because<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.910> way<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.180> head<00:04:06.420> works<00:04:06.890> but<00:04:07.890> to

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
because the way the head works but to

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.620 
because the way the head works but to
each<00:04:08.190> their<00:04:08.220> own<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.730> hope<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.150> enjoyed<00:04:09.420> and
