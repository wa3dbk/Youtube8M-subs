down into the base because the bristles
can<00:02:13.100> come<00:02:13.370> loose

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
can come loose

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.390 
can come loose
if<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.870> water<00:02:15.110> kind<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.560> loosens<00:02:15.860> up<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.190> glue

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
if the water kind of loosens up the glue

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.520 
if the water kind of loosens up the glue
but<00:02:16.610> these<00:02:16.850> are<00:02:17.000> all<00:02:17.120> synthetic<00:02:17.750> brushes<00:02:18.080> so

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
but these are all synthetic brushes so

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.780 
but these are all synthetic brushes so
you<00:02:18.590> don't<00:02:18.830> have<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.040> be<00:02:19.130> too<00:02:19.310> careful<00:02:19.730> about

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
you don't have to be too careful about

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
you don't have to be too careful about
that<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.260> just<00:02:21.680> usually<00:02:22.100> rinse<00:02:22.310> these<00:02:22.550> off

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:40.850 

and<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:32.409> course<00:02:32.739> I'm<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.310> great<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:33.940> there<00:02:38.970> and

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
and of course I'm so great on there and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:50.660 
and of course I'm so great on there and
work<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.099> in

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.369 

so<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:52.030> stiff<00:02:52.330> brushes<00:02:52.720> like<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:52.930> if

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
so for stiff brushes like this if

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.960 
so for stiff brushes like this if
they're<00:02:53.590> really<00:02:53.739> dirty<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.280> can<00:02:54.519> use<00:02:54.700> like<00:02:54.940> a

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
they're really dirty you can use like a

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.180 
they're really dirty you can use like a
rubber<00:02:55.239> curry<00:02:55.629> comb<00:02:55.959> or<00:02:56.319> something<00:02:56.829> like<00:02:56.980> that

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
rubber curry comb or something like that

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.920 
rubber curry comb or something like that
and<00:02:57.430> kind<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.760> rub<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.090> against<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.629> kind<00:02:58.840> of

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
and kind of rub it against to kind of

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.490 
and kind of rub it against to kind of
help<00:02:59.110> you<00:02:59.290> move<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.220> bristles<00:03:00.610> around<00:03:01.500> but

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
help you move the bristles around but

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.210 
help you move the bristles around but
this<00:03:02.620> one's<00:03:02.829> not<00:03:02.980> too<00:03:03.040> bad

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
this one's not too bad

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.920 
this one's not too bad
so<00:03:06.220> I'll<00:03:06.370> just<00:03:06.549> rinse<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.209> do<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.690> same

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
so I'll just rinse it and do the same

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:27.830 
so I'll just rinse it and do the same
thing<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.410> did<00:03:08.560> with<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.859> other<00:03:09.040> brush

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.240 

so<00:03:28.840> this<00:03:28.989> one<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.319> would<00:03:29.440> just<00:03:29.620> wash<00:03:29.890> similar

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
so this one you would just wash similar

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.100 
so this one you would just wash similar
to<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:30.610> currycomb<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.330> started<00:03:31.720> with<00:03:31.930> just

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
to that currycomb I started with just

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.670 
to that currycomb I started with just
rinse<00:03:32.379> it<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.799> then<00:03:33.090> apply<00:03:34.090> so<00:03:34.840> if<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:35.470> have

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
rinse it and then apply so if you have

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.610 
rinse it and then apply so if you have
lots<00:03:35.860> of<00:03:36.040> hair<00:03:36.220> stuck<00:03:36.580> in<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:37.260> brush<00:03:38.260> like<00:03:38.440> this

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
lots of hair stuck in a brush like this

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.380 
lots of hair stuck in a brush like this
you<00:03:38.769> can<00:03:38.950> use<00:03:39.069> the<00:03:39.280> comb<00:03:39.519> as<00:03:39.730> well<00:03:39.940> as<00:03:40.090> we<00:03:40.209> kind

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
you can use the comb as well as we kind

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.850 
you can use the comb as well as we kind
of<00:03:40.540> pulled<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:41.069> hairs<00:03:42.069> out<00:03:43.349> but<00:03:44.349> these<00:03:44.620> brushes

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
of pulled it hairs out but these brushes

00:03:44.860 --> 00:04:13.160 
of pulled it hairs out but these brushes
don't<00:03:45.220> get<00:03:45.430> too<00:03:46.769> dirty<00:03:47.769> really

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.559 

so<00:04:14.130> when<00:04:14.460> you're<00:04:14.580> cleaning<00:04:14.790> hoof<00:04:15.090> picks<00:04:15.390> I

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
so when you're cleaning hoof picks I

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.539 
so when you're cleaning hoof picks I
usually<00:04:15.930> just<00:04:16.109> like<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.470> find<00:04:16.709> an<00:04:16.920> old<00:04:17.100> sponge

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
usually just like to find an old sponge

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.819 
usually just like to find an old sponge
and<00:04:18.030> then<00:04:18.209> just<00:04:18.600> apply<00:04:18.780> some<00:04:19.200> dish<00:04:19.410> soap<00:04:19.680> and

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
and then just apply some dish soap and

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.340 
and then just apply some dish soap and
kind<00:04:20.070> of<00:04:20.190> scrub<00:04:20.459> all<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.609> dirt<00:04:20.940> off<00:04:21.350> these

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
kind of scrub all the dirt off these

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.650 
kind of scrub all the dirt off these
stiff<00:04:22.710> brushes<00:04:23.550> are<00:04:23.700> pretty<00:04:23.940> hard<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.300> clean

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
stiff brushes are pretty hard to clean

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.950 
stiff brushes are pretty hard to clean
but<00:04:24.900> if<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.110> can<00:04:25.290> just<00:04:25.500> run<00:04:26.480> water<00:04:27.480> through<00:04:27.870> it

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
but if you can just run water through it

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.420 
but if you can just run water through it
and<00:04:28.110> try<00:04:28.230> to<00:04:28.290> get<00:04:28.620> some<00:04:28.860> soap<00:04:29.130> into<00:04:29.340> the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
and try to get some soap into the

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:49.170 
and try to get some soap into the
bristles<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.090> seems<00:04:30.390> to<00:04:30.600> work<00:04:30.630> pretty<00:04:31.020> good

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.370 

so<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.270> don't<00:04:50.510> want<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:50.690> forget<00:04:50.870> to<00:04:51.020> clean<00:04:51.200> out

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380

of<00:05:18.860> brushes<00:05:19.310> are<00:05:19.490> faced<00:05:20.000> down<00:05:20.210> like<00:05:20.510> this<00:05:20.780> so

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
of brushes are faced down like this so

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.960 
of brushes are faced down like this so
all<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.290> water<00:05:21.470> runs<00:05:21.770> out<00:05:22.040> of<00:05:22.100> the<00:05:22.370> handle<00:05:22.730> and

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.750 
all the water runs out of the handle and
doesn't<00:05:23.780> stay<00:05:23.990> in<00:05:24.020> there<00:05:24.290> and<00:05:24.410> get<00:05:25.220> moldy<00:05:25.670> and

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
doesn't stay in there and get moldy and

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.600 
doesn't stay in there and get moldy and
stuff<00:05:26.180> and<00:05:26.600> if<00:05:27.500> it's<00:05:27.680> sunny<00:05:27.890> outside<00:05:28.100> it's

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
stuff and if it's sunny outside it's

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.250 
stuff and if it's sunny outside it's
probably<00:05:28.940> better<00:05:29.030> to<00:05:29.330> leave<00:05:29.690> them<00:05:29.870> outside<00:05:29.990> to

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
probably better to leave them outside to

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.940 
probably better to leave them outside to
dry<00:05:30.590> just<00:05:30.890> so<00:05:31.010> they<00:05:31.130> dry<00:05:31.400> faster<00:05:32.500> so<00:05:33.500> this<00:05:33.800> is

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
dry just so they dry faster so this is

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.560 
dry just so they dry faster so this is
what<00:05:34.070> it<00:05:34.190> looks<00:05:34.370> like<00:05:34.490> when<00:05:34.820> everything<00:05:35.360> is
