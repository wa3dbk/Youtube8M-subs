00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.620
 every year in spring world a 58 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.630
 Head of the expert jury, the kfw here 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.420
 this year has become the peugeot 308 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.609
 against about 30 competitors 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.109
 enforced and I would say visually 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.560
 he is definitely one 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.560
 winner type 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 everything has changed except the name 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.450
 the new peugeot 308 is over 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.940
 Spiked design with risi in the cooler 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.469
 Mouth and chunky look of the grille 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.239
 shrinks the model change the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.280
 Headlights are getting smaller and for that 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.350
 Concise it is a pleasant 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.000
 factuality fed by the franzose 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.660
 with a lot of modesty in the design 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.660
 combines 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.830
 sent the body body club 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.820
 set fold the necessary tension and 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.740
 provide accents 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.220
 the new looks elegant and dynamic 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.500
 peugeot 308 with implied 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.479
 Underride protection, the tail works so well 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.310
 not boring 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.930
 so now I want to know if the time 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.930
 rest gets what the design promises 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.860
 that's great now I have one here 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.260
 great screen with me everything 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.250
 taxes including heating and 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.140
 air conditioner 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.820
 only when the sun is from behind 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.500
 on it seems he knows unfortunately 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.410
 nothing at all stupid then 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.280
 I already have the rollo of 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.230
 optional glass roof but then 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.130
 of course I will lose that again 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.130
 nice room feeling 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.479
 who wants to work around the problem can also 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.430
 on the basis 308 with conventional 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.430
 resort to radio and air conditioning 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.040
 I like the small steering wheel 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.020
 basically very good because there is one more 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.060
 a bit sporty all the way 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.010
 Character gives the circuit paths are 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.020
 but for a bit too long 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.580
 that could be a bit shorter 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.520
 circuit could be a little more precise 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.750
 then it would be even sportier the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.240
 new is compared to his 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.070
 predecessor 140 kilograms lighter as well 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.260
 shorter and lower and with four meters 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.360
 25 length it is exactly at golf level 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.270
 What I did not like so much that 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.130
 the steering wheel must be extremely low down 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.680
 so I even tacho and 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.790
 If you do not see the tachometer 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.990
 biggest is and the steering wheel a bit too high 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.820
 has set then the top hangs 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.590
 part in front of it and the view on the 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.690
 instruments is not better than 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.880
 in a conventional arrangement where you 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.090
 through the steering wheel looks around the speedometer and 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.160
 Tachometer to see the peugeot 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.170
 uses the same platform as the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.890
 citroÃ«n c4 picasso that saves 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.890
 production costs 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.439
 again here on the display 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.810
 to come back with that one really 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:25.849
 everything except the volume of the radio 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.920
 controls everything , so to speak, of course 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.409
 neat because one less switch 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.819
 and buttons in the car but has just the 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.489
 Heating I do not have here 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.719
 Control what is via the touchscreen 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.159
 because if that breaks it can 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.730
 I do not even feel warm or cold anymore 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:43.370
 the french make offer for the 308 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.099
 5 engines three petrol and two diesel 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.049
 the 85 degrees tested by us in this 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.389
 Motor is standard with stop start 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.760
 automatic equipped he consumes 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.810
 according to the manufacturer's 3.8 liters 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.879
 at 100 kilometers 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.560
 the price for the frugal frenchman 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:03.310
 is around 24 1600 euro in germany 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.440
 such a distance control is yes 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.810
 nice and good but if you are behind one 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.870
 car drove off what then suddenly slows down 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.819
 then he always has problems after that 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.590
 then regulate goes into pause mode 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.489
 and tell me i should control 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.260
 take over again 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.970
 I do not need a distance rule for that 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:27.070
 tempomat or the conclusion to the fresh 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.070
 Chosen came of the year 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.930
 the peugeot 308 is indeed a good car 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.270
 however, he does have it here and there 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.610
 still a lot of room for improvement 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.120
 that's why I would not have him to the car of 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.120
 the year chosen
