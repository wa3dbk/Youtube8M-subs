00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
a team here at the theme for watch so my

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.840 
a team here at the theme for watch so my
prediction<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.560> team<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.130> Chelsea

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
prediction would be my team that Chelsea

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.620 
prediction would be my team that Chelsea
Nash's<00:01:33.180> fighting<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> break

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630

strongest<00:01:36.630> out<00:01:37.050> there<00:01:37.230> that<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.470> predict<00:01:37.980> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
strongest out there that I predict to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.550

actually<00:01:38.580> win<00:01:38.760> that<00:01:38.910> event<00:01:39.210> female<00:01:40.170> fighting

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
actually win that event female fighting

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.770 
actually win that event female fighting
game<00:01:41.550> Chelsea's<00:01:41.910> brother<00:01:42.150> won<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.480> strongest

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780

female<00:01:42.960> fighters<00:01:43.410> out<00:01:43.530> there<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.550> i<00:01:44.580> would

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
female fighters out there so i would

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.100 
female fighters out there so i would
