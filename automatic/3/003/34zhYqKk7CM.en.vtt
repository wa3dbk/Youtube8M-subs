00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.980
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.800
 my youtube channel to another 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.449
 film about the ottifants 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.429
 quadrocopter yes as you may know 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.099
 I fly with the 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.050
 robbe futaba t 8 y and i am also very 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.300
 satisfied with this remote control 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.949
 but there are certainly still people who 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.259
 want to do a little more 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.890
 for example, they need more channels around 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.350
 about a retractable landing frame 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.470
 and to drive out or to the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.200
 example by telemetry here the 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.550
 data of the buyer to the remote control 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.950
 has it sent back 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.200
 and I would like to show you how 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.770
 you could do that for me 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.230
 here 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.829
 this remote control is the robbe 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.570
 Futaba T14 SG this is a 14 channel 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.510
 remote control with telemetry 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.980
 support and i want you in the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.350
 Show up like you guys next week 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.299
 which connects with the phantom like you 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.119
 telemetry data down spark 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.399
 could start and so on and today 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.049
 Let's go here with a short one 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.350
 unboxing video I want to show you 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.100
 what is included in the scope of supply of t 14 sg 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.100
 is included 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.380
 So then we take the life out of it 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.520
 always on the side 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.900
 First of all we have one here 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.210
 instruction manual in german language 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:43.780
 as you can see from robbe and a cd 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.740
 instruction manual for windows yes me 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.230
 think there will be another one 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.090
 be in pdf format on it and 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.800
 maybe drivers or something 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.590
 to carry out firmware update 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.790
 then we have a red one here 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.000
 note still with a few 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.920
 additional information here then a band 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.840
 has lenny art with which you look at the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:13.000
 remote control then hang around your neck 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:15.430
 Here is the battery 1 2800 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.510
 milliHp battery for the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:25.960
 remote control then we have the here 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:30.970
 remote control itself looks so composed as 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.830
 a bit yes how the fota but stop 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.680
 Remote controls look very much 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.680
 3 channel switch three-stage switch 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:48.820
 123456 this is a two-step and here 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:52.739
 such a toggle switch two rotary control here 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.300
 on the side still slider yes too 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.440
 We put a lot of each amount 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.570
 on the side suitable for remote control 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:07.300
 Of course there is still a receiver 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:11.170
 this is the 7800 sb that is too 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.260
 already with the scope of delivery then 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.370
 there is a charger of course you have to 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.770
 the battery also somehow again 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.300
 charge 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.790
 then we have such a gentleman here 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.630
 is that it is a two-sided 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.430
 duct tape 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.760
 I think maybe for that 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.060
 akkufach so that the battery sits firmly 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:37.360
 then we have cable with one here 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:41.069
 on off switch and here so a little 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.400
 tool that a small screwdriver 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:48.120
 and last but not least, here then yes 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.790
 a small bag in there 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.030
 two things a white plastic part and 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.640
 a silver metal part but what the 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.519
 I do not know why you have to go in 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.010
 look up the instructions 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:06.670
 so that was the scope of the robbe 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.109
 futaba t14 sg I'll show you this one 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.980

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.319
 close up 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.909
