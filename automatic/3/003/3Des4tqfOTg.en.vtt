you must have had to learn about the
physics<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.530> chemistry<00:02:46.620> about<00:02:47.340> Connor

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
physics and the chemistry about Connor

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.090 
physics and the chemistry about Connor
it<00:02:48.120> was<00:02:48.360> me<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.570> took<00:02:48.840> me<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.050> long<00:02:49.290> time<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.830> do

DC yeah so the whole idea about my kind
of<00:03:16.769> cooking<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.370> not<00:03:18.060> using<00:03:18.540> any<00:03:18.690> artificial

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
of cooking is not using any artificial

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.000 
of cooking is not using any artificial
stuff<00:03:19.680> all<00:03:20.480> using<00:03:21.480> pure<00:03:21.780> ingredients<00:03:22.049> so<00:03:22.950> if

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
stuff all using pure ingredients so if

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.789 
stuff all using pure ingredients so if
we<00:03:23.070> even<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:23.610> pure<00:03:23.970> like<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.570> have<00:03:24.840> home<00:03:25.440> cow's

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
we even have pure like I have home cow's

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.729 
we even have pure like I have home cow's
milk<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.820> paneer<00:03:27.150> everything<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.080> all<00:03:28.350> home

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
milk the paneer everything is all home

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.640 
milk the paneer everything is all home
that<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.130> different<00:03:29.489> i<00:03:29.940> use<00:03:30.390> only<00:03:30.720> double

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
that is different i use only double

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.880 
that is different i use only double
cream<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.400> use<00:03:32.790> homie<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:33.870> no<00:03:34.049> we<00:03:34.350> won't<00:03:34.650> get

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
cream I use homie but no we won't get

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.729 
cream I use homie but no we won't get
free<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.459> haha<00:03:35.970> now<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.690> but<00:03:37.110> I<00:03:37.140> use<00:03:37.470> very

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
free and haha now so but I use very

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.129 
free and haha now so but I use very
little<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.310> double<00:03:38.700> cream<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.269> very

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
little of the double cream and very

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.590 
little of the double cream and very
little<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.680> homemade<00:03:41.190> butter<00:03:41.400> also<00:03:41.700> but

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
little of the homemade butter also but

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.380 
little of the homemade butter also but
it<00:03:42.750> adds<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.380> full<00:03:43.950> flavor<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.670> think<00:03:44.910> fat

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
it adds that full flavor and I think fat

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.240 
it adds that full flavor and I think fat
in<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:46.110> right<00:03:46.230> amounts<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.069> right

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
in the right amounts and the right

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.809 
in the right amounts and the right
quantities<00:03:47.819> is<00:03:48.410> very<00:03:49.410> good<00:03:49.620> for<00:03:49.770> you<00:03:49.860> so<00:03:50.190> seema

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
quantities is very good for you so seema

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.440 
quantities is very good for you so seema
you<00:03:51.000> know<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.150> take<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.660> dash<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.290> butter<00:03:53.120> in<00:03:54.120> a

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
you know I take a dash of butter in a

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.660 
you know I take a dash of butter in a
non-stick<00:03:54.870> pan<00:03:55.200> that's<00:03:55.590> negligible<00:03:56.310> it's

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
non-stick pan that's negligible it's

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.820 
non-stick pan that's negligible it's
totally<00:03:57.240> negligible<00:03:57.810> but<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.410> flavor<00:03:58.650> it

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
totally negligible but the flavor it

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.010 
totally negligible but the flavor it
gives<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.280> brilliant<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.450> know<00:04:00.569> so<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.780> need

that and I then add the orange juice to
it<00:04:07.100> so<00:04:08.100> my<00:04:08.190> pan<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.640> nice<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.060> hot<00:04:09.240> and<00:04:10.520> then<00:04:11.520> I

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
it so my pan is nice and hot and then I

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.790 
it so my pan is nice and hot and then I
like<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.270> put<00:04:12.480> these<00:04:12.690> whole<00:04:13.110> pieces<00:04:13.470> of

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.140 
important to enjoy when you're cooking
yeah<00:06:22.560> now<00:06:22.800> what<00:06:23.040> we're<00:06:23.190> going<00:06:23.310> to<00:06:23.400> do<00:06:23.520> is<00:06:23.790> we

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
yeah now what we're going to do is we

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.850 
yeah now what we're going to do is we
are<00:06:24.180> going<00:06:24.270> to<00:06:24.510> turn<00:06:24.780> this<00:06:25.050> whole<00:06:25.320> thing<00:06:25.350> into

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
are going to turn this whole thing into

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:37.270 
are going to turn this whole thing into
this<00:06:26.610> pan<00:06:27.419> that<00:06:27.960> I'm<00:06:28.110> going<00:06:28.290> to<00:06:28.350> bake<00:06:28.530> in

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.840 

and<00:06:38.150> now<00:06:39.020> the<00:06:39.980> trick<00:06:40.280> is<00:06:40.310> to<00:06:40.820> turn<00:06:41.570> this<00:06:41.800> Sunday

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
and now the trick is to turn this Sunday

and now the trick is to turn this Sunday
hmm<00:06:43.850> I'm<00:06:44.210> onto<00:06:44.500> this<00:06:45.500> stance<00:06:46.070> so<00:06:46.370> all<00:06:46.610> I'm

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
hmm I'm onto this stance so all I'm

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.420 
hmm I'm onto this stance so all I'm
going<00:06:46.790> to<00:06:46.940> do<00:06:47.120> flip<00:06:47.900> it<00:06:47.930> is<00:06:48.139> that<00:06:48.410> and<00:06:48.770> flip<00:06:49.340> it

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
going to do flip it is that and flip it

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:55.180 
going to do flip it is that and flip it
over<00:06:50.200> whoops<00:06:51.200> there<00:06:51.740> it<00:06:52.010> goes<00:06:52.270> and<00:06:53.650> then<00:06:54.650> I'm

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 
over whoops there it goes and then I'm

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.990 
over whoops there it goes and then I'm
going<00:06:55.730> to<00:06:55.820> top<00:06:56.000> it<00:06:56.180> up<00:06:56.360> with<00:06:56.389> some<00:06:57.020> slivers<00:06:57.470> of

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
going to top it up with some slivers of

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.620 
going to top it up with some slivers of
almonds<00:06:59.000> as<00:07:00.430> the<00:07:01.430> strawberries<00:07:01.940> descend<00:07:02.389> I

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
almonds as the strawberries descend I

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.159 
almonds as the strawberries descend I
see<00:07:03.290> how<00:07:03.530> texture<00:07:04.190> and<00:07:04.639> color<00:07:05.000> can<00:07:05.630> be<00:07:05.660> crucial
