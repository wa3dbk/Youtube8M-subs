 inside cooked himself outside 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.489
 and then I thought what was needed from the inside 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.620
 prettier also turns out on three 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:28.200

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.760
 4 when it was full everything can be cut 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.739
 calmly fear nothing will be gone 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.070

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.310
 mayor troika 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:01.459
 how to burn metal does not burn 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.720

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:10.910

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:40.650
 for the doors we take the hang and four pieces 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:46.220
 so this is also a cocoon of metal rolled 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:50.070
 I took with these fila wreaths 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:54.060
 I cut in half and I get 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:57.510
 Now here is such a thing to 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:05.130

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.510
 lest there be gorges 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.490
 Now the smoke goes through the gap 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.430
 From here because it is a little overlapped 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:39.360
 pipe temperature drop that's all 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.530
