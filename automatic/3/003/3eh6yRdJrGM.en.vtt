00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.480
 welcome to Honduras to the first chapter 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.459
 of the Hebrew course they saw reims 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.919
 in this first chapter we are going to see how we can install the application 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.400
 robien king 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.509
 in the windows operating system 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.509
 the first step that we are going to make 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.409
 directing to the next web page 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.890
 anyone can see 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.220
 they chose to take away the address 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.590
 in this link 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.890
 what we are going to find is 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.620
 a link 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.370
 where we can download a file 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.660
 and this is the culprit will not leave anything all that is necessary to 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 so we can run are not machines November 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.269
 installing this 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.839
 this this file that do not have any difficulty we just have to go 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.000
 giving you following next following 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.950
 so that we can banish everything 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.210
 we will leave 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.990
 right after you step on it 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.090
 a one console 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.020
 where we have to enter two commands for what are those two 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.980
 commands 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.040
 it was simply to update to the latest version of the reverse 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.740
 and the system 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.740
 that we would have to introduce we accept it 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.509
 there is here it will be better 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.509
 we equip 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.130
 exists 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.130
 and here with this we update the system 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.890
 in olé said but this is not a normal windows console this is a 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.610
 console that equips you bring the file burned 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.620
 we want and Saturday before 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.770
 if not us 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.770
 he can only find it 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.470
 start all programs 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.980
 reims 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.360
 and here we have the ruby ​​on rails console 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.740
 I say it because we tried to compose these commands what position 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.760
 the post 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.760
 he will not recognize them 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:24.809
 marquez as the first command believes that we are going to introduce this this what is going to 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:30.489
 to do is to introduce new ones on the system operate update the system 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.229
 and the second command once 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:38.899
 the rebels and that does not shepherd the the last version of the king 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.889
 after this this command then approximately in total about 6 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.049
 minutes and takes takes from Neapolitan system 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.719
 we have to recharge because our our ideal of salty one very popular 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.779
 we do not have here 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.110
 we're just going to go back 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.110
 and we can leave it to that free procedure 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.869
 and we find it on this web page 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:15.929
 we download it and other 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.359
 it can not happen 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.779
 that once downloaded 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.859
 I could have gone from here 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.260
 when creating a new project we have the problem that does not recognize ruby 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.349
 in this part so we would not have the rudi folder to select our 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.369
 draft 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.529
 we just have to go to ramiro these 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.539
 accessories 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:42.599
 a new window will open 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.599
 this is going to take a point 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:49.259
 we tell 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.279
 inc club available 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:53.400
 and in the search field we oppose 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.029
 rudi 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:59.029
 and already with this we have had seems 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.689
 terrorist 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:22.270
 here you have to appear the option of ruby ​​on rails simply what 

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:25.269
 notes instyle once to the icsa labs button 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:29.469
 It's going to take very little and you already have it Saturday the complement 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.389
 once she has installed 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.870
 the reiss package that is not going to install everything necessary that we have our 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.580
 ideal for those to write about it in terms of rubin programming 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.700
 and in movistar arena updated 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.999
 updated our rail system 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.090
 we have to check if 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.039
 everything works correctly 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.990
 the first thing we're going to see 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.800
 to see if everything works correctly is 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.159
 create our first project we will not do it from our idea 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.159
 we're going to do it from the console 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.719
 and that we will have to put in rent or a 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.819
 binner 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.949
 draft 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.499
 this will create us a series of directory 2 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.960
 and your directory and what we want well the seven chapters 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.819
 for now that does not worry us 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.460
 let's go into the directory 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.550
 min 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.550
 in the project 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.419
 the package in the second in the executable that monista side 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.839
 previously 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:47.039
 they have also installed a server that sued bric 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.409
 we are going to 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.409
 when starting our first project with the server 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.189
 let's start server that is a rail s 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.849
 server 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.589
 I was going to run 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:05.589
 the web server of e we see it here 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.909
 informs us that to open your application we have to introduce this 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.969
 local josu 2 points 3 min 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:16.060
 separate control brings to pay the server 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.889
 and let's see what we think 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.449
 we open a window with the center simón local games 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:32.030
 is loading 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.259
 and here 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.919
 when not very stressed 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.469
 this page 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:42.279
 we already have the certainty that we have installed everything correctly but as 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:45.279
 they do not have much difficulty 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:49.129
 if we click on the link, it will tell us the pressure is that we have 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.499
 and here apparently not everything 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:06.539
 and with this we have already finished our first chapter car which consists 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.330
 install the rodeo in reims 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.949
 in the windows operating system
