00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
a new design the old one was pretty

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.020 
a new design the old one was pretty
plain<00:04:26.110> since<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:26.800> wasn't<00:04:27.010> really<00:04:27.639> really<00:04:27.909> old

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
plain since it wasn't really really old

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.629 
plain since it wasn't really really old
I<00:04:28.300> had<00:04:28.780> lots<00:04:29.199> and<00:04:29.440> lots<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.710> details<00:04:29.949> it<00:04:30.370> isn't

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
I had lots and lots of details it isn't

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.850 
I had lots and lots of details it isn't
necessarily<00:04:31.030> bigger<00:04:31.419> but<00:04:31.930> in<00:04:32.289> my<00:04:32.500> opinion

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
necessarily bigger but in my opinion

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.360 
necessarily bigger but in my opinion
it's<00:04:33.070> way<00:04:33.490> better<00:04:34.470> well<00:04:35.470> at<00:04:35.710> some<00:04:35.919> point<00:04:35.979> I

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
it's way better well at some point I

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.860 
it's way better well at some point I
just<00:04:36.550> got<00:04:36.699> the<00:04:36.820> feeling<00:04:36.970> that<00:04:37.510> there<00:04:37.690> need<00:04:37.840> to

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
just got the feeling that there need to

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.390 
just got the feeling that there need to
be<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.110> river<00:04:38.380> going<00:04:38.680> through<00:04:38.979> this<00:04:39.159> area

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
be a river going through this area

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.189 
be a river going through this area
because<00:04:39.940> I<00:04:40.090> always<00:04:40.270> preach<00:04:40.599> about<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:41.020> in<00:04:41.110> my

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
because I always preach about it in my

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.839 
because I always preach about it in my
videos<00:04:41.530> that<00:04:41.770> it<00:04:41.860> was<00:04:42.009> important<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.580> have<00:04:42.789> a

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
videos that it was important to have a

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.689 
videos that it was important to have a
connection<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.449> water<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.860> an<00:04:44.979> ocean<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.669> a

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
connection to water to an ocean to a

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.140 
connection to water to an ocean to a
river<00:04:46.150> or<00:04:46.479> something<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.650> big<00:04:48.130> lake<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:49.120> I

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
river or something to a big lake so I

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.149 
river or something to a big lake so I
just<00:04:49.479> decided<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:49.990> take<00:04:50.470> advantage<00:04:50.919> of<00:04:51.009> the

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
just decided to take advantage of the

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.070 
just decided to take advantage of the
fact<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.580> just<00:04:51.639> had<00:04:52.090> gotten<00:04:52.330> rid<00:04:52.599> of<00:04:52.630> car

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
fact that I just had gotten rid of car

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.409 
fact that I just had gotten rid of car
get<00:04:53.229> old<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.620> took<00:04:54.130> some<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.520> space

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
get old and took some of that space

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.200 
get old and took some of that space
which<00:04:55.750> was<00:04:55.930> now<00:04:56.199> blanket<00:04:56.889> basically<00:04:57.550> still<00:04:57.970> is

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
which was now blanket basically still is

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.320 
which was now blanket basically still is
blank<00:04:58.539> because<00:04:58.750> I<00:04:58.930> have<00:04:59.259> not<00:05:00.210> exchanged<00:05:01.210> it

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
blank because I have not exchanged it

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.050

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.610 
and now it's way better and it's a
little<00:05:42.740> bit<00:05:42.830> bigger<00:05:43.070> and<00:05:44.170> of<00:05:45.170> course<00:05:45.350> I<00:05:45.500> made

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
little bit bigger and of course I made

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.250 
little bit bigger and of course I made
tons<00:05:45.950> and<00:05:46.250> tons<00:05:46.280> of<00:05:46.730> new<00:05:47.030> houses<00:05:47.660> but<00:05:47.930> I<00:05:47.990> won't

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
tons and tons of new houses but I won't

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.410 
tons and tons of new houses but I won't
go<00:05:48.440> any<00:05:48.740> further<00:05:49.070> into<00:05:49.400> detail<00:05:49.910> because<00:05:50.090> this

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
go any further into detail because this

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.740 
go any further into detail because this
would<00:05:50.660> simply<00:05:51.260> to<00:05:51.380> take<00:05:51.650> too<00:05:51.830> much<00:05:51.860> time<00:05:52.750> well

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
would simply to take too much time well

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.170 
would simply to take too much time well
and<00:05:53.990> that<00:05:54.110> is<00:05:54.230> pretty<00:05:54.440> much<00:05:54.500> it<00:05:54.800> so<00:05:55.180> there's

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
and that is pretty much it so there's

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.520 
and that is pretty much it so there's
one<00:05:56.360> last<00:05:56.480> thing<00:05:56.600> I<00:05:56.750> get<00:05:56.990> off<00:05:57.080> my<00:05:57.230> chest

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
one last thing I get off my chest

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.260 
one last thing I get off my chest
because<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:57.920> think<00:05:58.400> it's<00:05:58.580> gonna<00:05:58.760> mean<00:05:59.000> a<00:05:59.030> lot<00:05:59.240> to

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270
