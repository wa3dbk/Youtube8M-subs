 ideal image of the project and putting it 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.450

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.810
 difficult and helps to work for a 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.550
 motive and in the same direction to all

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.490

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.590
 for its degree of personal utility and 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.180
 social values ​​of the company are the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.120
 most important pillars of any 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.609
 organization with them actually 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.590
 define themselves because the values ​​of 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.629
 an organization are the values ​​of their 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.790
 members and especially their
