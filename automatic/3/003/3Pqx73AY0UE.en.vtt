00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.450
 That's how she laughed at the pc games 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.230
 hardware 2 2004 that's exactly five now 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.209
 years ago 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.550
 if you continue in the past of 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.520
 pcgh I recommend you to travel 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.090
 the extra long jubilee video on 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.690
 this dvd that the last 100 years pc 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.980
 reviews games hardware 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.760
 maybe only the last 100 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.570
 expenditure 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.030
 but back in january 2004 a new one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.480
 year had begun and thus became 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.269
 everything different instead of how else test tips 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.870
 tuning promised us the cover this time 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:48.449
 Tips tuning and troubleshooting one 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.729
 small revolution of the faithful ones 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.519
 readers could hardly recover 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:56.460
 but do not be afraid of one or the other 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.649
 Of course there was also a test in the folder 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.170
 the next shock was already waiting 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.629
 page 12 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.000
 mds brand new and much awaited athlon 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.220
 64 not only made Intel's Pentium 4 die 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.800
 hell hot he obviously had himself 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.680
 a heat problem of switching to the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.870
 state-of-the-art 90 nanometer production ran 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.270
 not as expected the maximum 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.930
 loss of athlon 64 was threatened 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.170
 to increase from 89 to 105 watts 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.360
 monti 105 did today about it 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.010
 just smile so many chip comes up 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.070
 140 watts of heat 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.500
 that is probably somewhere between 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.000
 volcano eruption and geforce fx but on 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.920
 he was nothing to the rumors 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.490
 turn and a polynuclear Athlon 64 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.850
 his life remained at a maximum of 89 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.780
 but watt on page 12 is still found 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.420
 another interesting note thought 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.150
 at that time already over the 45 nanometer 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.640
 Technology after those days five years 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.690
 later in the form of fan m2 yes too 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 actually comes to the market funny 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.530
 Comment does not come to mind 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.710
 one page further on 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.599
 fulfilled promise ddr2 went back then 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.239
 at the start and should soon be the success 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.040
 repeat from ddr 1 and so it does not 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.110
 this strange political fabric 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.600
 meant but the most successful 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.240
 Memory standard of Intel's favorite 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.860
 technology rambus had displaced yes and 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.020
 we just have to go one page further 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.060
 are already expected on page 14 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.400
 us the next promising future 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.130
 technology dual layer dvds 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.590
 the 8 5 gigabytes on a disk 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.540
 should accommodate the dual layer 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.230
 Technology uses two data layers 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.390
 one above the other 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.040
 the big advantage the dvd must have 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.790
 longer videos no longer turned 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.740
 because the pcgh dvd but without dual 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.930
 Layer technology works now 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.140
 unfortunately for the continuation of the second 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.210
 insert page 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.540
 they are still there, of course, only one 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.390
 joke 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.190
 then it can not go on with it 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.080
 All the techniques have that history 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.390
 as well meant notebooks with 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.790
 changeable graphics chips like this 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.160
 alienware model zb have always been 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.260
 but never a good idea 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.460
 could prevail which is a pity 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.770
 Just imagine how 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.210
 in practice this is a mobile device 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.600
 to be able to upgrade 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.610
 shut up on gtx 280 and already running 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.910
 circle on the little gameboy 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.220
 sister yes it was not meant to be 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.960
 nevertheless, mobile computers were also like that 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.910
 always faster though usually 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.180
 not quite as literally as 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.160
 this casemod the at least 30 km / h 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.140
 came and their creator from us at that time 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.880
 elected hobby helicopter of the month 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.320
 has been 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.950
 also quite fast the new ones 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:48.180
 graphics cards with geforce fx 5900 xt and 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.960
 radeon 9800 se on page 50 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.150
 test 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.130
 that were not bad soil much 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.100
 performance for the money and in this case 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.770
 even two fans if it is a good idea 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.020
 is just a geforce fx with red 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.250
 to decorate flames 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.910
 One step further you went 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.460
 alba tons of their geforce fx 5700 ultra 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.150
 got three fans if one 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.360
 it turns out that calms down a lot 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.560
 but a 5700 will not 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.100
 they mean so hot 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.120
 but if you forget that 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.710
 plastic foil from the heat conductor too 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.320
 Remove as after disassembly 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.270
 the cooler turned out no wonder 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.889
 that this map with the distance 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.289
 highest temperatures reached in the test 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.479
 yes, albert honda had humor 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.819
 funny folks you can see that already on 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.409
 logo were also the people of extra dem 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.529
 third supposedly large 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:45.719
 graphic chip manufacturers in the market 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:49.319
 volare v8 duo was already in the 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:50.879
 proven in the test lab before and even if 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.710
 the quotes the word 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.349
 Proven now should not have heard 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.180
 Here they are now 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.219
 We had a new card with a new one 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.199
 drivers in the lab and behold them 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.599
 already worked much better 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.099
 Meanwhile, even had the extra in the 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.199
 last month still inactive 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:10.259
 edge smoothing in the driver of the v8 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.779
 unlocked madness finally one 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.759
 fully functioning card though 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:17.339
 even at first glance because on 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:20.629
 the second we saw that we nothing 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:24.120
 More saw genuine anti aliasing 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:26.550
 tv8 actually only a blur 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.009
 thilo bayer's conclusion at the time 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.319
 Edge smoothing has nothing to do 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.729
 the picture for mud so that the 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.949
 weak technology does not look that accurate 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.899
 that's a tactic these days too 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.479
 like by many game developers 

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:41.430
 is used but we were fuller 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.039
 Confidence in the outlook on the 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.039
 graphics cards year 2004, the name appeared 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.689
 an extra one was actually from 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.020
 not much to hear this boy 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:54.120
 and even less to see 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.979
 The same applies to s3 whose delta chrome 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.439
 cards we also test and for 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.990
 power wa of which we chose the year 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:03.539
 2004 also something competition hoped 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.610
 Three manufacturers do not like it 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.620
 the duopoly of at managed their video 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.949
 to break through and to the present day 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:16.020
 days that is so sad there is one 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:17.129
 minute of silence attached so that would have 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.189
 I'm around now 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:21.959
 We do not agree with the games 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:23.999
 this work of art only in form 

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:27.509
 he already molested an ad 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:29.969
 this title a shooter named the 3 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.680
 It was not quite finished yet 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:33.300
 we dedicated a multilateral one to him 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.550
 preview article 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.729
 Finally, software has been playing since 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.529
 always for original play mechanics and 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:43.529
 complex background stories famous 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:45.479
 oh sorry I have that now 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:48.270
 List held upside andersrum 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:51.180
 So even with weak history and 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.979
 Simple gameplay Doom 3 was technical 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.020
 groundbreaking and who needs it 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.270
 fun when he has such nice shade 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.969
 can look at 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.710
 we are already at the end or 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:04.349
 not 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:07.050
 yes I know one thing is missing in the last one 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:08.639
 Month I did not show her and then 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.819
 reached me a veritable flood of 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.680
 e-mails well most of them offered me 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:15.270
 only cheap power and had 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.800
 actually nothing to do with it but 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.300
 Nevertheless, I mean the message 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.349
 to have understood 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:24.719
 you want to see thorn please there it is 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:26.990
 hidden on page 35 in one else 

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:28.770
 only moderately pretty display 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.249
 they also want to get moving 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:36.529
 See you well, but I say goodbye 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:36.529
 So ever until next time
