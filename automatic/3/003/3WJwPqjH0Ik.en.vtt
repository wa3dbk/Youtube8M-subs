 that means, on the other hand, at the impact 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.219
 If one arm repels one can get one

 Jeff Dienst Einstein wrote in perfection show the importance of the slope 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.610
 therefore, in a fall, an arm threatens repulsion 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.750
