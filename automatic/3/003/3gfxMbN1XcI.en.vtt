per<00:00:36.280> string<00:00:36.309> that's<00:00:37.149> pretty<00:00:38.110> much<00:00:38.290> basically

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
per string that's pretty much basically

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.680 
per string that's pretty much basically
the<00:00:38.860> same<00:00:39.070> thing<00:00:39.329> except<00:00:40.329> for<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.660> four<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the same thing except for the four and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.530 
the same thing except for the four and
we've<00:00:43.690> had<00:00:43.899> this<00:00:44.079> lake<00:00:44.410> in<00:00:44.910> another<00:00:45.910> mission

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
we've had this lake in another mission

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.020 
we've had this lake in another mission
ready<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.450> shape<00:00:49.960> would<00:00:50.140> be<00:00:50.260> 7<00:00:50.770> 10<00:00:51.190> 12<00:00:51.670> and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
ready the shape would be 7 10 12 and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.440 
ready the shape would be 7 10 12 and
then<00:00:52.230> 7<00:00:53.230> 9<00:00:53.500> 12<00:00:54.010> on<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.370> g<00:00:54.730> string<00:00:54.760> so<00:00:55.150> I<00:00:55.180> skip

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
then 7 9 12 on the g string so I skip

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.110 
then 7 9 12 on the g string so I skip
the<00:00:55.540> D<00:00:55.690> string<00:00:55.900> and<00:00:56.410> then<00:00:56.500> 7<00:00:56.950> 10<00:00:57.250> 12<00:00:57.579> on<00:00:57.790> the

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
the D string and then 7 10 12 on the

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.510 
the D string and then 7 10 12 on the
high<00:00:58.240> E<00:00:58.270> string<00:00:58.450> I<00:00:58.870> stick<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.140> be<00:00:59.380> strong<00:00:59.680> and

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.800 

what<00:01:03.520> I<00:01:03.550> do<00:01:03.670> now<00:01:04.000> is<00:01:04.030> I<00:01:04.299> tap<00:01:04.960> on<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:06.189> 15th<00:01:07.119> fret

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
what I do now is I tap on the 15th fret

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.690 
what I do now is I tap on the 15th fret
of<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.049> high<00:01:08.259> E<00:01:08.409> string<00:01:08.439> to<00:01:09.130> it<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.549> add

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
of the high E string to it to add

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.399 
of the high E string to it to add
another<00:01:09.850> Genie

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:22.950 

but<00:01:14.409> I<00:01:14.439> slide<00:01:14.890> from<00:01:15.609> the<00:01:15.729> 14th<00:01:16.240> into<00:01:16.509> the<00:01:16.630> feet

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.000 

so<00:01:23.740> that's<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:24.070> nice<00:01:24.280> lick<00:01:24.610> itself

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.170 

and<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.130> second<00:01:29.430> time<00:01:29.580> I<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.330> same<00:01:30.360> thing

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
and the second time I do the same thing

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.850 
and the second time I do the same thing
so<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:33.420> back<00:01:33.600> down<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.230> just<00:01:34.410> hammer-ons

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
so I go back down it's just hammer-ons

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.520 
so I go back down it's just hammer-ons
and<00:01:34.980> pull-offs<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:36.020> pick<00:01:37.020> again<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.500> snow<00:01:37.800> and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
and pull-offs I pick again this snow and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.370 
and pull-offs I pick again this snow and
there's<00:01:40.530> no<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.820> seventh<00:01:42.600> fret<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.990> on

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
there's no so the seventh fret and on

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.280 
there's no so the seventh fret and on
the<00:01:43.620> high<00:01:43.740> E<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.430> AH<00:01:44.550> g-string<00:01:45.180> sorry<00:01:46.020> are

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the high E and AH g-string sorry are

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.810 
the high E and AH g-string sorry are
being<00:01:46.800> picked

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.400 

and<00:01:52.820> then<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:53.150> do<00:01:53.210> this<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:53.960> first<00:01:54.080> time<00:01:54.320> it

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
and then I do this so the first time it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.790 
and then I do this so the first time it
is<00:01:54.680> 14<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.580> 15<00:01:55.760> and<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.540> second<00:01:57.200> time<00:01:57.320> it's<00:01:57.500> 15

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
is 14 to 15 and the second time it's 15

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.970 
is 14 to 15 and the second time it's 15
to<00:01:57.920> 17<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:59.110> I<00:02:00.110> land<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.910> on<00:02:01.910> that<00:02:02.230> 17th<00:02:03.230> Fred

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
to 17 and I land on on that 17th Fred

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.469 
to 17 and I land on on that 17th Fred
just<00:02:04.880> high<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.230> and<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:07.670> takes<00:02:07.940> me<00:02:08.180> to<00:02:08.330> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
just high a and that takes me to the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:18.100 
just high a and that takes me to the
next<00:02:09.670> idea<00:02:10.670> or<00:02:11.240> lick<00:02:11.740> which<00:02:12.740> is<00:02:12.950> this<00:02:16.990> which<00:02:17.990> is

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
next idea or lick which is this which is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.960 
next idea or lick which is this which is
basically<00:02:18.440> just<00:02:18.560> string<00:02:19.040> skipping<00:02:19.280> combined

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
basically just string skipping combined

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.400 
basically just string skipping combined
without<00:02:20.390> tapping

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.180

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.940 
the high E string so the whole thing
slowly<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:02.790> start<00:03:03.790> with<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:03.970> tap<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.650> tab

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
slowly is I start with a tap so it's tab

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.610 
slowly is I start with a tap so it's tab
pull<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:07.090> 10<00:03:07.360> hammer<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:08.140> 2<00:03:08.260> 12<00:03:09.810> tap<00:03:10.810> again<00:03:11.020> pull
