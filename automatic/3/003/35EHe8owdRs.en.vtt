00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
because I don't have a sandblaster

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.730 
because I don't have a sandblaster
and<00:00:08.910> I've<00:00:09.510> got<00:00:09.660> other<00:00:09.840> things<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.290> really

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
to finish this rusty area then I'm going

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.389 
to finish this rusty area then I'm going
to<00:00:35.940> spray<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:37.020> might<00:00:37.800> spray<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.340> with

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
to spray it with I might spray it with

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.220 
to spray it with I might spray it with
some<00:00:38.460> rust<00:00:38.760> inhibitor<00:00:39.239> first<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.840> then<00:00:39.989> put

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
some rust inhibitor first and then put

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.260 
some rust inhibitor first and then put
the<00:00:40.320> truck<00:00:40.500> bed<00:00:40.680> coating<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.879> under

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the truck bed coating over it or under

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.970 
the truck bed coating over it or under
coating<00:00:42.570> depending<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:42.989> whatever<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.710> feel

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
coating depending on whatever I feel

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.260 
coating depending on whatever I feel
like<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.520> when<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> store

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
like going with when I go to the store

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.510 
like going with when I go to the store
and<00:00:45.450> then<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.500> know<00:00:46.890> figure<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.430> I'm

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and then you know figure out what I'm

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
and then you know figure out what I'm
doing<00:00:47.579> after<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.899> probably<00:00:49.140> I'm

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
doing after that so it's probably I'm

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.040 
doing after that so it's probably I'm
probably<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.559> gonna<00:00:49.739> spray<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.010> black

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
probably just gonna spray it black

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.119 
probably just gonna spray it black
because<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.260> gonna<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.530> under<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> carpet

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
because it's gonna be under the carpet

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.880 
because it's gonna be under the carpet
nobody's<00:00:53.370> gonna<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.649> finished

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
nobody's gonna see it so so I finished

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.060 
nobody's gonna see it so so I finished
sanding<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.059> scuffing<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.539> my<00:00:57.770> floor<00:00:58.770> board

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
sanding and scuffing up my floor board

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.700 
sanding and scuffing up my floor board
and<00:00:59.250> I<00:01:00.059> went<00:01:00.480> out<00:01:00.719> when<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> went<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.620> my

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and I went out when I went to get my

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.100 
and I went out when I went to get my
transmission<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.539> store<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.989> bought

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
transmission to the store and bought

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
transmission to the store and bought
some<00:01:04.170> truck<00:01:04.589> bed<00:01:04.799> coating<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.299> kind

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
some truck bed coating and this is kind

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.310 
some truck bed coating and this is kind
of<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.720> looks<00:01:06.869> like

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
of what it looks like

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.710 
of what it looks like
cleaned<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:08.090> I'm<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> rest

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
cleaned it up I'm going to do the rest

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.310 
cleaned it up I'm going to do the rest
of<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:11.250> floor<00:01:11.460> pan<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.720> probably<00:01:13.200> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
of the floor pan up there probably I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.399 
of the floor pan up there probably I
gonna<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.820> about<00:01:14.939> Hama<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
gonna think about Hama if I'm going to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.060 
gonna think about Hama if I'm going to
paint<00:01:16.619> over<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.060> mat<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:19.070> sound-deadening

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
paint over the mat or sound-deadening

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.820 
paint over the mat or sound-deadening
material<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:21.259> is<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
material that is up there from the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.469 
material that is up there from the
factory<00:01:23.340> or<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.880> I'm<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.390> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
factory or what I'm going to do with it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.080 
factory or what I'm going to do with it
so<00:01:24.860> I'm<00:01:25.860> certainly<00:01:26.130> gonna<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> other<00:01:26.729> pan

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
so I'm certainly gonna do the other pan

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.550 
so I'm certainly gonna do the other pan
as<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:27.509> once<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.750> get<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:27.960> my<00:01:28.080> crap<00:01:28.320> out<00:01:28.530> of

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
as well once I get all my crap out of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.929 
as well once I get all my crap out of
here<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.479> at<00:01:30.479> least<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.939> transmission

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
here and at least the transmission

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.789 
here and at least the transmission
tunnel<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.509> stuff<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.650> that

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
tunnel and stuff like that this is that

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.789 
tunnel and stuff like that this is that
the<00:01:35.040> that'll<00:01:35.610> protect<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.360> from<00:01:36.530> future<00:01:37.530> rust

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the that'll protect it from future rust

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.179 
the that'll protect it from future rust
and<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.180> forth<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.159> can

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
and so on and so forth so but you can

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.899 
and so on and so forth so but you can
see<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:42.380> cured<00:01:43.380> quite<00:01:44.100> nicely<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.670> still

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
see it's cured quite nicely it's still

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.429 
see it's cured quite nicely it's still
tacky<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:46.100> it's<00:01:47.100> curing<00:01:47.460> quite<00:01:47.700> nicely<00:01:47.909> I

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
tacky but it's curing quite nicely I

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.840 
tacky but it's curing quite nicely I
think<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.040> actually<00:01:50.369> work<00:01:50.549> out

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
think this is going to actually work out

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.910 
think this is going to actually work out
