you can plug it into a computer and this
part<00:01:43.049> into<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> helicopter<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.490> charge<00:01:44.790> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
part into the helicopter and charge it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.080 
part into the helicopter and charge it
it<00:01:45.119> comes<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.450> an<00:01:45.570> extra<00:01:45.750> rear<00:01:46.500> rotor<00:01:47.250> in

it comes with an extra rear rotor in

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:57.560 
it comes with an extra rear rotor in
case<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.579> breaks

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.800 

so<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.520> now<00:02:00.759> our<00:02:01.079> helicopter<00:02:02.079> should<00:02:02.259> be<00:02:03.810> this

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810
