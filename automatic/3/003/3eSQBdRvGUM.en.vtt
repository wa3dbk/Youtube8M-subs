00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.319
 to glue the first tile on the wall 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.790
 bathroom 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.099
 you need to carefully prepare and work 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.349
 check all walls for deviation from 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.480
 vertical 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.940
 check the floor level found in the most 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.680
 high point here here and I myself spent 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.689
 together with level 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.939
 and let the whole world inhabit the floor decompose 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.109
 tile 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:33.000
 can inspected in principle 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:37.590
 the geometry of this tile is normal even in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.190
 this rectangle forming a cross 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.290
 looked 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.890
 here the principle turned out perfectly 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.559
 slight deviation is there but this is for 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.160
 I am nonsense 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.899
 that is, the parallel here is perfect 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.350
 it turned out and parallels here too 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.510
 It turned out perfectly checked from this 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.539
 rivers at 90 degrees and this one 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:06.240
 vertical seam turned out that is 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:08.060
 ok deviation is actually not this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.310
 tile will 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.170
 from the floor 3 rows of tone from her 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.350
 have more of this tile is such a dark 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.590
 crosses 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.670
 set and getting warmer the water level i 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.630
 shorter measured it turned out 50 all 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.040
 centimeters that is 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.380
 57 centimeters it will be somewhere here 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.570
 here that is, I will not cut and tile 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.420
 as there are two tiles so it was 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.780
 I will start working with this tile 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.930
 Here from this size that is 60 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.430
 centimeters 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.799
 here you need to take the size of the floor before 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.680
 Bottom of this tile size you need 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.850
 sure that you can take five 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.840
 millimeters let it be 60 centimeters and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.840
 5 millimeters 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.039
 the thickness of the floor with electric 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:15.390
 warm floor 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:16.140
 the size will be 1 and 2 millimeters 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.280
 that is, you can 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.280
 one and a half centimeters still add that is 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:32.360
 one and a half centimeters 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:32.360
 60 and 5 and a half it will be 62 centimeters 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:49.940
 that is , this is the place in 62 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:58.739
 centimeter 62 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:08.819
 I run all the devil and put it here 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:12.950
 here are the rules for the level and I will glue 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:19.940
 tiles on the vertical wall and its 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.940
 further bye
