00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.519
 hi girls 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.429
 today I want to show you how to do two 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.799
 of the kanzashi sharp petal method 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.139
 girls who are engaged in kanzashi me 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.840
 any this way the first way is very 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.310
 well know this is a common way 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.710
 for all those who do not know for beginners I 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.330
 show now so take a square 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.470
 ribbons me three and a half for three with 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.390
 half a centimeter 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.850
 Deal more squares to was 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.719
 clearly visible and clear how to do it 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.719
 it in half diagonal 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:01:02.960
 fold again and we fold again like this 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:02.960
 cut off our tips set on fire 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.689
 cut out here at the end so that more carefully 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.759
 it was here leave 5 millimeter can 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.490
 7 depending on what size you have 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:31.710
 petal and here a centimeter and a half is 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:35.180
 Jack's top got fed up on a mushroom here 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.180
 we have such a petal 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:45.659
 here is the Gnostic petal 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.090
 so now I want to show you the same 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.460
 the best way but the ribbon is already in it 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.240
 if you have a narrow ribbon at me 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.410
 At the moment 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:02.820
 two centimeters of this ribbon 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:04.619
 cut a 2 by 2 square and make you 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.190
 same way that you just 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.340
 showed only with a narrow ribbon folded 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.880
 dad 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.170
 folded in half again and again in half 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:23.220
 and here is a little petal with us 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.550
 It turned out here let's work up to 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.550
 the end 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.050
 and here and here what petal we have 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.870
 turned out with a ribbon width of 2 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.520
 centimeter but if we do 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.280
 the second way that you now 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.170
 I will show this way on the Internet anywhere 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.650
 did not see and I discovered it for myself 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.510
 because when i needed 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.810
 larger petal ribbons a 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.380
 the neck was not there so I came up with how it 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:20.020
 can do let's see I add 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:25.040
 a ribbon like this now serving here 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:28.970
 I think I turn it around and cut it off 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.040
 ribbons that's when I deploy from me 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.290
 it turns out not a box like this 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.680
 here is a piece 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.680
 I'll show you again so add up 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:47.300
 so add 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:49.970
 and smoothly in half you see what 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.340
 it turned out exactly the same petal he 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.480
 larger with the same width 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:05.320
 ribbons i think it will come in handy for you 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:08.270
 future this video will be useful for you 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.150
 because I myself was in such a situation 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.450
 I didn't know how to make a bigger petal 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.410
 Ribbon width was and now I had to 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.209
 him as he would come up and do not know can 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.590
 You are on the Internet and met but I do not 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.450
 met this way 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:30.140
 petal and now decided to share with you 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:33.320
 here and so see I want to show you 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:36.020
 that here with this ribbon turned 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.350
 almost the same petal size as 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.330
 with this ribbon there were three and a half 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.860
 for three and a half and then two for two 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:48.860
 here these three dotted difference is still visible 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.550
 I want to say that you see the petals 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.300
 slightly different among themselves orange 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.199
 yellow 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.479
 due to the fact that this ribbon is satin i am so 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.960
 I think she is so soft 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:06.229
 and without points it turns out more like 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.190
 would pyshnenkie may say so but 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:13.190
 it's me . already rougher here the fabric so I do not 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:17.210
 I know what kind of fabric it is coarser and 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.520
 such a petal is obtained well, a little bit 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.520
 it looks different too it all depends on 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.590
 what ribbon do you have I'll say right away with 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.740
 this ribbon is easier to work when me 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.629
 what's the price of it all 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.610
 if something is not clear write in the comments 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.610
 and see you in the next video bye
