because they you can't control how
they're<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> react<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.190> tend<00:00:53.579> not<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
they're going to react so I tend not to

they're going to react so I tend not to
encourage<00:00:54.629> my<00:00:54.840> dog<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.710> strangers

to<00:00:56.760> get<00:00:56.910> fed<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.500> get

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
to get fed because it's going to get

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.720 
to get fed because it's going to get
them<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.859> trouble<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.520> can't

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
them in trouble because you can't

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.830 
them in trouble because you can't
control<00:01:00.030> how<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> restrainer<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.780> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
control how the restrainer is going to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.820 
control how the restrainer is going to
react<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.609> instead<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.910> would<00:01:03.030> go<00:01:03.629> work<00:01:03.989> around

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
react so instead I would go work around

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.380 
react so instead I would go work around
a<00:01:05.010> stranger<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.880> would<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.150> all<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390

people then that would be the only place
that<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:44.010> social<00:04:44.730> isolation<00:04:44.880> like<00:04:45.389> that<00:04:45.570> would

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
that a social isolation like that would

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.350 
that a social isolation like that would
be<00:04:45.900> potentially<00:04:46.680> beneficial<00:04:47.280> right<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:48.150> more

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
be potentially beneficial right the more

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.210 
be potentially beneficial right the more
times<00:04:48.570> your<00:04:48.780> dog<00:04:48.930> meets<00:04:49.290> new<00:04:49.620> people<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.100> has

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
times your dog meets new people and has

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.430 
times your dog meets new people and has
good<00:04:50.370> experiences<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.570> less<00:04:51.810> likely<00:04:52.290> your

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
good experiences the less likely your

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.159 
good experiences the less likely your
dog<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.919> want<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.190> bite<00:04:53.600> new<00:04:54.600> people<00:04:54.990> right

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
dog is to want to bite new people right

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.240 
dog is to want to bite new people right
so<00:04:56.070> if<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:58.020> was<00:04:58.200> a<00:04:58.230> goal<00:04:58.470> of<00:04:58.500> yours<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:59.100> have<00:04:59.220> a

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
so if that was a goal of yours to have a

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.860 
so if that was a goal of yours to have a
dog<00:04:59.460> that<00:04:59.490> would<00:04:59.669> bite<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.850> lot<00:05:00.090> of<00:05:00.180> people<00:05:00.419> then

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
dog that would bite a lot of people then

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.020 
dog that would bite a lot of people then
no<00:05:01.440> then<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:01.710> having<00:05:02.190> lots<00:05:02.370> of<00:05:02.490> socialization

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
no then you having lots of socialization

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.340 
no then you having lots of socialization
in<00:05:03.270> contact<00:05:03.630> probably<00:05:03.900> isn't<00:05:04.080> going<00:05:04.200> to<00:05:04.260> be

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
in contact probably isn't going to be

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.400 
in contact probably isn't going to be
good<00:05:04.530> for<00:05:05.220> that<00:05:05.370> dog<00:05:05.610> right<00:05:06.270> so<00:05:06.600> for<00:05:06.840> me<00:05:07.050> most

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
good for that dog right so for me most

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.930 
good for that dog right so for me most
of<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.650> three<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.100> reason<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:08.490> I<00:05:08.550> wouldn't

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
of the three the reason that I wouldn't

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.370 
of the three the reason that I wouldn't
allow<00:05:09.030> my<00:05:09.210> dog<00:05:09.360> to<00:05:09.480> go<00:05:09.570> say<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:09.780> hide<00:05:10.050> everybody

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
allow my dog to go say to hide everybody

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.920 
allow my dog to go say to hide everybody
would<00:05:11.100> be<00:05:11.220> either<00:05:11.520> one<00:05:12.090> because<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.750> dog<00:05:12.900> is

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
would be either one because the dog is

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.630 
would be either one because the dog is
fearful<00:05:13.290> and<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.890> can't<00:05:14.130> control<00:05:14.340> what<00:05:14.520> those

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
fearful and I can't control what those

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.710 
fearful and I can't control what those
people<00:05:14.820> are<00:05:14.910> going<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.060> do<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.419> they<00:05:15.480> can<00:05:15.600> make

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
people are going to do and they can make

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.620 
people are going to do and they can make
my<00:05:15.840> fearful<00:05:16.230> problem<00:05:16.560> worse<00:05:16.770> or<00:05:17.700> two<00:05:18.210> because

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
my fearful problem worse or two because

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.510 
my fearful problem worse or two because
my<00:05:18.780> dog<00:05:18.930> won't<00:05:19.110> pay<00:05:19.260> any<00:05:19.500> attention<00:05:19.710> to<00:05:20.070> me<00:05:20.280> and

more<00:05:58.110> fun<00:05:58.169> than<00:05:58.470> working<00:05:58.620> with<00:05:58.770> me<00:05:58.979> and<00:05:59.160> as<00:05:59.250> I

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
more fun than working with me and as I

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.380 
more fun than working with me and as I
start<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.610> try<00:05:59.729> to<00:05:59.760> get<00:05:59.910> them<00:06:00.000> to<00:06:00.090> work<00:06:00.210> with<00:06:00.270> me

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
start to try to get them to work with me

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.029 
start to try to get them to work with me
they're<00:06:00.810> like<00:06:00.960> no<00:06:01.110> no<00:06:01.229> I'd<00:06:01.410> rather<00:06:01.560> go<00:06:01.680> say<00:06:01.890> hi

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
they're like no no I'd rather go say hi

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.909 
they're like no no I'd rather go say hi
and<00:06:02.340> that<00:06:03.030> distractibility<00:06:03.900> factor<00:06:04.320> makes<00:06:04.680> my

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
and that distractibility factor makes my

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.890 
and that distractibility factor makes my
early<00:06:05.220> training<00:06:05.370> harder<00:06:05.880> so<00:06:06.360> they'll<00:06:06.660> get<00:06:06.840> a

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
early training harder so they'll get a

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.779 
early training harder so they'll get a
little<00:06:07.289> bit<00:06:07.410> of<00:06:07.530> social<00:06:07.740> isolation<00:06:08.039> from

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
little bit of social isolation from
