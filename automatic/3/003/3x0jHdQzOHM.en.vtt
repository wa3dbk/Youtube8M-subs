00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
the other side now usually this hair

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.430 
the other side now usually this hair
star<00:02:19.580> will<00:02:19.700> be<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.850> lot<00:02:20.120> more<00:02:20.150> neat<00:02:20.600> but<00:02:20.990> because

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
star will be a lot more neat but because

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.320

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.300 
it's just these little things that make
it<00:02:41.630> look<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.990> lot<00:02:42.260> mice<00:02:42.500> at<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:42.830> end<00:02:43.010> but<00:02:43.190> I'm

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
it look a lot mice at the end but I'm

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.680 
it look a lot mice at the end but I'm
just<00:02:43.400> basically<00:02:43.760> showing<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.270> how<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.390> do<00:02:44.660> it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
just basically showing you how to do it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.320 
just basically showing you how to do it
so<00:02:45.070> we<00:02:46.070> do<00:02:46.190> exactly<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.880> same<00:02:46.910> on<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.300> other

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
so we do exactly the same on the other

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.890 
so we do exactly the same on the other
side<00:02:50.470> now<00:02:51.470> we<00:02:52.370> go<00:02:52.520> towards<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.150> part<00:02:53.540> where<00:02:53.870> we

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
side now we go towards the part where we

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.240 
side now we go towards the part where we
start<00:02:54.410> pinning<00:02:54.680> both<00:02:55.070> braids<00:02:55.460> at<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.850> back<00:03:00.250> so

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
start pinning both braids at the back so

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.520 
start pinning both braids at the back so
for<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:01.940> first<00:03:02.150> strategy<00:03:02.540> I'm<00:03:03.110> going<00:03:03.410> to
