home I'm gonna have to take it out later

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.789 
home I'm gonna have to take it out later
to<00:03:35.540> because<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.079> books<00:03:36.260> are<00:03:36.379> the<00:03:36.500> inside

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
to because the books are the inside

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.819 
to because the books are the inside
that's<00:03:36.980> probably<00:03:37.280> why<00:03:37.430> it's<00:03:37.579> not<00:03:37.669> working<00:03:37.730> and

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
that's probably why it's not working and

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.239 
that's probably why it's not working and
then<00:03:40.090> thanks<00:03:41.090> for<00:03:41.120> watching
