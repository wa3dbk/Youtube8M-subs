00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
very important and finding ways to

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.160 
very important and finding ways to
connect<00:04:14.120> with<00:04:14.180> audiences<00:04:14.390> across<00:04:14.930> the

today ladino when we talk about it as
often<00:04:36.939> we're<00:04:37.210> looking<00:04:37.479> backwards<00:04:37.930> in<00:04:38.169> time

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.589 
often we're looking backwards in time
we're<00:04:38.650> often<00:04:38.770> looking<00:04:39.189> historically<00:04:39.479> but<00:04:40.479> the

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
we're often looking historically but the

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.329 
we're often looking historically but the
truth<00:04:40.809> is<00:04:41.020> that<00:04:41.050> traditions<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.069> cultures

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:42.339 
truth is that traditions and cultures

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:43.679
