00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and just copy those two files right into

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.520 
and just copy those two files right into
the<00:00:59.070> minecraft.jar<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:01.050> now<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.320> ready

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
because obviously there's not going to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.340 
because obviously there's not going to
need<00:01:21.450> trees<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.670> but<00:01:23.670> um<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.140> got<00:01:25.140> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
works as all types of axes where we're

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.280 
works as all types of axes where we're
going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> call<00:01:29.040> them<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.110> take

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
going to call them so all you do is take

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
going to call them so all you do is take
the<00:01:31.409> X<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.340> hit<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> lowest<00:01:33.000> part

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the X and then just hit the lowest part

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.960 
the X and then just hit the lowest part
you<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.420> hit<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.680> second<00:01:34.680> hi<00:01:35.400> Louis

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
you can hit that second hi Louis

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.280 
you can hit that second hi Louis
probably<00:01:36.299> guess<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.750> want<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.140> no

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
point just hit the bottom one and there

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.719 
point just hit the bottom one and there
you<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.880> what<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.360> does<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.899> um
