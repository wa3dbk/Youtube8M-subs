00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.819
 well then we continue to acquaint you with 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.680
 board games and in the sequel we 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.780
 tell about the more simple all known 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.830
 games that do not require complex details and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.830
 easy to learn 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.760
 but before we begin to tell them 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.410
 about one game on the works of lovecraft 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.970
 exactly older since a mans 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.320
 the goal of the game is to defeat evil in the museum 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.850
 antiquities for this need 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.320
 awaken an ancient being who with 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.240
 using a special ritual can 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.010
 turn into anyone and save the world 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.780
 from the evil that is about to break into our 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.489
 world can participate up to four 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.350
 characters each have unique 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.260
 abilities in front of you is available map 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.000
 locks on it marked the goals of just 64 so 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.590
 that you wo n't be bored , unlike 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.870
 classic non digital version in 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.820
 mobile cubes slowed spells but 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.530
 It does not affect the gameplay and help. 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.180
 artifacts can set life 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.100
 spell manipulation 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.340
 Separately, I want to note the magnificent 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.340
 graphics 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.380
 engenius is a very interesting strategy 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.970
 developed by studio and sam who created 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.710
 the game of the colonialist which we spoke in 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.539
 last release the game takes place on 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.520
 hexagonal box players alternately 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.289
 expose steam chips stress create 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.329
 as much money as possible 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.310
 the main thing is to evenly promote all colors 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.110
 he loses the one who seems the most 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.270
 not developed in the original version may 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.920
 participate up to 4 people on in digital 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.840
 the field had to be reduced so as not to be 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.939
 too small so the game is only for 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.259
 two have a tournament with increasing levels 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.299
 difficulty can be played against the computer 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:46.429
 either yours on one device 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:47.840
 but at the insanely popular card game 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.640
 very serious strategic 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.439
 motivated the goal of the game get rid of all 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.179
 cards are laid over the previous one 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.429
 certain rules must match 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.869
 either color or figure could in interest 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.369
 makes a special card using 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.349
 which you can change the direction of entry 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.090
 specify the color and make the players take 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.009
 additional cards also need 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.689
 constantly tears in quantity at home and at 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.280
 their rivals mobile version 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.440
 engaged in gameplay and unfortunately 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.180
 updated kept on donatti well but 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.180
 it is free and with multiplayer 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.390
 from the most popular word games 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.340

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.020
 our country form words 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.700
 Crossword not only allow interest 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.500
 spend time but also significantly expand 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.360
 your vocabulary and it is worth forgetting and 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.920
 pro strategy also bonus cells 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.570
 sometimes it is much more profitable to exchange your 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.010
 letters skip a move or make 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.930
 small like the next turn 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.090

 it will be severely curtailed 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.290
 get the most out of 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.290
 games will have to lay out a few hundred 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.129

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.260
