 that's why we declare that your 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.230
 expectations open up to a new 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.480
 dimension to stop seeing things in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.480
 pessimistic form amen 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.040
 the bible says in Romans chapter 10 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.559
 verse 17 so faith comes from hearing the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.400
 message and the message comes from the word 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.710
 of Christ, pay special attention to the 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.090
 kind of expectations and thoughts that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.280
 you have in your interior it is important that 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.540
 at the beginning of the day you have a time of 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.850
 seek and receive words from God when 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.510
 we open our hearts to what God 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.890
 It means we are receiving faith 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.600
 have correct expectations and in turn 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.509
 we expel from our minds the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.899
 darkness that they want us to believe what 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:19.110
 worse the Bible teaches us that by hearing the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:21.990
 word of God our faith is activated and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.930
 the blessings manifest not 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.840
 we can move forward if we pay attention to 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.159
 the feelings of fear of route or 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.560
 failure 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.310
 the first step to transform your life 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.799
 is changing expectations this is 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.020
 he manages to stop listening to bad news 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.140
 and abandoning thoughts 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.369
 unbelievers fill yourself with thoughts today 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.859
 of faith to live with words and actions 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.240
