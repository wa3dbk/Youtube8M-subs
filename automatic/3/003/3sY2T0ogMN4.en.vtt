weapon was introduced in the Dragonborn
DLC<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:19.240> pretty<00:02:19.420> much<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.690> equivalent

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
DLC and it's pretty much the equivalent

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.310 
DLC and it's pretty much the equivalent
of<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:21.220> Dwarven<00:02:21.610> blackboard<00:02:22.060> site<00:02:22.360> except<00:02:23.140> as

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
of the Dwarven blackboard site except as

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.340 
of the Dwarven blackboard site except as
a<00:02:23.530> two-handed<00:02:23.980> weapon<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:25.150> what<00:02:25.390> this<00:02:25.840> weapon

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
a two-handed weapon so what this weapon

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.370 
a two-handed weapon so what this weapon
does<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.190> has<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.580> 50%<00:02:28.330> chance<00:02:28.390> for<00:02:28.870> each

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
does is it has a 50% chance for each

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.820 
does is it has a 50% chance for each
element<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:30.010> fire<00:02:30.250> frost<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.330> shock<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:32.230> do<00:02:32.380> 25

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
element of fire frost and shock to do 25

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.740 
element of fire frost and shock to do 25
points<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.310> damage<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:34.300> that's<00:02:34.510> pretty<00:02:34.690> much

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
points of damage so that's pretty much

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.350 
points of damage so that's pretty much
these<00:02:35.230> three<00:02:35.620> separately<00:02:36.370> as<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.640> 50%<00:02:37.060> chance

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
these three separately as a 50% chance

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.930 
these three separately as a 50% chance
so<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.170> can<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.500> know<00:02:38.530> do<00:02:39.040> all<00:02:39.280> three<00:02:39.520> damages

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
so it can you know do all three damages

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.940 
so it can you know do all three damages
at<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.150> same<00:02:40.390> time<00:02:40.720> it's<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.500> very<00:02:41.740> very

at the same time it's a very very
powerful<00:02:42.310> weapon<00:02:42.550> indeed<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.330> that's<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:44.080> huge
