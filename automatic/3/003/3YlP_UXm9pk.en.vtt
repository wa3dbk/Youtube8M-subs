it's<00:00:11.130> really<00:00:11.490> pretty<00:00:11.610> simple<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.420> I'm<00:00:12.509> going

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
it's really pretty simple so I'm going

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.669 
it's really pretty simple so I'm going
to<00:00:12.719> show<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.809> how<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.049> do<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.290> today

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
to show you how to do it today

to show you how to do it today
now<00:00:14.580> you're<00:00:15.210> going<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.389> take<00:00:15.540> your<00:00:15.690> top<00:00:15.839> plate

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
now you're going to take your top plate

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.930 
now you're going to take your top plate
in<00:00:16.260> your<00:00:16.289> bottom<00:00:16.619> plate<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.130> lay<00:00:17.789> them<00:00:17.910> down

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
in your bottom plate and lay them down

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.849 
in your bottom plate and lay them down
and<00:00:18.090> flat<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> deck<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.350> can<00:00:19.380> either<00:00:19.619> lay

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
and flat on the deck you can either lay

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.070 
and flat on the deck you can either lay
them<00:00:20.100> one<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.730> top<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.090> other<00:00:21.270> or<00:00:21.480> edge

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
them one on top of the other or edge

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.620 
them one on top of the other or edge
side<00:00:22.439> up<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:22.980> I've<00:00:23.609> matter<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.029> preference<00:00:24.269> I

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
side up so I've matter of preference I

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.720 
side up so I've matter of preference I
like<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.710> top<00:00:26.070> plate<00:00:26.340> stacked<00:00:26.609> on

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
like it with the top plate stacked on

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.490 
like it with the top plate stacked on
top<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> bottom<00:00:27.330> plate<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.349> then<00:00:28.470> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
top of the bottom plate so that then I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.349 
top of the bottom plate so that then I
can<00:00:28.680> mark<00:00:28.830> across<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.429> face<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.820> get<00:00:29.910> my<00:00:30.060> studs

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
can mark across the face to get my studs

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.880 
can mark across the face to get my studs
nice<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.779> straight<00:00:31.050> we're<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
nice and straight we're going to have a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.520 
nice and straight we're going to have a
stud<00:00:32.189> every<00:00:32.430> 16<00:00:32.730> inches<00:00:32.940> down<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.630> wall<00:00:33.840> it's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
stud every 16 inches down the wall it's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.680 
stud every 16 inches down the wall it's
called<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> 16<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.219> center<00:00:35.250> layout<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.180> since

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
called a 16 on center layout and since

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.400 
called a 16 on center layout and since
we're<00:00:36.870> doing<00:00:36.960> studs<00:00:37.559> every<00:00:37.829> 16<00:00:37.980> inches<00:00:39.410> you'd

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
we're doing studs every 16 inches you'd

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.470 
we're doing studs every 16 inches you'd
think<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.800> was<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> mark<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.460> 16<00:00:41.879> 32

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
think that I was going to mark at 16 32

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.080 
think that I was going to mark at 16 32
48<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.890> Riya<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.370> reality<00:00:44.820> I'm<00:00:44.910> actually

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
48 but Riya in reality I'm actually

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.459 
48 but Riya in reality I'm actually
going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> go<00:00:45.570> three<00:00:45.930> quarters<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.289> an<00:00:46.410> inch

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
going to go three quarters of an inch

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.400 
going to go three quarters of an inch
before<00:00:47.070> each<00:00:47.430> stud<00:00:47.940> mark<00:00:48.239> because<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> need<00:00:49.379> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
before each stud mark because I need to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.130 
before each stud mark because I need to
leave<00:00:49.770> room<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.489> need<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.629> account<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
leave room I need to account for the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.930 
leave room I need to account for the
fact<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> sheathing<00:00:52.800> has<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.399> land<00:00:53.610> in

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
fact that the sheathing has to land in

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.130 
fact that the sheathing has to land in
the<00:00:54.059> middle<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> stud<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the middle of a stud and I'm going to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.869 
the middle of a stud and I'm going to
show<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.350> more<00:00:55.469> about<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> minute<00:00:56.100> but

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.620 
is take both plates lay them next to
each<00:01:43.680> other<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:45.299> take<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
each other like this and then take a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.389 
each other like this and then take a
speed<00:01:46.500> square<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.750> transfer<00:01:48.920> those<00:01:49.920> marks

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
speed square and transfer those marks

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.179 
speed square and transfer those marks
from<00:01:51.149> one<00:01:51.360> plate<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> other<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.350> lot<00:01:53.130> of

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
from one plate to the other a lot of

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.770 
from one plate to the other a lot of
guys<00:01:53.369> will<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.729> mark<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.119> top<00:01:54.329> edge<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
guys will just mark the top edge of the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.209 
guys will just mark the top edge of the
plate<00:01:56.299> it's<00:01:57.299> faster<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.810> way<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:58.890> to

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
plate it's faster that way but I like to

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.800 
plate it's faster that way but I like to
mark<00:01:59.399> across<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> whole<00:02:00.060> face<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.570> plate

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
mark across the whole face of the plate

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.450 
mark across the whole face of the plate
because<00:02:01.290> when<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.829> go<00:02:01.979> when<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.280> go<00:02:02.399> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
because when you go when you go to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
because when you go when you go to
assemble<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> wall<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.960> you're<00:02:04.049> working<00:02:04.320> with

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
assemble the wall if you're working with

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.160 
assemble the wall if you're working with
any<00:02:04.439> bowed<00:02:04.799> studs<00:02:05.159> or<00:02:05.600> curved<00:02:06.600> studs<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
any bowed studs or curved studs and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.809 
any bowed studs or curved studs and
they're<00:02:07.530> all<00:02:07.649> bowed<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> curved<00:02:08.429> these<00:02:08.610> days

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
they're all bowed and curved these days

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.400 
they're all bowed and curved these days
it<00:02:09.420> really<00:02:09.629> helps<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:09.989> able<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> tweak

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
it really helps you be able to tweak

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.630 
it really helps you be able to tweak
them<00:02:10.560> back<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.069> layout<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.430> get<00:02:11.550> them

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
them back to layout and get them

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.880 
them back to layout and get them
straight<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.750> line<00:02:12.959> really<00:02:13.290> helps<00:02:13.530> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
straight the line really helps you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.850 
straight the line really helps you
get<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.790> right<00:02:14.970> where<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.180> want<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.860> now

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
get it right where you want it now

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.920 
get it right where you want it now
remember<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:17.910> burned<00:02:18.210> three-quarters

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
remember that we burned three-quarters

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.300 
remember that we burned three-quarters
of<00:02:18.990> an<00:02:19.140> inch<00:02:19.230> off<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.560> each<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.220> these

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
of an inch off of each one of these

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.150 
of an inch off of each one of these
measurements<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.960> reason<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.470> is

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
measurements and the reason for that is

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.670 
measurements and the reason for that is
because<00:02:24.060> when<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.270> put<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.110> sheathing<00:02:25.350> on

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
because when I put on the sheathing on

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.480 
because when I put on the sheathing on
the<00:02:26.040> outside<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.520> house<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:29.070> really<00:02:29.220> want

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
the outside of the house you really want

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.630 
the outside of the house you really want
that<00:02:29.640> theme<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.240> land<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.250> middle<00:02:32.460> of<00:02:32.550> a

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
that theme to land in the middle of a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.800 
that theme to land in the middle of a
stud<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:34.080> as<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.320> can<00:02:34.410> see<00:02:36.590> when<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.620> nail<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:37.920> on

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
stud so as you can see when I nail it on

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.940 
stud so as you can see when I nail it on
by<00:02:39.810> burning<00:02:40.200> three-quarters<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.740> an<00:02:40.860> inch

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
by burning three-quarters of an inch

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.860 
by burning three-quarters of an inch
which<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.460> half<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.730> width<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.360> stud

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
which is half the width of a stud

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.610 
which is half the width of a stud
I<00:02:43.130> now<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.580> straddle<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.540> stud<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.380> have

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
I now can straddle this stud and have

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.050 
I now can straddle this stud and have
solid<00:02:46.980> nailing<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.430> both<00:02:47.580> pieces<00:02:47.940> of

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
solid nailing for both pieces of

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.310 
solid nailing for both pieces of
sheathing<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.570> one<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.050> one<00:02:49.170> that's

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
sheathing this one and the one that's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.250 
sheathing this one and the one that's
going<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.500> come<00:02:49.680> next

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
going to come next

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.190 
going to come next
the<00:02:52.260> only<00:02:52.410> other<00:02:52.620> trick<00:02:52.830> here<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:54.450> when

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
the only other trick here is that when

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.449 
the only other trick here is that when
you<00:02:55.290> separate<00:02:55.709> your<00:02:55.860> top<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.340> your<00:02:56.370> bottom

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
you separate your top and your bottom

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.570 
you separate your top and your bottom
plates<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:58.230> don't<00:02:58.470> mess<00:02:58.709> up<00:02:58.740> this<00:02:59.310> X

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
plates you don't mess up this X

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.370 
plates you don't mess up this X
orientation<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.900> want<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.080> make<00:03:01.170> sure<00:03:01.200> you

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
orientation you want to make sure you

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.630 
orientation you want to make sure you
have<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> X<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.830> same<00:03:02.040> side<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.459> line

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
have the X on the same side of the line

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.070 
have the X on the same side of the line
for<00:03:02.880> both<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.390> when<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.570> lay<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.840> stud

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
for both so that when you lay the stud

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.380 
for both so that when you lay the stud
it<00:03:04.530> doesn't<00:03:04.830> end<00:03:04.950> up<00:03:05.040> candid<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.940> that's<00:03:06.240> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
it doesn't end up candid and that's the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.740 
it doesn't end up candid and that's the
basics<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.959> wall<00:03:07.260> plate<00:03:07.500> layout
