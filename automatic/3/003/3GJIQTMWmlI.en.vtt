when<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.570> was<00:00:09.750> younger<00:00:10.020> when<00:00:10.350> I<00:00:10.410> was<00:00:10.500> 3<00:00:10.920> I

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
when I was younger when I was 3 I

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.140 
when I was younger when I was 3 I
started<00:00:12.059> Bell<00:00:12.210> racing<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.309> I<00:00:14.309> think<00:00:14.940> from

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
started Bell racing and I think from

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
started Bell racing and I think from
then<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.690> was<00:00:15.719> all<00:00:16.139> about<00:00:16.590> steep<00:00:17.990> it<00:00:18.990> was

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
then on it was all about steep it was

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.160 
then on it was all about steep it was
built<00:00:19.440> into<00:00:19.830> me<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.310> when<00:00:21.180> they<00:00:21.300> said<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.840> could

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
built into me so when they said I could

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.070 
built into me so when they said I could
go<00:00:22.290> on<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.440> double<00:00:22.590> spelling<00:00:23.130> last<00:00:23.340> year<00:00:23.580> with

go on a double spelling last year with

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.850 
go on a double spelling last year with
speed<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> really<00:00:25.980> loved<00:00:26.190> it<00:00:30.080> this<00:00:31.080> year<00:00:31.410> I'm

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
speed so I really loved it this year I'm

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.799 
speed so I really loved it this year I'm
gonna<00:00:32.070> try<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.520> same<00:00:32.790> thing<00:00:33.120> I'm<00:00:33.450> gonna<00:00:33.600> come

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
having done it I don't know how many

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.310 
having done it I don't know how many
times<00:01:55.070> infinite<00:01:55.549> four<00:01:55.970> or<00:01:56.030> five<00:01:56.210> times<00:01:56.540> they

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
times infinite four or five times they

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.040 
times infinite four or five times they
start<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.619> anticipate<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:59.210> horses<00:01:59.690> start<00:01:59.899> to

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
start to anticipate the horses start to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.499 
start to anticipate the horses start to
anticipate<00:02:00.259> when<00:02:00.649> they<00:02:00.740> go<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.130> start

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
anticipate when they go to the start

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.850 
anticipate when they go to the start
they're<00:02:02.509> gonna<00:02:02.600> wit<00:02:02.840> round<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.320> they're<00:02:03.740> know

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
they're gonna wit round and they're know

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.139 
they're gonna wit round and they're know
more<00:02:04.100> or<00:02:04.190> less<00:02:04.220> where<00:02:04.550> they're<00:02:04.729> going<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.000> go

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
more or less where they're going to go

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.300 
more or less where they're going to go
and<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:05.720> it's<00:02:06.470> like<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.619> racehorse<00:02:06.860> at<00:02:07.250> the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
and so it's like a racehorse at the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.910 
and so it's like a racehorse at the
starting<00:02:07.700> gates<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.239> sort<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.619> gets<00:02:09.830> a

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
starting gates is sort of and it gets a

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.350 
starting gates is sort of and it gets a
bit<00:02:10.100> impetuous<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.569> knew<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:12.260> knew<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
bit impetuous so I knew I knew the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.910 
bit impetuous so I knew I knew the
chances<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.840> were<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.350> wasn't<00:02:15.620> gonna<00:02:15.739> leave

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
chances of were it wasn't gonna leave

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.160 
chances of were it wasn't gonna leave
everything<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.519> sanding<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.180> remember<00:02:18.110> having

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
everything of sanding I remember having

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.350 
everything of sanding I remember having
the<00:02:18.350> second<00:02:18.739> fence<00:02:18.980> off<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.760> thinking<00:02:20.150> well

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
the second fence off and thinking well

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.550 
the second fence off and thinking well
you<00:02:21.230> know<00:02:21.290> I'm<00:02:21.560> in<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:21.980> bit<00:02:22.100> of<00:02:22.160> trouble<00:02:22.220> now<00:02:22.670> and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
you know I'm in a bit of trouble now and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.630 
you know I'm in a bit of trouble now and
I<00:02:24.560> think<00:02:26.350> but<00:02:27.350> when<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.739> personnel<00:02:28.130> Vince<00:02:28.370> had

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
I think but when the personnel Vince had

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.420 
I think but when the personnel Vince had
the<00:02:29.060> third<00:02:29.810> or<00:02:30.019> fourth<00:02:30.290> loss<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.739> knew<00:02:30.890> even

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
the third or fourth loss I knew even

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.640 
the third or fourth loss I knew even
coming<00:02:31.730> down<00:02:31.880> for<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.090> last<00:02:32.209> two<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.470> knew

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
coming down for the last two so I knew

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.240 
coming down for the last two so I knew
more<00:02:33.920> or<00:02:33.950> less<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:34.670> had<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.150> clear<00:02:35.360> them<00:02:35.569> and

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
more or less if I had to clear them and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.220 
more or less if I had to clear them and
hopefully<00:02:37.250> even<00:02:37.610> faster<00:02:38.209> but<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.600> also<00:02:38.989> got<00:02:39.200> a

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
hopefully even faster but I also got a

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.100 
hopefully even faster but I also got a
very<00:02:39.500> big<00:02:39.739> strike<00:02:40.069> so<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.819> can<00:02:41.630> take<00:02:41.780> strides

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
very big strike so I can take strides

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.949 
very big strike so I can take strides
out<00:02:42.380> if<00:02:42.590> his<00:02:42.800> needs<00:02:43.010> be<00:02:43.569> yes

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
out if his needs be yes

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.960 
out if his needs be yes
you<00:02:45.110> know<00:02:45.230> it's<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.560> fair<00:02:46.160> measure<00:02:46.340> luck<00:02:46.670> in<00:02:46.819> it

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
you know it's a fair measure luck in it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.600 
you know it's a fair measure luck in it
