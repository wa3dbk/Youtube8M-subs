it's<00:00:14.790> actually<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.690> MST<00:00:16.699> MS<00:00:17.699> o<00:00:17.940> 1d<00:00:18.810> pearl<00:00:19.529> so

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it's actually the MST MS o 1d pearl so

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.759 
it's actually the MST MS o 1d pearl so
let's<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.970> already<00:00:21.390> are<00:00:21.869> pre<00:00:22.199> opened<00:00:22.560> on

let's see I already are pre opened on

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.720 
let's see I already are pre opened on
the<00:00:23.130> box

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the box

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.849 
the box

Scott it from the post office on just

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:35.120 
Scott it from the post office on just
right<00:00:26.010> now<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.580> see<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.750> have<00:00:27.990> inside<00:00:34.130> see

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
right now so see what we have inside see

00:00:35.130 --> 00:01:40.450 
right now so see what we have inside see
the<00:00:35.270> MST<00:00:37.670> max<00:00:38.670> speed<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.670> MST

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:49.190 

instruction<00:01:41.460> manual<00:01:47.330> is<00:01:48.330> actually<00:01:48.840> gonna<00:01:48.960> be

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
instruction manual is actually gonna be

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.910 
instruction manual is actually gonna be
my<00:01:49.380> first<00:01:49.740> RC<00:01:50.729> drift<00:01:51.060> build<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.500> I'm<00:01:52.590> kind<00:01:52.860> of

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
my first RC drift build so I'm kind of

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.749 
my first RC drift build so I'm kind of
excited<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:54.270> also<00:01:54.570> comes<00:01:55.080> with<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:56.310> stock

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
excited it also comes with a stock

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.330 
excited it also comes with a stock
counter<00:01:57.180> steal<00:01:57.420> kit<00:01:57.660> so<00:01:58.020> imma<00:01:58.470> actually<00:01:59.100> set

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
counter steal kit so imma actually set

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.070 
counter steal kit so imma actually set
this<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.880> how<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.690> my<00:02:00.899> other

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
this up like how I have my other

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.370 
this up like how I have my other
counters<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.649> your<00:02:01.740> car<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.130> TBO<00:02:02.930> 3jf<00:02:03.930> that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
counters to your car the TBO 3jf that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.800 
counters to your car the TBO 3jf that
was<00:02:04.500> converted<00:02:04.830> with<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.280> ego<00:02:05.640> racing<00:02:06.270> GRT

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
was converted with the ego racing GRT

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.229 
was converted with the ego racing GRT
conversion<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.070> I<00:02:08.100> have<00:02:08.429> some<00:02:08.670> knowledge<00:02:08.880> how

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
conversion so I have some knowledge how

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.810 
conversion so I have some knowledge how
to<00:02:09.269> set<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:10.049> so<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.709> can't<00:02:11.549> wait<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
to set this up so I can't wait to

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.789 
to set this up so I can't wait to
actually<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.810> probably<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.260> next<00:02:13.410> video

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
actually do it probably the next video

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:20.509 
actually do it probably the next video
will<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.269> on<00:02:15.470> my<00:02:16.730> MS<00:02:17.730> o<00:02:17.910> one<00:02:18.390> deidre<00:02:19.260> pro<00:02:19.650> build

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
will be on my MS o one deidre pro build

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.170 
will be on my MS o one deidre pro build
video<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.500> how<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.010> burped<00:02:23.489> car<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.030> what

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
video so just how I burped car and what

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.270 
video so just how I burped car and what
electronics<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:24.959> will<00:02:25.110> be<00:02:25.290> using<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.739> on<00:02:26.010> this

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
electronics I'm will be using on on this

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:44.580 
electronics I'm will be using on on this
car<00:02:36.500> all<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.709> we<00:02:38.130> are<00:02:38.220> actually<00:02:38.459> pretty<00:02:39.150> nice

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.760 

and<00:02:45.590> then<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.130> actually<00:02:46.520> ordered<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.770> separate

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
and then I actually ordered a separate

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.430 
and then I actually ordered a separate
aluminum<00:02:49.400> stirring<00:02:49.850> arm<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.210> heard<00:02:50.420> this<00:02:51.230> will

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
aluminum stirring arm I heard this will

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.620 
aluminum stirring arm I heard this will
actually<00:02:51.770> get<00:02:51.890> more<00:02:52.130> anger<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:52.880> I'm<00:02:53.180> gonna<00:02:53.420> try

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
actually get more anger so I'm gonna try

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.950 
actually get more anger so I'm gonna try
this<00:02:53.690> out<00:02:54.020> instead<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.530> stock<00:02:55.190> plastic<00:02:55.960> okay

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
this out instead of stock plastic okay

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.720 
this out instead of stock plastic okay
so<00:02:57.320> that's<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.650> only<00:02:57.890> thing<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.160> ordered<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.580> was

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
so that's the only thing I ordered I was

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.780 
so that's the only thing I ordered I was
gonna<00:02:58.820> get<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.350> carbon<00:03:00.350> fiber<00:03:00.680> lower<00:03:01.070> deck<00:03:01.400> but

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
gonna get a carbon fiber lower deck but

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.390 
gonna get a carbon fiber lower deck but
I<00:03:02.030> thought<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.780> lot<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.740> people<00:03:04.040> said<00:03:04.250> the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
I thought a lot of people said the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.950 
I thought a lot of people said the
mechanical<00:03:05.030> grip<00:03:05.300> is<00:03:05.480> better<00:03:05.690> than<00:03:05.870> the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
mechanical grip is better than the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.510 
mechanical grip is better than the
plastic<00:03:06.440> one<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:06.830> I'll<00:03:06.950> try<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.190> out<00:03:07.460> and

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
plastic one so I'll try that out and

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.040 
plastic one so I'll try that out and
then<00:03:07.880> maybe<00:03:08.060> in<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.330> future<00:03:08.510> I'll<00:03:08.720> get<00:03:08.900> the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
then maybe in the future I'll get the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:39.610 
then maybe in the future I'll get the
carbon<00:03:09.290> fiber<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:37.990> think<00:03:38.990> this<00:03:39.140> might<00:03:39.380> be<00:03:39.440> the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
carbon fiber I think this might be the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:59.170 
carbon fiber I think this might be the
front<00:03:40.040> one<00:03:40.340> way<00:03:44.410> turnbuckles<00:03:49.660> net<00:03:50.660> amount

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:22.460 

screws<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.510> pins<00:04:14.870> this<00:04:15.870> breaks<00:04:21.260> your<00:04:22.260> big

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
screws and pins this breaks your big

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:33.310 
screws and pins this breaks your big
dude<00:04:22.650> off<00:04:22.920> suspension<00:04:24.200> arms<00:04:28.940> battery<00:04:29.940> three

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:05:04.730 

links<00:05:01.220> here's<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.460> lower<00:05:02.690> lower<00:05:03.690> deck<00:05:04.020> so

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
links here's the lower lower deck so

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.090 
links here's the lower lower deck so
thin<00:05:05.190> so<00:05:05.630> will<00:05:06.630> be<00:05:06.810> interesting<00:05:07.560> putting<00:05:07.920> on

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
thin so will be interesting putting on

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.390 
thin so will be interesting putting on
the<00:05:08.700> Dalek<00:05:09.390> tonics<00:05:09.840> on<00:05:09.990> this<00:05:10.230> it's<00:05:11.130> pretty

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
the Dalek tonics on this it's pretty

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:22.060 
the Dalek tonics on this it's pretty
rigid<00:05:11.960> looks<00:05:12.960> like<00:05:13.170> good<00:05:13.320> plastic<00:05:18.200> antenna<00:05:20.060> to

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
rigid looks like good plastic antenna to

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.980 
rigid looks like good plastic antenna to
here's<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.370> carbon<00:05:23.790> fiber<00:05:24.410> upper<00:05:25.410> deck<00:05:26.600> so<00:05:27.600> I

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
here's the carbon fiber upper deck so I

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.350 
here's the carbon fiber upper deck so I
think<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.410> would<00:05:28.560> have<00:05:28.710> to<00:05:29.010> seal<00:05:29.760> it<00:05:29.940> off

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.750 

defining<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.510> last<00:05:33.780> thing<00:05:34.110> you<00:05:34.500> get<00:05:34.650> some<00:05:35.010> MST

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
defining the last thing you get some MST

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.690 
defining the last thing you get some MST
stickers<00:05:36.210> so<00:05:37.020> coming<00:05:37.440> up<00:05:37.590> will<00:05:37.800> be<00:05:38.040> probably<00:05:38.610> a

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700
