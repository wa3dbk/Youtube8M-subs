setting foot in a ring he couldn't let

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.570 
setting foot in a ring he couldn't let
the<00:05:20.510> disease<00:05:20.660> wins<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.890> for<00:05:22.070> me<00:05:22.190> it<00:05:22.340> was<00:05:22.400> the

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
the disease wins and for me it was the

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.090 
the disease wins and for me it was the
opposite<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.150> just<00:05:23.420> to<00:05:23.900> me<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.560> rink<00:05:24.800> was<00:05:24.920> my

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
opposite I just to me the rink was my

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.090 
opposite I just to me the rink was my
home<00:05:25.310> it<00:05:25.580> was<00:05:25.670> a<00:05:25.700> place<00:05:25.970> of<00:05:26.180> comfort<00:05:27.100> it's

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
home it was a place of comfort it's

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.560 
home it was a place of comfort it's
somewhere<00:05:28.520> where<00:05:28.700> I<00:05:28.730> feel<00:05:29.270> like<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.900> myself<00:05:31.570> and

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
so for me leaving the rink was never

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.960 
so for me leaving the rink was never
really<00:05:35.180> thought<00:05:36.080> about<00:05:36.140> it<00:05:37.010> was<00:05:37.490> more<00:05:37.760> of<00:05:37.790> a
