00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:14.059
 I said earlier far from any 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.910
 type of polemic sentence if someone searches 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.810
 the controversy this time those much 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.550
 for example I say instead what I think 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.500
 I say a good game has been played 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.050
 that we would definitely have deserved train 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.029
 to win even with the goal difference 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.100
 we questioned the product and they suffered 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.200
 a shot parried by Amelia in the four 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.870
 there were ten spellings in the 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.650
 construction site in the door mirror from 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.020
 part of the milan 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.239
 we have so many of those situations that 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.690
 3 against 3 incredible time 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.150
 so it was a game that this group 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.600
 how well deserved is a victory that 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.820
 would have gratified the audience was 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.530
 absolutely beautiful tonight would have 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.500
 ratified the company but above all 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.990
 would make player gratified 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.850
 so the regret I said earlier 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.520
 time colleagues that there is a further 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.479
 regret because what happened 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.790
 in the end and I do not enter into the first one 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.530
 penalty goal I'm not talking about these 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.820
 almost are things about football and injuries 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.010
 therefore should be accepted discusses the fact 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.340
 which by regulation I sincerely do not 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.810
 I'm so convinced that with a player 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.970
 on the ground for two minutes 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.149
 we are changing but there is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.350
 turnover we feel the change with the 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.060
 engine is ready to enter 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.560
 expect the ball rejected because 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.600
 regulations to wait for the gym 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.740
 and the moment the ball comes out 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.869
 that we have the right to do 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.970
 enter our player to play 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.650
 in 11 but from the fact that the rates 30 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.220
 seconds at the end is a detail 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.960
 and this is what I say love and I say 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.799
 also that if by chance a player does not 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.570
 had it been ready I believe that too 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.460
 this I do not know silk regulation but 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.500
 I hope a player on the ground a 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.409
 resume the game 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.240
 a player lying on the ground 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.340
 message to check again if 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.989
 the gravity of the accident to put 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.090
 one recovered does not tend but wants 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.790
 must complain, better vote with 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.100
 the andria yes and instead is not as I have 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.860
 said Monday we didn't do the 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.690
 meeting they showed me the goal of 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.690
 bergamo clear seriously to regulate 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.930
 explained that it was irregular not to do 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.849
 game but to hinder the goalkeeper 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.920
 so I was looking for a physical contact then 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.090
 it was seriously we do casuistry 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.070
 I think that what happened 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.510
 this prepares case studies because 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.940
 it never happened to me at the series level 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.560
 c1 quickly beating against the current 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.970
 just to enter with a player a 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.760
 land and a player is played on the ground 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.460
 until it has taken the launch 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.310
 sincerely this strength to soccer does not 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.920
 I know I never saw a thing 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.810
 therefore says too much maybe all of you 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.120
 in the regulation there is a quirk that 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.500
 say these fateful together 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.300
 if there is this I apologize in 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.280
 advance a question I make 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.370
 controversial minister i'm just looking 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.690
 to understand why something happened 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.660
 of this type 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.610
 then if I can change the player 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.340
 injured the Milan makes three goals the Milan 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.800
 wins deservedly thought good at doing 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.810
 three days in the last 30 seconds and us 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.050
 we take note, however, only players 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.200
 in the field as our website 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.760
 so this leaves a little to dent 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.830
 I repeat if today we as I said the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.480
 fellow maximum I say unidelta 9 points 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.270
 for what we did a 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.640
 bergamo we have 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.910
 I throw those who are not at sea 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.090
 having won for charity if it were not there 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.530
 been that goal probably can 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.480
 maybe we would not have had 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.550
 surely we would have won 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:59.700
 this means that from 3 to 6 points of 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.230
 difference or so this 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.530
 would mean at the ranking level 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.940
 an important two night standings 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.890
 points of view together with the point of 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.620
 bergano we have to talk about the three points that 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.090
 sausages were already acquired but leaves 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.970
 stand the point of bergamo that can 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.980
 the acquiree happens a little tonight 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.980
 so it seems to me that 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.030
 to confirm that the church therefore the 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.540
 necessity is made of non-declarations 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.550
 made of proclamations but made of work 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.840
 in the field when it is free 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.260
 this is an absolutely group 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.970
 positive and purposeful that he wants 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.620
 work to carve out a space there 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.540
 I say because I see them worked John 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.600
 today they would have deserved absolutely in the 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.400
 sure gratification that yes 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.320
 we had prepared it because we during 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.350
 the sunny week we prepare the 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.040
 games 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.590
 we do not rely on chance but we go to 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.480
 analyze all situations 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.450
 that is, he could do those things because 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.880
 we who were that space not by chance 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.620
 that changed the other times you can't 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.540
 do that because there is no space for it 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.900
 do it and then we have to do other things 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.050
 so that's why I say they would 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.050
 organized 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.740
 the victory to be gratified for 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.990
 were careful to calculate that the 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.180
 milan first shot he did he looked 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.219
 we said 2 to 0 to 7 from three minutes from 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.039
 end here therefore that finally delivers 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:30.020
 deserved so it seems difficult 86 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:34.080
 against four bars well it is a bit start 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.930
 bad that the friend on the way 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:41.759
 in Milan last year I won and it has me 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.590
 explained that so many things I said tonight 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.870
 to him to Gallians better to you than to 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.699
 others to this gift and that there will be 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.680
 we radovic got injured 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.259
 lucky patrols looking lucky 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.430
 we have an injured mother then 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.710
 expect to sell injured too 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.080
 it hurts them and she replaced them for that 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.939
 no because there were 10 of them a quarter of an hour 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.669
 in the end we said more to 0 by now not 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:03.810
 there was more need than they can bring to 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.550
 home the result what we were 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.550
 French if it is allowed now
