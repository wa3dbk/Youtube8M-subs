so<00:00:05.279> we've<00:00:05.549> just<00:00:05.580> been<00:00:05.879> demonstrating<00:00:06.890> uses<00:00:07.890> of

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
so we've just been demonstrating uses of

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.459 
so we've just been demonstrating uses of
the<00:00:08.550> three<00:00:08.820> types<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.389> masks<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.840> basic<00:00:10.290> the

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
the three types of masks the basic the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.039 
the three types of masks the basic the
intermediate<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.250> advanced<00:00:11.550> masks

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
intermediate and the advanced masks

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.020 
intermediate and the advanced masks
firstly<00:00:13.049> with<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.679> basic<00:00:14.429> masks<00:00:14.639> we<00:00:14.910> were

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
firstly with the basic masks we were

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.570 
firstly with the basic masks we were
looking<00:00:15.330> at<00:00:15.480> provoking<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.830> creating<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.400> very

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
looking at provoking so creating a very

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.790 
looking at provoking so creating a very
simple<00:00:17.940> character<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:18.600> use<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.140> there's<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
simple character we use the there's the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.650 
simple character we use the there's the
sad<00:00:20.039> mask<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> basic<00:00:21.210> mask<00:00:21.390> they've

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
sad mask with the basic mask they've

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.500 
sad mask with the basic mask they've
basically<00:00:21.840> got<00:00:22.109> one<00:00:22.890> emotion<00:00:23.730> written<00:00:24.390> on

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
basically got one emotion written on

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.029 
basically got one emotion written on
them<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.930> they're<00:00:25.260> very<00:00:25.289> accessible

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
them and they're very accessible

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.120 
them and they're very accessible

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
then looked at the intermediate mask and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.300 
then looked at the intermediate mask and
these<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.110> fantastic<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.680> looking<00:01:14.130> how<00:01:14.250> you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
these are fantastic for looking how you

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.810 
these are fantastic for looking how you
might<00:01:14.580> start<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.450> devise<00:01:15.780> again<00:01:16.640> these<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
might start to devise again these are a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.010 
might start to devise again these are a
little<00:01:17.939> bit<00:01:18.030> more<00:01:18.119> complex<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.780> they're<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> bit

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
little bit more complex so they're a bit

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.370 
little bit more complex so they're a bit
more<00:01:19.820> human<00:01:20.820> looking<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.330> they've<00:01:21.780> got<00:01:21.990> more

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
more human looking and they've got more

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.719 
more human looking and they've got more
than<00:01:22.500> one<00:01:22.650> emotion<00:01:22.890> written<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.400> them<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.670> you

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
than one emotion written on them but you

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.140 
than one emotion written on them but you
can<00:01:23.880> still<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.680> sad<00:01:26.250> mask<00:01:26.790> in

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
can still see that this is a sad mask in

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.600 
can still see that this is a sad mask in
a<00:01:27.240> way<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.689> what<00:01:28.590> we've<00:01:28.740> been<00:01:28.770> doing<00:01:29.280> is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
a way and what we've been doing is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.899 
a way and what we've been doing is
working<00:01:30.329> with<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.320> colleague<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
working with a colleague and the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
colleague actually helps you to create a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.249 
colleague actually helps you to create a
character<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:36.479> great<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> character<00:01:37.079> history

character it's great a character history
by<00:01:37.680> studying<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.400> mask<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.900> then<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:41.119> one<00:01:42.119> of

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
by studying the mask and then the one of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.749 
by studying the mask and then the one of
the<00:01:42.270> actors<00:01:42.540> narrates<00:01:42.960> their<00:01:43.680> story<00:01:44.070> while

the other one will be acting in the mask

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.819 
the other one will be acting in the mask

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
using the intermediate mask and it's

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.609 
using the intermediate mask and it's
really<00:01:54.210> all<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.720> thought<00:01:54.960> process<00:01:55.409> and
