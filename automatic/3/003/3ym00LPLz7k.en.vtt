to balance the game as a result of that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.970 
to balance the game as a result of that
you<00:01:00.750> know<00:01:00.870> when<00:01:00.989> Saints<00:01:01.380> for<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.649> third<00:01:01.829> we

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
you know when Saints for the third we

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
you know when Saints for the third we
took<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.219> up<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> 11<00:01:02.790> so<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.180> Saints<00:01:03.570> Row<00:01:03.660> 4<00:01:03.690> they

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
took it up to 11 so on Saints Row 4 they

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
took it up to 11 so on Saints Row 4 they
want<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> take<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.739> 13<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.399> so<00:01:05.640> we

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
want to take it up to 13 and so we

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.580 
want to take it up to 13 and so we
really<00:01:06.360> can't<00:01:06.719> just<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:07.020> regular<00:01:07.200> gangs

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
really can't just have regular gangs

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.109 
really can't just have regular gangs
even<00:01:07.950> if<00:01:08.040> they're<00:01:08.159> wearing<00:01:08.310> Mexican<00:01:08.759> wrestler

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.789 
even if they're wearing Mexican wrestler
masks<00:01:09.479> we've<00:01:09.689> got<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.930> go<00:01:10.020> even<00:01:10.170> further<00:01:10.439> so

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
masks we've got to go even further so

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
masks we've got to go even further so
I've<00:01:10.890> got<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> aliens<00:01:11.610> oh<00:01:11.930> you<00:01:14.569> having<00:01:15.569> aliens

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990

in<00:01:16.200> Saints<00:01:16.469> Row<00:01:16.590> 4<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:17.219> allowed<00:01:17.579> us<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
in Saints Row 4 really allowed us to

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.789 
in Saints Row 4 really allowed us to
expand<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.659> these<00:01:18.869> crazy<00:01:19.200> weapons<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.709> were

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
expand on these crazy weapons that were

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.190 
expand on these crazy weapons that were
known<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.249> so<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:21.179> we<00:01:21.359> didn't<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.659> aliens<00:01:22.079> we

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
known for so if we didn't have aliens we

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.719 
known for so if we didn't have aliens we
probably<00:01:22.439> wouldn't<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.799> able<00:01:22.889> to<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> black

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729

the rectifier one of our lead animators

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.180 
the rectifier one of our lead animators
had<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.390> idea<00:01:38.660> to<00:01:38.690> put<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:39.170> tongue<00:01:39.530> inside<00:01:39.980> the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
had the idea to put a tongue inside the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.890 
had the idea to put a tongue inside the
tip<00:01:40.400> of<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.730> when<00:01:41.120> it<00:01:41.240> opens<00:01:41.510> up<00:01:41.630> there's<00:01:41.840> a

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
tip of it when it opens up there's a

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.360 
tip of it when it opens up there's a
tongue<00:01:42.170> inside<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.650> that's<00:01:42.710> wiggling<00:01:43.250> all

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
tongue inside and that's wiggling all

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.130 
tongue inside and that's wiggling all
around<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.000> after<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.300> created<00:01:44.690> that<00:01:44.930> he

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
around so after I created that he

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.830 
around so after I created that he
animated<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.340> grouse<00:01:46.760> himself<00:01:47.240> out<00:01:47.420> so

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
animated it and grouse himself out so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.590 
animated it and grouse himself out so
