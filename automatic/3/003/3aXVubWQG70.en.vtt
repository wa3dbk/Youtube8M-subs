 two months with the support of the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.850

 and patrick perret patrick emmanuel 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.309
 hello how the idea of ​​equipping the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.530
 sellers of a tablet it's she 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.460
 materialized we had the opportunity to 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.290
 visit 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.629
 microsoft business innovation center and 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.220
 to exchange with people who 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.610
 work in this center 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.600
 we were seduced by their dynamism 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.140
 professionalism they knew us 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.360
 to convince 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.100
 on one side that the project was feasible 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.570
 from them and therefore train us 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.880
 also because our side we had 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.280
 also a lot to treat 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.320
 these windows 8 that equip your tablets 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.930
 why choose this bone is 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.610
 windows and windows it's still 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.070
 In most cases, it is at least 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.690
 bake the operating system that 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.149
 allows you to rotate the set of 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.830
 our windows 8 applications is access 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:42.009
 to mobility with the perpetuation the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.970
 maintaining our existing applications 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.160
 you have developed an application 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.690
 specific for your stores and you 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.250
 did it with microsoft services iis 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.960
 already we have chosen to develop a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.630
 application so that 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.670
 ergonomics is perfectly adapted to 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.380
 the sale in a shop 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.569
 we worked from microsoft who brought 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.119
 all this dimension design of 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.600
 the application and all this dimension 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.399
 ergonomic navigation and on this plane 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.079
 really microsoft was completely the 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.549
 height thank you patrick so for better 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.869
 understand how the tablet fits 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.489
 in the sales process 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.260
 I suggest you listen to laurence 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.610
 scherpereel the first needs it was 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.019
 to have information that they are 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.690
 sure the coolest possible this 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.340
 that today we are only to manage so we 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.600
 manages them like fresh food 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.100
 we actually put tools 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.030
 dead in the understanding of our 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.030
 services it's a real tool 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.350
 optimization for sale because of 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.820
 dance is the seller will be able if the 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.830
 customize according to the streams of 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.750
 his universe back with emmanuel and 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.830
 patrick emmanuel i turn to you 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.780
 what were the functional needs 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.150
 of the application the main goal 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.970
 was to be able to accompany the sale 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.500
 for sellers in this context there 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.780
 will have given complementary tools 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.820
 for example we gave them the price and 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.640
 the live stock we gave them 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.170
 also to burst products that their 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.210
 have made it possible to support their 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.370
 speeches of two months were enough to 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.830
 develop this deep concept it's very 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.170
 short yes actually we worked 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.490
 in agile method and in fact it has us 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.040
 allowed to follow the course of a 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.600
 standard project but accelerated 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.400
 the teams of microsoft services 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.780
 had come onsite this agile method 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.360
 allowed us to work directly 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.280
 on the store where we had the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.720
 developers who were directly at 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.510
 side of the sellers and that allowed them 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.190
 to be able to adapt exactly to their 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.630
 specifications to finish with this 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.130
 development component what were the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.030
 strengths of the relationship with 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.980
 microsoft services 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.780
 our interlocutors quickly understood 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.370
 in fact our business needs I think 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.090
 that there is a mobilization of teams 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.770
 very strong 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.720
 on both sides which allowed to 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.490
 arrive in two months a little word on the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.050
 material that has been used and that is 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.430
 available for eh salespeople 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.920
 well we took a tablet 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.480
 samsung slate this series 7 what are 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.490
 Impacts on the information system 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.800
 of deploying these tablets side dsi 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.000
 it was not neutral either, even if we 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.320
 reused a lot of things that 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.690
 already existed in our infrastructure 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.400
 on the other hand, new 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.050
 web services with the s400 what we do not 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.660
 did not know how to do it so far 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.250
 allowed to increase our potential thank you 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.900
 manual now let's see what about 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.070
 on the ground that improve our 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.140
 relationship with our customers have chosen 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.410
 together this tool also allows 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.980
 to optimize our sales both in the 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.060
 product but also in everything that is 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.310
 satellite to products I think about 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.720
 accessories I think of service 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.840
 obviously I consult my stocks 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.130
 mainly for 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.449
 to tell my customer if he produces 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.830
 is available immediately if he can 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.630
 to prevail because today 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.830
 to be very responsive the customer wants everything from 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.510
 following his product and it's very 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.780
 important for me to know 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.940
 information the services also the 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.320
 contracts of guarantee repairs 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.680
 possible of a font because that 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.210
 cost 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.430
 these little details again that 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.440
 make the difference and win 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.120
 on the sale so far what balance sheet is this 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.760
 that you can draw from the project 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.130
 overall very positive very good

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.100
 dedicated application to all 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.139
 bakers sellers however the project 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.000
 is already a success confirming the 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.160
 microsoft service consulting capability 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.600
