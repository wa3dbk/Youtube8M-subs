00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 is 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.169
 Hello today I want to be a possibility which programs 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.839
 So the first exam was placed in the Quick Launch bar 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:16.370
 speaks 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.640
 Things here like this line can start looking faster now what you can do now 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.170
 a quick start can be good 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.750
 If now in the fast city bar as a link in it are closer to the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.100
 the editor Klinger trusts and the appropriate program is there for the 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.489
 Circumstances here on all programs 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.350
 Accessories and gedieh met click so that will be a few clicks 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.019
 like one or the other too much 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.749
 that's why you could do it more theoretically in the 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:41.360
 quickly stood 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.830
 as a link so faster start now it works 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.510
 not yet another option that you can do with the keyboard so 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.360
 to start a program faster 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.230
 which is in the quick launch bar in it 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.260
 how it works is quite simple, we simply have to pay 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.360
 to the corresponding positions 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.850
 here the once here the 2 3 4 5 and so on 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.950
 So now I want to tell her the and because start the calculator 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.950
 so now on the keyboard, the windows button and the corresponding remain 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.700
 Number, then 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.479
 Editorial if here 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.430
 Windows and 4 and there he would be 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.350
 Mom the same with the calculator 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.470
 Press Windows key and m 5 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.790
 and that the calculator and so on and so forth 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.810
 So in principle, everything goes if you say yes, but I have none 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.580
 Line go but I have a second his second go 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.200
 say so 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.550
 but a little bit closer to me looks like this 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.080
 Dante is basically no difference they just have to 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.910
 as they also write left to right samples down the whole thing too 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.730
 imagine again speak 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.790
 3 and methods continue 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.570
 5 6 they did 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.570
 what need again for the Aldi Tor 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.790
 windows button and 4 thus again tailwind effects 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.830
 and there is our editor because computer Trabelsi guess correctly Windows 5 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.540
 against refers simply 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.250
 and theoretically could that one not only go to the new if that is 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.719
 We can test a bit for the new one 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.749
 I will just add them to any program or especially I will 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.829
 that they will be a little bit longer 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.379
 So what do you take their Windows Movie Maker 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.489
 they just come in 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.059
 Create bafflement and so on 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.229
 therefore create link 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:30.489
 Extras in April between single not good but games in Kreuth 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.859
 Create baffling his moved perfectly 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.499
 So sitting w8 for this we also have to take 2 belong to it still 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.339
 WordPad will create link here 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:43.170
 but 9 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.709
 always something 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.649
 backup and restore 10 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:49.709
 good family 10 1 1 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.340
 and the poles are now practically on the keyboard, so to speak 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.270
 the never with it just times the number 9 for the Virtual XP important always on it 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.270
 Point will be so theoretically can also be expected for that 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.790
 work windows button and new dead 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.019
 and here comes the Wildbad 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.120
 but now we have to or salsa we have to still we want this 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.299
 secure and restore part 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.499
 get to us and now we just do Windows and 0 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.649
 and what happens 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:19.259
 the part comes that means the new form is going to see that once 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:24.399
 if I would theoretically add an eleventh part here now 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.029
 we 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:26.459
 Painter you do not either 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.819
 and I here now twice the once proclaiming the 1 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.669
 does not work 11 so does not work because Windows and 1 what would that be 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.839
 if everyone is looking very carefully 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:38.260
 Show desktop 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.369
 so that's not possible you can do a maximum of ten characters 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:45.169
 Relationships 10 keyboard shortcuts call the same 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.499
 standing behind each other 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.420
 that is, I saw the 0 there 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.420
 then acts practically all scenes when calling again 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.500
 Dr Paint what sure Cell Pharm did not work 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.989
 There are also programs that would have other key combinations 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.109
 can set 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.879
 but the Meda external programs and that brings Windows with so the function 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.629
 Windows and any number works 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.379
 without installing any other program 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.419
 be noted here that the whole does not work with the numeric keypad so 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.720
 she dared string 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.850
 work with the numbers above the letters 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.550
 if the ten times lured in the room the 4 for the editor he presses like that 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.150
 Windows and 4 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.210
 nothing works 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.939
 it does not work even when the AMNOG is switched off 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.460
 there it can only be 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.860
 with these 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.469
 Numbers over the butt died working 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:38.529
 and as I said the whole works similar even if you have one here 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.370
 spits the ca TAS bar have 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.860
 So you understand the whole again, he collects everything from each other simply from 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.999
 from left to right 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.509
 number and then start down again 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.330
 then the whole thing is more money, there is not only until 10 o'clock at the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.539
 Watches here act as ten 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.270
 from where should you have questions then you write us either via e-mail 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.999
 or 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.999
 You simply write them in the forum under the corresponding 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.449
 or category 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.449
 In principle, that was it until the next video 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.189
 Marlon Jost 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.499
 on 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:21.960
 USD 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.960
 Mainz 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.050
 August threatens 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.819
 This is
