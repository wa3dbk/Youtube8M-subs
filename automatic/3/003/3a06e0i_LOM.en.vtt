00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
project rip whether the true

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.830 
project rip whether the true
to<00:00:42.660> me<00:00:42.840> there<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.730> there<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.760> none<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.570> very

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
to me there is there is none of a very

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.600 
to me there is there is none of a very
different<00:00:46.290> approach<00:00:46.410> between<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.220> night<00:00:47.430> out

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
different approach between the night out

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.870 
different approach between the night out
and<00:00:47.910> hey<00:00:48.450> now<00:00:48.630> for<00:00:48.870> example<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> even<00:00:49.860> if<00:00:50.100> ya

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
and hey now for example if it even if ya

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.510 
and hey now for example if it even if ya
maybe<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.960> night<00:00:52.140> outs<00:00:52.320> bit<00:00:52.650> more<00:00:52.860> mellow<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
maybe the night outs bit more mellow and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.360 
maybe the night outs bit more mellow and
and<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.240> of<00:00:54.420> course<00:00:54.450> it's<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and so of course it's it's not like the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.790 
and so of course it's it's not like the
big<00:00:56.940> mainstream<00:00:57.600> banger<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.530> you're<00:00:58.680> going

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
big mainstream banger that you're going

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.280 
big mainstream banger that you're going
to<00:00:58.860> play<00:00:59.360> in<00:01:00.360> the<00:01:00.450> middle<00:01:00.720> of<00:01:00.840> all<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
to play in the middle of all the

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.200 
to play in the middle of all the
festival<00:01:01.800> set<00:01:02.040> but<00:01:02.370> some<00:01:02.610> people<00:01:02.880> say<00:01:03.059> that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
festival set but some people say that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.820

they recognize when I play in some of
mine<00:01:05.040> they<00:01:05.220> recognize<00:01:05.670> some<00:01:05.910> stuff<00:01:06.180> because

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
mine they recognize some stuff because

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.000 
mine they recognize some stuff because
of<00:01:06.570> course<00:01:06.780> there<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:06.990> some<00:01:07.290> some<00:01:07.530> production

of course there are some some production

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.280 
of course there are some some production
tricks<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.400> guess<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.820> shares<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.140> are

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
tricks I guess I shares then that are

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.780 
tricks I guess I shares then that are
common<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> different<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> different

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
test of all the energy get has to be

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.029 
test of all the energy get has to be
very<00:04:17.910> high<00:04:18.150> has<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.600> go<00:04:18.690> there<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.199> course<00:04:19.590> but

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
very high has to go there of course but

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.420 
very high has to go there of course but
of<00:04:20.160> course<00:04:20.400> you're<00:04:20.789> right<00:04:20.820> what's<00:04:21.419> what's

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
of course you're right what's what's

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.670 
of course you're right what's what's
if<00:04:23.789> I<00:04:23.970> can<00:04:24.150> change<00:04:24.389> what<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.380> great<00:04:25.650> thing

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
if I can change what the great thing

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.040 
if I can change what the great thing
that<00:04:26.220> may<00:04:26.610> have<00:04:26.759> may<00:04:26.970> have<00:04:27.000> done<00:04:27.330> is<00:04:27.509> to<00:04:27.960> have

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
that may have may have done is to have

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.820 
that may have may have done is to have
more<00:04:28.289> diversity<00:04:28.889> in<00:04:29.009> one<00:04:29.850> set<00:04:30.750> yeah<00:04:31.169> also<00:04:31.590> when

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
more diversity in one set yeah also when

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.120 
more diversity in one set yeah also when
to<00:04:32.160> go<00:04:32.310> from<00:04:32.580> low<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.150> high<00:04:33.449> and<00:04:34.100> actually<00:04:35.100> I

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
to go from low to high and actually I

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.219 
to go from low to high and actually I
think<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.490> best<00:04:35.970> DJs<00:04:36.449> they<00:04:36.690> managed<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.050> do

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
think the best DJs they managed to do

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.650 
think the best DJs they managed to do
that<00:04:37.259> right<00:04:37.440> now<00:04:37.680> sure<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.360> think<00:04:39.600> with

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
that right now sure and I think with

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.909 
that right now sure and I think with
yourself<00:04:39.960> like<00:04:40.080> you<00:04:40.110> took<00:04:40.289> you<00:04:40.440> took<00:04:40.620> out<00:04:40.770> one
