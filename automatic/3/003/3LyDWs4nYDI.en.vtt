my first led review and the synchronous
arguably<00:00:16.020> one<00:00:16.169> of<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> first<00:00:16.529> digital

shortly<00:00:21.449> after<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.259> Pulsar<00:00:23.249> p1<00:00:23.669> and<00:00:23.970> although

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
shortly after the Pulsar p1 and although

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.439 
shortly after the Pulsar p1 and although
there<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.199> some<00:00:25.939> debate<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.089> it<00:00:27.210> might<00:00:27.329> have

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
there is some debate that it might have

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.700 
there is some debate that it might have
actually<00:00:27.599> been<00:00:27.839> available<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.409> prototype

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
actually been available in prototype

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.040 
actually been available in prototype
form<00:00:28.859> before<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.640> one<00:00:29.789> anyway<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
form before that one anyway this is a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.020 
form before that one anyway this is a
mark<00:00:31.619> 3<00:00:31.769> which<00:00:32.040> one<00:00:32.220> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.340> later<00:00:32.520> versions

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
mark 3 which one of the later versions

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.460 
mark 3 which one of the later versions
and<00:00:33.240> this<00:00:33.330> particular<00:00:33.600> one<00:00:33.840> actually<00:00:34.140> has<00:00:34.440> a

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
and this particular one actually has a

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.920 
and this particular one actually has a
replacement<00:00:35.160> later<00:00:35.550> module<00:00:35.940> pile<00:00:36.240> just<00:00:36.450> show

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
replacement later module pile just show

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.350 
replacement later module pile just show
you<00:00:36.990> the<00:00:37.200> features<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.830> the<00:00:37.950> watch<00:00:38.150> so<00:00:39.150> on<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
you the features of the watch so on the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.760 
you the features of the watch so on the
top<00:00:39.540> there<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.900> can<00:00:40.050> see<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.650> actually

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
top there you can see this is actually

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.170 
top there you can see this is actually
the<00:00:41.400> solar<00:00:42.120> panel<00:00:42.770> which<00:00:44.150> recharges<00:00:45.150> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the solar panel which recharges the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.420 
the solar panel which recharges the
batteries<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:45.900> the<00:00:45.990> watch<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.160> actual

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
batteries for the watch and the actual

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.510 
batteries for the watch and the actual
display<00:00:47.730> itself<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:48.960> side<00:00:49.860> front<00:00:50.220> of

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
display itself is on the side front of

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.350 
display itself is on the side front of
the<00:00:50.580> watch<00:00:50.790> thing<00:00:51.060> and<00:00:52.700> you<00:00:53.700> can<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:53.970> it's<00:00:54.180> got

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the watch thing and you can see it's got

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.320 
the watch thing and you can see it's got
these<00:00:54.480> sliders<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.740> the<00:00:55.860> side<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.820> operate<00:00:57.240> the

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
these sliders on the side to operate the

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.600 
these sliders on the side to operate the
functions<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:57.990> reason<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.370> it's<00:00:59.370> got

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
functions and the reason is it's got

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.400 
functions and the reason is it's got
those<00:00:59.790> is<00:01:00.060> because<00:01:00.330> there's<00:01:00.600> actually<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
those is because there's actually the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.389 
those is because there's actually the
module<00:01:01.710> itself<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.190> black<00:01:02.880> bit<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.810> bottom

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
module itself is black bit on the bottom

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.249 
module itself is black bit on the bottom
and<00:01:05.399> all<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> plastic<00:01:06.359> bits<00:01:06.719> is<00:01:06.899> a<00:01:06.929> sealed

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
and all the plastic bits is a sealed

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.459 
and all the plastic bits is a sealed
module<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.100> these<00:01:08.700> sliders<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.869> magnets<00:01:10.350> on

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
module and these sliders have magnets on

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.440 
module and these sliders have magnets on
them<00:01:10.679> which<00:01:10.799> actually<00:01:11.009> operate<00:01:11.490> switches

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
them which actually operate switches

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.340 
them which actually operate switches
within<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.899> watch<00:01:13.049> itself<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.539> so<00:01:15.539> the<00:01:15.719> field

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
within the watch itself and so the field

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
within the watch itself and so the field
module<00:01:16.740> together<00:01:17.069> with<00:01:17.270> originally<00:01:18.270> would

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
module together with originally would

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840 
module together with originally would
have<00:01:18.479> had<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.719> gel<00:01:19.679> filling<00:01:20.100> made<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.490> both

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
have had a gel filling made it both

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.559 
have had a gel filling made it both
water<00:01:21.149> and<00:01:21.409> shockproof<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:24.270> also<00:01:24.390> a

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
water and shockproof it's also a

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.719 
water and shockproof it's also a
stainless<00:01:25.499> steel<00:01:25.530> case<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.340> along<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.579> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
stainless steel case and along with the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.239 
stainless steel case and along with the
rechargeable<00:01:27.240> batteries<00:01:27.719> it<00:01:28.469> really<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.859> you

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
rechargeable batteries it really is you

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.629 
rechargeable batteries it really is you
know<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.399> watch<00:01:29.639> designed<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.299> life<00:01:31.639> anyway

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:32.639 
know a watch designed for life anyway

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:35.359 
know a watch designed for life anyway
here<00:01:33.539> are<00:01:33.569> the<00:01:33.659> functions<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.859> slide<00:01:35.159> this

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
here are the functions you slide this

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.940 
here are the functions you slide this
one<00:01:35.549> back<00:01:35.789> and<00:01:36.659> that'll<00:01:37.350> show<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> time

forward and that shows you the date

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.679 
forward and that shows you the date
that's<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.990> 21st<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.560> March<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.979> once<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.689> you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
that's the 21st of March at once and you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.749 
that's the 21st of March at once and you
slide<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.350> left<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.709> forward<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.340> that's

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
slide the left one forward and that's

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.399 
slide the left one forward and that's
showing<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.179> day<00:01:51.389> and<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:51.780> also<00:01:51.929> counting

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
showing the day and it's also counting

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.209 
showing the day and it's also counting
up<00:01:52.499> the<00:01:52.530> seconds<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.590> slide<00:01:55.889> it<00:01:56.009> back

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
up the seconds and if you slide it back

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.660 
up the seconds and if you slide it back
it's<00:01:56.579> showing<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> two<00:01:57.299> there<00:01:57.600> which<00:01:57.959> is<00:01:58.670> that

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
it's showing the two there which is that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.669 
it's showing the two there which is that
too<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.299> think<00:02:00.359> it's<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> sort<00:02:01.319> of<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.499> the

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
too is I think it's the sort of in the

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.260 
too is I think it's the sort of in the
year<00:02:01.889> in<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> four<00:02:02.429> year<00:02:02.609> cycle<00:02:02.789> of<00:02:03.060> leap

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
year in the four year cycle of leap

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.279 
year in the four year cycle of leap
years<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:06.240> other<00:02:06.389> number<00:02:06.569> they<00:02:06.840> are<00:02:06.869> 0<00:02:07.200> 0

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
years and that other number they are 0 0

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.949 
years and that other number they are 0 0

can have it that's American format with
a<00:02:48.569> month<00:02:48.750> first<00:02:49.019> but<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.440> can<00:02:49.560> set<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:49.860> be

European format of the day first and
then<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.440> month<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:53.329> you<00:02:54.329> can<00:02:54.450> also<00:02:54.569> choose

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
then the month and you can also choose

then the month and you can also choose
whether<00:02:55.079> to<00:02:55.140> have<00:02:55.200> leading<00:02:55.620> zeros<00:02:55.980> or<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.250> I

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
whether to have leading zeros or that I

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.800 
whether to have leading zeros or that I
haven't<00:02:56.640> got<00:02:56.730> leading<00:02:57.030> zeros<00:02:57.329> there<00:02:57.540> and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
haven't got leading zeros there and

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.870 
haven't got leading zeros there and
finally<00:02:58.739> for<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.010> day<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.340> week<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.760> can

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
finally for the day of the week you can

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.819 
finally for the day of the week you can
select<00:03:00.329> which<00:03:00.630> language<00:03:00.660> either<00:03:01.230> English

French<00:03:02.250> or<00:03:02.400> German<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.480> very<00:03:03.720> nice

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
French or German so it's a very nice

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.650 
French or German so it's a very nice
additions<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.430> their<00:03:05.640> own<00:03:05.940> one<00:03:06.239> last<00:03:06.450> function

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
additions to their own one last function

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.830 
additions to their own one last function
and<00:03:07.110> if<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.500> pull<00:03:07.680> both<00:03:07.860> sliders<00:03:08.280> back<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.840> it

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
and if you pull both sliders back and it

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.830 
and if you pull both sliders back and it
does<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.880> cancel<00:03:11.880> on<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.120> second<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.690> if<00:03:12.750> you

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
does that cancel on a second and if you

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.539 
does that cancel on a second and if you
slide<00:03:13.079> on<00:03:13.110> them<00:03:13.380> off<00:03:13.500> it'll<00:03:13.709> stop<00:03:13.920> at<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.430> next

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
slide on them off it'll stop at the next

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.009 
slide on them off it'll stop at the next
minute<00:03:15.889> so<00:03:16.889> that's<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:18.000> here<00:03:18.389> syncing<00:03:18.900> our
