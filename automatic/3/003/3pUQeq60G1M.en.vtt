just a paint program running on windows
7<00:00:41.810> and<00:00:42.080> as<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.220> go<00:00:43.460> through<00:00:43.490> and<00:00:43.850> I<00:00:43.940> just<00:00:44.150> draw

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
7 and as I go through and I just draw

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.450 
7 and as I go through and I just draw
with<00:00:44.870> my<00:00:44.960> finger<00:00:45.350> I<00:00:45.530> can<00:00:46.040> draw<00:00:46.220> with<00:00:46.400> the

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
with my finger I can draw with the

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.310 
with my finger I can draw with the
second<00:00:46.820> finger<00:00:47.120> your<00:00:47.510> job<00:00:47.780> with<00:00:47.870> multiple

second finger your job with multiple

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.260 
second finger your job with multiple
fingers<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.370> can<00:00:49.400> start<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:49.730> see<00:00:49.850> how<00:00:50.210> you

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
fingers and you can start to see how you

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.940 
fingers and you can start to see how you
might<00:00:50.480> interact<00:00:50.930> a<00:00:51.260> little<00:00:51.380> bit<00:00:51.620> differently

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
might interact a little bit differently

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.020 
might interact a little bit differently
with<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.250> computer<00:00:52.550> that<00:00:52.700> you've<00:00:52.790> done<00:00:52.940> in

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
with the computer that you've done in

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.270 
with the computer that you've done in
the<00:00:53.060> past<00:00:53.150> so<00:00:53.660> well<00:00:54.530> what<00:00:54.860> I'm<00:00:54.950> running<00:00:55.190> on

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
the past so well what I'm running on

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.910 
the past so well what I'm running on
here<00:00:55.550> right<00:00:55.940> here<00:00:56.180> is<00:00:56.329> a<00:00:56.360> dell<00:00:56.690> latitude<00:00:57.440> xt

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
here right here is a dell latitude xt

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.080 
here right here is a dell latitude xt
and<00:00:58.100> this<00:00:58.220> machine<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:58.670> actually<00:00:58.970> available

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
and this machine is actually available

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.720 
and this machine is actually available
in<00:00:59.690> market<00:00:59.810> today<00:01:00.110> and<00:01:00.470> it<00:01:00.590> does<00:01:00.770> single<00:01:01.520> touch

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
in market today and it does single touch

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.030 
in market today and it does single touch
and<00:01:02.030> a<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:02.989> this<00:01:03.110> is<00:01:03.170> an<00:01:03.350> evolution<00:01:03.920> of

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
and a and so this is an evolution of

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.079 
and a and so this is an evolution of
what<00:01:04.159> we've<00:01:04.280> done<00:01:04.400> in<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.610> past<00:01:04.759> with<00:01:05.000> our

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
what we've done in the past with our

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.599 
what we've done in the past with our
platform<00:01:05.540> with<00:01:05.689> with<00:01:05.900> ink<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.409> with<00:01:07.100> touch<00:01:07.310> to

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:07.609 
platform with with ink and with touch to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:08.950 
platform with with ink and with touch to
bring<00:01:07.789> you<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:07.999> multi-touch<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.749> what

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
bring you the multi-touch and what

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.999 
bring you the multi-touch and what
you're<00:01:09.109> showing<00:01:09.289> just<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:09.619> we<00:01:09.740> get<00:01:09.859> the

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
you're showing just so we get the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
straight this is going to be built into

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.950 
straight this is going to be built into

products<00:01:19.639> how<00:01:19.759> important<00:01:20.179> is<00:01:20.240> multi-touch

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
products how important is multi-touch

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.359 
products how important is multi-touch
didn't<00:01:21.139> going<00:01:21.289> forward<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:21.679> computing<00:01:22.159> well

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
didn't going forward and computing well

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.529 
didn't going forward and computing well
i<00:01:22.399> think<00:01:22.520> it's<00:01:22.819> super<00:01:23.149> important<00:01:23.420> because

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
i think it's super important because

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.419 
i think it's super important because

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.800 
it's really very natural to interact and
do<00:01:27.920> things<00:01:28.219> on<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:29.060> screen<00:01:29.149> with<00:01:29.509> multi-touch

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
do things on the screen with multi-touch

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.559 
do things on the screen with multi-touch
is<00:01:30.229> much<00:01:30.499> faster<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:31.249> do<00:01:31.670> certain<00:01:32.060> tasks<00:01:32.240> than

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
is much faster to do certain tasks than

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.359 
is much faster to do certain tasks than
you<00:01:32.689> would<00:01:32.899> with<00:01:33.139> using<00:01:33.709> the<00:01:33.740> mouse<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.280> know

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
you would with using the mouse you know

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.099 
you would with using the mouse you know
you<00:01:34.429> had<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:34.729> character<00:01:35.450> entry<00:01:35.780> with<00:01:35.929> which

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
you had the character entry with which

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.419 
you had the character entry with which
really<00:01:36.289> kind<00:01:36.469> of<00:01:36.649> slow<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:36.859> then<00:01:37.219> you<00:01:37.310> have

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
really kind of slow and then you have

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.069 
really kind of slow and then you have
the<00:01:37.549> mouse<00:01:37.759> which<00:01:38.090> braid<00:01:38.329> it<00:01:38.450> brought<00:01:38.929> it<00:01:39.049> a

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
the mouse which braid it brought it a

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.989 
the mouse which braid it brought it a
little<00:01:39.409> bit<00:01:39.590> faster<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.280> now<00:01:40.399> touch<00:01:40.670> when<00:01:40.909> you

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
little bit faster and now touch when you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.459 
little bit faster and now touch when you
can<00:01:41.119> directly<00:01:41.479> manipulate<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.139> things<00:01:42.319> on

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
can directly manipulate the things on

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.010 
can directly manipulate the things on
the<00:01:42.499> screen<00:01:42.789> really<00:01:43.789> makes<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.389> huge<00:01:44.539> lot<00:01:44.899> of

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
the screen really makes a huge lot of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.629 
the screen really makes a huge lot of
the<00:01:45.079> box<00:01:45.319> what<00:01:45.829> you're<00:01:45.950> doing<00:01:46.189> with<00:01:46.279> photos

want to be able to do is use touch when
it<00:04:31.880> makes<00:04:32.030> sense<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.539> mouse<00:04:32.720> would<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.050> make

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
it makes sense the mouse would it make

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.330 
it makes sense the mouse would it make
sense<00:04:33.410> in<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.620> keyboard<00:04:33.979> when<00:04:34.099> it<00:04:34.190> makes

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
sense in the keyboard when it makes

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.950 
sense in the keyboard when it makes
sense<00:04:34.460> so<00:04:34.789> it's<00:04:34.910> not<00:04:35.000> about<00:04:35.240> complete

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
sense so it's not about complete

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.809 
sense so it's not about complete
replacement<00:04:36.289> in<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.710> mouse<00:04:36.919> so<00:04:37.280> it's<00:04:37.729> a

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
replacement in the mouse so it's a

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.480 
replacement in the mouse so it's a
combination<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.720> both<00:04:39.199> what<00:04:39.889> works<00:04:40.069> best<00:04:40.280> and

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
combination of both what works best and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.890 
combination of both what works best and
we<00:04:40.580> will<00:04:40.699> have<00:04:40.849> an<00:04:40.940> on-screen<00:04:41.240> keyboard<00:04:41.780> as

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
and where touch really makes a big
