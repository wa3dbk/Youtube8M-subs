00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello my ladies and gentlemen heartily 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.899
 Welcome to this video 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.150
 recently the wwe ppv team was live 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.190
 stream to us mode pretty much already 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.530
 have made videos and now I will 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.599
 sum up everything in that 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.020
 livestream shown and told like that 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.240
 has been 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 because I have not mentioned anything yet 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.050
 in the videos shown so far resp 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.330
 made videos yes there so we put 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.910
 Let's start with that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.149
 champion title or what is mental 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.130
 next to title and indeed you can see 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.690
 here it gives the index the title that 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.510
 I would actually have this on 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.980
 never thought about it over and over 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.600
 It is logical to think why 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.820
 should the ex, the title does not 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.350
 give 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 somehow, after all 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.820
 Surprises so far there were only three 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.610
 title carrier 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.390
 the denex titles were in the beginning 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.579
 It is very happy then has the longest 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.300
 I took over the title 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.489
 and by now this offered that 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.470
 otherwise only three titleholders hear that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.479
 then you will be nice in wwe ppv timo 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.820
 which can of course be extreme 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.240
 cold tcw is also back from the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.750
 game 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.840
 with the titles that must be one 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.030
 other thing to the titles and indeed 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.250
 Come as you see here now too 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.930
 women more to the validity in the universe mode 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.580
 if you really want that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.560
 pretty unnecessary because there are anyway 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.229
 only 7 women but you can now 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.780
 meanwhile also as main title so 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.630
 as major title the divas championship 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.180
 select that was not there before 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.189
 you could only wwe title world 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.490
 heavyweight championship and what went 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.840
 nevertheless, wcw or sth 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.619
 the big titles as major title 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.729
 use for example also inter 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.130
 continental european heart choir us title 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.790
 ding all not now you can 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.189
 but also as I said the divas as 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.350
 use major title there and virtually 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.450
 if university what if you do there 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.000
 So it's hot that's what I'm gonna do 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.759
 certainly not make but that works 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.470
 now so then there is for 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.600
 a few wrestlers like john 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.920
 cena different 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.600
 Clothes again, they take care of here 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.880
 can just adjust to the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.310
 various rattle her came the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.210
 different dressed pure and 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.920
 of course with another 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.040
 that means when I join in now 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.860
 john cena the wrestlemania 23 the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.540
 Select then he comes in any case 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.990
 with the clothes in and of my knowledge 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.400
 also with the engines that actually one 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.960
 very good thing now we come 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.270
 also a cool thing and indeed 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:45.490
 to the logos for the universe mode the 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.140
 you can use it then I can 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.890
 yes, always just make the paper where you 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.830
 the logo has 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.800
 so mcgowan superstars ross 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.560
 alex clear just the moment shot then 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.410
 come the twelve pay per views of 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.990
 Rumble what is in january is just up to 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.790
 december gorgeous so rumble in the 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.520
 rain ii extreme with blah blah blah 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.020
 includes not only time to tlc prior to 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.270
 then, of course, then the 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.520
 all the wrestlemania logos by the 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.740
 FÃ¶rderkreis romania are all too 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.600
 Wrestlemania in there so you can see 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.730
 now wrestlemania 1 to 11 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:28.030
 and here then wrestlemania 9 to 23 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.709
 and here now 24 then to wrestlemania 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.020
 30 that I look cool too 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.060
 wesselmann 30 and as a logo there it is 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.530
 I will then as with me 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.440
 Wrestlemania set that kurras 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.240
 Men 30 then also cool double you 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.600
 monday night raw and is off is again 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.959
 there 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.680
 as a symbol and we have two pay per 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.290
 Views from the wcw clash of the champions 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.760
 and www star kate at least ever 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.950
 maybe two more 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.370
 I'm assuming that it still 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.780
 others will give other logos for 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.200
 pay per views the question is now whether the 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.670
 from www or old from the wwe man 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.170
 looks quite down there homer them 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.860
 forgive gives a few others 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.209
 Richmond Day or bed stays and what 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.250
 I know everything gave me a few more 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.900
 other www pay per views and yes more 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.709
 Unfortunately , they have not shown of the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.000
 Mode in the live stream for me a pity 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.290
 some may not be interested 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.760
 as true as I would like to know if so too 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.490
 is from who are aware of it whether 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.180
 now one night stand and december to 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:39.229
 december or just the really old ones 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.479
 by oldschool easy double you haven and 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.190
 what else was there 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.550
 november remember november wants visa 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.960
 Segal you will see then there is 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.630
 a few more you can see the bar 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.030
 on the right is about two-thirds 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.770
 So a bit of what it indicates logos 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.530
 there was something else that surprised me then 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.760
 we have tribute trips what 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.930
 yes no pig needs and king of the 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.940
 ring king of the ring we need 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.440
 Definitely for the universe mode at the 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.570
 I will become king of doing tournament 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.030
 definitely just mercy and answer 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.610
 I think it's cool that there too 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.810
 the old wwe pervis matrix will then work 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.250
 I wonder why there is uk in it 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.350
 is this a pay per view of which or 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.490
 is that the normal logge me if I 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.930
 sure I again shortly after 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.539
 Look what it is at all that is 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:28.550
 just the old racing promotion as in the 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:31.729
 wwe cww cwt entso-e rage is among others 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.169
 an american wrestling association as 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.180
 I believe or was it just here 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.680
 It just does not matter to me why 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.090
 in there are probably the ways the 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.650
 bought sometime and now are 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.760
 which in the mirror to asr 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.650
 I'm not so interested that was it 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.520
 already so far with the rest 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.169
 infos about the king of the ring mode in 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.330
 wwe ppv team universe mode I have yes 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.289
 already made a video I will 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.850
 you still have a video description 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.960
 link so if that's not yet 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.910
 You could have seen that 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.800
 there is information about king of 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.389
 the ring featuring university 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.539
 However, one thing forgot to say 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:07.280
 a trifle and if you like that 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.289
 then you make a king of the ring 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.419
 appears after the king of the ring 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.789
 tournament this forms here with the 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.590
 winner left and against whom he where and 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.680
 as won, so has mixed white 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.580
 been for counter 130 and against whom in 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.110
 which match 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.389
 Besides, there was also there 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.220
 are missing and rivalries in the meantime 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.669
 universe mode also in between video 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.189
 made 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.650
 that too is in the video description 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:34.039
 linked that was so far to me 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.270
 www.tk fortin universe mode i hope 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.680
 that again did not please about one 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.000
