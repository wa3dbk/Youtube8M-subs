algae<00:01:51.890> some<00:01:52.890> people<00:01:53.159> considered<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.700> pest<00:01:54.110> I'm

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
algae some people considered a pest I'm

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.209 
algae some people considered a pest I'm
going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> leave<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.799> time<00:01:55.979> being

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
going to leave it for the time being

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.459 
going to leave it for the time being
until<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.579> takes<00:01:56.700> over<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.270> guess<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.229> kind<00:01:58.409> of

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
until it takes over I guess it kind of

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.429 
until it takes over I guess it kind of
pulls<00:01:58.710> nitrates<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.610> your<00:01:59.700> system<00:01:59.909> maybe

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
pulls nitrates out of your system maybe

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.260 
pulls nitrates out of your system maybe
they<00:02:01.439> kind<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.829> help<00:02:02.460> filter<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.969> water<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
they kind of help filter the water a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.380 
they kind of help filter the water a
little<00:02:03.360> bit<00:02:04.040> but<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.310> guess<00:02:05.490> they<00:02:05.700> they<00:02:05.939> spread

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
little bit but I guess they they spread

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.410
