seen a lot of these in your life being

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.370 
seen a lot of these in your life being
your<00:01:06.760> kids<00:01:07.090> you<00:01:07.299> possibly<00:01:07.720> asked<00:01:08.049> your<00:01:08.200> mother

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
your kids you possibly asked your mother

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.470 
your kids you possibly asked your mother
for<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.770> penny<00:01:09.010> to<00:01:09.310> throw<00:01:09.940> in<00:01:10.090> in<00:01:10.240> such<00:01:10.450> a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
for a penny to throw in in such a

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.140 
for a penny to throw in in such a
machine<00:01:10.660> yourself<00:01:11.370> but<00:01:12.370> in<00:01:12.520> Japan<00:01:12.850> it's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
machine yourself but in Japan it's

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.530 
machine yourself but in Japan it's
slightly<00:01:13.660> more<00:01:13.900> cultural<00:01:14.680> thing<00:01:14.980> and<00:01:15.250> so<00:01:15.610> it's

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
slightly more cultural thing and so it's

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.540 
slightly more cultural thing and so it's
also<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.990> slightly<00:01:17.260> more<00:01:17.470> collector<00:01:17.980> oriented

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
also a slightly more collector oriented

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.160 
also a slightly more collector oriented
which<00:01:18.730> means<00:01:19.030> these<00:01:19.360> toys<00:01:19.660> are<00:01:19.870> slightly

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
which means these toys are slightly

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.530 
which means these toys are slightly
bigger<00:01:20.380> quality<00:01:20.530> Jen<00:01:21.280> for<00:01:21.460> example<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:22.000> rubber

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
bigger quality Jen for example a rubber

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.890 
bigger quality Jen for example a rubber
teeth<00:01:22.930> or<00:01:23.470> this<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:24.100> rubber<00:01:24.970> hand<00:01:25.360> that<00:01:25.660> you<00:01:25.750> can

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
teeth or this a rubber hand that you can

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.890 
teeth or this a rubber hand that you can
slap<00:01:26.170> enemies<00:01:26.740> with<00:01:27.300> which<00:01:28.300> results<00:01:28.720> in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
slap enemies with which results in

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.670 
slap enemies with which results in
things<00:01:29.290> like<00:01:29.500> this<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.810> is<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.110> first<00:01:32.410> of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
things like this this is the first of

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.060 
things like this this is the first of
the<00:01:32.800> two<00:01:32.950> -<00:01:33.190> upon<00:01:33.520> balls<00:01:33.730> I<00:01:34.030> have<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:34.930> I<00:01:35.380> think

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
the two - upon balls I have and I think

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.590 
the two - upon balls I have and I think
in<00:01:36.400> this<00:01:36.550> video<00:01:36.790> we<00:01:36.910> are<00:01:36.970> going<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.210> conflict

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
in this video we are going to conflict

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.270 
in this video we are going to conflict
on<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:37.930> one<00:01:38.110> because<00:01:38.260> honestly<00:01:38.860> I<00:01:38.980> haven't

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
on this one because honestly I haven't

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.780 
on this one because honestly I haven't
opened<00:01:39.730> it<00:01:39.760> yet<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.420> I'm<00:01:41.080> just<00:01:41.380> going<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.620> be

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
opened it yet and I'm just going to be

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.340 
opened it yet and I'm just going to be
just<00:01:42.790> as<00:01:42.970> looking<00:01:43.270> at<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.540> first<00:01:43.780> time<00:01:44.050> as<00:01:44.230> you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
just as looking at it first time as you

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.520 
just as looking at it first time as you
are<00:01:44.530> so<00:01:45.300> without<00:01:46.300> any<00:01:46.480> delay<00:01:46.540> let's<00:01:47.230> see<00:01:47.409> what

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
are so without any delay let's see what

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.149 
are so without any delay let's see what
we<00:01:47.650> have<00:01:47.800> here<00:01:51.120> nice<00:01:52.120> little<00:01:52.240> ball<00:01:52.720> with

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
we have here nice little ball with

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.170 
we have here nice little ball with
Japanese<00:01:54.159> symbols<00:01:54.730> on<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:56.670> also<00:01:57.670> interesting

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
Japanese symbols on it also interesting

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.010 
Japanese symbols on it also interesting
thing<00:01:58.480> we<00:01:59.409> have<00:01:59.650> these<00:01:59.980> little<00:02:00.600> holes<00:02:01.600> in<00:02:01.990> the

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
thing we have these little holes in the

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.980 
thing we have these little holes in the
ball<00:02:02.350> which<00:02:02.770> are<00:02:02.950> air<00:02:03.220> vents<00:02:03.640> which<00:02:04.420> probably

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
ball which are air vents which probably

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.260 
ball which are air vents which probably
are<00:02:05.140> designed<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:05.800> there<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:06.729> earth

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
are designed so that there is earth

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.229 
are designed so that there is earth
circulation<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.379> so<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.739> toy<00:02:08.979> does<00:02:09.280> not<00:02:09.489> get

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
circulation and so the toy does not get

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.479 
circulation and so the toy does not get
quality<00:02:10.629> issues<00:02:10.989> over<00:02:11.230> lack<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:12.040> air<00:02:12.310> or

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
quality issues over lack of air or

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.369 
quality issues over lack of air or
something<00:02:12.760> like<00:02:12.819> that

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
something like that

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.860 
something like that
