00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.750
 I'm going to teach you how to make play dough 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.870
 And the only thing we're going to need is 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.270
 a cup of flour half a cup of salt 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.849
 half a cup of water two teaspoons 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.730
 oil and dyes to paint your 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:24.779
 plasticine you have to do is put the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.939
 half a cup of salt along with the average 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.880
 cup with the flour cup and together the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.170
 half a cup of water and four 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.059
 teaspoons of oil and you have to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.610
 mix because everyone has to find 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.860
 a little bit and the position falls, we have to 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.290
 stick your fingers after you have to put 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.800
 the line on some flat surface and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.170
 mix good knead the short one that 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.810
 there is playing moving with mass as 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.990
 for five minutes you will have something left 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.820
 I do not want to stick your fingers 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.680
 and that you can move it and that it does not stick 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.870
 nowhere and then you have to 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.270
 if you want you can divide it and paint 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.270
 different colors how to paint it all 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.830
 of a single new color here is that it puts 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.620
 the dye in between 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.690
 mix it with enveloping movements 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.450
 blue and the only thing here is with a stick 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.460
 or with whatever you put coloring and already 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.650
 you just have to move it with 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.920
 wraparound movements so you leave 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.720
 painting all your plasticine or since 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.090
 I was reading was going to paint 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.550
 everything is the same color and the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.950
 You must be able to move it and not 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.140
 stick your fingers and be able to stretch like 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.760
 any plasticine if you feel that 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.550
 it still hits you at least a little 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.110
 the fingers puts a little more flour already 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.990
 that you have finished it you have to 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.990
 keep it in a closed place like him 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.090
 like in a boat with a lid any place 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.820
 but that is closed so that you do not get 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.159
 go to dry if it is drying you 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.850
 you can put a little more water to 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.009
 that returns to its normal consistency if 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.140
 you spend a little with the water you can 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.860
 put back more saline and it will come back 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.860
 to stay the same
