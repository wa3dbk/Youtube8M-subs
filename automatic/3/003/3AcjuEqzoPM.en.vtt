00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.550
 with another video lesson for you 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.669
 and then beat you there as staff 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.390
 ping ping in games that there 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.930
 folks 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.119
 at the request of many participants there and I am 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.829
 here for you especially for them and 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.930
 for those who have this problem as well 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.610
 ping pong high in online games 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.969
 first you do not have to download 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.430
 these two files leave someone in the 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:45.699
 description that would be a notepad 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:50.289
 to confirm the reddit and a program 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:57.629
 called is the license plate I think who has the 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:01:01.800
 function to reconfigure the system to you 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:07.770
 so here it runs better in games 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:11.040
 then run as administrator 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.060
 architect was previously thought 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.510
 to remove 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.890
 now you're saying you're in the 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.680

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:28.440

 do a little settings there 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.740
 so let's go there to execute those who do not 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.670
 You know how abc leonel just was not 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.840

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:08.619
 people are going to have to explain and 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:14.890
 that local machine software microsoft and 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:19.150

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:39.400
 if you do not have the vi and me to stay and that 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.920
