00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
you've seen this diverter kit that we

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.370 
you've seen this diverter kit that we
have<00:00:11.370> for<00:00:11.730> rainwater<00:00:12.300> harvesting<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.290> we've

there's some updates we used to clamp
our<00:00:18.539> tubing<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.320> outside<00:00:20.130> or<00:00:21.000> 1<00:00:21.570> inch

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
our tubing on the outside or 1 inch

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.099 
our tubing on the outside or 1 inch
tubing<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.859> still<00:00:23.189> do<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.689> either

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
tubing we can still do that on either

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.320 
tubing we can still do that on either
side<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.609> put<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.269> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
side with a you can put the one and a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.660 
side with a you can put the one and a
quarter<00:00:27.539> inch<00:00:27.960> inside<00:00:28.560> diameter<00:00:28.800> tubing

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
quarter inch inside diameter tubing

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.180 
quarter inch inside diameter tubing
right<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.660> there<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:32.630> use<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.710> with<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> clamp

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
right on there and use that with a clamp

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.490 
right on there and use that with a clamp
or<00:00:35.570> now<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:37.020> threaded<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.100> both<00:00:38.850> sides<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:40.290> on

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
or now it's threaded on both sides so on

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.229 
or now it's threaded on both sides so on
this<00:00:40.710> side<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.790> right<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.840> have

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
this side what you see right here I have

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.779 
this side what you see right here I have
this<00:00:45.239> insert<00:00:45.989> screwed<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.649> light<00:00:47.370> just

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
this insert screwed in light just

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.740 
this insert screwed in light just
lightly<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.710> 1<00:00:49.950> inch<00:00:50.160> tubing<00:00:50.820> i<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.449> on

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
lightly and the 1 inch tubing i have on

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.840 
lightly and the 1 inch tubing i have on
part<00:00:52.170> way<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.820> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
part way so that you can see this is a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.600 
part way so that you can see this is a
barb<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.539> that's<00:00:54.750> an<00:00:55.260> insert<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.370> have

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
barb so that's an insert that we have

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.619 
barb so that's an insert that we have
that's<00:00:56.789> available<00:00:57.469> this<00:00:58.469> makes<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.370> that

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
that's available this makes it so that

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.590 
that's available this makes it so that
people<00:01:00.629> more<00:01:01.379> people<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:02.280> different<00:01:02.730> sizes

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
people more people with different sizes

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.039 
people more people with different sizes
for<00:01:03.629> their<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.920> their<00:01:05.220> barrels<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:06.600> utilize

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
for their of their barrels can utilize

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.830 
for their of their barrels can utilize
this<00:01:07.350> diverter<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.939> I'm<00:01:09.090> screwing<00:01:09.570> in

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
this diverter this that I'm screwing in

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.780 
this diverter this that I'm screwing in
right<00:01:10.170> now<00:01:10.820> will<00:01:11.820> fit<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:13.229> garden<00:01:14.159> hose<00:01:14.430> so

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
right now will fit on a garden hose so

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.600 
right now will fit on a garden hose so
if<00:01:14.850> your<00:01:15.210> barrel<00:01:15.750> takes<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.390> garden<00:01:18.390> hose<00:01:19.610> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
if your barrel takes a garden hose to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.880 
if your barrel takes a garden hose to
fill<00:01:20.780> now<00:01:22.490> we<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:24.000> adapter<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
attention that in my instructions I have

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.020 
attention that in my instructions I have
the<00:01:54.920> band<00:01:55.920> wrapping<00:01:56.850> around<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.759> base

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the band wrapping around this the base

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.149 
the band wrapping around this the base
and<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.509> top<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:02.540> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.469> gutter<00:02:04.710> peace

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
and the top of the of the gutter peace

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.619 
and the top of the of the gutter peace
and<00:02:06.439> many<00:02:07.439> people<00:02:07.829> would<00:02:08.190> prefer<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.599> it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
and many people would prefer to do it

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.080 
and many people would prefer to do it
this<00:02:10.170> way<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.520> fine

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
this way and that is fine

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.910 
this way and that is fine
on<00:02:12.269> this<00:02:12.629> installation<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.560> wouldn't<00:02:13.830> be

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
on this installation it wouldn't be

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.650 
on this installation it wouldn't be
possible<00:02:14.160> because<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.390> corner

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
possible because this is on the corner

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.380 
possible because this is on the corner
of<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:16.019> shed<00:02:16.349> but<00:02:17.099> in<00:02:17.220> several<00:02:17.670> cases<00:02:17.879> if<00:02:18.269> you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
of a shed but in several cases if you

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.170 
of a shed but in several cases if you
would<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.680> can<00:02:19.890> certainly<00:02:20.220> use<00:02:20.489> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
would like to you can certainly use the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.229 
would like to you can certainly use the
bands<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.870> are<00:02:22.019> supplied<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:23.060> our<00:02:24.060> rain

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
bands that are supplied with our rain

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.589 
bands that are supplied with our rain
water<00:02:24.480> diverter<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:26.239> install<00:02:27.239> them

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
water diverter and you can install them

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.400 
water diverter and you can install them
in<00:02:27.959> this<00:02:28.860> manner<00:02:29.450> instead<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.870> wrapping<00:02:31.080> it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
in this manner instead of wrapping it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.759 
in this manner instead of wrapping it
around<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.040> front<00:02:32.340> as<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.660> instructions<00:02:34.379> say

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
around the front as the instructions say

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.199 
around the front as the instructions say
sometimes<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:35.910> think<00:02:35.940> outside<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.690> box<00:02:37.160> okay

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
sometimes we think outside the box okay

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.780 
sometimes we think outside the box okay
