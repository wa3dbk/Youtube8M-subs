00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.370
 [music] 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.840
 few armored vehicles are capable 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.610
 surprise us also like a 180 ton 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.360
 steel great german heavy tank 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.760
 maus 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.390
 it began to be developed after closing 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.800
 project heavy tank lion from March 1942 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.350
 until July 1944 the company circle had to 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.450
 build 140 1 unit of this technique 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.320
 but air force bombardment 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.300
 Britain prevented this plan in 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 1943 during the air battle behind the wheel 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.110
 the plant circle was dealt serious 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.360
 damage due to this 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.550
 the production of the tank maus was impossible 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.589
 for eight months and when 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.320
 infrastructure nevertheless restored order 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.550
 was reduced from 140 one car to two 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.860
 tanks and one turret 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.900
 if the irregular raids of the British 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.850
 Aviation Sryba lice and military work 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.040
 German factories then it is possible that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.229
 Mouse would have been made in large series 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.970
 even before adopting and even 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.659
 used on the fronts of the second world 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.750
 of war 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.850
 however, this did not happen in the game mouse 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.970
 are the crown of the German development branch 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.750
 heavy tanks we will give an assessment 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.420
 tactical and technical characteristics 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.000
 this machine compared to other tt 10 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 level the highest rates will be 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 have a rating of 10 points and the lowest 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.979
 unit 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.960
 according to dynamic characteristics he 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.700
 inferior to their classmates speed 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.630
 turning the chassis 15 degrees per second 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.119
 towers 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.820
 14 degrees per second maximum 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.560
 speed is 20 kilometers per hour 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.630
 fire quality is also not the most 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.020
 Strong feature of this tank is the time 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.289
 information 2.9 seconds scatter when 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.289
 shot equal to 0.38 meters for every 100 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.479
 one-time damage is 490 meters 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.380
 units penetration armor-piercing projectile 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.340
 the average is 246 millimeters 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.119
 booking our tank one of 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.310
 best in the game 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.439
 upper armor detail 200 thick 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.030
 millimeters angled 52 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.730
 degrees and able to withstand hits 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.340
 from the most powerful guns in the game 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.409
 hull board 185 millimeters but 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.310
 lack of tilt angle greatly reduces 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.069
 its effectiveness 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.530
 the forehead of the tower is 240 millimeters and 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.840
 bead has a convex shape tower is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.239
 two hundred and 10 meters and is located under 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.330
 a break of 30 degrees is difficult 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.769
 doable task for most tanks 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.959
 tank strength 3000 units 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.780
 what is the maximum rate in 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.819
 the game review is 400 meters as in 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.769
 other heavy tanks of this level beyond 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.269
 with the exception of the British summarize 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.670
 Mouse weaknesses 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.709
 low dynamics and mediocre fire 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.140
 power besides huge dimensions make 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.450
 from him an excellent target for artillery 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.840
 the main advantage of this machine is big 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.519
 margin of safety and good booking 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.470
 vulnerabilities are the cheeks of the tower 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.569
 lower armor sheet and poorly protected I 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.959
 part of the board to get on which you can 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.030
 shoot the front rollers at an angle 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.950
 consider the tactics of combat - this 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.690
 tank first row he can take on 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.590
 yourself damage covering your allies from 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.200
 enemy fire 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.060
 Traditionally for heavy tanks, the ideal 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.340
 battlegrounds are urban 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.530
 cards we can confidently hold or 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.079
 push the direction while threatening 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.079
 artillery strike is almost absent 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.400
 do not forget about vulnerabilities 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.620
 the possibility of hiding the lower armor 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.250
 and keep the tower turned so that the enemy 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.989
 couldnâ€™t get his cheeks important 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.450
 we need to do at different stages 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.220
 development of the battle is not worth the first minutes 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.200
 rushit directions only because 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.410
 no one can see the enemy ahead 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.970
 wait for you around the corner if you're sure 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.760
 sure that there are only a few ahead of you 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.050
 tanks boldly pushing the direction 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.910
 enlisting the support of allies 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.370
 the help of teammates is very important 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.470
 since the mouse alone is very light 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.770
 target for the enemy and fight on two fronts 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.700
 it is extremely difficult for him to take 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.590
 ruinberg map 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.090
 but we say right away that we are considering 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.410
 action only in the urban part 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.390
 since going out in the open 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.540
 space is not recommended for us 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.940
 the beginning of the battle go to the square g3 use 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.590
 destroyed the house as shelter through 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.810
 embrasure we can fire 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.090
 if the opponent rashit 3 lines 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.950
 or get into positional bout we can 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.840
 DPS opponent wherein 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.240
 remaining protected from return fire 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.380
 from this square we can take 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.990
 the following actions 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.930
 move to f2 and work from the corner to 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.860
 the case of a large accumulation of enemy forces 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.350
 push the third line or 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.760
 drive to j2 if the enemy breaks small 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.960
 city 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.550
 usually on each card you 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.560
 perform several key actions 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.140
 due to which it is achieved 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.700
 advantage of one of the parties on the mouse we 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.530
 not able to move quickly with 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.150
 one flank to another therefore 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.280
 initially choose a direction 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.700
 likely movement of the main forces of the enemy and 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.770
 there we play our part in the open 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.230
 maps such as robin prokhorovka 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.880
 el hulluf sandy river steppe we do not 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.820
 we can realize our advantage 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.250
 tank maus is slow him hard 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.990
 change position or find shelter him 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.210
 huge dimensions allow the enemy 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.100
 quickly break the enemy's isolate 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.320
 artillery and keep you waiting 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.150
 and mediocre break through and not the 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.940
 better accuracy will not allow us to lead 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.590
 long-range fire on a robin 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.470
 the best option would be to stand near 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.140
 cowsheds or monasteries on al-Khaluf 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.820
 we can hide behind the mountains on 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.590
 sandy river need to get to 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.470
 cities and there try to hide from 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.330
 enemy fire 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.040
 on the map of the steppe you can get behind the stones 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.470
 from there fight other heavy 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.360
 tanks prokhorovka 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.520
 one of the most unfavorable for the mouse 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.960
 cards because we can light and 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.330
 destroy before we can 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.250
 get to a comfortable position so 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.900
 moving around neatly 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.240
 Shelter houses in the village 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.450
 for example, any other actions will result 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.970
 to the imminent death of the mouse as not many 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.620
 other tanks are highly dependent on the card in 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.840
 this is the difficulty of playing 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.670
 this car canyons and other hidden 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.980
 from artillery places he is capable of 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.810
 much but as soon as the mouse appears 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.840
 on the open card or stays in 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.160
 alone he becomes very vulnerable 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.130
 successfully continue the fight in this case 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.110
 It turns out not often separately note 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.940
 serious mouse vulnerability when you 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.280
 put the tank at an angle the enemy can 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.380
 shoot you in the rink shell pass 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.300
 through it and will fall into 80 millimeter 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.760
 long-sided armor 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.530
 this can not be afraid but melee 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.540
 worth following where to aim 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.630
 adversary and timely turn 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.580
 body trying to achieve rebound when 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.200
 clinch with virtually any other tanks 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.960
 we can use your maximum 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.480
 weight let the damage from the ram is not so high but 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.250
 he will not be superfluous to the tank was 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.960
 more effectively in the battle set 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.330
 the following additional equipment 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.130
 fuse stabilizer and reinforced 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.320
 pickup drives help work better 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.600
 at close range, shoot faster and 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.700
 come down after the lapel of the tower 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.150
 crew skills are most effective 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:03.110
 the following combinations are all good luck 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.110
 on the battlefield
