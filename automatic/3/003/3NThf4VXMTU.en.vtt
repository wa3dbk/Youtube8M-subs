vine<00:00:18.460> I'm<00:00:19.460> not<00:00:19.640> sure<00:00:19.940> how<00:00:20.180> cold<00:00:20.600> hardy<00:00:21.109> it<00:00:21.230> is

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
vine I'm not sure how cold hardy it is

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.800 
vine I'm not sure how cold hardy it is
we<00:00:21.740> get<00:00:21.920> down<00:00:22.130> into<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.609> mid<00:00:22.880> 20s<00:00:23.449> on<00:00:23.779> a

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
we get down into the mid 20s on a

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.140 
we get down into the mid 20s on a
regular<00:00:24.349> basis<00:00:24.919> and<00:00:25.160> it's<00:00:25.400> fine<00:00:25.789> in<00:00:26.029> that

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
regular basis and it's fine in that

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.550 
regular basis and it's fine in that
situation<00:00:27.130> so<00:00:28.130> this<00:00:28.640> is<00:00:28.849> it<00:00:29.150> used<00:00:29.599> on<00:00:29.990> as<00:00:30.499> a

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
situation so this is it used on as a

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.550 
situation so this is it used on as a
fence<00:00:31.130> cover<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:32.029> was<00:00:32.300> a<00:00:32.329> wooden<00:00:32.750> wire<00:00:33.079> fence

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
fence cover this was a wooden wire fence

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.360 
fence cover this was a wooden wire fence
and<00:00:34.329> they<00:00:35.329> wanted<00:00:35.660> privacy<00:00:35.900> on<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.440> side<00:00:36.860> so

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
and they wanted privacy on the side so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.570 
and they wanted privacy on the side so
they<00:00:37.579> covered<00:00:38.239> this<00:00:38.390> fence<00:00:39.040> with<00:00:40.040> this<00:00:40.220> vine

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
they covered this fence with this vine

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.300 
they covered this fence with this vine
so<00:00:41.390> here's<00:00:41.780> what<00:00:42.020> I<00:00:42.050> like<00:00:42.290> about<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:42.890> it<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:43.280> one

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
so here's what I like about it it is one

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.460 
so here's what I like about it it is one
of<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.760> faster<00:00:44.270> growing<00:00:44.540> vines<00:00:45.020> you're<00:00:45.320> going

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
of the faster growing vines you're going

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.390 
of the faster growing vines you're going
to<00:00:45.530> find<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:47.570> blooms<00:00:48.020> virtually<00:00:48.740> all<00:00:48.950> year

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
to find and it blooms virtually all year

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.640 
to find and it blooms virtually all year
it's<00:00:49.580> a<00:00:49.730> very<00:00:50.090> heavy<00:00:50.360> bloomer<00:00:50.900> this<00:00:51.200> is<00:00:51.380> late

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
it's a very heavy bloomer this is late

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.610 
it's a very heavy bloomer this is late
August<00:00:52.130> and<00:00:52.340> it<00:00:53.270> is<00:00:53.390> still<00:00:53.720> blooming<00:00:54.050> we're<00:00:54.530> in

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
August and it is still blooming we're in

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.810 
August and it is still blooming we're in
a<00:00:54.710> hot<00:00:54.920> inland<00:00:55.370> Valley

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
a hot inland Valley

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.200 
a hot inland Valley
so<00:00:56.450> I<00:00:56.480> handles<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.170> heat<00:00:57.410> just<00:00:57.650> fine<00:00:58.310> and<00:00:58.400> also

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
so I handles the heat just fine and also

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.420 
so I handles the heat just fine and also
deer<00:00:59.870> seem<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.440> leave<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:00.830> alone<00:01:01.040> the

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
deer seem to leave this alone the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.240 
deer seem to leave this alone the
Jasmine<00:01:02.030> a<00:01:02.150> solanum<00:01:03.020> family<00:01:03.500> I<00:01:03.530> believe<00:01:04.009> is

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
Jasmine a solanum family I believe is

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.179 
Jasmine a solanum family I believe is
poisonous<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:06.619> need<00:01:06.799> to<00:01:06.920> check<00:01:07.130> that

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
poisonous and you need to check that

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.670 
poisonous and you need to check that
though<00:01:07.640> but<00:01:08.270> I<00:01:08.299> believe<00:01:09.020> that's<00:01:09.229> why<00:01:09.439> they

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
though but I believe that's why they

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.389 
though but I believe that's why they
leave<00:01:09.890> this<00:01:10.130> alone<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.499> you<00:01:12.499> know<00:01:12.619> in<00:01:12.829> terms<00:01:13.130> of

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
leave this alone so you know in terms of

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.730 
leave this alone so you know in terms of
fast<00:01:13.789> cover<00:01:14.179> and<00:01:14.509> lots<00:01:15.439> of<00:01:15.590> color<00:01:16.179> this<00:01:17.179> one<00:01:17.450> is

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
fast cover and lots of color this one is

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.459 
fast cover and lots of color this one is
great<00:01:18.740> for<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.219> this<00:01:19.670> plant<00:01:20.149> I<00:01:20.570> think<00:01:21.320> these

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
great for that this plant I think these

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.620 
great for that this plant I think these
are<00:01:21.530> about<00:01:21.890> two<00:01:22.249> to<00:01:22.490> three<00:01:22.520> years<00:01:22.999> old<00:01:23.299> and

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
are about two to three years old and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.870 
are about two to three years old and
that's<00:01:23.810> what's<00:01:24.049> pretty<00:01:24.319> impressive<00:01:24.770> is<00:01:25.130> this

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
that's what's pretty impressive is this

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.389 
that's what's pretty impressive is this
is<00:01:26.149> about<00:01:26.509> a<00:01:26.569> nine<00:01:26.990> foot<00:01:27.380> high<00:01:27.619> planting

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
is about a nine foot high planting

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.520 
is about a nine foot high planting
you're<00:01:28.579> looking<00:01:28.939> at<00:01:29.090> right<00:01:29.270> now<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:29.840> very

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
you're looking at right now and very

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.910 
you're looking at right now and very
dense<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.249> full<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:31.969> as<00:01:32.210> I<00:01:32.840> said<00:01:33.140> very<00:01:33.469> fast

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
dense and full so as I said very fast

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.660 
dense and full so as I said very fast
growing<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.869> prolific<00:01:35.869> plant<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.950> problem

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
growing and prolific plant the problem

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.910 
growing and prolific plant the problem
with<00:01:37.850> anything<00:01:38.149> like<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:38.659> is<00:01:39.259> that<00:01:39.619> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
with anything like that is that the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.260 
with anything like that is that the
plant<00:01:40.219> doesn't<00:01:40.490> know<00:01:40.789> where<00:01:40.999> it's<00:01:41.119> supposed

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
plant doesn't know where it's supposed

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.679 
plant doesn't know where it's supposed
to<00:01:41.600> stop<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.350> if<00:01:43.249> it<00:01:43.460> runs<00:01:43.700> out<00:01:43.939> a<00:01:43.999> room<00:01:44.389> it

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
to stop and if it runs out a room it

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.879 
to stop and if it runs out a room it
just<00:01:44.960> starts<00:01:45.229> grabbing<00:01:45.560> on<00:01:45.889> other<00:01:46.280> stuff<00:01:47.889> the

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:48.889 
just starts grabbing on other stuff the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:51.429 
just starts grabbing on other stuff the
other<00:01:49.159> concern<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:49.909> have<00:01:50.359> with<00:01:50.389> this<00:01:50.780> plant<00:01:51.200> is

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
other concern I have with this plant is

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.709 
other concern I have with this plant is
that<00:01:51.499> it<00:01:52.340> can<00:01:52.609> kind<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:53.030> just<00:01:53.209> run<00:01:53.509> out<00:01:53.689> of

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
that it can kind of just run out of

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.469 
that it can kind of just run out of
juice<00:01:54.109> and<00:01:54.409> start<00:01:55.189> dying<00:01:55.490> back<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.209> getting

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
juice and start dying back and getting

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.379 
juice and start dying back and getting
woody<00:01:56.810> over<00:01:57.139> time<00:01:57.649> now<00:01:58.490> here's<00:01:58.909> a<00:01:58.969> good<00:01:59.209> look

00:01:59.379 --> 00:01:59.389 
woody over time now here's a good look

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:02.379 
woody over time now here's a good look
at<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.689> flowers<00:02:00.429> really<00:02:01.429> beautiful<00:02:02.090> flower

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389 
at the flowers really beautiful flower

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
kind of a star shape white flower with a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.840 
kind of a star shape white flower with a
yellow<00:02:05.959> Center<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.539> lots<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:08.840> them<00:02:09.610> here<00:02:10.610> you

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
yellow Center and lots of them here you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.500 
yellow Center and lots of them here you
can<00:02:11.030> kind<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.360> see<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.810> vining<00:02:12.319> habit<00:02:12.830> now

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
can kind of see the vining habit now

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.940 
can kind of see the vining habit now
what's<00:02:14.510> interesting<00:02:14.750> though<00:02:15.439> is<00:02:15.470> this

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
what's interesting though is this

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.970 
what's interesting though is this
doesn't<00:02:16.220> have<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.909> tendrils<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:18.590> see

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
doesn't have the tendrils that you see

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.320 
doesn't have the tendrils that you see
with<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.280> lot<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.640> other

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
with a lot of other

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.630 
with a lot of other
fine<00:02:20.450> tight<00:02:20.840> plants<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:21.650> just<00:02:21.950> kind<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.280> runs

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
fine tight plants this just kind of runs

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.390 
fine tight plants this just kind of runs
all<00:02:22.910> over<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.360> place<00:02:23.600> but<00:02:23.930> it's<00:02:24.620> not<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.220> much

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
all over the place but it's not so much

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.580 
all over the place but it's not so much
grabbing<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.630> lot<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:26.930> other<00:02:27.230> things

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
grabbing on to a lot of other things

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.320 
grabbing on to a lot of other things
actually<00:02:28.870> when<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.900> look<00:02:30.260> at<00:02:30.410> how<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:30.920> is

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
actually when I look at how this is

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.790 
actually when I look at how this is
behaving<00:02:33.460> here's<00:02:34.460> how<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.390> grabs<00:02:35.690> on<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.530> just

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
behaving here's how it grabs on it just

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.820 
behaving here's how it grabs on it just
kind<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.190> twists<00:02:37.610> itself<00:02:38.060> around<00:02:38.510> things<00:02:38.960> but

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
kind of twists itself around things but

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.710 
kind of twists itself around things but
it<00:02:39.950> doesn't<00:02:40.370> have<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.730> tendrils<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.540> you

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
it doesn't have the tendrils that you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.070 
it doesn't have the tendrils that you
get<00:02:41.930> with<00:02:42.170> them<00:02:42.440> say<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.950> pink<00:02:43.370> Jasmine<00:02:44.060> or<00:02:44.270> an

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
get with them say a pink Jasmine or an

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.370 
get with them say a pink Jasmine or an
ivy<00:02:45.620> type<00:02:45.950> thing<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.460> latches<00:02:47.030> on<00:02:47.240> so<00:02:47.690> it's

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
ivy type thing that latches on so it's

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.620 
ivy type thing that latches on so it's
not<00:02:48.500> super<00:02:48.830> it's<00:02:49.670> not<00:02:49.880> terrible<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.600> that

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
not super it's not terrible in that

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.650 
not super it's not terrible in that
regard<00:02:51.260> but<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:52.730> know<00:02:52.850> I<00:02:53.060> just<00:02:53.090> think<00:02:53.450> the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
regard but you know I just think the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.690 
regard but you know I just think the
sheer<00:02:53.930> mass<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.800> challenge<00:02:55.280> with<00:02:55.520> this

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
sheer mass is the challenge with this

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.670 
sheer mass is the challenge with this
plant<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.150> can<00:02:56.420> see<00:02:56.630> this<00:02:56.810> entire<00:02:57.260> fence

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
plant you can see this entire fence

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.190 
plant you can see this entire fence
planting<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:59.030> if<00:02:59.420> you're<00:02:59.570> going<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.750> use<00:02:59.990> it

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
planting so if you're going to use it

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.290 
planting so if you're going to use it
just<00:03:00.410> know<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.040> gets<00:03:01.160> very<00:03:01.280> large<00:03:01.850> give

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
just know that it gets very large give

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.440 
just know that it gets very large give
it<00:03:02.450> room<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.930> run<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.970> these<00:03:04.970> are<00:03:05.150> still

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
it room to run and these are still

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.800 
it room to run and these are still
younger<00:03:05.750> plants<00:03:06.410> but<00:03:06.880> before<00:03:07.880> worn<00:03:08.209> that<00:03:08.510> for

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
younger plants but before worn that for

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.600 
younger plants but before worn that for
me<00:03:09.020> these<00:03:09.380> can<00:03:09.650> be<00:03:09.800> short-lived

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
me these can be short-lived

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.370 
me these can be short-lived
I've<00:03:10.730> seen<00:03:11.000> them<00:03:11.150> just<00:03:11.180> start<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.900> die<00:03:12.140> out

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
I've seen them just start to die out

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.260 
I've seen them just start to die out
after<00:03:12.830> four<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.280> six<00:03:13.520> years<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.380> longer<00:03:15.380> and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
after four to six years and longer and

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.970 
after four to six years and longer and
but<00:03:17.270> you<00:03:17.630> could<00:03:17.840> always<00:03:17.990> replace<00:03:18.560> them<00:03:18.830> with

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
but you could always replace them with

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.740 
but you could always replace them with
something<00:03:19.250> that's<00:03:19.610> going<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.850> read<00:03:20.060> with<00:03:20.600> the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
something that's going to read with the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.790 
something that's going to read with the
same<00:03:21.170> plant<00:03:21.530> that's<00:03:21.830> going<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.070> come<00:03:22.310> back<00:03:22.550> and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
same plant that's going to come back and

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
same plant that's going to come back and
fill<00:03:24.800> back<00:03:25.040> in<00:03:25.070> again

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
fill back in again

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.530 
fill back in again
so<00:03:26.060> that's<00:03:26.360> solanum<00:03:26.989> Jasmine<00:03:27.560> oits<00:03:28.540> potato
