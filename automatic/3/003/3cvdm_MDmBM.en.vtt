right screen which is coming up its dot
you<00:04:44.380> do<00:04:44.530> not<00:04:44.680> want<00:04:44.860> to<00:04:44.920> hit<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.190> it<00:04:45.310> it's<00:04:45.490> pretty

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
you do not want to hit to it it's pretty

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.120 
you do not want to hit to it it's pretty
much<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.720> you<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.230> won't<00:04:47.470> think<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:47.919> as<00:04:47.980> out

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
much to you you won't think of it as out

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.900 
much to you you won't think of it as out
of<00:04:48.280> bands<00:04:49.260> so<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.380> dogleg<00:04:50.890> is<00:04:51.100> an<00:04:51.250> L<00:04:51.430> shape<00:04:51.760> you

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
of bands so the dogleg is an L shape you

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.480 
of bands so the dogleg is an L shape you
can<00:04:52.060> see<00:04:52.240> here<00:04:52.540> so<00:04:53.500> now<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:54.040> just<00:04:54.160> want<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.400> hit

under the stump not over if you hit it

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.430 
under the stump not over if you hit it
over<00:05:01.480> it<00:05:01.720> you're<00:05:01.810> going<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:01.990> go<00:05:02.110> straight<00:05:02.350> out

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
over it you're going to go straight out

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:11.100 
over it you're going to go straight out
of<00:05:02.620> em<00:05:02.890> so<00:05:03.310> here<00:05:03.730> you<00:05:03.820> go<00:05:09.660> if<00:05:10.660> you<00:05:10.750> get<00:05:10.870> stuck

behind the trees it doesn't matter you
just<00:05:13.390> hit<00:05:13.530> into<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.620> fairway<00:05:14.860> chip<00:05:15.220> into<00:05:15.520> it

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
just hit into the fairway chip into it

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.530 
just hit into the fairway chip into it
it'll<00:05:17.470> cost<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:17.979> your<00:05:18.070> structure<00:05:18.520> so<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.060> might

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
it'll cost you your structure so I might

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.210 
it'll cost you your structure so I might
I<00:05:19.750> might<00:05:19.870> recommend<00:05:20.490> saying<00:05:21.490> clear<00:05:21.820> them<00:05:23.220> all

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
I might recommend saying clear them all

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
it's going to curve and go out of bounds

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.190 
it's going to curve and go out of bounds
there's<00:05:31.210> one<00:05:31.240> of<00:05:31.390> the<00:05:31.450> hardest<00:05:31.810> holes<00:05:31.990> in<00:05:32.140> a

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
there's one of the hardest holes in a

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.900 
there's one of the hardest holes in a
beginner<00:05:32.500> level

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.080 

so<00:05:39.510> you<00:05:39.570> all<00:05:40.020> end<00:05:40.260> up<00:05:40.440> in<00:05:40.740> Windham<00:05:41.670> it's<00:05:41.820> rough

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
so you all end up in Windham it's rough

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.540 
so you all end up in Windham it's rough
right<00:05:42.390> here<00:05:42.750> this<00:05:43.350> little<00:05:44.810> island<00:05:45.810> of<00:05:46.290> rough

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
right here this little island of rough

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.070 
right here this little island of rough
klaroline<00:05:47.550> Islands<00:05:48.060> connected<00:05:48.360> arm<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:48.990> the

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
klaroline Islands connected arm of the

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.320 
klaroline Islands connected arm of the
name<00:05:49.260> I'll<00:05:49.530> just<00:05:49.740> call<00:05:49.920> it<00:05:50.040> normally<00:05:50.340> so<00:05:51.270> you

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
name I'll just call it normally so you

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.050 
name I'll just call it normally so you
see<00:05:51.510> this<00:05:51.690> it's<00:05:51.900> shorted<00:05:52.520> so<00:05:53.520> that<00:05:53.610> means<00:05:53.880> you

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
see this it's shorted so that means you

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.690 
see this it's shorted so that means you
only<00:05:54.330> want<00:05:54.600> to<00:05:54.660> hit<00:05:54.840> up<00:05:54.990> to<00:05:55.170> there<00:05:55.460> but<00:05:56.460> in<00:05:56.550> this

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
only want to hit up to there but in this

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.390 
only want to hit up to there but in this
case<00:05:56.970> you<00:05:57.210> want<00:05:57.420> to<00:05:57.480> hit<00:05:57.630> just<00:05:57.870> above<00:05:58.260> it

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
case you want to hit just above it

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.730 
case you want to hit just above it
because<00:05:59.400> it's<00:05:59.670> uphill<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.510> it's<00:06:01.230> farther<00:06:01.530> and
