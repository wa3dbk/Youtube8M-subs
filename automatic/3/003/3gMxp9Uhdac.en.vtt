between Yancy and Kurtis prob gets that

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.560 
between Yancy and Kurtis prob gets that
in<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.710> bit<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.580> whole<00:00:29.730> point<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> side

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
in a bit the whole point of the side

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.330 
in a bit the whole point of the side
quest<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.619> obtain<00:00:31.769> Pokemon

quest is so that you can obtain Pokemon

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.740 
quest is so that you can obtain Pokemon
that<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.610> can't<00:00:32.850> normally<00:00:33.000> get<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> game

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
that you can't normally get in the game

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.470 
that you can't normally get in the game
such<00:00:34.200> as<00:00:34.230> togepi<00:00:34.860> spinder<00:00:35.460> teddiursa<00:00:35.820> spirit

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
such as togepi spinder teddiursa spirit

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.549 
such as togepi spinder teddiursa spirit
ohm<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.780> Snorlax

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
ohm and Snorlax

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.770 
ohm and Snorlax
so<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> first<00:00:38.340> step<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> fly<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> ten<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
so the first step is to fly to ten of

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.930 
so the first step is to fly to ten of
the<00:00:39.899> 15<00:00:40.290> locations<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.950> show<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.340> video<00:00:41.520> if
