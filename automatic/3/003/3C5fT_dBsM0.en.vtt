00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.670
 Further city presented European 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.160
 media representatives interesting news 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.259
 their public first occurs in the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.089
 next february that someone paris 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.670
 have and next year in the market 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.859
 will be available 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.289
 new in the program of vÃ¤derstad is opus 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.330
 a strong and flexible Europe in 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.099
 working widths of six and seven 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.900
 meters 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.240
 Europe can be up to 40 inches deep 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.460
 The tines are over three 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.210
 beams are distributed and show a line 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.640
 distance of 27 centimeters at one 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.219
 frame height of 80 centimeters comes 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.890
 opus also with large quantities of organic 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.590
 Substance with moderate traction required 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.570
 right up to 20 different 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.989
 Combinations approach and baffles 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.520
 offers further city for opus the farmer 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.520
 So with this machine over 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.420
 a great flexibility regarding 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.390
 help with changing 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.800
 Ground conditions will focus on two 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.409
 be available 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.659
 with the double pillars and with one 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.760
 steel roller these rollers are 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.960
 interchangeable and can also be quite 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.360
 be reduced 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.580
 the pressure on the rollers can thereby 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.979
 be customized 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.900
 then weiterstadt adds its short 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.600
 slotted corners of the type carrier with the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.930
 series l and extends the previous xl 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.299
 Variant with working widths from 425 to 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.720
 eight yards 25 down 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.210
 This reel has a disc of 51 centimeters 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.210
 diameter the xl variants with such 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.979
 61 centimeters are the machines 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.320
 designed to handle high volumes 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.700
 to handle residues and can now 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.740
 also work deeper 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.979
 an adjustable cut angle 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.939
 It always allows the whole floor 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.810
 regardless of the work depth too 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.119
 to edit 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.030
 even with this machine is a wide 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.189
 Program attorney available for optimal 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.189
 ground closure for a quick location 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.570
 to ensure the harvest arrears 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.840
 by the exchange of slices can 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.130
 to run from a carrier xl 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.860
 or vice versa from an xl version one 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.110
 Machine The machine can also be at eight 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.880
 meters working width one transport height 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.880
 of 4 meters and a width of three 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.470
 comply with the standards 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.900
 under the slogan rebirth of one 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.319
 vÃ¤derstad has the seeder 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.269
 rapidly evolving the satan has one 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.610
 got new design and became light 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.010
 Pulled forward to gain access to 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.720
 machine to improve 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.209
 is stored together with maintenance-free 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.130
 the service now simply the number of 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.110
 fog could be reduced 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.810
 the machine has one 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.180
 hydraulic metering with the variable 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.870
 quantities can be applied 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.299
 in combination of local like and one 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.610
 ipad can change the seed drill on request 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.769
 controlled by a wireless communication 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.720
 become 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.480
 ease of use cost efficiency 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.140
 and easy updates are the advantages 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.840
 This ipad solution is rapid 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.310
 a new after rule equipped 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.250
 it in a mechanical or 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.140
 hydraulic execution gives at the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.760
 Hydraulic version can be the pressure 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.780
 while driving out of the tractor 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.780
 be adjusted
