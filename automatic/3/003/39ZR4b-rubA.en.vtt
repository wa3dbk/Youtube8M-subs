00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
with iOS 6 is that's why I'm using right

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.870 
with iOS 6 is that's why I'm using right
now<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.390> jailbroken<00:00:55.079> iOS<00:00:55.230> 6<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.760> go

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
now to jailbroken iOS 6 and so if we go

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.220 
now to jailbroken iOS 6 and so if we go
into<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> United<00:00:57.450> music<00:00:57.540> app<00:00:57.899> or<00:00:58.050> whether

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
into the United music app or whether

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.470 
into the United music app or whether
it's<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.590> stock<00:00:58.980> OS<00:00:59.190> six<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.760> me<00:00:59.880> I'm<00:01:00.239> not

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
it's just stock OS six for me I'm not

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
it's just stock OS six for me I'm not
sure<00:01:00.540> if<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:00.960> actually<00:01:01.290> includes<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.800> theme

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
sure if it's actually includes the theme

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.380 
sure if it's actually includes the theme
maybe<00:01:02.220> it's<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.460> because<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.820> iOS<00:01:03.180> 6

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
maybe it's just because the iOS 6

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.240 
maybe it's just because the iOS 6
doesn't<00:01:03.690> support<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.079> and<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.070> far<00:01:05.189> as

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
doesn't support that and but as far as

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.950 
doesn't support that and but as far as
the<00:01:05.369> icon<00:01:05.670> set<00:01:05.850> goes<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.479> what

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the icon set goes this is what

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.620 
the icon set goes this is what
psychology<00:01:07.770> you've<00:01:07.950> got<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.450> circles<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
psychology you've got the circles of the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.709 
psychology you've got the circles of the
icons<00:01:10.399> which<00:01:11.399> looks<00:01:11.579> really<00:01:11.790> good<00:01:11.939> especially

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
icons which looks really good especially

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.480 
icons which looks really good especially
the<00:01:12.869> icons<00:01:13.290> aren't<00:01:13.680> actually<00:01:13.920> skinned<00:01:14.219> and

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the icons aren't actually skinned and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.430 
the icons aren't actually skinned and
they<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.479> know<00:01:15.510> don't<00:01:15.840> stand<00:01:16.080> out<00:01:16.229> too<00:01:16.409> much

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
they you know don't stand out too much

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.020 
they you know don't stand out too much
which<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.860> sort<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.370> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.549> main<00:01:17.729> things
