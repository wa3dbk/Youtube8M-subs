00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
pattern as called for and the steps I

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.620 
pattern as called for and the steps I
lost<00:02:28.430> count<00:02:28.640> 1<00:02:29.300> 2<00:02:29.600> 3<00:02:29.630> 4<00:02:30.260> 5<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:31.550> then<00:02:32.000> we<00:02:32.090> skip<00:02:32.330> 3

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
lost count 1 2 3 4 5 and then we skip 3

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.810 
lost count 1 2 3 4 5 and then we skip 3
1<00:02:32.960> 2<00:02:33.350> 3<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.190> go<00:02:34.460> in<00:02:34.580> there<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.950> again<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
1 2 3 and go in there so again in the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.280 
1 2 3 and go in there so again in the
interest<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.300> time<00:02:38.510> let's<00:02:38.780> pretend<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.140> I've

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
interest of time let's pretend that I've

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.720 
interest of time let's pretend that I've
gotten<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.770> very<00:02:39.950> end<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.190> my<00:02:40.310> piece<00:02:40.520> we'll

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
gotten to the very end of my piece we'll

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.520 
gotten to the very end of my piece we'll
just<00:02:40.880> pretend<00:02:41.000> that's<00:02:41.270> gone<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:42.080> we<00:02:42.200> flip<00:02:42.410> it

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
just pretend that's gone and we flip it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.479 
just pretend that's gone and we flip it
over<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:46.450> now<00:02:47.450> we've<00:02:47.630> got<00:02:47.810> all<00:02:47.900> these<00:02:48.140> cool

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
over and now we've got all these cool

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.250 
over and now we've got all these cool
loop-de-loops<00:02:49.489> so<00:02:50.650> for<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.739> next<00:02:52.190> row<00:02:52.430> and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
loop-de-loops so for the next row and

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.990 
loop-de-loops so for the next row and
from<00:02:54.260> for<00:02:54.709> all<00:02:54.739> subsequent<00:02:55.310> rows<00:02:55.730> if<00:02:55.940> you

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
from for all subsequent rows if you

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.820 
from for all subsequent rows if you
decided<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.420> do<00:02:56.600> this<00:02:56.750> for<00:02:56.930> 20<00:02:57.230> rows<00:02:57.410> or<00:02:57.680> just

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
decided to do this for 20 rows or just

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.170 
decided to do this for 20 rows or just
one<00:02:57.980> more<00:02:58.100> row<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:58.610> what<00:02:58.760> you'll<00:02:58.910> do

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
one more row this is what you'll do

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.050 
one more row this is what you'll do
every<00:02:59.570> time<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.920> you're<00:03:01.280> going<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.520> chain<00:03:01.760> 5

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
every time so you're going to chain 5

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:11.199 
every time so you're going to chain 5
again<00:03:02.090> 1<00:03:02.840> 2<00:03:03.760> 3<00:03:05.140> 4<00:03:07.000> 5<00:03:08.709> then<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:10.100> single<00:03:10.850> crochet

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
again 1 2 3 4 5 then you single crochet

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.860 
again 1 2 3 4 5 then you single crochet
in<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:13.040> 5<00:03:13.370> chain<00:03:13.760> space<00:03:14.150> which<00:03:14.390> means<00:03:14.630> right

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
in this 5 chain space which means right

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.120 
in this 5 chain space which means right
through<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.140> loop<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.799> makes<00:03:15.980> this

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
through the loop and so that makes this

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.610 
through the loop and so that makes this
so<00:03:16.400> easy<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:17.299> you'll<00:03:17.930> start<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.290> get<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.530> a

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
so easy and you'll start to get in a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.530 
so easy and you'll start to get in a
groove<00:03:18.980> that<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.610> can<00:03:19.760> just<00:03:19.940> do<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.180> by<00:03:20.269> feel

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
groove that you can just do it by feel

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.370 
groove that you can just do it by feel
and<00:03:21.459> so<00:03:22.459> it'll<00:03:22.670> go<00:03:22.790> really<00:03:23.000> fast<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.260> can

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
and so it'll go really fast and you can

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.110 
and so it'll go really fast and you can
do<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:24.530> while<00:03:24.590> you're<00:03:24.680> watching<00:03:24.739> TV<00:03:25.040> 1<00:03:25.640> 2<00:03:26.360> 3<00:03:27.170> 4<00:03:28.120> 5

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
do it while you're watching TV 1 2 3 4 5

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.490 
do it while you're watching TV 1 2 3 4 5
you're<00:03:29.510> going<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.690> go<00:03:29.780> ahead<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.049> skip<00:03:30.440> that

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
you're going to go ahead and skip that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.380 
you're going to go ahead and skip that
single<00:03:31.040> crochet<00:03:31.130> from<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.610> row<00:03:31.760> before<00:03:31.910> and

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
single crochet from the row before and

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.479 
single crochet from the row before and
go<00:03:32.959> straight<00:03:33.380> into<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:36.260> next<00:03:36.350> 5<00:03:36.890> chain<00:03:37.130> space

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
go straight into the next 5 chain space

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.400 
go straight into the next 5 chain space
the<00:03:37.760> loop<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.209> it's<00:03:38.540> single<00:03:38.840> crochet<00:03:39.170> there

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
the loop and it's single crochet there

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.770 
the loop and it's single crochet there
and<00:03:39.620> what<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.580> can<00:03:40.730> see<00:03:40.970> forming<00:03:43.510> it's<00:03:44.510> sort

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
and what you can see forming it's sort

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.039 
and what you can see forming it's sort
of<00:03:44.870> like<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.500> almost<00:03:45.709> looks<00:03:45.920> like<00:03:46.480> scales<00:03:47.480> you

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
of like it almost looks like scales you

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.960 
of like it almost looks like scales you
know<00:03:48.200> like<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.410> little<00:03:48.560> mermaid<00:03:49.040> tail<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.940> can

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
know like a little mermaid tail you can

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.220 
know like a little mermaid tail you can
see<00:03:50.330> how<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.540> scallops<00:03:51.340> are<00:03:52.340> forming<00:03:53.230> and

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
see how the scallops are forming and

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.530 
see how the scallops are forming and
that's<00:03:54.560> all<00:03:54.799> there<00:03:55.040> is<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.489> it's<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:56.030> fast

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
that's all there is to it it's so fast

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.320 
that's all there is to it it's so fast
it's<00:03:57.049> really<00:03:57.350> simple<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:58.280> it's<00:03:58.700> got<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:58.970> great

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
it's really simple and it's got a great

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.810 
it's really simple and it's got a great
drape<00:03:59.930> I<00:04:00.230> highly<00:04:00.950> recommend<00:04:01.370> choosing<00:04:01.580> this

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
drape I highly recommend choosing this

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.300 
drape I highly recommend choosing this
one<00:04:02.000> especially<00:04:02.299> if<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:03.290> are<00:04:03.650> working<00:04:04.130> on<00:04:04.220> the

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
one especially if you are working on the

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.009 
one especially if you are working on the
show<00:04:04.459> we<00:04:04.580> wrap<00:04:04.820> all<00:04:05.420> right<00:04:05.540> that's<00:04:05.750> all<00:04:05.870> there

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
show we wrap all right that's all there

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.440 
show we wrap all right that's all there
is<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.290> it
