00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
a tick it sends a lag spikes which is

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.170 
a tick it sends a lag spikes which is
called<00:06:03.720> cannes<00:06:04.110> directed<00:06:04.620> like<00:06:04.830> spikes<00:06:05.190> so

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
called cannes directed like spikes so

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.340 
called cannes directed like spikes so
what<00:06:06.300> you<00:06:06.360> do<00:06:06.479> should<00:06:06.750> go<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:06.990> go<00:06:07.140> to<00:06:07.200> the
