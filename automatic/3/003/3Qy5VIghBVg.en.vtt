00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
application of black please do note this

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.500 
application of black please do note this
is<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.010> ten<00:00:55.490> year<00:00:55.610> old<00:00:55.760> car<00:00:55.970> but<00:00:56.090> what<00:00:56.239> has<00:00:56.330> done

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
is a ten year old car but what has done

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.510 
is a ten year old car but what has done
this<00:00:56.720> most<00:00:56.930> likely<00:00:57.080> beyond<00:00:57.770> just<00:00:58.160> general

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
this most likely beyond just general

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.270 
this most likely beyond just general
exposure<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:59.290> silicone<00:01:00.290> type<00:01:00.500> products<00:01:00.950> armor

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
exposure is silicone type products armor

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.460 
exposure is silicone type products armor
all<00:01:01.400> type<00:01:01.820> products<00:01:02.239> have<00:01:02.870> actually<00:01:03.230> caused

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
all type products have actually caused

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.590 
all type products have actually caused
this<00:01:03.680> damage<00:01:04.600> so<00:01:05.600> we<00:01:05.780> simply<00:01:06.140> two<00:01:06.590> coats

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
this damage so we simply two coats

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.170 
this damage so we simply two coats
and<00:01:08.690> you<00:01:09.290> want<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:09.590> wipe<00:01:09.740> it<00:01:09.890> on<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.040> clean<00:01:10.490> dry

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
and you want to wipe it on a clean dry

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.330 
and you want to wipe it on a clean dry
surface<00:01:11.470> fully<00:01:12.470> silicone<00:01:13.070> free<00:01:13.340> surface

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.030 

and<00:01:17.549> that's<00:01:18.360> it

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and that's it

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.530 
and that's it
expecting<00:01:21.040> two<00:01:21.550> coats<00:01:21.940> would<00:01:22.240> be<00:01:22.360> necessary

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
expecting two coats would be necessary

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.220 
expecting two coats would be necessary
considering<00:01:23.470> how<00:01:23.710> much<00:01:24.150> carbon<00:01:25.150> black<00:01:25.360> has

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
considering how much carbon black has

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.200 
considering how much carbon black has
actually<00:01:26.650> been<00:01:26.740> lost<00:01:27.070> yeah<00:01:27.490> do<00:01:27.700> get<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:28.120> get

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
actually been lost yeah do get it to get
