heard by the masses and also putting it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.160 
heard by the masses and also putting it
next<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.830> a<00:00:40.920> certain<00:00:41.640> visual<00:00:41.910> gives<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
next to a certain visual gives it a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.930 
next to a certain visual gives it a
totally<00:00:43.739> different<00:00:44.070> connotation<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
totally different connotation and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
totally different connotation and
meaning<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.900> you<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> think<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.250> be

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
meaning and you know I think that can be

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.450 
meaning and you know I think that can be
quite<00:00:47.550> an<00:00:47.640> interesting<00:00:48.830> way<00:00:49.830> of<00:00:49.860> looking<00:00:50.040> at

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
quite an interesting way of looking at

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.610 
quite an interesting way of looking at
music<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.090> wouldn't<00:00:51.300> normally<00:00:51.620> you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
music that you wouldn't normally you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.720 
music that you wouldn't normally you
know<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.570> what<00:00:54.570> else<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.050> suppose<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.739> don't

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
know do that what else I suppose I don't

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.149 
know do that what else I suppose I don't
know<00:00:56.970> it<00:00:57.090> was<00:00:57.150> just<00:00:57.239> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.530> inspiration

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159

know it was just kind of the inspiration
really<00:00:59.489> came<00:00:59.729> specifically<00:01:00.360> from<00:01:00.629> good<00:01:00.960> film

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
going to ask or maybe not um oh I don't

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.120 
going to ask or maybe not um oh I don't
know<00:01:43.990> just<00:01:44.230> because<00:01:44.350> you<00:01:44.830> know<00:01:44.980> I'm<00:01:45.070> a

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
know just because you know I'm a

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.650 
know just because you know I'm a
musician<00:01:45.370> and<00:01:45.730> that's<00:01:45.910> what<00:01:46.090> I'd<00:01:46.180> like<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.360> do

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.850 
and you know I don't think of going into
I<00:01:49.360> think<00:01:49.660> if<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.810> go<00:01:49.840> into<00:01:50.050> films<00:01:50.560> in

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
I think if you go into films in

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.680 
I think if you go into films in
different<00:01:51.550> ways<00:01:51.670> especially<00:01:51.970> as<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.450> musician

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690

different ways especially as a musician
you<00:01:52.960> just<00:01:53.170> go<00:01:53.350> into<00:01:53.590> it<00:01:53.740> as<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.890> musician<00:01:54.220> and

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
you just go into it as a musician and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.760 
you just go into it as a musician and
you<00:01:55.210> know<00:01:55.330> right<00:01:55.630> for<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.050> rather<00:01:56.410> than<00:01:56.590> act

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.300 

um<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:03.180> got<00:02:03.539> asked<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.810> do<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.109> by<00:02:04.289> norwegian<00:02:04.979> TV
