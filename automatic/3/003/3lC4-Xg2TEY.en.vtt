as<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.599> said<00:02:40.629> Madison<00:02:41.349> it<00:02:41.440> says<00:02:41.620> fib<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.879> it

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
as you said Madison it says fib so is it

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.869 
as you said Madison it says fib so is it
just<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.450> government-controlled<00:02:44.170> UFO<00:02:45.099> that

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
just a government-controlled UFO that

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.880 
just a government-controlled UFO that
could<00:02:46.120> be<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.390> case<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.200> one<00:02:47.379> thing<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.650> wanted

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
could be the case the one thing I wanted

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.380 
could be the case the one thing I wanted
to<00:02:47.950> point<00:02:48.040> out<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.489> we've<00:02:48.730> actually<00:02:48.910> yet<00:02:49.239> to

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
to point out that we've actually yet to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.809 
to point out that we've actually yet to
point<00:02:49.660> out<00:02:49.780> here<00:02:49.810> at<00:02:50.260> tripi<00:02:51.010> commentaries<00:02:51.700> I

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
point out here at tripi commentaries I

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.369 
point out here at tripi commentaries I
know<00:02:51.879> other<00:02:52.269> people<00:02:52.629> have<00:02:52.720> mentioned<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.200> is

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
know other people have mentioned it is

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.339 
know other people have mentioned it is
that<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.010> think<00:02:54.129> that<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:55.329> three<00:02:55.599> main<00:02:55.780> symbols

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
that I think that the three main symbols

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.470 
that I think that the three main symbols
on<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.799> chiliad<00:02:57.160> mystery<00:02:57.670> mural<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.180> course

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
on the chiliad mystery mural of course

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.630 
on the chiliad mystery mural of course
you<00:02:58.629> have<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.319> UFO<00:02:59.769> which<00:03:00.069> were<00:03:00.220> on<00:03:00.340> top<00:03:00.609> of

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
you have the UFO which were on top of

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.140 
you have the UFO which were on top of
right<00:03:00.970> now<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.780> other<00:03:02.019> symbol<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.760> egg

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
right now the other symbol is the egg

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.720 
right now the other symbol is the egg
and<00:03:04.629> then<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.290> last<00:03:05.410> symbol<00:03:05.769> is<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.069> jetpack

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
and then the last symbol is the jetpack

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.300 
and then the last symbol is the jetpack
now<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.150> think<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.690> egg<00:03:08.170> might<00:03:09.010> actually

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
now I think that that egg might actually

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.569 
now I think that that egg might actually
be<00:03:09.670> referring<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.200> UFO<00:03:11.889> right<00:03:12.250> here

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
be referring to this UFO right here

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.460 
be referring to this UFO right here
because<00:03:12.730> if<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.120> look<00:03:13.359> on<00:03:13.569> top<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.109> it<00:03:14.260> you

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
because if you look on top of it you

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.970 
because if you look on top of it you
have<00:03:15.540> some<00:03:16.540> eggs<00:03:16.780> symbols<00:03:17.440> now<00:03:17.620> they<00:03:17.799> don't

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
have some eggs symbols now they don't

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.490 
have some eggs symbols now they don't
have<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.400> crack<00:03:18.700> in<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.000> middle<00:03:19.269> there's<00:03:19.900> six

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
have the crack in the middle there's six

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.059 
have the crack in the middle there's six
eggs<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:22.120> maybe<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:23.139> is<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.410> exact<00:03:23.859> eggs

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
eggs so maybe that is the exact eggs

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.650 
eggs so maybe that is the exact eggs
because<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.430> me<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:25.000> clearly<00:03:25.359> in<00:03:25.569> an

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
because to me it's clearly in an

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.229 
because to me it's clearly in an
egg-shaped<00:03:25.870> or<00:03:26.739> egg<00:03:27.250> shape<00:03:27.549> so<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.790> think<00:03:27.910> that

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
egg-shaped or egg shape so I think that

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.849 
egg-shaped or egg shape so I think that
this<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.750> what<00:03:28.959> they're<00:03:29.079> referring<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.680> you

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
this is what they're referring to you

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.120 
this is what they're referring to you
have<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.250> UFO<00:03:30.669> the<00:03:31.209> egg<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.840> maybe<00:03:32.620> the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
have the UFO the egg and maybe the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.550 
have the UFO the egg and maybe the
jetpack<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:34.030> linked<00:03:34.569> to<00:03:34.630> this<00:03:34.810> UFO<00:03:35.230> as<00:03:35.349> well

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
jetpack is linked to this UFO as well

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.069 
jetpack is linked to this UFO as well
Madison<00:03:35.980> maybe<00:03:36.579> it's<00:03:36.790> inside<00:03:37.000> of<00:03:37.299> it<00:03:37.599> I<00:03:37.810> mean

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
Madison maybe it's inside of it I mean

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.680 
Madison maybe it's inside of it I mean
that's<00:03:38.349> possibility<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.489> know<00:03:39.910> your<00:03:40.269> current

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
that's possibility I know your current

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.780 
that's possibility I know your current
theory<00:03:41.079> is<00:03:41.109> you<00:03:41.530> think<00:03:41.829> because<00:03:42.190> these<00:03:42.340> UFOs

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
theory is you think because these UFOs

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.240 
theory is you think because these UFOs
are<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.150> useless<00:03:43.389> so<00:03:43.780> far<00:03:44.079> is<00:03:44.919> that<00:03:44.980> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
are so useless so far is that the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.220 
are so useless so far is that the
jetpack<00:03:45.669> is<00:03:45.700> currently<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.419> this<00:03:46.599> UFO<00:03:46.989> right

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
jetpack is currently in this UFO right

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.420 
jetpack is currently in this UFO right
oh<00:03:47.380> that<00:03:48.340> would<00:03:48.459> be<00:03:48.900> I'd<00:03:49.900> be<00:03:49.959> nice<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.680> mean<00:03:51.190> it's

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
oh that would be I'd be nice I mean it's

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.240 
oh that would be I'd be nice I mean it's
out<00:03:51.579> of<00:03:51.609> you<00:03:51.760> somewhere<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:53.230> how<00:03:53.739> do<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:53.980> think

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
we're gonna get the jetpack if it is in

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.020 
we're gonna get the jetpack if it is in
the<00:03:56.049> UFO<00:03:56.500> do<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:56.799> think<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.130> will<00:03:57.280> be<00:03:57.340> abducted

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.509 
the UFO do you think we will be abducted
by<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.269> and<00:03:58.630> then<00:03:58.780> somehow<00:03:59.079> maybe<00:03:59.440> take<00:04:00.370> out

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
by it and then somehow maybe take out

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.339 
by it and then somehow maybe take out
the<00:04:00.700> aliens<00:04:01.120> on<00:04:01.299> board<00:04:01.629> leave<00:04:02.109> with<00:04:02.260> the

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
free roam mode very interesting I think

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.350 
free roam mode very interesting I think
there's<00:05:12.800> still<00:05:12.979> a<00:05:13.039> way<00:05:13.250> to<00:05:13.280> get<00:05:13.580> in<00:05:13.729> that<00:05:13.759> UFO<00:05:14.330> I

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
there's still a way to get in that UFO I

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.119 
there's still a way to get in that UFO I
know<00:05:14.539> you're<00:05:14.840> blocking<00:05:15.620> that<00:05:15.770> they're<00:05:15.979> gonna

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:16.129 
know you're blocking that they're gonna

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.980 
know you're blocking that they're gonna
definitely<00:05:16.550> abduct<00:05:17.180> you<00:05:17.419> because<00:05:17.810> they're

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
definitely abduct you because they're

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.600 
definitely abduct you because they're
just<00:05:18.229> chillin<00:05:18.620> up<00:05:18.740> there<00:05:18.949> waiting<00:05:19.370> for<00:05:19.400> the

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
just chillin up there waiting for the

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.300 
just chillin up there waiting for the
right<00:05:19.789> moment<00:05:19.849> and<00:05:20.419> this<00:05:20.900> is<00:05:21.050> my<00:05:21.199> theory<00:05:21.530> you

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
right moment and this is my theory you

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.360 
right moment and this is my theory you
know<00:05:22.430> only<00:05:22.849> at<00:05:22.969> each<00:05:23.240> their<00:05:23.569> own<00:05:23.599> but<00:05:23.960> I<00:05:24.949> think

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
know only at each their own but I think

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.980 
know only at each their own but I think
that<00:05:25.550> they're<00:05:25.759> just<00:05:25.969> showing<00:05:26.210> up<00:05:26.419> there<00:05:26.630> and

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
that they're just showing up there and

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.050 
that they're just showing up there and
the<00:05:27.319> students<00:05:27.710> we<00:05:27.830> make<00:05:28.009> like<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.460> certain<00:05:28.849> move

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
the students we make like a certain move

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.689 
the students we make like a certain move
the<00:05:29.210> right<00:05:29.389> move<00:05:29.630> wrong<00:05:30.620> move<00:05:30.889> whatever<00:05:31.250> maybe

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
the right move wrong move whatever maybe

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.510 
the right move wrong move whatever maybe
it's<00:05:32.479> gonna<00:05:32.630> trigger<00:05:32.960> those<00:05:33.310> UFOs<00:05:34.310> because

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
it's gonna trigger those UFOs because

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.399 
it's gonna trigger those UFOs because
there's<00:05:34.729> three<00:05:35.029> of<00:05:35.060> them<00:05:35.240> mm-hmm<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.080> know<00:05:36.199> so

there's three of them mm-hmm you know so

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.550 
there's three of them mm-hmm you know so
maybe<00:05:36.560> there's<00:05:36.800> three<00:05:37.130> slight<00:05:38.029> goals<00:05:38.560> that

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
maybe there's three slight goals that

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.260 
maybe there's three slight goals that

the UFO above us right now that's her
current<00:06:09.169> theory<00:06:09.620> after<00:06:09.770> beating<00:06:10.699> a<00:06:10.789> storyline

current theory after beating a storyline

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.420 
current theory after beating a storyline
