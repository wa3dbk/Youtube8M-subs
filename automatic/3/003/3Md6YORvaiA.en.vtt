green<00:01:10.470> vegetable<00:01:11.130> today<00:01:11.790> many<00:01:12.060> actually<00:01:12.510> use

a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.900> bit<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> spinach<00:01:13.350> which<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.369> also<00:01:14.549> has

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
a little bit of spinach which I also has

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.890 
a little bit of spinach which I also has
quite<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> bit<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> antioxidants<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:18.210> I'm

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
quite a bit of antioxidants in it so I'm

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320 
quite a bit of antioxidants in it so I'm
using<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.380> blender<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.490> instead<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
using a blender to make this instead of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.620 
using a blender to make this instead of
a<00:01:21.450> food<00:01:21.659> processor

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
a food processor

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.710 
a food processor
so<00:01:23.630> I<00:01:24.020> do<00:01:24.140> like<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:24.650> cut<00:01:24.890> things<00:01:24.920> up<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.600> my

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
so I do like to cut things up so that my

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.110 
so I do like to cut things up so that my
blender<00:01:27.080> doesn't<00:01:27.350> have<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.620> work<00:01:27.770> too<00:01:28.040> hard<00:01:31.120> so

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
blender doesn't have to work too hard so

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.310 
blender doesn't have to work too hard so
we<00:01:32.300> do<00:01:32.510> spinach<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:34.930> actually<00:01:35.930> use<00:01:36.080> some

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
we do spinach and actually use some

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.880 
we do spinach and actually use some
parsley<00:01:36.800> in<00:01:37.250> this<00:01:37.610> which<00:01:38.600> is<00:01:38.780> great<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.560> I'm

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
parsley in this which is great and I'm

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.630 
parsley in this which is great and I'm
for<00:01:40.160> people<00:01:40.460> in<00:01:40.700> dogs<00:01:41.330> as<00:01:41.690> well<00:01:42.190> helps<00:01:43.190> get

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
for people in dogs as well helps get

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.020 
for people in dogs as well helps get
their<00:01:43.850> breath<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.330> little<00:01:44.510> bit<00:01:44.780> fresher<00:01:46.030> so

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
their breath a little bit fresher so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.950 
their breath a little bit fresher so
fresh<00:01:47.570> parsley<00:01:49.240> I'm<00:01:50.240> going<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.510> go<00:01:50.630> ahead<00:01:50.690> and
