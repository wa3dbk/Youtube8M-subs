00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
sandwiches so it's really easy to do

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.360 
sandwiches so it's really easy to do
because<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.349> can<00:02:11.590> put<00:02:11.769> different<00:02:12.069> fillings

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
because you can put different fillings

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.250 
because you can put different fillings
in<00:02:12.610> if<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.239> want<00:02:13.360> like<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.510> little<00:02:13.810> bite<00:02:13.930> mark
