00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.870
 today I want to show you how to do 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.780
 Easter cake for 4 cups of flour to us 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:18.630
 need these ingredients here 200 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:21.539
 grams of butter 20 grams of yeast 4 eggs 1 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.900
 a glass of milk or water or milk with 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:32.550
 water 150 grams of sugar and a half tea 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:36.600
 spoons of salt now mix all 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.989
 ingredients milk eggs sugar salt and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.989
 yeast 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.580
 sift flour 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.489
 now at the moment already 2 glasses 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.250
 flour 3 cups flour 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.129
 already quite thick enough on 4 already 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.180
 have interfere with the hands I shoot myself 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:12.800
 so i must udder now 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.200
 stir the dough 4 a glass of flour and we need 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.470
 add even at least half a glass because 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.400
 that the dough remained liquid and now 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.229
 it's time to start kneading 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.509
 add a little flour so that 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.880
 until there will be a uniform 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.369
 mass and dough won't stick to hands 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.649
 here in this place the dough sticks to the hands 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:40.580
 then you need to quietly like this 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:41.899
 I added literally two more kneading 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.600
 tablespoons of flour 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:48.410
 laid out on the board and now I will 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.340
 keep kneading on the board but not 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:56.350
 since i 'm doing now and so take 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.549
 unfolding beyond the edges and that's how we mess 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.760
 unfold just with one hand not 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.090
 convenient, and so the mass will have to add 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:10.519
 just a little flour just with one hand 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.560
 sorry not convenient here so add here 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.890
 see sticks need to add more 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.660
 a little flour literally pinch and 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.470
 continue to knead at the end of the batch 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.130
 add oil this is such a mass 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.140
 turned out 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.670
 Now I will add tasks a little bit 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.920
 flour here is such a bun 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.390
 that is, that's my hand here he is 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.390
 turned out big enough 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.370
 I divided the dough into 2 parts and set 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.069
 two pots will need to cover 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.739
 lid and leave to fit over 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.580
 two hours two hours dough should 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.709
 rise 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.739
 it will need to be pressed to remove and 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:55.890
 highlight if gas and leave for another 40 50 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.890
 minutes this is how the dough looks in 1 hour 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.239
 looks like dough in an hour and a half 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.069
 if you remember through tickles that is 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.709
 two hours later, all together will need 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.900
 punch dough to remove 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.230
 carbon dioxide and leave for another 40 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.230
 minutes 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.410
 Well, that's what the dough looks like in two hours 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.970
 now you can probably pinch him 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.760
 now quickly need to produce 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:37.040
 punch dough to remove carbon dioxide 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.590
 gas and alcohol which appeared during 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.990
 fermentation means you need it because I donâ€™t 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.400
 very comfortable with one hand everything you need 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:49.180
 raking in the center so to speak 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.310
 candied fruits and quick knead dough 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.400
 fired and put again on 40 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.950
 minutes in my case I have two tests in 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.080
 one dough I added candied other 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:07.100
 the test remained bland as it was 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:09.380
 let's cover the recipe now prepare the form 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.730
 as a form of my acts 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.310
 the pan inside I have smeared with oil now 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.650
 I'll sprinkle flour 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.570
 after 40 minutes, both tests rose 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.670
 enough to start them 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.560
 bake 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:30.940
 prepare a board on it we fill a little 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:33.680
 flour take one yolk 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.140
 we need a brush to 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.930
 lubricate the cake that is the top of the cake we 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:45.510
 we will grease the egg in order to be beautiful 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:48.960
 and in my opinion the cakes are ready 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:54.390
 30-40 minutes later , the cakes are ready. 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:59.670
 let them cool right in the forms well here 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:04.710
 This turned out neatly paska 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:07.250
 high but I hope you all too 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.250
 will turn out
