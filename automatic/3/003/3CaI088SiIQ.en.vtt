hello<00:00:01.260> everyone<00:00:01.530> my<00:00:02.280> name<00:00:02.310> is<00:00:02.490> Alberta

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hello everyone my name is Alberta

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.360 
hello everyone my name is Alberta
Manitoba<00:00:02.850> and<00:00:03.620> I'm<00:00:04.620> going<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.009> show<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.279> a

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
Manitoba and I'm going to show you a

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.010 
Manitoba and I'm going to show you a
little<00:00:05.520> experiment<00:00:06.240> that<00:00:06.390> I've<00:00:06.509> been<00:00:06.660> working

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
little experiment that I've been working

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.860 
little experiment that I've been working
on<00:00:07.460> this<00:00:08.460> experiment<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.210> connecting<00:00:09.719> my

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
on this experiment is connecting my

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.370 
on this experiment is connecting my
nexus<00:00:10.380> s<00:00:10.559> phone<00:00:11.040> which<00:00:11.820> runs<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.420> android<00:00:12.719> OS

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
nexus s phone which runs the android OS

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.320 
nexus s phone which runs the android OS
to<00:00:14.280> arduino<00:00:14.969> board<00:00:15.269> i<00:00:15.920> wrote<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> simple<00:00:17.330> tcp

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
to arduino board i wrote a simple tcp

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.609 
to arduino board i wrote a simple tcp
server<00:00:18.630> using<00:00:19.560> python<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.640> interface<00:00:21.390> with

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
server using python to interface with

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.480 
server using python to interface with
arduino<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.449> i<00:00:24.449> wrote<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> little<00:00:24.990> app<00:00:25.460> for<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
arduino and i wrote a little app for the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.900 
arduino and i wrote a little app for the
android<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:28.560> app<00:00:28.680> basically<00:00:29.010> detects<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
android the app basically detects the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.659 
android the app basically detects the
orientation<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> device<00:00:31.189> moving<00:00:32.189> upwards

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
orientation of the device moving upwards

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.810 
orientation of the device moving upwards
and<00:00:32.790> downwards<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.500> control<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.739> LED<00:00:35.550> graph

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and downwards and control the LED graph

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.549 
and downwards and control the LED graph
bar<00:00:36.030> as<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.630> see<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.870> let's<00:00:39.870> get

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
bar as you can see it here so let's get

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.840 
bar as you can see it here so let's get
this<00:00:40.920> experiment<00:00:41.610> started<00:00:43.460> first<00:00:44.460> let<00:00:44.820> me

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
this experiment started first let me

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.790 
this experiment started first let me
start<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.559> TCP<00:00:46.559> server<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:49.250> now<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:52.379> android

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
start the TCP server and now the android

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.950 
start the TCP server and now the android
app

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.580 

and<00:00:59.410> now<00:01:00.399> as<00:01:00.640> you<00:01:00.760> can<00:01:00.910> see<00:01:00.969> as<00:01:01.719> I<00:01:02.200> move<00:01:02.230> the

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
and now as you can see as I move the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:12.720 
and now as you can see as I move the
device<00:01:02.890> upwards<00:01:04.860> LEDs<00:01:05.860> show<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.430> position

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.560 

it's<00:01:13.300> a<00:01:13.360> little<00:01:13.630> bit<00:01:13.780> laggy<00:01:14.020> but<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:16.270> you<00:01:16.420> can

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
it's a little bit laggy but as you can

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.390 
it's a little bit laggy but as you can
see<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:18.450> from<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.630> server<00:01:19.840> at<00:01:20.620> equals<00:01:21.160> the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
see it and from the server at equals the

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.500 
see it and from the server at equals the
position<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.300> then<00:01:23.020> ladies<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:25.030> we<00:01:25.180> need<00:01:25.330> to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
position and then ladies that we need to

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.030 
position and then ladies that we need to
light

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.500 

so<00:01:32.700> my<00:01:33.120> next<00:01:33.360> goal<00:01:34.010> will<00:01:35.010> be<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.790> go<00:01:36.240> wireless

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
so my next goal will be to go wireless

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.610 
so my next goal will be to go wireless
with<00:01:36.840> android<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.420> arduino<00:01:39.470> using<00:01:40.470> this

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
with android and arduino using this

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.900 
with android and arduino using this
little<00:01:41.160> module<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:43.370> this<00:01:44.370> module<00:01:44.640> is

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
little module right here this module is

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.970 
little module right here this module is
the<00:01:45.590> blue<00:01:46.590> smurf<00:01:47.000> bluetooth<00:01:48.000> module<00:01:48.770> which<00:01:49.770> i

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
the blue smurf bluetooth module which i

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.310 
the blue smurf bluetooth module which i
will<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.310> connecting<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.180> andrew<00:01:51.660> to<00:01:52.050> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
will be connecting to andrew to the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.580 
will be connecting to andrew to the
arduino<00:01:52.860> board<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:54.450> go<00:01:54.600> wireless<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:55.610> it

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
arduino board and to go wireless with it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.360 
arduino board and to go wireless with it
so<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:59.400> it<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.060> experiment<00:02:00.510> and<00:02:01.370> for

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
so that's it for this experiment and for

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.300 
so that's it for this experiment and for
