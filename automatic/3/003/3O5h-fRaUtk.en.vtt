00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello everyone and today we will talk on the topic 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.509
 rhythm is actually a crucial aspect 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.220
 for guitarist more important than whitewash 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.460
 watered him therefore 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.990
 touched on in more detail actually 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.630
 most of these things have been for years 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.770
 explained on the site guitarplayer.ru but I 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.170
 I think that will never be superfluous 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.880
 repeat as you can see I recorded a small 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.710
 a piece for you and now we are on it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.720
 example, see what if both 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.699
 happens start let's define 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.099
 What is exactly the game ? 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.660
 curve game rhythmic curve game this 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.520
 when a person plays too much 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.500
 forward drums well or metronome and 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.980
 any source of rhythm or too 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.840
 strongly back again or do both 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.300
 another at the same time for example a person 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.610
 can in one piece hurry up then 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.700
 be late and it turns out it all sounds 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.710
 terribly awful immoderately a man swims 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.469
 and with all the consequences 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.510
 as for the level play, its conditional 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.250
 can be divided into three parts to play it 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.170
 a little bit forward that is to some 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.100
 deviates by a small amount from 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.670
 central bit 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.010
 the game is exactly a share and the game is a little later 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.930
 shares as for styles like rock 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.750
 metal and stuff ie say so jock 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 styles there the game does not welcome forward 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.729
 the message as it is necessary to try 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.860
 play either exactly in bit or what is better 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.650
 a little behind that is playing with 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.320
 so fast let's see why 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.880
 playing forward is bad i think all 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.830
 know that in styles like rock metal 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.259
 and other basic set of 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.750
 The main drive kach create precisely bat with 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.340
 drums are more accurate even drums why 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.020
 because they have a very sharp attack 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.020
 let's say we listen to this piece 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.780
 it is these sharp such clear blasting 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.450
 blows make people stomp clap 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.430
 dance and so on bass function 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.440
 again this add power to the drum and 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.780
 guitar function is just fill 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.460
 midrange band ie guitar 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.530
 it's a tool buzzing in her on so and 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.180
 far behind drum let 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.600
 let's see how you see here at the drum 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.520
 there is some kind of walnut stick and save 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.710
 my piece of guitar I try to play 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.530
 strong enough attack but as you can see 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.200
 anyway here at the beginning there is that moment 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.500
 someone starts to learn and here such 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.330
 sharp shelves like drums have no 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.370
 now see what's important if your 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.220
 at least a little guitar like this 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.019
 climbs out earlier than the drum then she immediately 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.330
 did everyone understand the listeners takes away on 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.860
 myself I don't know this is psychoacoustics or 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.440
 where does it come from but you can do 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.480
 the simplest experiment is to take two tracks 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.910
 and the containers are absolutely even and one of them 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.900
 move a bit earlier it would immediately 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.400
 refuse louder 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.040
 that is, such an effect that it becomes 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.930
 how important it comes to the fore and 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.850
 let's say so presses under another 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.220
 track the same thing happens here 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.650
 let's first hear the whole file as 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.650
 he sounds like he was played in the original 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.750
 and now I move the guitars a little bit forward 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.750
 see what you do 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.830
 this kind of fussy wadding appears 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.840
 feeling as if the man was running 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.370
 so in priests he was given money for 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.930
 studios rock faster write and get out of here 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.760
 and here it turns out really 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.819
 It is a feeling that is a person 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.970
 presses down the drum parts 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.590
 pounds and it all sounds very loose 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.989
 now from dima guitar a little bit back here 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.500
 let's see 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.500
 what happens 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.410
 as you can see the minimum win can 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.030
 it became a little post more precisely in this 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.450
 the place where the guitar gets to work 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.950
 discount 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.290
 I advised the place let's listen and 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.629
 account piece in principle and so it sounds 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.370
 quite urgently because here such 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.700
 quite fussy party by itself 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.500
 and here the delay does not help us much 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.410
 parties Tipo Ramstein or reef Olya 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.150
 richie kotzen tomato hard right here 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.090
 once some slow group things 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.520
 here is like a toyota and just 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.260
 smooth play and quick play as you can see 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.330
 In principle, it is difficult to say where more 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.280
 creates meat falling into a barrel or from 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.139
 chase in worker because workers 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.930
 very calls with his need very very 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.620
 Exactly right here, especially carefully 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.240
 do not rush 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.950
 I will remind you again how the strap sounds 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.280
 Lenya, that is, as you can see 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.610
 here 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:54.130
 explosive blow it completely disappears 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.600
 because guitars are starting to heal 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.470
 I don't know anymore anymore 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.550
 who play this bust but to understand 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.669
 i think i can 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.110
 experiment move i think 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.970
 that you will be dreaming of a newt today 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.599
 but let's hear it again this 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.599
 once with bass 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.290
 as you can see when it all work together 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.410
 harmoniously there is a bass right there 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.270
 also not in a hurry and not too much 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.850
 is late it turns out such about on 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.590
 pressure and most important here we are moment 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.300
 this vacuum which forms before 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.950
 it is especially important to workers 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.600
 endure and how not to break not 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:40.070
 degrees rubanut earlier because it 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:41.500
 just break the whole buzz it should be straight 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.360
 how is such a slingshot stretched 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.940
 hold on and and shoot it exactly along 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.910
 a little later it will give here right here 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.920
 the most juicy sound well and now 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.020
 the most important question is how is it all over 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.030
 this work actually need 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.580
 approach from different sides the first is 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.160
 playing a metronome at a pace of 70 that is but 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.530
 for a start 70 less than 70 go down 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.020
 it makes no sense when they say you play 44 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.060
 this is nonsense starting 70 because he 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.620
 more or less alive and in 40 you will have 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.140
 clamping and in hands and psychologically this 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.790
 it's bust 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.040
 then be sure to listen to the varnish on firm 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.570
 wild guitarists that is you maybe 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.400
 do you like to this team certain 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.590
 but there the dude is playing crooked that is and 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.570
 I can do nothing on my own 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.190
 advise those who obviously plays 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.140
 very cool in rhythm this andy timmons 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.060
 and richie kotzen is the primacy of the gods of rhythm 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.680
 even if you don't like the stuff but 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.600
 I'll have to break myself a little bit because 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.740
 that there is here before the tedious work she 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.390
 just awesome cool 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.130
 next we will need to stuff 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.230
 the simplest pictures in a drum machine 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.870
 that is, put some simple ones there 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.850
 beats and try on guitar and countries for sure 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.690
 repeat this bit and then in 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.820
 audio editor 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.250
 and of course to hear what is there to hear 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.050
 happens the most important thing is to have in 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.330
 head talent and sounding right 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.950
 In principle, I call this term hearing 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.230
 the taste is also around on the crankcase 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.150
 literally a couple of years ago that is what 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.000
 it is very important to have in your head 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.070
 the correct reference sound sounded and then 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.940
 you want don't want on your hands all the work 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.370
 fit under it 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.320
 so when it sounds in your ears 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.810
 correctly shot in the working drum or 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.640
 the barrel is the nail then anyway you to 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.380
 he will come therefore it 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.720
 it is very important to tune in 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.240
 bear in mind such ready-made patterns 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.370
 sound and finally I would like to 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.710
 remind a couple of things see if 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.350
 the party you have not learned is 100% 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.540
 play forward 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.030
 and most likely criminal if 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.580
 hands clamped not warmed up all that 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.630
 same this game forward if some 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.760
 excessive excitement 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.620
 same this game forward therefore 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.930
 Remember to play with smooth 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.990
 you can only what you own on 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.670
 one hundred percent good for today is all 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.620
 be sure to read the description of the video 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.650
 because there I will throw a small test 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.270
 also on this subject and as usual 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.260
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.780
 write comments 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.840
 all good bye and good luck with development feels 

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.840
 on
