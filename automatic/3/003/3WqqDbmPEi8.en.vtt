00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
using chemicals just to see if it would

right here the nose piece I'm sorry I'm
kind<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.489> doing<00:03:28.209> this<00:03:28.329> upside<00:03:28.900> down<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.230> nose

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
kind of doing this upside down the nose

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.690 
kind of doing this upside down the nose
piece<00:03:29.709> is<00:03:31.110> adjustable<00:03:32.110> it's<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.920> real<00:03:33.340> thick

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700

piece is adjustable it's a real thick
kind<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.090> metal<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:35.230> little<00:03:36.130> bit

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
kind of metal so it is a little bit

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.280 
kind of metal so it is a little bit
harder<00:03:36.579> to<00:03:36.760> adjust<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:37.329> mean<00:03:37.450> it's<00:03:37.780> less<00:03:38.019> likely

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
harder to adjust I mean it's less likely

in the ass to adjust just because it's a

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.050 
in the ass to adjust just because it's a
little<00:03:44.440> bit<00:03:44.590> stiffer<00:03:44.890> so<00:03:45.549> we're<00:03:45.760> trying<00:03:45.970> to

and the case folds up you see if I can

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.700 
and the case folds up you see if I can
fold<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.849> the<00:04:20.940> way<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.150> was<00:04:21.289> and<00:04:22.289> sticks<00:04:22.949> in<00:04:24.710> the

headband<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.729> mask<00:04:26.970> that's<00:04:27.539> pretty<00:04:27.750> cool

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.069 
headband of the mask that's pretty cool

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.100 
headband of the mask that's pretty cool
but<00:04:29.069> this<00:04:29.789> thing<00:04:30.150> doesn't<00:04:30.569> fit<00:04:30.690> me<00:04:30.900> real<00:04:31.080> well

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
but this thing doesn't fit me real well

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.950 
but this thing doesn't fit me real well
it's<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.940> does<00:04:33.210> have<00:04:33.419> a<00:04:33.449> little<00:04:33.750> bit<00:04:33.870> of

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
it's it does have a little bit of

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.969 
it's it does have a little bit of
adjustment<00:04:34.380> but<00:04:35.300> honestly<00:04:36.300> it's<00:04:36.509> it<00:04:37.500> says<00:04:37.800> I'm

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
adjustment but honestly it's it says I'm

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.890 
adjustment but honestly it's it says I'm
here<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.580> they<00:04:38.699> do<00:04:38.759> I<00:04:38.940> guess<00:04:39.419> come<00:04:39.750> in

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
here and they do I guess come in

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.749 
here and they do I guess come in
different<00:04:40.139> sizes<00:04:40.650> let<00:04:41.130> me<00:04:41.160> just<00:04:41.430> look<00:04:41.610> on<00:04:41.729> the

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
different sizes let me just look on the

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.570 
different sizes let me just look on the
webpage<00:04:42.030> here<00:04:42.560> they<00:04:43.560> have<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.770> youth<00:04:44.039> regular

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
webpage here they have a youth regular

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.210 
webpage here they have a youth regular
and<00:04:44.880> extra<00:04:45.240> large<00:04:45.449> this<00:04:45.750> one<00:04:46.440> is<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.620> regular<00:04:46.860> it

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
and extra large this one is a regular it

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.820 
and extra large this one is a regular it
says<00:04:47.460> fits<00:04:47.729> most<00:04:47.940> but<00:04:48.330> I'm<00:04:49.169> not<00:04:49.380> a<00:04:49.409> big<00:04:49.620> dude

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
says fits most but I'm not a big dude

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.719 
says fits most but I'm not a big dude
but<00:04:50.039> I<00:04:50.099> guess<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.400> got<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.550> big<00:04:50.759> head<00:04:52.430> cuz<00:04:53.430> this<00:04:53.580> is

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
but I guess I got a big head cuz this is

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.820 
but I guess I got a big head cuz this is
a<00:04:53.759> little<00:04:54.060> bit<00:04:54.180> smaller<00:04:54.479> my<00:04:54.690> head<00:04:54.840> if<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:55.590> take

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
a little bit smaller my head if I take

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.330 
a little bit smaller my head if I take
the<00:04:56.780> little<00:04:57.780> bag<00:04:58.050> out<00:04:58.319> of<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.650> headband<00:04:59.039> or

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
the little bag out of the headband or

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.710 
the little bag out of the headband or
rather<00:04:59.460> than<00:04:59.759> you<00:05:00.000> know<00:05:00.030> like<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.360> headband

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
rather than you know like the headband

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.899 
rather than you know like the headband
there<00:05:00.930> it<00:05:01.259> does<00:05:01.620> help<00:05:01.889> a<00:05:02.039> little<00:05:02.130> bit<00:05:02.400> with<00:05:02.610> the

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
there it does help a little bit with the

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.850 
there it does help a little bit with the
size<00:05:03.120> because<00:05:04.050> with<00:05:04.199> that<00:05:04.229> in<00:05:04.530> there<00:05:04.710> just

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
size because with that in there just

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.320 
size because with that in there just
kind<00:05:05.130> of<00:05:05.220> makes<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.550> stiff<00:05:07.819> great<00:05:08.819> idea<00:05:09.150> though

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
kind of makes it stiff great idea though

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.180 
kind of makes it stiff great idea though
I<00:05:09.360> like<00:05:09.659> that<00:05:09.810> idea<00:05:09.960> of<00:05:10.289> keeping<00:05:10.949> the<00:05:11.009> bag

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
I like that idea of keeping the bag

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.649 
I like that idea of keeping the bag
right<00:05:11.430> with<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.759> mask<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.240> know<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.419> don't

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
right with the mask you know you don't

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:13.700 
right with the mask you know you don't
have<00:05:12.780> it<00:05:12.840> thrown<00:05:13.080> in<00:05:13.259> a<00:05:13.319> bag<00:05:13.470> somewhere

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
have it thrown in a bag somewhere

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.499 
have it thrown in a bag somewhere
getting<00:05:14.250> blown<00:05:14.460> away<00:05:14.699> or<00:05:14.880> lost<00:05:15.120> or<00:05:15.270> whatever

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
getting blown away or lost or whatever

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.499 
getting blown away or lost or whatever
but<00:05:16.470> it<00:05:16.710> is<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:16.889> little<00:05:17.220> bit<00:05:17.340> small<00:05:17.610> so<00:05:17.909> for<00:05:18.360> me<00:05:18.479> I

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
but it is a little bit small so for me I

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.540 
but it is a little bit small so for me I
think<00:05:18.659> I'm<00:05:19.440> trying<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.800> think<00:05:19.949> what<00:05:20.039> met<00:05:20.340> our

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
think I'm trying to think what met our

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.810 
think I'm trying to think what met our
hat<00:05:21.090> size<00:05:21.360> I<00:05:21.389> have<00:05:21.740> think<00:05:22.740> like<00:05:22.919> seven<00:05:23.639> and<00:05:23.789> a

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
hat size I have think like seven and a

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.969 
hat size I have think like seven and a
half<00:05:23.969> maybe<00:05:24.210> right<00:05:24.780> around<00:05:24.900> there<00:05:25.259> seven<00:05:25.860> and

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
half maybe right around there seven and

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.909 
half maybe right around there seven and
a<00:05:26.009> quarter<00:05:26.159> seven<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:26.639> a<00:05:26.699> half<00:05:27.560> I'd<00:05:28.560> probably

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
a quarter seven and a half I'd probably

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.560 
a quarter seven and a half I'd probably
want<00:05:29.430> if<00:05:29.669> I<00:05:29.759> was<00:05:29.849> going<00:05:30.030> to<00:05:30.060> get<00:05:30.210> it<00:05:30.330> get

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
want if I was going to get it get

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.749 
want if I was going to get it get
another<00:05:30.810> one<00:05:31.020> I<00:05:31.169> would<00:05:31.320> want<00:05:31.349> the<00:05:32.250> extra<00:05:32.580> large

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
another one I would want the extra large

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.850 
another one I would want the extra large
I<00:05:33.000> guess<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:34.130> put<00:05:35.130> it<00:05:35.219> on<00:05:35.340> here<00:05:35.669> real<00:05:35.969> quick<00:05:36.210> just

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
I guess I put it on here real quick just

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:46.360 
I guess I put it on here real quick just
kind<00:05:37.860> of<00:05:37.919> show<00:05:38.099> you<00:05:38.159> what<00:05:38.280> it<00:05:38.490> looks<00:05:38.669> like

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370

all<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.650> way<00:05:52.800> kind<00:05:53.250> of<00:05:53.460> pull<00:05:54.090> so<00:05:54.509> for<00:05:55.289> it<00:05:55.380> to<00:05:55.410> be

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
all the way kind of pull so for it to be

know<00:06:17.460> go<00:06:17.699> cheap<00:06:17.970> on<00:06:18.150> the<00:06:18.180> velcro<00:06:18.599> and<00:06:19.289> it's

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
know go cheap on the velcro and it's

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.680 
know go cheap on the velcro and it's
it's<00:06:20.070> neoprene<00:06:20.550> I<00:06:20.849> didn't<00:06:21.360> mention<00:06:21.660> that

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
it's neoprene I didn't mention that

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.230 
it's neoprene I didn't mention that
before<00:06:22.020> it's<00:06:22.410> neoprene<00:06:22.830> so<00:06:23.550> even<00:06:24.000> in<00:06:24.120> the

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
before it's neoprene so even in the

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.330 
before it's neoprene so even in the
wintertime<00:06:24.509> it<00:06:24.840> actually<00:06:25.259> it<00:06:25.889> keeps<00:06:26.190> your

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
wintertime it actually it keeps your

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.570 
wintertime it actually it keeps your
face<00:06:26.520> warm<00:06:26.940> too<00:06:27.180> so<00:06:28.020> may<00:06:29.009> keep<00:06:29.190> your<00:06:29.370> face<00:06:29.550> a

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
face warm too so may keep your face a

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.830 
face warm too so may keep your face a
little<00:06:29.820> bit<00:06:29.940> too<00:06:30.150> warm<00:06:30.330> in<00:06:30.570> a<00:06:30.660> desert

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
little bit too warm in a desert

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.140 
little bit too warm in a desert
environment<00:06:31.050> but<00:06:31.680> I<00:06:31.949> guess<00:06:32.550> as<00:06:32.729> opposed<00:06:33.030> to

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
environment but I guess as opposed to

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.140 
environment but I guess as opposed to
breathing<00:06:33.660> in<00:06:33.930> some<00:06:34.530> nasty<00:06:34.740> stuff<00:06:35.250> you<00:06:36.090> know

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
breathing in some nasty stuff you know

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.960 
breathing in some nasty stuff you know
that's<00:06:36.360> what<00:06:36.509> you<00:06:36.599> get<00:06:37.070> but<00:06:38.070> oh<00:06:38.250> no<00:06:38.490> I<00:06:38.520> like

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
that's what you get but oh no I like

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.150 
that's what you get but oh no I like
this<00:06:39.270> I<00:06:39.479> really<00:06:39.960> do<00:06:40.199> I<00:06:40.229> just<00:06:40.470> wish<00:06:40.860> I<00:06:40.979> had<00:06:41.130> a

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
this I really do I just wish I had a

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.249 
this I really do I just wish I had a
different<00:06:41.310> size<00:06:41.699> so<00:06:42.570> just<00:06:42.780> keep<00:06:42.930> that<00:06:43.080> in<00:06:43.139> mind

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 
different size so just keep that in mind

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.529 
different size so just keep that in mind
they<00:06:43.590> kinda<00:06:44.009> in<00:06:44.520> my<00:06:44.580> opinion<00:06:45.120> run<00:06:45.300> a<00:06:45.330> little

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
they kinda in my opinion run a little

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.260 
they kinda in my opinion run a little
bit<00:06:45.750> small<00:06:46.080> they<00:06:46.919> do<00:06:46.979> have<00:06:47.280> a<00:06:47.580> slight<00:06:48.060> amount

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
bit small they do have a slight amount

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.080 
bit small they do have a slight amount
of<00:06:48.449> stretch<00:06:48.750> to<00:06:48.780> it<00:06:49.020> but<00:06:49.409> if<00:06:50.370> you<00:06:50.550> have<00:06:50.669> a<00:06:50.699> seven

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
of stretch to it but if you have a seven

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.969 
of stretch to it but if you have a seven
and<00:06:51.240> a<00:06:51.270> half<00:06:51.330> everywhere<00:06:51.990> in<00:06:52.080> a<00:06:52.139> seven<00:06:52.409> 1/2<00:06:52.740> hat

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 
and a half everywhere in a seven 1/2 hat

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.159 
and a half everywhere in a seven 1/2 hat
I<00:06:53.340> would<00:06:53.970> probably<00:06:54.180> go<00:06:54.539> with<00:06:54.570> the<00:06:54.810> extra-large

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
I would probably go with the extra-large

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:03.710 
I would probably go with the extra-large
on<00:06:56.130> this<00:06:56.990> so<00:06:59.539> RZ<00:07:00.539> mask<00:07:00.900> comm<00:07:02.389> you<00:07:03.389> know<00:07:03.479> I'm

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
on this so RZ mask comm you know I'm

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.180 
on this so RZ mask comm you know I'm
sure<00:07:03.780> there's<00:07:04.199> other<00:07:04.380> alternatives<00:07:04.470> out

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
sure there's other alternatives out

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.740 
sure there's other alternatives out
there<00:07:05.250> but<00:07:05.669> I<00:07:05.699> think<00:07:05.849> this<00:07:06.180> is<00:07:06.300> kind<00:07:06.510> of<00:07:06.599> cool

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750 
there but I think this is kind of cool

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.250 
there but I think this is kind of cool
especially<00:07:07.650> given<00:07:08.550> that<00:07:08.580> you<00:07:09.060> have<00:07:09.539> multiple

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
especially given that you have multiple

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.060 
especially given that you have multiple
different<00:07:11.240> patterns<00:07:12.349> it's<00:07:13.349> I<00:07:13.560> would<00:07:13.710> I'm

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
different patterns it's I would I'm

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.460 
different patterns it's I would I'm
