that was kind of what I was going for
that<00:02:07.210> makes<00:02:07.630> sense<00:02:07.930> so<00:02:08.679> yeah<00:02:09.579> as<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.630> can<00:02:10.690> see

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
that makes sense so yeah as you can see

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.150 
that makes sense so yeah as you can see
I'm<00:02:11.019> starting<00:02:11.410> off<00:02:11.530> with<00:02:11.560> blow-dried<00:02:12.130> hair

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
I'm starting off with blow-dried hair

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.090 
I'm starting off with blow-dried hair
and<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:13.510> split<00:02:13.720> my<00:02:13.780> into<00:02:14.140> four<00:02:14.320> sections<00:02:14.500> and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
and I split my into four sections and

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.340 
and I split my into four sections and
those<00:02:15.579> four<00:02:16.060> sections<00:02:16.480> are<00:02:16.660> split<00:02:16.840> into<00:02:17.019> two

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
those four sections are split into two

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.039 
those four sections are split into two
sections<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:18.010> would<00:02:18.160> give<00:02:18.430> over<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.910> twist<00:02:19.540> in

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
sections that would give over a twist in

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:20.449 
sections that would give over a twist in
my

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
my

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.059 
my
I<00:02:20.540> literally<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.689> put<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.230> dye<00:02:22.409> in<00:02:22.709> my<00:02:22.829> hand

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
I literally just put the dye in my hand

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.990 
I literally just put the dye in my hand
and<00:02:23.430> we're<00:02:23.819> all<00:02:24.209> over<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.109> the<00:02:25.709> hair<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.250> I

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
and we're all over and the hair and I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.220 
and we're all over and the hair and I
combed<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.390> through<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.780> make<00:02:27.900> sure<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.140> is

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
combed it through to make sure it is

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.979 
combed it through to make sure it is
evenly<00:02:28.680> distributed<00:02:29.060> we<00:02:30.060> sit<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.359> back<00:02:30.390> up<00:02:30.750> and

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
evenly distributed we sit it back up and

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.380 
evenly distributed we sit it back up and
moved<00:02:31.260> on<00:02:31.439> to<00:02:31.469> the<00:02:31.620> next<00:02:31.859> one<00:02:32.069> I<00:02:32.430> had<00:02:33.180> two

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
moved on to the next one I had two

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.599 
moved on to the next one I had two
bottles<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.870> dye<00:02:34.079> so<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.859> probably<00:02:35.099> went<00:02:35.370> round

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
bottles of dye so I probably went round

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.369 
bottles of dye so I probably went round
my<00:02:35.819> head's<00:02:36.000> about<00:02:36.060> four<00:02:36.450> or<00:02:36.510> five<00:02:36.750> times<00:02:36.780> to

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
my head's about four or five times to

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.750 
my head's about four or five times to
use<00:02:37.620> all<00:02:37.829> of<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.069> diet

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
use all of the diet

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.360 
use all of the diet
I<00:02:38.810> put<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.959> dye<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.200> around<00:02:40.739> my<00:02:40.980> head<00:02:41.159> in<00:02:41.280> a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
I put the dye on around my head in a

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.160 
I put the dye on around my head in a
certain<00:02:41.700> order<00:02:41.939> so<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.450> made<00:02:42.689> sure<00:02:42.719> that<00:02:42.989> I

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
certain order so I made sure that I

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.009 
certain order so I made sure that I
shampoo<00:02:43.549> BL<00:02:44.549> in<00:02:44.849> that<00:02:45.060> same<00:02:45.269> order<00:02:45.689> and<00:02:45.900> a

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
shampoo BL in that same order and a

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.440 
shampoo BL in that same order and a
major<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.620> conditioned<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.609> in<00:02:48.030> that

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
major that I conditioned it in that

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.209 
major that I conditioned it in that
order<00:02:48.659> I<00:02:49.109> don't<00:02:49.500> know<00:02:49.620> if<00:02:49.680> that's<00:02:49.920> me<00:02:50.189> just

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:50.219 
order I don't know if that's me just

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.979 
order I don't know if that's me just
been<00:02:50.549> over<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.879> top<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.329> felt<00:02:51.659> that<00:02:51.840> you

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
been over the top but I felt that you

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.490 
been over the top but I felt that you
made<00:02:52.200> sure<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.849> divers<00:02:53.849> on<00:02:54.000> each<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:55.079> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
made sure that divers on each this the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.610 
made sure that divers on each this the
same<00:02:55.769> amount<00:02:56.099> of<00:02:56.220> K<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:57.030> left<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.049> tie<00:02:58.230> on<00:02:58.379> for

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
same amount of K I left the tie on for

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.009 
same amount of K I left the tie on for
an<00:02:58.709> hour<00:02:58.889> I<00:02:59.370> know<00:02:59.459> that's<00:02:59.939> bad<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.510> was<00:03:00.900> only

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
an hour I know that's bad I was only

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.629 
an hour I know that's bad I was only
supposed<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.409> leave<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:01.709> for<00:03:01.769> 45<00:03:02.189> minutes

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
supposed to leave it on for 45 minutes

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.940 
supposed to leave it on for 45 minutes
but<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.239> couldn't<00:03:03.629> find<00:03:03.780> any<00:03:04.079> shampoo<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.829> by
