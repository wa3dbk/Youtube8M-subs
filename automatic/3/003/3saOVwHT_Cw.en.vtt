00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.710

 I live in Nantes there is the Loire is because our handkerchiefs of the Loire 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.800
 the Loire is because they want it from us 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 if for example a bouquet of 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.080
 the other side of the Loire that we 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.870
 I can launch 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.870
 I feel I smell and leave the French park 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.560
 I went back to work the day 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.050
 I work in the total 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.720
 there is a girl who came home with a sandwich 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.480
 never 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.550
 all the authors of what was eating 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.550
 but also I knew exactly what to eat and I had missed 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.100
 because she was going up 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.659
 lately I was in paris with friends and 10 may the same galley 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 he had a superb cake with discomfort 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.040
 but never 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.470
 at the same time he was never eating the last 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.680
 of all the things that are missing 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.050
 what does it mean 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.410
 at the perception center to go 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.660
 all directions 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.520
 feed because you are going to 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.610
 with us because you will hear 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 because you are going 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.250
 and you are going to review 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.230
 saying that he has only in many ways 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.230
 who said tarbes is called beatification 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.730
 when you eat you have the knowledge of the news this is at 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.330
 to say that here 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.730
 a pleasure to associate with this 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.190
 both are inseparable 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.190
 pushed far away the pleasure you will get the suffering 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.779
 pushed far the sufferings of everyone's opinion 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:14.059
 trace is again 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.529
 one should understand 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.619
 India does not go without the other 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.709
 and you're also watching 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.709
 that is, a madman and the universe 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.589
 pleasure suffering 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.629
 but just 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.629
 it's all bonus 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.129
 you are separated 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.909
 Sunday you are separated 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.639
 when you eat more 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.009
 you are advocating the union 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.009
 and he will create himself again 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.829
 if beatitude is to say that everything that exists everywhere Saturday 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:54.959
 Energy 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.709
 but it's more than that 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.709
 it's his little beard mane 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.200
 truth edgar j 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.329
 attitudes 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.649
 you are going m 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:10.309
 nourished by universal love because this energy is love 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:13.299
 the energy of the city sign of love 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.109
 and so constantly 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.379
 fed by this love 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.299
 so it starts with the essence makes a sensation 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.299
 and then it'll bleed it's andrew a moment 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.879
 assets of your novel that is to say we see too fat whole a making of 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:28.879
 war 2 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:29.969
 and are you going 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.969
 run constantly 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.609
 like firefighters filled 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.319
 filled with water we press on it and then it moves 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.439
 How's it going 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.559
 then the Lombard sensation and then as well after a while there will be a 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:53.109
 sensation 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.109
 and here we will quickly go beyond dualism 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.439
 it goes even further than that 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.439
 because at some point you will experience 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.519
 of the wall of the base of the security 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:10.919
 they are a wall 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.219
 and at some point you will have an inner experience that is of 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.279
 pass through this part 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.009
 to join 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.240
 and by doing that you will realize that the word 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:28.279
 that is, capable 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.729
 then apparently 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.659
 it does not exist 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.449
 what exists and the fear of nothing 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.279
 Saturday death 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.699
 in fact there is no more energy 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.379
 there is no more energy 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.020
 there you are pierre paul jacques or 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.849
 and that's appearances 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.849
 basically we all filmed 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.099
 because the first one really will not have and that our mental people 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.520
 to perceive this universe in which a help he needs form 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.719
 if you give a name 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.620
 it became a very good form 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.889
 and from very broad money 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.419
 that's what a little idea 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.819
 initially he 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.819
 he lives in the plane of m 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.229
 and then little by little will have the perceptions that will give him a 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.689
 more beautiful picture 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.719
 and then after having 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:27.419
 the face of her mother's sound of it 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:28.819
 in fact it is very rare 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.439
 and then get out of his sister who every time he goes to extend his 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.669
 his mind ie his name 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.159
 higher taxes 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.879
 and after the bscr 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.629
 what's that's what happened i'm calling 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:44.900
 vernon 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.900
 from the moment generally on the fields-elysÃ©es 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:50.240
 and from there 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.240
 create your universe 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.849
 you see what I want
