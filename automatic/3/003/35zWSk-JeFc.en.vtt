00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.740 
feel you'll feel this bird and the bird
has<00:02:11.039> gone<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.460> way<00:02:11.670> let's<00:02:12.210> take<00:02:12.360> what<00:02:12.630> they

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
has gone this way let's take what they

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.820 
has gone this way let's take what they
call<00:02:12.960> a<00:02:12.990> wire<00:02:13.290> edge<00:02:13.760> alright<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.780> knowing<00:02:16.650> that

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
call a wire edge alright so knowing that

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.890 
call a wire edge alright so knowing that
we<00:02:16.980> have<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.160> wire<00:02:17.430> edge<00:02:17.670> all<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> way<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.750> we

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
we have a wire edge all the way and we

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.750 
we have a wire edge all the way and we
want<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> wire<00:02:19.320> edge<00:02:19.560> on<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:19.860> side

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
want a wire edge on this side

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.789 
want a wire edge on this side
so<00:02:21.060> we're<00:02:21.239> going<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.480> take<00:02:21.689> and<00:02:21.900> do<00:02:22.019> roughly

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
so we're going to take and do roughly

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:29.360 
so we're going to take and do roughly
the<00:02:23.010> same<00:02:23.220> thing<00:02:23.489> over<00:02:23.610> again<00:02:27.439> and<00:02:28.439> now<00:02:29.010> i<00:02:29.069> can

the same thing over again and now i can
feel<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.579> wire<00:02:29.819> Ridge<00:02:30.060> right<00:02:30.209> here<00:02:30.269> now<00:02:31.019> we're

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
feel the wire Ridge right here now we're

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.490 
feel the wire Ridge right here now we're
ready<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.409> start<00:02:31.530> sharpening<00:02:31.890> okay<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.500> what

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
the blade frankly at this stage I don't

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.550 
the blade frankly at this stage I don't
like<00:02:57.030> coming<00:02:57.209> into<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.569> blade<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.780> I'd<00:02:58.379> rather

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
like coming into the blade I I'd rather

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.250 
like coming into the blade I I'd rather
go<00:02:58.769> like<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.129> I<00:02:59.340> feel<00:02:59.370> safer<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.329> it<00:03:00.989> doesn't

go like this I feel safer and it doesn't

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.780 
go like this I feel safer and it doesn't
seem<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.590> affect<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:02.159> quality<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.639> them

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
seem to affect the quality of them

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.339 
seem to affect the quality of them
played<00:03:08.420> okay<00:03:09.420> now<00:03:09.720> we're<00:03:09.870> going<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.019> go<00:03:10.139> down

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
played okay now we're going to go down

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.020 
played okay now we're going to go down
to<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.040> next<00:03:11.310> one<00:03:11.430> which<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:11.579> a<00:03:11.730> two<00:03:11.940> hundred

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
to the next one which is a two hundred

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:25.580 
to the next one which is a two hundred

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
grit what you have now is a pretty sharp

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.830 
grit what you have now is a pretty sharp
knife<00:03:25.829> anyways<00:03:26.220> right<00:03:26.430> now<00:03:26.609> but<00:03:27.299> what<00:03:27.720> we're

knife anyways right now but what we're

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.759 
knife anyways right now but what we're
going<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.019> do<00:03:28.139> is<00:03:28.230> we're<00:03:28.319> going<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.470> go<00:03:28.590> down

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
going to do is we're going to go down

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.379 
going to do is we're going to go down
and<00:03:29.310> we're<00:03:29.549> going<00:03:29.669> to<00:03:29.699> hone<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.269> little

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
and we're going to hone it in a little

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.089 
and we're going to hone it in a little
tighter<00:03:30.629> so<00:03:31.410> now<00:03:31.500> we're<00:03:31.620> going<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.769> use<00:03:31.919> the

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
tighter so now we're going to use the

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.599 
tighter so now we're going to use the
400<00:03:32.519> grit<00:03:33.199> you<00:03:34.199> can<00:03:34.440> tell<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:35.250> sounds

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
400 grit you can tell it sounds

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.159 
400 grit you can tell it sounds
different<00:03:35.760> when<00:03:36.120> you're<00:03:36.359> using<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.720> final

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
different when you're using the final

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:45.770 
different when you're using the final
ones<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:44.400> now<00:03:44.970> we're<00:03:45.150> going<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.329> go<00:03:45.480> into<00:03:45.510> the

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
ones and now we're going to go into the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:56.270 
ones and now we're going to go into the
600<00:03:54.169> for<00:03:55.169> those<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.620> whose<00:03:55.889> grandfather

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
would be upset it can come back if you

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.059 
would be upset it can come back if you
want<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:59.010> for<00:04:00.379> safety<00:04:01.379> reasons<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.859> don't

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.599 

either<00:04:10.379> way<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.769> usually<00:04:14.099> check<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.489> with

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
either way and I usually check it with

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.060 
either way and I usually check it with
my<00:04:14.730> thumb<00:04:14.760> nail<00:04:15.150> just<00:04:15.419> to<00:04:15.590> just<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.680> see<00:04:16.919> how<00:04:17.039> it

my thumb nail just to just to see how it

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.189 
my thumb nail just to just to see how it
digs<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.820> it's<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.539> can<00:04:18.690> feel<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:18.989> dig<00:04:19.169> it

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
digs in and it's you can feel it dig it

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.750 
digs in and it's you can feel it dig it
