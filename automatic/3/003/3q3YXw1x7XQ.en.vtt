there<00:00:06.859> from<00:00:07.859> crashing<00:00:08.670> when<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:08.940> opens<00:00:09.330> I

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
there from crashing when it opens I

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.720 
there from crashing when it opens I
guess<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.590> see<00:00:10.769> if<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.040> open<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.370> up<00:00:11.490> right

guess you see if you open it up right
here<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.599> would<00:00:12.840> take<00:00:13.019> about<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.349> minute<00:00:13.590> or<00:00:13.950> so

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
here it would take about a minute or so

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.890 
here it would take about a minute or so
and<00:00:14.639> then<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:15.030> would<00:00:15.120> just<00:00:15.150> completely<00:00:15.570> crash

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
and then it would just completely crash

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.460 
and then it would just completely crash
in<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.170> main<00:00:16.320> screen<00:00:17.029> well<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.330> already<00:00:19.140> fix

first did it it didn't work at first but
I<00:01:24.600> let<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.869> run<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.530> about<00:01:25.830> two<00:01:26.220> hours<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.580> so

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
I let it run for about two hours or so

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.030 
I let it run for about two hours or so
or<00:01:27.180> thrift<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.869> two<00:01:28.080> hours<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.590> sitting<00:01:28.890> here

or thrift like two hours or sitting here

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.760 
or thrift like two hours or sitting here
like<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.030> had<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.240> plugged<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.770> maybe

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
like this but I had it plugged in maybe

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.830 
like this but I had it plugged in maybe
if<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.130> lets<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.640> out<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.030> did<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
if you just lets it out like I did it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.330 
if you just lets it out like I did it
will<00:01:34.049> work<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.500> cannot<00:01:34.680> give<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.950> time<00:01:35.100> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
will work you cannot give it time to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.090 
will work you cannot give it time to
load<00:01:35.610> up<00:01:35.930> but<00:01:36.930> real<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> only<00:01:37.860> really

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
load up but real that's the only really

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.569 
load up but real that's the only really
way<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> fix<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:40.009> really<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> world<00:01:41.369> what

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
way to fix it and really the world what

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.990 
way to fix it and really the world what
happens<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:43.560> installed

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
happens is you installed

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.160 
happens is you installed
a<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:46.770> source<00:01:47.580> that<00:01:47.670> did<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.030> because<00:01:48.780> usually

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
a a source that did that because usually

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.140 
a a source that did that because usually
it's<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.650> blaze<00:01:49.890> ultimate<00:01:50.460> source<00:01:50.730> that<00:01:50.940> does

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
it's the blaze ultimate source that does

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.980 
it's the blaze ultimate source that does
that<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:53.120> that's<00:01:54.120> why<00:01:54.240> sometimes<00:01:54.660> I've

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
that and that's why sometimes I've

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.020 
that and that's why sometimes I've
always<00:01:55.140> crash<00:01:57.500> see<00:01:58.500> because<00:01:58.710> i<00:01:59.160> don't<00:02:00.000> have

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
always crash see because i don't have

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.469 
always crash see because i don't have
install<00:02:00.570> all<00:02:00.810> i<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:01.140> installed<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:02.479> all

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
install all i have installed is all

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.040 
install all i have installed is all
sources<00:02:04.670> that's<00:02:05.670> all<00:02:05.880> i<00:02:05.910> had<00:02:06.150> because<00:02:06.570> that's

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
sources that's all i had because that's

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.650 
sources that's all i had because that's
the<00:02:07.200> only<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.619> i<00:02:07.650> can<00:02:07.770> get<00:02:08.490> that<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.270> give<00:02:09.450> me

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
the only one i can get that will give me

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.330 
the only one i can get that will give me
all<00:02:09.990> this<00:02:12.320> without<00:02:13.320> without<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.220> like

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
all this without without it like

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.770 
all this without without it like
crashing<00:02:14.760> or<00:02:14.790> shooting<00:02:15.120> off<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.570> that's

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
crashing or shooting off and that's

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.440 
crashing or shooting off and that's
pretty<00:02:16.020> good<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.230> guess<00:02:16.290> I'm<00:02:16.920> fine<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.280> that
