starts off a bet over rules that's what
I'm<00:00:36.210> doing<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:37.020> could<00:00:37.170> use<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:38.160> two<00:00:38.340> ways

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
I'm doing you could use it's two ways

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.979 
I'm doing you could use it's two ways
you<00:00:38.640> go<00:00:38.730> hold<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> bar<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.570> hold<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> with

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
you go hold the bar you can hold it with

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.970 
you go hold the bar you can hold it with
your<00:00:40.850> weird<00:00:41.850> hands<00:00:42.809> inward<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.379> your<00:00:43.739> hands

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
your weird hands inward or your hands

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.410 
your weird hands inward or your hands
outward<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.780> usually<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.930> both<00:00:46.370> just<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:48.210> have

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
outward I usually do both just just have

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.990 
outward I usually do both just just have
different<00:00:48.780> variation<00:00:49.350> muscles<00:00:49.820> moving<00:00:50.820> I

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
different variation muscles moving I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.060 
different variation muscles moving I
guess<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.260> hell<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.440> best<00:00:52.710> way<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.920> do

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
guess just for the hell of best way I do

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.720 
guess just for the hell of best way I do
it<00:00:53.329> but<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.539> after<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.960> he<00:00:55.680> does<00:00:55.890> 4<00:00:56.520> sets

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it but right after that he does 4 sets

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.959 
it but right after that he does 4 sets
at<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.000> lives<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:58.199> he<00:00:59.010> aims<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.430> traps<00:00:59.789> on

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
at that lives and he aims for a traps on

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.479 
at that lives and he aims for a traps on
that<00:01:00.120> one<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.629> 4<00:01:00.930> sets

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
that one for 4 sets

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.570 
that one for 4 sets
so<00:01:02.489> that's<00:01:03.799> that's<00:01:04.799> right<00:01:05.010> after<00:01:05.129> bent<00:01:05.460> over

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so that's that's right after bent over

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.870 
noticed the difference of my traps and
since<00:03:24.570> I<00:03:24.660> started<00:03:24.870> doing<00:03:25.230> them<00:03:25.880> they're

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
since I started doing them they're

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.220 
since I started doing them they're
getting<00:03:27.090> pretty<00:03:27.180> high<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:30.420> like<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.870> that

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
getting pretty high so I I like it that

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.360 
getting pretty high so I I like it that
workout<00:03:31.560> right<00:03:31.709> there<00:03:31.739> like<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:31.980> said<00:03:32.220> last

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
workout right there like I said last

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.460 
workout right there like I said last
time<00:03:32.580> it's<00:03:33.030> uncomfortable<00:03:33.450> for<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.050> back<00:03:34.230> but

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
time it's uncomfortable for the back but

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.280 
time it's uncomfortable for the back but
it<00:03:34.590> really<00:03:34.860> targets<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.340> muscle<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.260> I

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
it really targets the muscle so I

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.289 
it really targets the muscle so I
definitely<00:03:37.500> recommend<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.190> when<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.670> do<00:03:39.030> two

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
definitely recommend that when I do two

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.930 
definitely recommend that when I do two
sets<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.930> one<00:03:40.110> right<00:03:40.140> there<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.760> then<00:03:41.760> um

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
sets of that one right there and then um

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.479 
sets of that one right there and then um
I'll<00:03:42.600> just<00:03:42.900> jump<00:03:43.080> into<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.560> cities<00:03:44.280> right

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
I'll just jump into the cities right

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.310 
I'll just jump into the cities right
