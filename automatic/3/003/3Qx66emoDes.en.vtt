00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
the ring I think those sources know that

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.710 
the ring I think those sources know that
really<00:00:54.980> means<00:00:55.190> business<00:00:55.490> you<00:00:56.300> know<00:00:56.450> there<00:00:56.630> is

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
really means business you know there is

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.850 
really means business you know there is
one<00:00:56.930> place<00:00:57.200> to<00:00:57.410> go<00:00:57.560> and<00:00:57.590> that's

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
one place to go and that's

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.460 
one place to go and that's
straightforward<00:01:00.220> it<00:01:01.220> was<00:01:01.340> nicely<00:01:01.579> done

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
straightforward it was nicely done

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.090 
straightforward it was nicely done
this<00:01:03.470> could<00:01:03.800> be<00:01:03.920> fun

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.760 

it's<00:01:09.100> quite<00:01:09.630> little<00:01:10.630> bit<00:01:10.840> quick<00:01:11.080> perhaps<00:01:11.470> but

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
it's quite little bit quick perhaps but

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.010 
it's quite little bit quick perhaps but
certainly<00:01:12.760> adequate<00:01:13.120> and<00:01:13.540> then<00:01:13.659> a<00:01:13.690> nice

doubt in this horses mind that William

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:19.890 
doubt in this horses mind that William
says<00:02:11.380> go<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:13.239> gonna<00:02:13.450> go<00:02:13.630> for<00:02:13.900> him

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
and it's not easy if it's correct it

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.600 
and it's not easy if it's correct it
should<00:02:22.840> look<00:02:23.170> easy<00:02:23.590> should<00:02:24.159> look<00:02:24.310> like<00:02:24.340> the

and<00:02:50.670> he's<00:02:50.910> allowing<00:02:51.240> him<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.600> nice<00:02:51.840> reach<00:02:52.230> with

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
and he's allowing him a nice reach with

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.330 
and he's allowing him a nice reach with
a<00:02:52.620> head<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:52.860> neck

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
a head and neck

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.780 
a head and neck
he's<00:02:54.270> overstepping

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
he's overstepping

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.770 
he's overstepping
has<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.390> be<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.510> good<00:02:57.890> extendable

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.840 

so<00:03:05.320> they<00:03:05.470> can<00:03:05.620> get<00:03:05.710> this<00:03:05.890> ring<00:03:06.130> back<00:03:06.700> organized

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
so they can get this ring back organized

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.390 
so they can get this ring back organized
difficulty<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.100> vault

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.100 

and<00:03:15.879> you<00:03:15.940> should<00:03:16.120> actually<00:03:16.300> lean<00:03:16.720> slightly

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
and you should actually lean slightly

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.110 
and you should actually lean slightly
forward<00:03:17.349> and<00:03:17.709> push<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.099> was<00:03:18.280> out<00:03:18.459> behind<00:03:18.790> you

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
forward and push that was out behind you

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.229 
forward and push that was out behind you
done<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.379> then<00:03:20.560> count<00:03:20.970> yep

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
done and then count yep

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.710 
done and then count yep

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.800 
see the jump from the hind leg that was
probably<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.840> nicely

so far so good right look at the attack

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.040 
so far so good right look at the attack
on<00:04:47.740> this<00:04:47.950> and<00:04:48.190> he's<00:04:48.430> just<00:04:48.820> riding<00:04:49.390> him<00:04:49.540> forward

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
on this and he's just riding him forward

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.490 
on this and he's just riding him forward
forward

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.470 

that<00:04:55.860> was<00:04:55.980> a<00:04:56.010> little<00:04:56.250> bit<00:04:56.520> before<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:57.180> center

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
that was a little bit before the center

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.290 
that was a little bit before the center
line<00:04:57.660> but<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:57.990> was<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.110> true<00:04:58.380> change<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:59.300> don't

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
line but it was a true change I don't

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.900 
line but it was a true change I don't
think<00:05:00.450> you<00:05:00.540> had<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:00.660> picky<00:05:01.460> as<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.520> judge<00:05:02.880> I

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
think you had that picky as a judge I

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.700 
think you had that picky as a judge I
think<00:05:03.120> if<00:05:03.420> the<00:05:03.510> changes<00:05:03.900> like<00:05:04.110> that<00:05:04.350> you<00:05:04.500> can

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
think if the changes like that you can

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.800 
think if the changes like that you can
easily<00:05:04.950> get<00:05:09.170> a<00:05:10.170> very<00:05:10.530> good<00:05:10.620> manager<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:12.570> might

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
easily get a very good manager you might

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.680 
easily get a very good manager you might
go<00:05:13.050> into<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.470> lead<00:05:13.620> how<00:05:14.160> about<00:05:14.430> that<00:05:14.700> I<00:05:17.690> don't

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
go into the lead how about that I don't

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:26.060 
go into the lead how about that I don't
think<00:05:18.960> you<00:05:19.080> can<00:05:19.200> fault<00:05:24.320> things<00:05:25.320> are

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
think you can fault things are

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.680 
think you can fault things are
up<00:05:26.520> are<00:05:26.880> they<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:29.550> is<00:05:29.820> the<00:05:30.060> last<00:05:30.210> one<00:05:30.480> and

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
up are they that is the last one and

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.570 
up are they that is the last one and
we've<00:05:30.840> still<00:05:31.140> got<00:05:31.500> some<00:05:31.530> good<00:05:31.770> ones<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.400> come

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
we've still got some good ones to come

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.030 
we've still got some good ones to come
so<00:05:33.150> don't<00:05:33.810> go<00:05:34.350> away<00:05:34.970> we<00:05:35.970> have<00:05:37.010> twenty<00:05:38.010> minutes

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
so don't go away we have twenty minutes

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:46.150 
so don't go away we have twenty minutes
now<00:05:38.490> so<00:05:39.260> enough<00:05:40.260> now

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.640 

yeah<00:05:47.160> we<00:05:47.580> actually<00:05:47.610> have<00:05:48.030> 40<00:05:48.510> minutes<00:05:48.840> but<00:05:49.380> I

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
yeah we actually have 40 minutes but I

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.160 
yeah we actually have 40 minutes but I
think<00:05:50.400> William<00:05:50.580> has<00:05:50.850> just<00:05:51.120> gone<00:05:51.300> into<00:05:51.600> the

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
think William has just gone into the

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.700 
think William has just gone into the
lead<00:05:52.730> with<00:05:53.730> a<00:05:53.760> very<00:05:54.270> good<00:05:54.510> mark<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:55.140> I<00:05:55.500> think

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
lead with a very good mark and I think

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.620 
lead with a very good mark and I think
he's<00:05:55.830> going<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.010> be<00:05:56.100> in<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.280> 30s<00:05:56.670> he's<00:05:57.330> got<00:05:57.540> to

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
he's going to be in the 30s he's got to

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:10.379 
he's going to be in the 30s he's got to
