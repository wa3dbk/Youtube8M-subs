00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
something that let's just say is worth

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.799 
something that let's just say is worth
it<00:00:33.800> alright<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.730> believe<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.540> need<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it alright so I I believe you need to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.110 
it alright so I I believe you need to
get<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> Lisa<00:00:37.350> s<00:00:37.590> rank<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.250> actually<00:00:38.670> get<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
get a Lisa s rank to actually get to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
get a Lisa s rank to actually get to
that<00:00:39.270> mission<00:00:39.739> because<00:00:40.739> if<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.129> lower

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that mission because if you get lower

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.040 
that mission because if you get lower
ranks<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.300> sure<00:00:42.540> if<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:42.750> really

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
ranks I'm not really sure if they really

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.139 
ranks I'm not really sure if they really
