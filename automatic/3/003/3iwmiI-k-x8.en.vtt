00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.330
 hi the parents greet the kids all 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.480
 I present on water 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.820
 the nerdy and his rocking plane in the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.050
 collection tut tut mates from vtec 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.029
 these are toys that caters to 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.619
 children from now to five but 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.630
 let's see right away what he has in the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.800
 belly it's a plane and is silent or one 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 lots here so that theo the nerd 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.190
 out of his box then you have to know 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.020
 like that just for info that's 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.820
 we have a jump of 2 euros reduction 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.430
 on the purchase of another tutut buddies 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.280
 in the box it can always be used to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.440
 time our theo the nerdy and well 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.890
 first let me tell you he 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.730
 there is a button home of so we can hop 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.739
 turn it off 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.829
 when we want to make it work it 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.420
 must of course get out the little thing in 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.579
 plastic that I had already released to the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.940
 sale that is there actually see 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.100
 so the idea hop you take it off because 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.869
 otherwise it will stay in demo mode and we 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 we do not want in demo mode we want them 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.040
 work downright hyper well like 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.439
 usually then theo the nerd I the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.439
 branch yes it's super simple a number 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.090
 [Music] 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.969
 so what's good is that see 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.100
 they cover the plane where it's funny 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.450
 it's a bit like a carousel and 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.909
 and then does it turn on there 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.319
 not turn but the little guy him 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.789
 completely turn theo the nerdy 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.770
 the interest of this toy is also 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.259
 to learn a little more about the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.429
 every little one's personality 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.009
 character who is part of the 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.600
 collection of studies buddies of that 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.659
 the child also learns vocabulary 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.329
 thanks to his friends tube so at 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.450
 let's take a little bit more so sure 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.450
 theo 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.160
 [Music] 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:11.930
 there are three songs like that and if 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:24.800
 melodies like that these jean melodies 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:26.630
 sÃ©bastien bach not come here she is bah 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.580
 yes your funny radio cushy then what 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.530
 is not bad too is that all 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.540
 toys from the tutut cooper range are 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.790
 interchangeable with each other 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.570
 so for example if I take an island 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:45.500
 the queen of the brush and that I put in the 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:48.560
 the egghead on the carriage of the block that is 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.100
 and see that he's holding another hop 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.650
 speech and fits where he 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.320
 is on a cart that's 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.530
 not bad we can do that too we can 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.100
 do that too with there we have the carousel 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.459
 so that's it if I fit t on the on 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:12.380
 carousel 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:15.709
 and after ok what he is happy yahoo 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.400
 so see there he also adapts to his 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.280
 support it was so theo hull intello 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.160
