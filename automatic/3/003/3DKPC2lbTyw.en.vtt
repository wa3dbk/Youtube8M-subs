00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello welcome to recipes for all 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.169
 point is today we are going to prepare a recipe 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.809
 of pork with pineapple for this we need 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:14.459
 a piece of pork for roasting as you can see 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.900
 very small even if it is for a few 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.750
 people because it is said that when 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.530
 put in the oven will reduce 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.470
 we're going to need ketchup mustard and pineapple 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.110
 in his game it's worth not in syrup but in 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.340
 your juice the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.410
 to be preheating the oven 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.410
 we are going to put it to 180 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.420
 up and down with fan 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.670
 meanwhile the only thing that we have to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.670
 make is chest 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.789
 pour a little oil 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:59.199
 at the base of our container and we're going 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.210
 to do even if it's a little flashy 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.789
 we are going to have to stain our hands 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.200
 agree let's catch let's go 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.740
 good salt for the whole piece 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.740
 d 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.220
 OK 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.420
 do not leave any nooks 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.240
 we put it here 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.940
 why 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.590
 we give a little hands because otherwise 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.590
 they're going to do a little ward 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.730
 and we are going to add mustard 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.079
 it does not matter that you mix it up and that 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.079
 done and we will remove everything well 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.250
 plus 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.369
 notice that I'm moving it so that it 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.369
 mix ketchup and mustard 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.240
 already we have one hand 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.240
 we turn it around 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.440
 but I'm telling you that you were going to stain 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.930
 and we finished 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.260
 we see well 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.090
 passive for the whole piece 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.610
 Once we have the piece and the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.130
 next step is to add the pineapple 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.350
 You can add the pineapple around the 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.250
 meat or even put it under 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.200
 pending you can add more pineapple or less 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.450
 how do you like it if you take the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.120
 juicy 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.780
 the last step that will come down is to add a 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.510
 some wine 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.250
 you can use white wine red rose 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.370
 ok I've done the one at this moment 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.659
 I have to be a pink 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.659
 we use a little 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.120
 with this it is worth simply we have 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.310
 have to go to the oven and wait about 20 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.040
 minutes to which it is made to remember that 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.739
 you have to turn it once when 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.170
 let's see that this starts to caramelize 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.880
 I know the ketchup and that's why we give it the 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.900
 turn to meat 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.900
 we go to the oven 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.380
 we put it in and we hope I told you 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.650
 about 20 minutes up and down about 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.250
 180 degrees we come back in a few minutes 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.900
 good it happened to me about 20 minutes it 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.180
 what we are going to do is show you more or 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.400
 less 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.120
 how will the house be 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.120
 fix 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.120
 this more or less would be also depends 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.270
 of people if you like more done or 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.590
 less done yes more chubby or less 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.980
 we simply would not fillet what 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.530
 agreement and if we see that it's a bit 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.540
 crude by the parties for the part of the 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.180
 center then turn the mind around 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.620
 minutillos already filleted in the oven but 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:30.290
 this would be the meat dish with pineapple 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.480
 oven agree thank you very much for 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.790
 be with being with us and we 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.060
 we see in recipes for all together is a 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.060
 greeting
