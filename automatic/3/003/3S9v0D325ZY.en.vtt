00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
there we go how about by Annika Hexbug

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.490 
there we go how about by Annika Hexbug
by<00:02:47.610> Annika<00:02:48.090> blue<00:02:48.360> I'm<00:02:48.630> not<00:02:48.810> sure<00:02:49.080> what<00:02:49.350> this

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
rolls across the table so I don't leave

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.080 
rolls across the table so I don't leave
me<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.220> like<00:03:05.310> one<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.700> standard

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
not too bad of a toy Hexbug tronic on

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.980 
not too bad of a toy Hexbug tronic on
yellow<00:03:16.910> that's<00:03:17.910> what<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.180> one's<00:03:18.390> calls<00:03:18.690> guys
