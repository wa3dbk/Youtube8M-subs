check it out when I did I thought it was

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.790 
check it out when I did I thought it was
pretty<00:00:24.600> obvious<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.199> should<00:00:25.590> showcase

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
pretty obvious that I should showcase

call it the paint job surprisingly came
with<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.130> package<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.940> wasn't<00:00:33.510> aware<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.690> it

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
with the package I wasn't aware of it

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.750 
with the package I wasn't aware of it
until<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.140> was<00:00:34.380> trying<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> pick<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.100> choose

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
until I was trying to pick and choose

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.690 
until I was trying to pick and choose
which<00:00:36.090> otter<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:37.110> wouldn't<00:00:37.410> fly<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.610> was

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
which otter I wouldn't fly so that was

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.490 
which otter I wouldn't fly so that was
pretty<00:00:38.850> exciting<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.540> it's<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:40.469> of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
pretty exciting and it's not one of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.049 
pretty exciting and it's not one of
those<00:00:40.649> paints<00:00:41.040> that's<00:00:41.250> thrown<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
those paints that's thrown in there and

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.660 
those paints that's thrown in there and
it<00:00:42.120> looks<00:00:42.270> choppy<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.930> pixely<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.800> really

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it looks choppy and pixely it really

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.549 
it looks choppy and pixely it really
looks<00:00:44.850> good<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.300> me<00:00:45.329> maybe<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.350> would<00:00:46.500> think

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
looks good to me maybe you would think

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
looks good to me maybe you would think
differently<00:00:46.920> i'm<00:00:47.039> not<00:00:47.160> sure<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:48.030> camera<00:00:48.629> I

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
differently i'm not sure but on camera I

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.080 
differently i'm not sure but on camera I
thought<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.649> looks<00:00:49.800> spot-on<00:00:50.010> you'll<00:00:50.850> probably

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
thought it looks spot-on you'll probably

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.840 
thought it looks spot-on you'll probably
notice<00:00:51.420> Scott's<00:00:51.840> field<00:00:52.140> again<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.649> use<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.640> in

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
notice Scott's field again I use that in

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.330 
notice Scott's field again I use that in
the<00:00:53.940> previous<00:00:54.120> video<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.690> c-130<00:00:55.199> which<00:00:56.190> is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the previous video of the c-130 which is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.369 
the previous video of the c-130 which is
annotated<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> top<00:00:57.059> left<00:00:57.300> by<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.480> way<00:00:57.600> but

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
annotated in the top left by the way but

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.860 
annotated in the top left by the way but
it's<00:00:58.649> funny<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.539> feel<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
it's funny because I feel like with the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.680 
it's funny because I feel like with the
otter<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.520> can't<00:01:02.789> make<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.210> bad

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
otter you really can't make a bad

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.509 
otter you really can't make a bad
landing<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.229> mean<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.769> has<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.129> look

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
landing I mean it really has to look

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.450 
landing I mean it really has to look
horrible<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.810> look<00:01:06.930> bad<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> otter

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
horrible to look bad but with the otter

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
horrible to look bad but with the otter
it's<00:01:08.729> difficult<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.330> drift<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
it's difficult not to drift a little and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.770 
it's difficult not to drift a little and
with<00:01:10.290> uh<00:01:10.320> with<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.700> otter<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.119> my<00:01:12.210> opinion<00:01:12.510> I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
with uh with the otter in my opinion I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
with uh with the otter in my opinion I
think<00:01:12.810> drifting<00:01:13.500> looks<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:14.250> nice<00:01:14.369> that's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
think drifting looks really nice that's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.219 
think drifting looks really nice that's
that's<00:01:15.150> that's<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> those<00:01:15.990> planes

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
that's that's really one of those planes

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.210 
that's that's really one of those planes
that<00:01:17.150> you<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.020> smack<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.799> thing<00:01:20.009> on

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
that you just have to smack the thing on

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.649 
that you just have to smack the thing on
the<00:01:20.250> ground<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.850> make<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> look<00:01:21.210> bad<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the ground to make it look bad and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.999 
the ground to make it look bad and
sometimes<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.200> even<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.799> looks

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
sometimes you can even do that it looks

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.219 
sometimes you can even do that it looks
good<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.030> depends<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> fit

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
good so it just depends but it fit

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.660 
good so it just depends but it fit
really<00:01:25.350> nice<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.860> package<00:01:26.220> so

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.740 

obviously<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:29.939> that's<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.540> know<00:01:30.630> that's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
obviously that's that's you know that's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.090 
obviously that's that's you know that's
just<00:01:30.930> how<00:01:31.079> i<00:01:31.170> feel<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.590> consider<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.070> source

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
just how i feel so consider the source

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.270 
just how i feel so consider the source
but<00:01:32.869> that's<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.140> got<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.320> far<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.070> if

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
but that's all I got so far if you if

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
but that's all I got so far if you if
you<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> package<00:01:36.030> or<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.780> don't

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you have the package or if you don't

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
you have the package or if you don't
have<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> bank<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> good

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
have the bank and you know of a good

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.960 
have the bank and you know of a good
spot<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.720> would<00:01:39.840> want<00:01:39.930> me<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> showcase
