or liable if it wasn't true
most<00:04:35.990> likely<00:04:36.790> I've<00:04:37.790> been<00:04:38.060> told<00:04:38.240> that<00:04:38.330> it

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
most likely I've been told that it

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.080 
most likely I've been told that it
wasn't<00:04:38.660> true<00:04:38.930> now<00:04:39.320> it<00:04:39.710> stands<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.490> reason<00:04:40.520> that

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
wasn't true now it stands to reason that

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.580 
wasn't true now it stands to reason that
a<00:04:41.150> little<00:04:41.419> bit<00:04:41.540> better<00:04:41.720> air<00:04:41.960> flow<00:04:41.990> would<00:04:42.410> give

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
a little bit better air flow would give

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.320 
a little bit better air flow would give
you<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.710> tiny<00:04:43.040> bit<00:04:43.160> more<00:04:43.430> power<00:04:43.639> probably<00:04:43.970> one

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
you a tiny bit more power probably one

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.960 
you a tiny bit more power probably one
horsepower<00:04:44.660> at<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.080> most<00:04:45.430> you<00:04:46.430> can't<00:04:46.639> expect

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
horsepower at the most you can't expect

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.730 
horsepower at the most you can't expect
too<00:04:47.090> much<00:04:47.210> from<00:04:47.270> an<00:04:47.540> air<00:04:47.630> filter<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.410> here<00:04:48.650> it

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
too much from an air filter so here it
