00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello we are give we see and black decker and in 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:12.920
 this time we want to show you how 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.830
 hack a slim psp or an easy spy 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.040
 here we have the two to show for 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.970
 we need first to have a 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.140
 magic stick and they should have it 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.910
 magical fact through the program of 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.440
 wake up from the b8 cemetery either for 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.980
 computer 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.470
 to run from a psp already 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.870
 hack here we have both 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.940
 aspirations now we also need 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.310
 a pandora battery 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.180
 this is the battery of a slim if you 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.090
 come is cultured thin and we have also 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.690
 the battery of a fat also 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.210
 it's a little thicker now what's 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.820
 what to do to be able to analyze it by 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.120
 hardware means is the next thing we're going 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.220
 to open the battery in this way 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.570
 all this shore if you see it takes a 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.290
 channel battery all batteries 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.630
 you have to pass it as an object with a sharp edge 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.479
 but being careful not to damage the battery 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.479
 inside in a component I already said 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.860
 that the battery this I have a part like 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.130
 I had already told you is going to be of this 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.280
 way 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.040
 already open 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.830
 now but what we will do in the FAD 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.470
 let's do the following 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.530
 From here to below we will search 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.030
 is this component this piece now 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.900
 let's see there was not a great bit given in a 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.510
 image 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.950
 is this 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.960
 now we are going to lift 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.470
 this pill that we see here those that 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.840
 they're just going 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.870
 We will we advance a little more will 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.120
 enlarge the 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.040
 is what I showed you where you are 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.010
 just below the room is only 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.720
 relevant with care not to touch 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.630
 none of the others that are here in 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.000
 peace 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.000
 having done that because the battery already 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.360
 is standardized now but the slim 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.080
 there is this is the slim 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.590
 from this point you have to look for the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.740
 drums 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.260
 the tablet we are going to look for this part only 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.120
 brings two large components among others 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.620
 components we are going to lift one of the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.980
 that is here like enlarging a bit the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.980
 image 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.849
 if you see this pill that is 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.360
 just between the ca and the c that is the 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.360
 what are we going to lift 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.810
 you have to avoid it also from damaging 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.410
 any 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.880
 Now let's do the following 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.080
 vandalized any of the batteries 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.770
 any 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.940
 p esp let's do the following 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.819
 how 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.680
 let's pirate our pst 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.260
 As I said, we need 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.629
 first one is magic that is the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.430
 maximum one gig this we have here 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:18.489
 it's one giga 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.810
 no more than a day a pandora battery 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.230
 standardized by means of hardware like 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.110
 we show you 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.980
 and the p esp we're going to 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.980
 hack 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.680
 and we show you the components now 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:39.530
 let's do the following and continue with 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.200
 careful the procedure we will place 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.180
 first the magic sticks like them 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.180
 we had said in the pf 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.680
 as you see, we have placed ourselves 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.710
 still the batteries we only have the ssp 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.130
 now we put the battery when 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.770
 we have placed the battery the p esp no 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.030
 is going to turn on just going to turn on a 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.030
 little bit of the ignition 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.069
 and the little bit of the 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.319
 memory 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.530
 then function for several hours without that 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:22.970
 you have turned on beforehand 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.110
 the fsp will leave this menu with 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.530
 the firmware 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.800
 the firmware and free for pirate that is 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.800
 that 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.680
 5.00 m 33 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.350
 the original surgeon in which leaves the 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.630
 original software of the pf 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.210
 now let's choose the pirate firmware 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.150
 What is it 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.150
 we press x and the procedure begins 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.949
 and you can see this procedure 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.039
 an important fact that we want to tell you 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:03.249
 is that the psp has to have as 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:05.259
 minimum two bars or 70% load 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:08.529
 If you want to give a comment about 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:12.269
 that can be put in the address 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:12.269
 attached that appears 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.170
 As I said, you can not turn off 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.710
 the fsp in no time because the flash 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:24.870
 it can be damaged and if it is damaged then 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.380
 we lose faith 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:32.840
 if you follow the procedure 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.840
 Slowly, we assure you that no 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.389
 support you notice alba 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.910
 We hope you liked the fucking 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.580
 as I had already told you the psp should not 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.980
 be with low charge or is the battery already 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.050
 that it can be damaged and goes out before 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.630
 that I finish after that either 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.600
 they can turn off 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.150
 the psc while sex sex 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.099
 because they can damage the beach if you 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.099
 see the phrase the one that is 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.099
 reprogramming 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.220
 we have done a little long this tuto for 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.220
 that you can give 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.600
 95 to 100% video 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:32.490
 100% 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.590
 if you notice a little one has come out 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.240
 menu 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.919
 has to do 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.289
 if you see that this is what has 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:44.280
 come out at the end with this little menu 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:46.639
 I remind you it has to be the awakening 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.160
 from the cemetery of 8 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:52.670
 which you are cela 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:56.900
 now let's press x choose the part 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:59.470
 from above the pcp has to light alone 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.470
 it goes 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.789
 restart solarana 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.980
 you already have the new system software and 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.150
 your psp 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.330
 pirate software 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.330
 [Applause] 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.250
 to see how you have 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:27.140
 at the end you have to be this 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:29.310
 way the new software system 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.820
 5,000 m 33 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.820
 4 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.900
 I hope you liked the tuto

 thank you very much there they give us their 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.660
 diners
