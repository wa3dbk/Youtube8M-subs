if<00:04:35.350> it<00:04:35.500> does<00:04:35.680> tangle<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:36.280> do<00:04:36.490> have<00:04:36.639> to

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
if it does tangle and you do have to

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.220 
if it does tangle and you do have to
come<00:04:36.970> through<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.389> there<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:37.960> minimal

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
come through it there is minimal

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.960 
come through it there is minimal
shedding<00:04:38.830> which<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.430> thought<00:04:39.669> was<00:04:40.090> such<00:04:40.990> a

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
shedding which I thought was such a

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.530 
shedding which I thought was such a
relief<00:04:42.970> for<00:04:43.630> me<00:04:44.560> because<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.520> last<00:04:45.700> one<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.360> had

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
relief for me because the last one I had

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.159 
relief for me because the last one I had
just<00:04:47.350> it<00:04:47.800> was<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.460> shedding<00:04:49.150> mishap<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:50.050> it

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
just it was a shedding mishap and it

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.470 
just it was a shedding mishap and it
just<00:04:50.440> kept<00:04:50.770> shedding<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.340> shedding<00:04:51.790> until

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
just kept shedding and shedding until

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.320 
just kept shedding and shedding until
there's<00:04:52.690> nothing<00:04:52.900> left<00:04:53.110> basically<00:04:53.880> so<00:04:54.880> this

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
there's nothing left basically so this

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.710 
there's nothing left basically so this
one<00:04:55.720> does<00:04:56.530> not<00:04:56.860> shed<00:04:57.490> that<00:04:57.730> much<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.330> mean<00:04:58.570> you

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
one does not shed that much I mean you

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.170 
one does not shed that much I mean you
can<00:04:58.900> comb<00:04:59.110> through<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.610> if<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:00.790> do<00:05:00.970> get<00:05:01.120> a

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
can comb through it if you do get a

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.700 
can comb through it if you do get a
little<00:05:01.330> bit<00:05:01.570> of<00:05:01.600> tangling<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.229> you<00:05:02.440> will<00:05:02.560> be

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
little bit of tangling and you will be

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.300 
little bit of tangling and you will be
perfectly<00:05:03.100> fine<00:05:03.540> um<00:05:04.540> it<00:05:04.990> does<00:05:05.290> hold<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.860> bit<00:05:06.160> of

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310
