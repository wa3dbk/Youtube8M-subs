it does have some other cool stuff so
it's<00:00:19.289> actually<00:00:19.650> pretty<00:00:20.640> easy<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.270> use<00:00:21.300> um<00:00:22.369> even

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
it's actually pretty easy to use um even

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.490 
it's actually pretty easy to use um even
though<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.609> has<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> lot<00:00:24.060> more<00:00:24.090> more<00:00:24.990> functions

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
though it has a lot more more functions

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.169 
though it has a lot more more functions
than<00:00:25.740> my<00:00:25.890> other<00:00:26.310> plain-jane<00:00:27.560> stopwatch<00:00:29.179> this

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
than my other plain-jane stopwatch this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.400 
than my other plain-jane stopwatch this
one's<00:00:30.390> actually<00:00:30.599> pretty<00:00:30.779> easy<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.380> use

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
one's actually pretty easy to use

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.110 
one's actually pretty easy to use
because<00:00:31.920> all<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.669> hit<00:00:32.820> mode

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
because all you have to do is hit mode

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.430 
because all you have to do is hit mode
over<00:00:33.840> here<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:35.300> it<00:00:36.300> kind<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.960> tells<00:00:37.200> you

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
over here and it kind of tells you

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.410 
over here and it kind of tells you
everything<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> stopwatch<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
everything so this is the stopwatch and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.110 
everything so this is the stopwatch and
if<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.629> hit<00:00:39.780> set<00:00:40.190> after<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.640> there<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
if I hit set after I go in there and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.740 
if I hit set after I go in there and
then<00:00:42.600> hit<00:00:42.840> mode<00:00:43.260> again<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.480> it<00:00:45.480> basically

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
then hit mode again and it basically

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.779 
then hit mode again and it basically
kind<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.289> tells<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.590> what<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:46.980> show<00:00:47.250> splits

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
kind of tells you what to do show splits

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.240 
kind of tells you what to do show splits
I<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:49.500> set<00:00:49.770> my<00:00:49.950> target<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
I can set my target and that's how you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.680 
I can set my target and that's how you
go<00:00:53.460> into<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:53.969> set<00:00:54.149> your<00:00:54.270> target<00:00:54.660> right

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
go into here and set your target right

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.270 
go into here and set your target right
now<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.199> target<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:56.129> minute<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
now I have my target for one minute and

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.889 
now I have my target for one minute and
that's<00:00:59.280> basically<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.940> usually<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.750> I'm

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that's basically like usually if I'm

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.779 
that's basically like usually if I'm
setting<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.680> four<00:01:01.890> miles<00:01:02.070> I'd<00:01:02.309> set<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.550> for

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
setting it four miles I'd set it for

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.060 
setting it four miles I'd set it for
like<00:01:02.940> 11<00:01:03.539> minutes<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.989> something<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:05.040> I

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
like 11 minutes or something and then I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.469 
like 11 minutes or something and then I
can<00:01:05.339> tell<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> give<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.060> take

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
can tell it give or take

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.890 
can tell it give or take
five<00:01:06.689> seconds<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:08.369> that's<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.540> want<00:01:09.780> my

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
five seconds and that's what I want my

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.350 
five seconds and that's what I want my
split<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.220> minute<00:01:11.520> give<00:01:11.880> or<00:01:12.030> take<00:01:12.150> 5

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
split to be is one minute give or take 5

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.219 
split to be is one minute give or take 5
seconds<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.700> target<00:01:14.700> distance<00:01:15.060> none<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
seconds and then target distance none I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.929 
seconds and then target distance none I
don't<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> tell<00:01:17.040> me<00:01:17.159> when<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> drink<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
can go in here crow no recall timer

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.880 
can go in here crow no recall timer
interval<00:01:33.720> timer<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.820> set<00:01:36.180> an<00:01:36.890> interval

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
interval timer and I can set an interval

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.310 
interval timer and I can set an interval
workout<00:01:40.009> set<00:01:41.009> interval<00:01:41.520> timer<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:43.140> this

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
workout set interval timer and then this

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.789 
workout set interval timer and then this
is<00:01:43.530> interval<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.420> 45<00:01:45.990> seconds

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
is interval one and it's for 45 seconds

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
is interval one and it's for 45 seconds
and<00:01:48.140> then<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.890> know<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.159> hit<00:01:50.520> mode<00:01:51.299> and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and then you know you just hit mode and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.580 
and then you know you just hit mode and
keep<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.170> through<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.549> interval<00:01:53.549> oh<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
keep going on through it interval oh and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.069 
keep going on through it interval oh and
I'll<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.040> give<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> name<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.909> want

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
I'll you can give it a name if you want

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.359 
I'll you can give it a name if you want
but<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.290> want<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.619> interval<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.659> so

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
but I just want it to be interval one so

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.840 
but I just want it to be interval one so
and<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.850> want<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> repeat<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.409> then<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.729> go

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and I want it to repeat and then we go

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.609 
and I want it to repeat and then we go
to<00:02:05.880> interval<00:02:06.299> two<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:06.869> only<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.320> 20

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
to interval two and it's only for 20

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.490 
to interval two and it's only for 20
seconds<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.509> so<00:02:09.509> if<00:02:09.660> you're<00:02:09.780> doing<00:02:09.810> intervals

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
seconds and so if you're doing intervals

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.380 
seconds and so if you're doing intervals
you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.920> set<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> watch<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.670> tell<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.150> when

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you can set the watch to tell you when

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.610 
you can set the watch to tell you when
to<00:02:12.420> stop<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:12.870> start

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
to stop and start

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.199 
to stop and start
and<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:13.950> forth<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.519> can<00:02:14.550> set<00:02:14.970> up<00:02:15.000> to

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
and so forth and you can set up to

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.910 
and so forth and you can set up to
sixteen<00:02:15.750> intervals<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.470> will<00:02:16.650> repeat<00:02:17.660> and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
sixteen intervals that will repeat and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.440 
sixteen intervals that will repeat and
I'm<00:02:19.920> not<00:02:20.040> great<00:02:20.430> at<00:02:20.459> using<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:21.030> yet<00:02:21.239> but<00:02:21.390> I'm

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
I'm not great at using it yet but I'm

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.449 
I'm not great at using it yet but I'm
okay<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.989> set<00:02:22.680> okay

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
okay and set okay

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.040 
okay and set okay
so<00:02:23.819> we<00:02:23.970> hit<00:02:24.120> mode<00:02:24.300> again<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.690> go<00:02:24.780> back<00:02:24.810> to

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
so we hit mode again and go back to

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.430 
so we hit mode again and go back to
there<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.959> whenever<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.050> start<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.280> stopwatch

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
there so whenever I start the stopwatch

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.809 
there so whenever I start the stopwatch
let's<00:02:31.440> see<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.040> let's<00:02:32.220> go<00:02:32.400> ahead<00:02:32.430> and

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
let's see and then let's go ahead and

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.410 
let's see and then let's go ahead and
start<00:02:34.519> my<00:02:35.519> intervals<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.950> start<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.420> it's

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
start my intervals to start and it's

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.660 
start my intervals to start and it's
going<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.660> start<00:02:39.900> counting<00:02:40.140> down<00:02:40.319> from<00:02:40.680> 45<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
going to start counting down from 45 and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.559 
going to start counting down from 45 and
then<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.239> hit<00:02:42.390> mode<00:02:42.629> again<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:44.569> it's

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
then I can hit mode again and it's

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.250 
then I can hit mode again and it's
already<00:02:45.840> telling<00:02:46.260> me<00:02:47.660> my<00:02:48.660> time<00:02:48.840> has<00:02:48.900> already

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
already telling me my time has already

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.699 
already telling me my time has already
started<00:02:49.500> my<00:02:50.040> intervals<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:52.160> my<00:02:53.160> split<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:53.880> I

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
started my intervals and my split so I

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.190 
started my intervals and my split so I
set<00:02:55.709> my<00:02:55.890> goal<00:02:56.220> split<00:02:56.760> for<00:02:56.970> 45<00:02:57.450> seconds<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:57.959> if<00:02:58.110> I

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
set my goal split for 45 seconds so if I

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.610 
set my goal split for 45 seconds so if I
tap<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.650> now<00:02:59.900> it's<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> tell<00:03:01.379> me<00:03:01.500> I'm

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
tap it now it's going to tell me I'm

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.110 
tap it now it's going to tell me I'm
going<00:03:01.950> too<00:03:02.099> fast

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.780 

which<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.299> kind<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.660> cool<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.400> then<00:03:11.400> here<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.730> a

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
which is kind of cool and then here in a

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.930 
which is kind of cool and then here in a
second<00:03:13.099> it's<00:03:14.099> gonna<00:03:14.310> tell<00:03:14.610> me<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.790> my

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
second it's gonna tell me that my

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.370 
second it's gonna tell me that my
interval<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.660> up<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.370> think<00:03:17.930> maybe<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.049> have<00:03:19.260> to

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
interval is up I think maybe I have to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.650 
interval is up I think maybe I have to
wait<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.560> couple<00:03:19.739> more<00:03:20.010> seconds<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.700> don't

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
wait a couple more seconds I don't

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.319 
wait a couple more seconds I don't
really<00:03:21.810> remember<00:03:21.989> what<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.440> said<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.799> for<00:03:23.329> there

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
really remember what I said it for there

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:24.800 
really remember what I said it for there
you<00:03:24.420> go

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
you go

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.289 
you go
see<00:03:25.200> if<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.220> were<00:03:26.370> doing<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.639> run<00:03:26.819> walk<00:03:27.030> that

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
see if I were doing a run walk that

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.800 
see if I were doing a run walk that
would<00:03:27.480> mean<00:03:27.660> walk<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:29.480> then<00:03:30.480> here<00:03:30.690> in<00:03:30.750> a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
would mean walk and then here in a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.289 
would mean walk and then here in a
second<00:03:32.989> it'll<00:03:33.989> tell<00:03:34.319> me<00:03:34.349> again<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:36.150> do

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
second it'll tell me again to do

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.479 
second it'll tell me again to do
something<00:03:37.079> else<00:03:37.290> yeah<00:03:39.230> well<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.620> don't

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
something else yeah well I don't

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.520 
something else yeah well I don't
remember<00:03:41.670> what<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:41.940> said<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.359> for<00:03:42.540> there<00:03:43.290> we<00:03:43.410> go

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
remember what I said it for there we go

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.030 
remember what I said it for there we go
yeah<00:03:43.799> and<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.430> would<00:03:44.609> mean<00:03:44.760> run<00:03:45.180> again<00:03:45.480> and

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
yeah and that would mean run again and

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.470 
yeah and that would mean run again and
then<00:03:47.040> let's<00:03:47.609> see<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.819> don't<00:03:48.150> know<00:03:48.209> how<00:03:48.299> many

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
then let's see I don't know how many

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.330 
then let's see I don't know how many
seconds<00:03:48.900> it's<00:03:49.109> been<00:03:49.260> since<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.650> tapped<00:03:49.919> it<00:03:50.130> last

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
seconds it's been since I tapped it last

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.920 
seconds it's been since I tapped it last
but<00:03:50.579> I<00:03:50.609> want<00:03:50.849> it<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.060> tell<00:03:51.239> me<00:03:51.389> I'm<00:03:51.480> going<00:03:51.780> too

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
but I want it to tell me I'm going too

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.030 
but I want it to tell me I'm going too
slow<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:52.290> I'm<00:03:52.799> going<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.040> wait<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.220> minute

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
slow so I'm going to wait a minute

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.080 
slow so I'm going to wait a minute
basically<00:03:56.040> that's<00:03:56.280> how<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.459> do<00:03:56.639> your<00:03:56.669> splits

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
basically that's how you do your splits

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.550 
basically that's how you do your splits
you<00:03:57.209> just<00:03:57.389> have<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.630> tap<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.049> face<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.470> the

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
you just have to tap the face of the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.890 
you just have to tap the face of the
watch<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:59.669> I<00:03:59.790> had<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.060> recalibrate<00:04:00.419> that

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
watch and I had to recalibrate that

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.159 
watch and I had to recalibrate that
because<00:04:01.319> when<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.160> first<00:04:02.489> got<00:04:02.669> it<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.169> wasn't

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
because when I first got it it wasn't

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.800 
because when I first got it it wasn't
really<00:04:04.590> taking<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.609> my<00:04:05.730> gentle<00:04:06.090> tap<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:06.599> kind

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
really taking to my gentle tap it kind

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.530 
really taking to my gentle tap it kind
of<00:04:06.900> wanted<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.109> be<00:04:07.290> punched

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.920 

and<00:04:13.540> now<00:04:14.530> I'm<00:04:14.740> too<00:04:14.950> slow<00:04:15.340> so<00:04:18.180> anyhow<00:04:19.180> that's<00:04:19.690> my

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
and now I'm too slow so anyhow that's my

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.449 
and now I'm too slow so anyhow that's my
new<00:04:20.080> watch<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.770> I<00:04:20.890> think<00:04:20.980> it's<00:04:21.280> pretty

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
new watch and I think it's pretty

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.760 
new watch and I think it's pretty
fantastic<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.720> like<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.140> lot<00:04:23.320> it's<00:04:23.500> kind

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
fantastic and I like it a lot it's kind

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.100 
fantastic and I like it a lot it's kind
of<00:04:23.860> big<00:04:24.040> though<00:04:24.330> so<00:04:25.330> this<00:04:26.050> one<00:04:26.440> may<00:04:26.800> end<00:04:27.250> up

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
of big though so this one may end up

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.470 
of big though so this one may end up
okay<00:04:29.110> this<00:04:30.010> one<00:04:30.280> may<00:04:30.460> end<00:04:30.640> up<00:04:30.730> going<00:04:31.090> into<00:04:31.240> my

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
okay this one may end up going into my

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.840 
okay this one may end up going into my
dad's<00:04:31.750> stocking<00:04:32.500> for<00:04:32.740> Christmas<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.580> might

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
dad's stocking for Christmas and I might

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.700 
dad's stocking for Christmas and I might
go<00:04:34.000> ahead<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.390> get<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.600> smaller<00:04:34.960> version

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
go ahead and get the smaller version

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.870 
go ahead and get the smaller version
there's<00:04:35.920> a<00:04:35.980> there's<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.460> more<00:04:36.640> feminine

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880
