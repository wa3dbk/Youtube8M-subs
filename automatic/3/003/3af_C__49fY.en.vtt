00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.820
 hi friends what such a reality and see you 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.430
 new here thanks for subscribing to 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.800
 my channel today we're going to see how it's done 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.539
 a lollipop say the color already 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.260
 you choose these are some 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.630
 combinations but is an example 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.570
 and in this case I'll make the rose let 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.420
 to use a strip of white fimo other 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.550
 of rose and another of a combination of 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.350
 pink and white that is definitely a 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.890
 pink more clarito so they do more 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.660
 tonalities we put them together all and what 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.489
 what we are going to do is make a churro 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.910
 integrating the three colors we are going to 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.030
 go bending several times until 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.400
 that we find the churrito with the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.940
 drawing that we like the more 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.610
 I doubled and if I integrate it, then more lines 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.550
 white and pink will have and that's what 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.380
 nice to see the lollipop with 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.140
 different tonalities 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.509
 once we have already the fine trickle 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.689
 and with the drawing that we more or less want 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.010
 what we are going to do is roll it in 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.180
 a spiral 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.890
 do it in a length that allows you to do 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.470
 the spiral of the size that you want in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.130
 this case for a brooch and you have to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.740
 also leave some some 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.960
 trickle a strip that is the one that then 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.180
 let's scroll how are you going to see 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.590
 what are we going to do then we are going to take a 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.590
 piece of dough 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.570
 and together with a stick in this case is a 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.390
 skewer stick of food 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.970
 make skewers and with a click 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.420
 let's make the brooch let's put the 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.760
 stick of the measure that you want we are going to 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.180
 hit our to our lollipop with 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.429
 some dough from behind 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.170
 careful to crush our country the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.630
 drawing of the frontal 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.560
 and what we are going to do is roll up the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.690
 churro leftover on the stick 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.810
 until it reaches the end 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.910
 in this case the violet would be 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.310
 so we find later with 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.850
 another piece of dough what we are going to 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.900
 to do is to stick the safety pin too 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.150
 you can do it with a brooch 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.730
 conventional buying the value I in 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.990
 that case we would need to paste it 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.590
 I would only hit it when the 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:47.140
 violet was already cooked and hardened 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.110
 that we would miss the little detail of the 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.069
 from the heart we do it as you are 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.439
 seeing 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.799
 doing the peak shape and then 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:00.349
 making a cut to do what 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.120
 is the heart shape giving it the form 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:08.170
 Rounded is very simple as you see 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.170
 of a color that stands out 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.640
 so that the heart is a detail 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.100
 quite visible and once you 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.100
 we have then we paste it in its position 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:26.030
 and this would be the finished work 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.550
 I hope you like it is so nice 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.260
 and very eye-catching thanks for your 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.760
 I hope to see you in the next visit 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.760
 tutorial a kiss chao
