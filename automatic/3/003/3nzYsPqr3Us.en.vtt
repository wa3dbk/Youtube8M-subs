jazzed<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.320> self-respond<00:02:54.980> because<00:02:55.190> he<00:02:55.250> was

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
jazzed to self-respond because he was

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.949 
jazzed to self-respond because he was
really<00:02:55.580> big<00:02:55.730> back<00:02:55.940> in<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.150> day<00:02:56.300> but<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.900> don't

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
really big back in the day but I don't

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.540 
really big back in the day but I don't
think<00:02:57.290> any<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.800> stuff<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.190> gonna<00:02:58.310> come

think any of that stuff is gonna come
back<00:02:58.700> like<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.240> think<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.570> only<00:02:59.750> character

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320

anything like that so I think nekron I

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.199 
anything like that so I think nekron I
think<00:03:14.180> spawn<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.200> think<00:03:15.830> link<00:03:16.730> aren't

you know Nintendo's new system but I

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.720 
you know Nintendo's new system but I
guess<00:03:56.690> not<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.350> I<00:03:57.709> can<00:03:57.860> really<00:03:58.250> hardly<00:03:58.489> blame

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
you got a you're worried that you're

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.250 
you got a you're worried that you're
getting<00:04:02.239> your<00:04:02.330> system<00:04:02.660> your<00:04:02.930> game<00:04:03.110> isn't

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
getting your system your game isn't

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.630 
getting your system your game isn't
gonna<00:04:03.410> sell<00:04:03.650> on<00:04:03.799> this<00:04:03.950> system<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.430> it's<00:04:04.549> not

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
gonna sell on this system and it's not

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.160 
gonna sell on this system and it's not
even<00:04:04.790> gonna<00:04:04.910> be<00:04:05.000> worth<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.360> time<00:04:05.600> to<00:04:05.660> port<00:04:06.080> it

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
even gonna be worth the time to port it

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.140 
even gonna be worth the time to port it
over<00:04:06.260> or<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.709> money<00:04:06.950> so<00:04:07.519> you<00:04:07.610> just<00:04:07.790> don't<00:04:07.970> do

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
over or the money so you just don't do

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.440 
over or the money so you just don't do
it

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
it

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.970 
it
I<00:04:08.480> think<00:04:09.019> Nintendo<00:04:09.140> needs<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.680> get<00:04:09.769> on<00:04:09.890> the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
I think Nintendo needs to get on the

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.530 
I think Nintendo needs to get on the
ball<00:04:10.160> with<00:04:10.519> this<00:04:10.670> stuff<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:11.000> really<00:04:11.269> think<00:04:11.510> that

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
ball with this stuff I really think that

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.300 
ball with this stuff I really think that
this<00:04:12.049> isn't<00:04:12.380> exactly<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.920> fault<00:04:13.130> of

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
this isn't exactly the fault of

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.740 
this isn't exactly the fault of
developers<00:04:13.820> and<00:04:13.970> publishers<00:04:14.090> with<00:04:14.630> the

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
developers and publishers with the

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.870 
developers and publishers with the
exhale<00:04:14.959> expensive<00:04:15.830> it<00:04:15.980> is<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.130> make<00:04:16.400> games<00:04:16.640> now

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
exhale expensive it is to make games now

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.820 
exhale expensive it is to make games now
I<00:04:17.150> really<00:04:17.989> think<00:04:18.200> it<00:04:18.290> needs<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.500> be<00:04:18.650> in<00:04:18.739> the

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
I really think it needs to be in the

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.099 
I really think it needs to be in the
hands<00:04:19.100> of<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.310> console<00:04:19.910> like<00:04:20.330> developers<00:04:20.930> the

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
hands of the console like developers the

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.330 
hands of the console like developers the
people<00:04:21.350> that<00:04:21.440> actually<00:04:21.590> make<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:22.040> con

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
people that actually make the con

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.879 
people that actually make the con
the<00:04:22.520> company's<00:04:22.850> behind<00:04:23.150> them<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.510> go<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.410> Namco

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
the company's behind them to go to Namco

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.680 
the company's behind them to go to Namco
