00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.020
 the personal beauty this here is a samsung 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.540
 galaxy 3 I have about 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.820
 three years and as you can see he's 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.599
 with the expression machines and quiche 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.470
 It's true that there were some falls 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.869
 leading and how we can perceive the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.240
 samsung galaxy s 13 the cable would have to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.990
 this part here and painted in the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.210
 It's true then he does not have much 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.730
 resistance business as if it were a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.489
 worm just peeling even I go 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.809
 do that now is to try the parts to 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.860
 top of the galaxy to try 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.219
 make it stay a bit longer 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.780
 cute with us I do not know if this 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.960
 It's the most recommendable is that I'm 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:59.730
 using a sandpaper for appliances 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:03.989
 It looks fine and you can see and I already 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.659
 I started doing some damage is 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.860
 basically what I will do is pass the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.869
 phone to the side and give the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.909
 finish as the nail file on the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.630
 from above as you can see are a little 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.210
 a lot because of improvisation but it's already me 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.439
 I did the side part as you can see 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.140
 here and the bottom is that 's what I did 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.409
 basically went to pass the phone, right? 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.650
 In that sense, you can not even 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.049
 see that the button was turned white and 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.579
 button was once of this thing here 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.350
 Just as we want to leave the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.850
 business more uniform then I am 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.549
 passing on to them accordingly 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.390
 is the end product here of ours in 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.090
 pages 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.929
 You can see that on the side 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.329
 It was very good to feel the whole 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.130
 Ink is how we expected it 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.710
 I had to take a few pieces of the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.229
 sandpaper and ironing with the hand here table has 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.469
 an accident seasoning that I still need 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.410
 give a finish is not over either 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.080
 so the overall result was very good at 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.660
 people had a part I want is metallic 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.000
 here and now we have a black part 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.390
 then you have to I we have 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.549
 here a phone she had got is 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.950
 old but yes now it has a look 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:29.569
 again there are not those and those signs 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.860
 of falling and everything else that he had 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.410
 Before we did it, man. 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.510
 so it's a very good job if the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.129
 guys come here if someone comments 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.129
 also tried to do this
