 today I tell you a good news before 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.389
 that all hello because it does quite 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.790
 time that not a few days that does not 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.330
 they gave signs of life in none of the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.360
 two channels and well also give you the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.920
 thanks to prieto for taking charge 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.160
 also and be able to provide them 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.140
 information these days 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.600
 today I tell you a story that I have 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.649
 I wanted to do for extravagance 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.940
 of it and given the creepy thing about it 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.940
 mysterious and what 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.070
 rare there is my silence says it all 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.170
 possibly it is the news more 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.600
 important more creepy more 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:57.040
 mysterious more what is this or this what is 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.650
 the best of all the science channel 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.040
 Technology and mystery Tilly Prieto and 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.500
 net 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.480
 it turns out that it approaches an asteroid 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.390
 towards the earth one of the so-called 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.570
 potentially dangerous but has a 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.110
 object about the same asteroid and 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.190
 it's a pyramid 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.610
 what does a pyramid do 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.410
 on the surface of an asteroid is 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.620
 a question that many people made 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.240
 on the internet really like that has 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.860
 burst a bit I said this is it and 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.810
 have seen a good video to you have the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.220
 video that is the one that you are well in these 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.470
 moments and picture that this belongs to the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.300
 isro that is the research the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.240
 Space Research Organization 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.910
 from india that shows what what 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.900
 it seems to be a black pyramid on the 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:56.090
 asteroid called 1999 rq36 and 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.920
 it's all like it has everything a lot 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.080
 meaning now I will comment 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.960
 it turns out that this asteroid was 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.979
 discovered on September 11 , 96 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.009
 of 99 sorry and was discovered by the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:15.390
 linear project has a medium diameter 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.720
 of approximately 493 meters and 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.860
 is considered a bit impossible 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.709
 impactor of the earth that is a 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.709
 potentially dangerous asteroid between 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.050
 2.169 and the 2.199 that is to say these two 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.480
 dates are the possible dates or that 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.010
 strip where you can collide with 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.180
 our planet 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.879
 the cities rex of the nasa is 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.430
 programmed to be launched in 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:50.620
 2016 and arriving at the asteroid in 2018 is 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.879
 say land on the asteroid in 2018 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.220
 and intends to analyze aims to take 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.190
 the earth a sample of 2.1 ounces of its 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.720
 land and in 2023 it will reach the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:08.450
 land with this is worth with these ounces 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.910
 and the purpose of your trip and has followed 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.940
 an official statement from which we take 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.680
 a little bit the mission will be to help the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.990
 scientists to investigate how the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.180
 planets were formed and how the 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.370
 life as well as improve our 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.980
 understanding of the asteroids that 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.230
 could impact all this on earth 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.390
 it's very good if we did not see that it has 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.760
 a piece of pyramid on the surface 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.800
 of your asteroid and do not come here it's a 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.750
 piece of rock that is formed of a 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.850
 special way that makes it a 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.470
 totally perfect pyramid that 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.570
 can see perfectly the steps 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.760
 such as the Mayan pyramids and that 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.630
 have four doors in each vertex in 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.140
 each level of the pyramid has as 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.110
 white doors as white rectangles 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.820
 and in what has been the ceiling where 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.470
 should be the peak that is not because 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.520
 It looks a lot like a Mayan pyramid 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.210
 before an Egyptian pyramid is seen 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.900
 another rectangle is as good as 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:12.110
 as if it were a helipad but cubic 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.730
 it's very strange and it's very strange that 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.609
 these images have now appeared 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.630
 taking into account that NASA already 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:24.050
 I had talked about about this mission 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.259
 a mission that is called osiris-rex is 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.860
 everything very strange to me we have been a while 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:33.680
 fried and I looking trying to get him 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.419
 the thousand legs to the cat as saying this 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.419
 it's an optical effect this is 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.870
 and product of our imagination is 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.150
 total this which whistles and flutes do not 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.730
 it can be can not be an optical effect 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.100
 for a simple reason the object looks 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.160
 in motion the asteroid is seen in 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.350
 movement sees how it goes around and 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.540
 the laps it gives is giving that 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.810
 asteroid that pyramid is still the 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.730
 same position has the same 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.440
 has the same structure can not be 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.490
 no play of lights can not be anything 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.820
 weird nothing from our mind because it's that 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:16.960
 is there and that's the weird thing the weirdest 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.090
 what are you seeing is what is 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.150
 fucking perfect and excuse me the 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.860
 expression I do not want to extend more 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.259
 because we've been almost five minutes and 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.910
 I want you to tell me 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.729
 tell you to analyze the video over and over 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.319
 time again and once and tell me what 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.680
 You really think that I do not have 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:37.360
 answer for this we have tried 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.479
 take out of context but it is that 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.050
 It can is very striking and it's a lot 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:46.810
 chance that the nasa was already doing 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.479
 time thinking about this project with 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.220
 this asteroid is very rare an asteroid 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.440
 that is supposed to infect inside 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.509
 hundred and some years on our planet is 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.610
 very strange worry about others who are going 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.139
 to impact more soon not that by 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.500
 what about this because he has a fucking 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.970
 pyramid on the surface is why a 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.680
 kiss of all guys and see you in 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.099
 another video of this channel until the 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.099
 next
