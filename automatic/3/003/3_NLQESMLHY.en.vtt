00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.839
 allegedly came with the help of an elevator 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.610
 travel to another world so crazy 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.300
 It sounds like there is even one 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.300
 instruction 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.920
 hello together for the sake of fairness 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.720
 I have an important request for you again today 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.360
 you follow me all on twitter below 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.520
 www.twitter.com / with naked there 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.720
 posting on things in between me 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.460
 only post on twitter 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.190
 so worth it in any case with it 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.090
 would be happy to follow and thank you for 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.290
 support 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.450
 now to the actual video 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.220
 This crazy ritual comes naturally 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.579
 Once again from the Asian region 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.149
 this was the korea 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.000
 north of a korean website 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.000
 this total trend there is a kind 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.730
 probation comparable to the plate 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.070
 Mary, for example 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.830
 just a lot scary and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.890
 disturbing 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.780
 remember this ritual or game is 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.560
 as in supposedly very dangerous and 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.970
 is carried out at your own risk 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.670
 You can only play this game alone 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.130
 play and you need a building with 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.970
 at least ten floors and one 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.030
 elevator 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.890
 Follow the instructions below 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.440
 courthouse and go to the elevator in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.840
 first floor it alone that else 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.810
 nobody in the elevator 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.040
 then knobs pushed the fourth floor 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.860
 if the elevator is the fourth floor 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.270
 does not increase that the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.000
 Close the door again and press the button 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.770
 button for the second floor if the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.240
 on the second floor you stay in the elevator 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.240
 and press the button the sixth 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.070
 Stage if you are in the sixth floor 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.190
 stay in the elevator and press the button 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.900
 for the second floor 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.370
 if you're on the second floor 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.830
 press the button for the tenth 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.260
 floor 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.990
 when the tenth floor is pressed 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.120
 the button for the fifth floor with 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.470
 the fifth floor would be 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.470
 probably a young friend 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.620
 give not rise 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.550
 do not talk to her she is not that 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.550
 what she seems to be 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.290
 press the button on the first floor 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.440
 when the elevator starts to drive up to 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.910
 You can continue on the tenth floor 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.130
 if the elevator is actually under 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.810
 the first floor drives the way so 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.670
 Do not look fast as possible 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.290
 back and does not speak 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.840
 you have reached another ten pieces 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.970
 the choice if you want to stay in the elevator 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.860
 or want to get off if you are 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.500
 decide to get out and if I have 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.440
 the woman asks where you are going to answer 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.060
 he does not and does not look at you 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.340
 You can easily find out if you are 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.660
 you into a different world it is 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.300
 However, there is only one 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.610
 note you are the only person of the 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.920
 other world you will not be on any other 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.990
 humans meet except at most 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.390
 this woman and if the wood yet 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.560
 're somewhere meet other people 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.620
 you still in the real world 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.360
 but how do you get back to that? 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.090
 stay in the elevator on the 10th floor 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.440
 hit the first floor if the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.690
 Elevator is easy to try 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.630
 continue through the whole time the button 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.070
 until the lift leaves on the first floor 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.170
 is a first floor and reports 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.610
 the doors open leaving so fast 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.670
 as possible, do not look at the elevator 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:32.050
 say nothing back with the tenth stock 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.730
 from text vocals as well as follow back you 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.600
 you need the same order for return 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.860
 with whom you came 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.870
 then only the same floor has to be 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.330
 learn how to start 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.880
 you should end up in the fifth 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.770
 floor if you are on the fifth floor 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.500
 has reached presses the button with the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.940
 first floor to arrive 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.080
 the elevator with restart in the 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.510
 Tenth floor to drive 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.350
 hit all sorts of floors around that 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.420
 to prevent 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.020
 you have to manage the duo 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.050
 will you stay in front of the tenth floor? 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.550
 then you can drive the first floor 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.520
 when you reach the first floor 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.350
 Exactly check your environment if 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.400
 you something strange appears open in the 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.460
 smallest detail 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.290
 then do not get off the elevator if you 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.570
 something does not discover that there 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.590
 belongs or you the world somehow 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.300
 different or strange occurs repeat 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.610
 the floor sequence you are back in 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.700
 fifth floor and drive in again 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.350
 the first floor makes you so often you are 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.900
 the 100 percent sure you are 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.340
 to be the real world 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.090
 then you can secure a lift 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.390
 leave 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.760
 a few additional weather information 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.280
 other world will reach the floor 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.830
 apart from no human soul altogether 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.580
 Ident look like the floor in the 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.860
 real world 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.670
 but you can do two things altogether 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.260
 safely orientate 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.720
 no lights are switched on 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.760
 and you can not be lights 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.100
 turn on 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:03.060
 and if out of the window chance is a 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.310
 red cross of distance see some 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.550
 say electronic devices like cell phones 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.860
 cameras mp3 player etc work 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.620
 not in other world others in turn 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.610
 say they work 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.170
 to get back to your own world 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.120
 may be a bit difficult than you 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.220
 do you think you might lose that 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.770
 orientation and forgets in which 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.510
 lift you have arrived the right one 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.590
 give will perhaps continue 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.390
 away than before 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.930
 if you find yourself a bit to see 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.100
 stay alert and with clear mind 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.530
 do not try to cloud your soul 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.680
 you should leave it for some reason 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.790
 to get out of power incorrectly or 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.720
 somehow different your consciousness 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.640
 to lose 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.790
 You will probably be at your home 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.370
 Note wake up exactly because 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.100
 environment will be noticed that this 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.660
 not the real world is trying 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.110
 there again the building with the elevator 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.580
 to get out of the world 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.010
 and again a warning for the woman in the 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.560
 fifth floor talks to her and 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.169
 you do not look 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.070
 if they do, maybe they will 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:09.410
 decide to keep that to yourself 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.389
 what do you think about that ? 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.800
 really so possible then he writes 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.570
 though in the comments 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.760
 or think that can not really 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.490
 work is just a normal one 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.300
 courage test then writes away completely in the 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.460
 Comments 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.440
 and will you ever do that yourself? 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.790
 I definitely try it 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.930
 not even if only one percent 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.660
 chance exists 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.490
 somehow in a parallel world or in 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.889
 another world as it is called caught 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.990
 be it return, I determined that not 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.570
 especially cities before eleven has quite 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.410
 alone with the elevator around 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.570
 theoretically one would have this still 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.669
 at night they usually do it during the day 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.550
 easier strangers could get in 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:48.919
 to interrupt the ritual 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.450
 So pretty flu really unique 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:53.270
 do not make but how does it because in 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.280
 Look out if there is such a kind of video 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.740
 like and want to see more of it 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.020
 then let a thumb up there follows 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.419
 me necessarily on twitter at no info 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:07.430
 not to miss more yet 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:09.620
 you and until next time will come 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.640
 run the endart left arrived 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.530
 to give compassion 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.720
 there could be around in creepy ritual 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.310
 Run midnight and right thought 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.289
 playing hide-and- seek 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.690
 there you can supposedly alone with 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.900
 hide a stuffed animal play a lot 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.900
 fun
