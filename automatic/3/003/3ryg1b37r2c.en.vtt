00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:07.089
 playstation now is a streaming service 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.250
 of video games created by sony for 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.540

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.450
 course to your own console the play 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.450
 station 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.810
 What many people do not know is that 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.880
 this service is nothing new 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.949
 many years ago in the sixth generation 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.930
 of consoles in the e3 of the year 2001 was 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:41.760
 presented a new model of 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.000
 playstation 2 the sc ph 30000 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.070
 which brought in the back a 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.659
 expansion fence designed to 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.059
 install a 3.5-inch hard drive and 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:57.899
 be used with the new peripheral of that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.899
 then the network adapter or in Spanish 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.750
 network adapter this would increase the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.970
 capabilities of play station2 as the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.039
 be able to play online and other 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.780
 more features that were 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.780
 presented in that same event 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.490
 when it started to market this 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.110
 new model in his country of origin japan 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.159
 he sold it under the name of 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.060
 playstation to be be initially pack 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.360
 only the Japanese model would bring within 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.909
 the box a special cedÃ© which at 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.570
 install it in our console we 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.220
 would allow to visualize and administer 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.940
 files on our hard drive from the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.670
 browser in addition to installing a 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.649
 exclusive application that only came out for 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.159
 Japan call play station broadband 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.219
 navigator 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.990
 within the many options 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.020
 provided by the application we 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 we would find a section called 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.969
 channel of games that was in turn 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.670
 conformed by other channels of 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:14.060
 video game companies of which 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.060
 one of them was called play station now 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.800
 It should be noted that within these 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.050
 channels 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.080
 we could find out about news 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.360
 corresponding to the company and download 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.490
 downloadable content to our disk 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.670
 hard either videos music videos and up 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.060
 video game demos such was the case of the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:43.920
 channel of konami that at that time offered 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.920
 a dlc of the game vice buy and special 3 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.890
 how the game ran from the hard drive 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:57.099
 a psx emulator emulator was used 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.099
 that was officially created by sony 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.950
 unfortunately playstation broadband 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.680
 navigator did not see light outside japan anymore 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.240
 that you could say that the idea was a 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.240
 little advanced for its time 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.749
 during all these years several 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:27.249
 amateur programmers tried 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:30.280
 create a psx emulator for ps2 but 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:32.999
 creating an emulator from scratch is not for 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.999
 not easy 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.720
 so these emulators have 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.200
 many incompatibilities errors and 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.200
 glitches 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:52.870
 but at the beginning of 2013 and apparently 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.810
 anonymously they brought deciphered and 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.939
 they filtered the sonic emulator that 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.939
 konami used several years ago 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.230
 initially the news along with the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.659
 emulator and instructions for 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.900
 make it work were published in 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:13.900
 assembler game dotcom the name 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.150
 official emulator is pop starter and it 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.759
 believes that it is the predecessor version of the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.650
 emulator of play station 1 for p esp 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:24.900
 which is coincidentally called pops 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.930
 as the emulator was just a 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.630
 sony project without concluding not all 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.789
 the games worked even if it was and 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.910
 it's still better than all 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:38.280
 emulators that they tried to create is by 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.070
 that reason that internet people with 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.810
 A lot of knowledge about soft modding is 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.380
 they joined and they tried to work 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:50.160
 hard for months to improve the 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.259
 game compatibility and also for 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.210
 add new features like 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.810
 possibility of running it from 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.690
 USB ports on the other side page 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.419
 puntocom you can find information 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.669
 on how to install this emulator but
