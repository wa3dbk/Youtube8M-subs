00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
I think with starcraft 2 is you can

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.160 
I think with starcraft 2 is you can
unbroke<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.610> can<00:04:10.760> burrow<00:04:11.000> your<00:04:11.360> supply

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
unbroke you can burrow your supply

siege tanks raping the crap are those
stalkers<00:06:32.250> just<00:06:32.639> like<00:06:32.729> a<00:06:32.759> spark<00:06:33.030> up<00:06:33.150> one

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
stalkers just like a spark up one

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.939 
stalkers just like a spark up one
however<00:06:34.139> instruct<00:06:34.380> after<00:06:34.590> they<00:06:34.710> actually

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
however instruct after they actually

don't rape stalkers it's kind of the

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.290 
don't rape stalkers it's kind of the
opposite<00:06:36.930> which<00:06:37.050> is<00:06:37.080> a<00:06:37.199> little<00:06:37.530> odd<00:06:37.620> but<00:06:38.300> yeah

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
opposite which is a little odd but yeah

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.960 
opposite which is a little odd but yeah
as<00:06:39.539> you<00:06:39.660> can<00:06:39.780> see<00:06:39.960> right<00:06:39.990> now<00:06:40.699> between<00:06:41.699> with
