00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.480
 then we will learn to do 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.580
 flat stitch 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.650
 the low point what we should do to 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.309
 that the tasks fit better 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.309
 finished 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.260
 To start the point, we take the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.920
 crochet well 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.920
 we will click 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.380
 in the first hole and we take out 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.320
 now we have two vaga mounted on the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.150
 crochet and we will close the point with the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.010
 same vague 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:51.040
 we have made the first satin point we are going to 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.080
 make another one we puncture we take out the vaga 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.620
 and it is with this same bar that we close 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.620
 the piston 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.800
 again we puncture the bar 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.450
 we have two vaga 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.020
 and it is with this same bar that we close 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.020
 point 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.040
 we will continue working in this way to 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.040
 along the whole row
