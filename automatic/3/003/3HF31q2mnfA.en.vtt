hey<00:00:01.110> guys<00:00:01.319> Cali<00:00:01.709> so<00:00:02.399> now<00:00:02.580> that<00:00:02.639> you've<00:00:02.909> built

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hey guys Cali so now that you've built

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.940 
hey guys Cali so now that you've built
your<00:00:03.210> tetrax<00:00:03.689> or<00:00:03.810> matrix<00:00:04.170> Ranger<00:00:04.529> bot<00:00:04.710> you're

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
your tetrax or matrix Ranger bot you're

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.530 
your tetrax or matrix Ranger bot you're
probably<00:00:05.160> wondering<00:00:05.609> how<00:00:05.940> do<00:00:06.000> I<00:00:06.120> program

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
probably wondering how do I program

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.700 
probably wondering how do I program
these<00:00:06.690> well<00:00:07.109> that's<00:00:07.259> what<00:00:07.410> we're<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.589> to

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
these well that's what we're going to

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.290 
these well that's what we're going to
learn<00:00:07.830> how<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.010> do<00:00:08.189> today<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:08.700> let's<00:00:09.030> go<00:00:09.179> on

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
learn how to do today so let's go on

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.730 
learn how to do today so let's go on
over<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.540> Row<00:00:09.719> ICU<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.170> learn<00:00:10.320> how<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.469> program

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
over to Row ICU and learn how to program

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.849 
over to Row ICU and learn how to program
the<00:00:10.980> joystick<00:00:17.690> all<00:00:18.690> right<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.140> once<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.560> robot

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
the joystick all right so once in robot

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.050 
the joystick all right so once in robot
C<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.580> go<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> file<00:00:21.539> new<00:00:21.990> new<00:00:22.949> file<00:00:23.369> and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
C we have to go to file new new file and

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.759 
C we have to go to file new new file and
I'll<00:00:24.150> create<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> new<00:00:24.449> file<00:00:24.810> with<00:00:25.080> already<00:00:25.650> our

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
I'll create a new file with already our

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.990 
I'll create a new file with already our
task<00:00:26.010> maintenance

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
task maintenance

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.759 
task maintenance
task<00:00:27.480> main<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.930> basically<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> first<00:00:28.650> thing

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
task main is basically the first thing

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460 
task main is basically the first thing
that<00:00:28.980> runs<00:00:29.130> when<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.400> program<00:00:29.699> starts<00:00:30.470> but

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
that runs when the program starts but

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.830 
that runs when the program starts but
first<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:32.189> want<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.550> set<00:00:32.820> up<00:00:32.850> our<00:00:33.090> robots<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.750> we

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
first we want to set up our robots so we

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.049 
first we want to set up our robots so we
have<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.020> go<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.170> robot<00:00:34.649> motor<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.700> sensor

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
have to go to robot motor and sensor

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:36.650 
have to go to robot motor and sensor
setup

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
setup

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.270 
setup
now<00:00:36.899> each<00:00:37.140> robots<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.860> different

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
now each robots going to be different

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.600 
now each robots going to be different
but<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.329> Ranger<00:00:39.750> tetrax<00:00:40.170> box<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:41.250> we

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
but for the Ranger tetrax box but we

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.010 
but for the Ranger tetrax box but we
want<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> click<00:00:42.210> standard<00:00:42.719> tetra

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
want to click standard tetra

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.130 
want to click standard tetra
configuration<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.120> then<00:00:45.120> go<00:00:45.510> over<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.690> motors

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
configuration and then go over to motors

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.930 
configuration and then go over to motors
tab<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.980> see<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.280> two<00:00:47.489> motors<00:00:47.820> available

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
tab and we see with two motors available

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.290 
tab and we see with two motors available
motor<00:00:48.840> D<00:00:49.110> will<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.250> our<00:00:50.809> left<00:00:51.809> motor<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.300> motor

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
motor D will be our left motor and motor

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
motor D will be our left motor and motor
he<00:00:54.600> will<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.110> our<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.500> motor<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:57.410> since<00:00:58.410> one

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
he will be our right motor and since one

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.380 
he will be our right motor and since one
in<00:00:59.070> sense<00:00:59.430> each<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.820> these<00:00:59.879> motors<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
in sense each of these motors is a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.580 
in sense each of these motors is a
mirror<00:01:00.660> image<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> each<00:01:01.079> other<00:01:01.230> we're<00:01:01.500> gonna

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
mirror image of each other we're gonna

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.380 
mirror image of each other we're gonna
have<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> reverse<00:01:02.160> one<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.489> them<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.270> can

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
have to reverse one of them so we can

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.810 
have to reverse one of them so we can
reverse<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.899> left<00:01:04.110> motor<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.680> that'll<00:01:05.460> make

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
reverse the left motor and that'll make

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.679 
reverse the left motor and that'll make
it<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.270> that'll<00:01:06.689> make<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:08.240> now<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.479> wanted

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
it but that'll make it now if we wanted

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.570 
it but that'll make it now if we wanted
to<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> matrix<00:01:10.290> pot<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> click

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
to the matrix pot we have to click

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.600 
to the matrix pot we have to click
standard<00:01:12.000> matrix<00:01:12.290> configuration<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.610> then

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
standard matrix configuration and then

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.630 
standard matrix configuration and then
we<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.720> motor<00:01:16.020> F<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.470> motor<00:01:16.619> G<00:01:16.890> which<00:01:17.130> are<00:01:17.280> not

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
we see motor F and motor G which are not

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
we see motor F and motor G which are not
used<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.330> matrix<00:01:18.659> pot<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.530> still

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
used for the matrix pot and we still

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980 
used for the matrix pot and we still
reverse<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.700> left<00:01:20.909> motor<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.840> it's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
reverse the left motor but it's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.480 
reverse the left motor but it's
basically<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> same<00:01:22.740> thing<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
basically the same thing just a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.670 
basically the same thing just a
different<00:01:23.610> checkmark<00:01:24.360> over<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:25.530> can

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
different checkmark over here we can

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.230 
different checkmark over here we can
ignore<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> other<00:01:26.250> tabs<00:01:26.520> for<00:01:26.759> now<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.090> just

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
ignore the other tabs for now and just

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.660 
ignore the other tabs for now and just
click<00:01:27.450> OK<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.860> will<00:01:28.920> generate<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.400> code

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
click OK and it will generate this code

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.460 
click OK and it will generate this code
we<00:01:30.000> do<00:01:30.119> not<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> touch<00:01:30.780> his<00:01:30.990> code<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
we do not have to touch his code and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.890 
we do not have to touch his code and
just<00:01:31.799> leave<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.070> up<00:01:32.250> there<00:01:32.360> all<00:01:33.360> right<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.750> now

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
just leave it up there all right so now

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.590 
just leave it up there all right so now
to<00:01:33.960> begin<00:01:34.470> program<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.009> robot<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.270> want<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
to begin program a robot what we want to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.149 
to begin program a robot what we want to
do<00:01:36.689> first<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.259> since<00:01:37.680> we're<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> be

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
do first is since we're going to be

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.679 
do first is since we're going to be
using<00:01:38.400> joystick<00:01:38.790> control<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.509> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
using joystick control we have to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.289 
using joystick control we have to
include<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.110> driver<00:01:40.470> now<00:01:41.250> driver<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.820> list<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
include a driver now driver is a list of

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.420 
include a driver now driver is a list of
methods<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.960> are<00:01:43.110> already<00:01:43.439> made<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.130> us<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
methods that are already made for us so

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.730 
methods that are already made for us so
we<00:01:44.549> don't<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.909> retype<00:01:45.060> them<00:01:45.570> now<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:46.649> we

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
we don't have to retype them now what we

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.190 
we don't have to retype them now what we
can<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.549> include

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
can do is we can just do it include

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.940 
can do is we can just do it include
quotation<00:01:49.200> joystick<00:01:50.570> driver<00:01:51.570> dot<00:01:52.350> C<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
quotation joystick driver dot C and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.190 
quotation joystick driver dot C and
that's<00:01:53.640> all<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.030> need<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.170> can

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that's all we need to do and then we can

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800 
that's all we need to do and then we can
use<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.710> joystick<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.030> when<00:01:57.149> our<00:01:57.240> task<00:01:57.479> main

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
use the joystick so when our task main

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.109 
use the joystick so when our task main
we<00:01:58.409> want<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.740> loop<00:01:58.950> indefinitely<00:01:59.610> because<00:01:59.969> we

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
we want to loop indefinitely because we

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.550 
we want to loop indefinitely because we
always<00:02:00.299> want<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.719> program<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.110> running<00:02:01.500> we

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
always want this program to running we

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.590 
always want this program to running we
don't<00:02:01.740> want<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.040> stop<00:02:02.310> until<00:02:02.790> until<00:02:03.509> we

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
don't want it to stop until until we

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.569 
don't want it to stop until until we
receive<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> stop<00:02:04.350> signal<00:02:04.829> from<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.310> field

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
receive a stop signal from the field

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.580 
receive a stop signal from the field
control<00:02:05.969> system<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.320> walk

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
control system so you have to walk

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.750 
control system so you have to walk
through<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:10.619> will<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.550> is

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
through and that will be this is

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.369 
through and that will be this is
basically<00:02:12.150> an<00:02:12.330> infinite<00:02:12.540> loop

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
basically an infinite loop

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.110 
basically an infinite loop
inside<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:14.129> what<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.519> first<00:02:14.730> wanted<00:02:14.999> we

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
inside here what we first wanted we

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.640 
inside here what we first wanted we
always<00:02:15.269> want<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.540> update<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.019> joystick<00:02:16.469> to

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
always want to update the joystick to

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.679 
always want to update the joystick to
what<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.280> what<00:02:17.609> the<00:02:17.760> controller<00:02:18.389> is

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
what the for what the controller is

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.379 
what the for what the controller is
pressing<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.219> to<00:02:20.280> do<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:20.579> we<00:02:20.879> type<00:02:21.090> get

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:21.389 
pressing so to do that we type get

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:27.770 
pressing so to do that we type get
joystick<00:02:22.280> settings<00:02:25.219> joystick<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:27.599> that

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
joystick settings joystick and that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.399 
joystick settings joystick and that
allows<00:02:28.049> us<00:02:28.079> to<00:02:28.939> get<00:02:29.939> the<00:02:30.209> joystick<00:02:31.049> settings

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
allows us to get the joystick settings

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.330 
allows us to get the joystick settings
pretty<00:02:31.709> much<00:02:32.329> now<00:02:33.329> to<00:02:33.659> actually<00:02:34.620> control<00:02:35.159> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
pretty much now to actually control the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.479 
pretty much now to actually control the
robot<00:02:35.730> we<00:02:36.150> just<00:02:36.420> type<00:02:36.689> motor<00:02:37.409> and<00:02:37.739> then

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
robot we just type motor and then

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.309 
robot we just type motor and then
whatever<00:02:38.819> mode<00:02:39.120> we<00:02:39.329> want<00:02:39.419> to<00:02:39.540> control<00:02:39.840> select

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
whatever mode we want to control select

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.339 
whatever mode we want to control select
motor<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:40.829> this<00:02:40.980> case<00:02:41.659> equals<00:02:42.659> whatever<00:02:43.200> you

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
motor in this case equals whatever you

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.409 
motor in this case equals whatever you
want<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.799> be<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.459> isn't<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.389> a

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:45.419 
want it to be this isn't this is a

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.409 
want it to be this isn't this is a

with<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.489> full<00:02:50.879> power<00:02:50.909> forwards<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.510> can<00:02:51.599> do

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
with the full power forwards you can do

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.830 
with the full power forwards you can do
any<00:02:51.959> number<00:02:52.409> in<00:02:52.500> between<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.069> zero<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.489> stop

any number in between and zero to stop

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.289 
any number in between and zero to stop
so<00:02:54.840> for<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.139> tank<00:02:55.739> drive<00:02:56.069> which<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.669> the<00:02:56.849> basic

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
so for the tank drive which is the basic

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.659 
so for the tank drive which is the basic
controls<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.109> want<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.319> be<00:02:58.409> using<00:02:58.669> we

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
controls that we want to be using we

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.189 
controls that we want to be using we
want<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.030> left<00:03:00.180> motor<00:03:00.419> to<00:03:00.569> be<00:03:00.659> equal<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:01.199 
want the left motor to be equal to the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:02.689 
want the left motor to be equal to the
left<00:03:01.379> joystick<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.159> do<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:02.549> take

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:02.699 
left joystick so to do that we take

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:07.849 
left joystick so to do that we take
joystick<00:03:03.299> joy<00:03:04.049> one<00:03:04.439> underscore<00:03:05.400> y1<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.859> the

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
joystick joy one underscore y1 and the

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.229 
joystick joy one underscore y1 and the
joystick<00:03:08.189> values<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> number<00:03:08.730> from<00:03:08.819> negative

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
joystick values a number from negative

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.220 
joystick values a number from negative
128<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.250> 127<00:03:11.250> positive<00:03:12.209> but<00:03:12.629> like<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.840> said<00:03:13.049> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
128 to 127 positive but like I said the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.979 
128 to 127 positive but like I said the
motor<00:03:13.469> values<00:03:13.859> are<00:03:13.980> negative<00:03:14.129> 100<00:03:14.639> 200<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.870> we

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
motor values are negative 100 200 so we

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.339 
motor values are negative 100 200 so we
want<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.319> do<00:03:16.439> here<00:03:16.799> is<00:03:17.540> multiply<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.840> by<00:03:19.079> 100

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
want to do here is multiply this by 100

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.640 
want to do here is multiply this by 100
over<00:03:20.090> 127<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.419> that<00:03:22.049> will<00:03:22.199> get<00:03:22.290> us<00:03:22.349> as<00:03:22.590> close

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
over 127 and that will get us as close

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.890 
over 127 and that will get us as close
to<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> negative<00:03:23.790> 1<00:03:24.060> or<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.359> a<00:03:24.389> hundred<00:03:24.780> values

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
to a negative 1 or to a hundred values

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.729 
to a negative 1 or to a hundred values
we<00:03:25.259> can<00:03:25.409> get<00:03:25.560> now<00:03:26.689> we<00:03:27.689> can<00:03:27.840> just<00:03:27.989> type<00:03:28.229> the<00:03:28.439> same

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
we can get now we can just type the same

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.619 
we can get now we can just type the same
thing<00:03:29.159> for<00:03:29.939> the<00:03:30.060> right<00:03:30.239> motor<00:03:30.599> and<00:03:32.329> instead<00:03:33.329> of

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
thing for the right motor and instead of

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.129 
thing for the right motor and instead of
the<00:03:34.459> joy<00:03:35.459> 1<00:03:35.759> under<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.239> want<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.659> lead<00:03:36.810> or<00:03:36.959> 1

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
the joy 1 under so I want to lead or 1

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.050 
the joy 1 under so I want to lead or 1
underscore<00:03:37.560> Y<00:03:37.739> 2<00:03:37.799> which<00:03:38.280> will<00:03:38.400> be<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.549> second

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
underscore Y 2 which will be a second

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.960 
underscore Y 2 which will be a second
joystick<00:03:39.479> and<00:03:39.689> we<00:03:40.290> again<00:03:41.040> it's<00:03:41.669> the<00:03:41.729> same

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
joystick and we again it's the same

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.729 
joystick and we again it's the same
value<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.449> we<00:03:42.540> have<00:03:42.629> to<00:03:42.720> multiply<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.139> by<00:03:43.290> 1

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
value so we have to multiply it by 1

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.879 
value so we have to multiply it by 1
over<00:03:43.949> 100<00:03:44.400> over<00:03:44.579> 127<00:03:45.439> now<00:03:46.439> there's<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.709> slight

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
over 100 over 127 now there's a slight

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.939 
over 100 over 127 now there's a slight
problem<00:03:47.250> with<00:03:47.549> this<00:03:47.699> in<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.900> when<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.709> when

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
problem with this in that when you when

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.939 
problem with this in that when you when
the<00:03:50.069> joysticks<00:03:50.489> aren't<00:03:50.729> pressing<00:03:50.970> anything

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
the joysticks aren't pressing anything

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.580 
the joysticks aren't pressing anything
it<00:03:52.949> will<00:03:53.040> be<00:03:53.280> some<00:03:53.849> low<00:03:54.449> number<00:03:54.870> like<00:03:55.079> it's<00:03:55.409> not

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
it will be some low number like it's not

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.589 
it will be some low number like it's not
gonna<00:03:55.859> be<00:03:55.949> at<00:03:56.040> 0<00:03:56.370> exactly<00:03:56.519> it'll<00:03:57.090> be<00:03:57.209> maybe<00:03:57.449> at

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
gonna be at 0 exactly it'll be maybe at

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.050 
gonna be at 0 exactly it'll be maybe at
1<00:03:57.840> or<00:03:57.989> 2<00:03:58.199> but<00:03:58.439> it'll<00:03:59.159> still<00:03:59.430> make<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.790> motors

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
1 or 2 but it'll still make the motors

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.610 
1 or 2 but it'll still make the motors
move<00:04:00.299> which<00:04:00.509> can<00:04:00.719> be<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.870> problem<00:04:01.199> and<00:04:01.530> get

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
move which can be a problem and get

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.530 
move which can be a problem and get
annoying<00:04:01.919> so<00:04:02.609> what<00:04:02.819> we<00:04:02.939> want<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.120> do<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.359> come

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
annoying so what we want to do is come

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.759 
annoying so what we want to do is come
on<00:04:03.659> that<00:04:03.930> is<00:04:03.959> we<00:04:04.199> want<00:04:04.349> to<00:04:04.379> create<00:04:04.500> what's

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
on that is we want to create what's

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.379 
on that is we want to create what's
called<00:04:04.829> a<00:04:05.069> dead<00:04:05.280> zone<00:04:05.549> which<00:04:05.879> is<00:04:06.030> basically

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
called a dead zone which is basically

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.179 
called a dead zone which is basically
when<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.500> joysticks

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
when the joysticks

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.339 
when the joysticks
in<00:04:08.400> between<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.819> certain<00:04:09.299> value<00:04:09.479> that<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.079> close

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
in between a certain value that is close

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.050 
in between a certain value that is close
enough<00:04:10.379> to<00:04:10.709> zero<00:04:10.739> we'll<00:04:11.099> just<00:04:11.280> treat<00:04:11.519> it<00:04:11.549> as<00:04:11.729> 0

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
enough to zero we'll just treat it as 0

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.360 
enough to zero we'll just treat it as 0
so<00:04:13.019> we<00:04:13.169> want<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.560> say<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:13.769> if<00:04:13.949> you<00:04:14.039> want<00:04:14.159> to<00:04:14.189> say

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
so we want to say is if you want to say

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.159 
so we want to say is if you want to say
if<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.729> joystick<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.209> greater<00:04:15.599> than<00:04:15.780> 10<00:04:15.989> or

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
if the joystick is greater than 10 or

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.289 
if the joystick is greater than 10 or
less<00:04:16.530> than<00:04:16.739> negative<00:04:16.889> 10<00:04:17.340> which<00:04:17.969> means<00:04:18.000> it's

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
less than negative 10 which means it's

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.199 
less than negative 10 which means it's
outside<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.870> dead<00:04:19.079> zone<00:04:19.820> which<00:04:20.820> is<00:04:20.849> otherwise

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
outside the dead zone which is otherwise

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.510 
outside the dead zone which is otherwise
known<00:04:21.389> as<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.570> absolute<00:04:21.779> value<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.710> that

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
known as the absolute value of that

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.840 
known as the absolute value of that
joystick<00:04:24.080> value

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
joystick value

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.750 
joystick value
in<00:04:26.630> this<00:04:26.750> case<00:04:26.960> joy<00:04:27.140> joy<00:04:27.770> one<00:04:28.010> for<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.400> while<00:04:28.580> one

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
in this case joy joy one for a while one

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.630 
in this case joy joy one for a while one
is<00:04:29.690> greater<00:04:30.050> than<00:04:30.290> 10<00:04:31.810> then<00:04:32.810> we<00:04:33.800> want<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:34.130> run

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
is greater than 10 then we want to run

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
is greater than 10 then we want to run
this<00:04:34.790> code<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:36.040> then<00:04:37.040> if<00:04:37.310> it's<00:04:38.000> not<00:04:38.270> doing

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
this code and then if it's not doing

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.220 
this code and then if it's not doing
that<00:04:38.810> so<00:04:39.050> we'll<00:04:39.170> type<00:04:39.320> else<00:04:39.590> we<00:04:40.520> just<00:04:40.550> want<00:04:40.910> to

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
that so we'll type else we just want to

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.810 
that so we'll type else we just want to
set<00:04:42.230> the<00:04:42.260> motor<00:04:42.670> to<00:04:43.670> zero<00:04:44.470> so<00:04:45.470> in<00:04:45.560> that<00:04:45.710> case<00:04:46.010> if

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
set the motor to zero so in that case if

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.580 
set the motor to zero so in that case if
it's<00:04:47.060> in<00:04:47.300> that<00:04:47.450> dead<00:04:47.690> zone<00:04:47.720> we<00:04:48.170> just<00:04:48.350> want<00:04:48.530> to

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
it's in that dead zone we just want to

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.830 
it's in that dead zone we just want to
treat<00:04:48.800> it<00:04:48.860> as<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.310> being<00:04:49.340> zero<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:50.060> we<00:04:50.810> can

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
treat it as it being zero and we can

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.590 
treat it as it being zero and we can
type<00:04:51.200> the<00:04:51.410> same<00:04:51.620> thing<00:04:51.920> for<00:04:52.670> the<00:04:53.030> right<00:04:53.270> motor

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
type the same thing for the right motor

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.350 
type the same thing for the right motor
so<00:04:54.020> very<00:04:54.260> thick<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.950> Droid<00:04:55.310> 1<00:04:55.640> underscore<00:04:56.180> y2

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
so very thick the Droid 1 underscore y2

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.160 
so very thick the Droid 1 underscore y2
is<00:04:57.320> greater<00:04:57.500> than<00:04:58.040> 10<00:05:01.510> motor<00:05:02.510> right<00:05:02.930> moon

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
is greater than 10 motor right moon

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.300 
is greater than 10 motor right moon
above<00:05:03.470> all<00:05:03.800> and<00:05:04.180> then<00:05:05.180> we<00:05:05.330> can<00:05:05.540> type<00:05:05.780> else<00:05:06.310> just

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
above all and then we can type else just

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.150 
above all and then we can type else just
treat<00:05:07.730> it<00:05:07.910> as<00:05:08.120> zero<00:05:10.870> all<00:05:11.870> right<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:12.830> once<00:05:13.010> we're

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
treat it as zero all right so once we're

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.350 
treat it as zero all right so once we're
done<00:05:13.220> with<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:13.400> that<00:05:13.730> should<00:05:13.880> be<00:05:13.910> an<00:05:14.120> entire

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
done with that that should be an entire

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.300 
done with that that should be an entire
code<00:05:14.630> that<00:05:14.810> should<00:05:14.960> run<00:05:15.350> correctly<00:05:15.860> with<00:05:16.220> the

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
code that should run correctly with the

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.560 
code that should run correctly with the
joysticks<00:05:16.730> what<00:05:16.910> we<00:05:17.000> want<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.210> do<00:05:17.270> is<00:05:17.360> you<00:05:17.420> want

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
joysticks what we want to do is you want

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
joysticks what we want to do is you want
to<00:05:17.630> save<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.080> file<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:18.590> then<00:05:19.520> robot<00:05:20.590> piling

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
to save the file and then robot piling

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.100 
to save the file and then robot piling
down<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.950> program<00:05:22.220> to<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.880> robot<00:05:23.210> so<00:05:23.570> let's<00:05:23.900> go

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
down the program to a robot so let's go

00:05:24.110 --> 00:06:34.149 
down the program to a robot so let's go
over<00:05:24.200> the<00:05:24.410> robot<00:05:24.710> and<00:05:24.800> see<00:05:25.010> how<00:05:25.190> it<00:05:25.250> runs

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.860 

so<00:06:35.159> as<00:06:35.339> you<00:06:35.520> can<00:06:35.639> see<00:06:35.699> the<00:06:36.150> joystick<00:06:36.569> program

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
so as you can see the joystick program

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.499 
so as you can see the joystick program
that<00:06:37.050> we<00:06:37.139> wrote<00:06:37.379> works<00:06:37.740> perfectly<00:06:38.400> and<00:06:38.699> yours

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:39.509 
that we wrote works perfectly and yours

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:41.540 
that we wrote works perfectly and yours
