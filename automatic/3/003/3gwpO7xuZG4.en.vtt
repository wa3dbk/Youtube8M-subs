00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
and I only do this method on bone

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.080 
and I only do this method on bone
straight<00:01:04.449> hair<00:01:04.809> so<00:01:05.110> I<00:01:05.619> can<00:01:05.830> actually<00:01:06.130> see<00:01:06.340> what

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
straight hair so I can actually see what

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.270 
straight hair so I can actually see what
I'm<00:01:07.930> trying<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.350> see<00:01:08.619> if<00:01:08.680> there's<00:01:09.010> anything

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
I'm trying to see if there's anything

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.250 
I'm trying to see if there's anything
restraining<00:01:09.880> not<00:01:10.030> see<00:01:10.390> if<00:01:10.450> there's<00:01:10.720> any<00:01:10.960> split

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
restraining not see if there's any split

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.140 
restraining not see if there's any split
ends<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:11.650> is<00:01:11.799> straight<00:01:12.159> so<00:01:12.640> it's<00:01:12.790> really<00:01:13.030> easy

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
ends and is straight so it's really easy

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.240 
ends and is straight so it's really easy
it<00:01:13.720> practically<00:01:14.439> just<00:01:14.710> jumps<00:01:15.220> out<00:01:15.369> at<00:01:15.580> me<00:01:15.610> I

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it practically just jumps out at me I

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.300 
it practically just jumps out at me I
start<00:01:18.250> by<00:01:18.340> taking<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.759> section<00:01:19.180> of<00:01:19.360> my<00:01:19.570> hair

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:33.399 

clipping<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.460> remainder<00:01:25.000> of<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.450> section<00:01:25.900> up

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.190 

okay<00:01:34.369> then<00:01:34.579> I<00:01:34.610> have<00:01:34.790> a<00:01:35.000> small<00:01:35.360> section<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:36.020> my

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200

I get these short strands that pop out

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.460 
I get these short strands that pop out
this<00:02:26.090> is<00:02:26.269> this<00:02:26.599> one<00:02:26.840> won't<00:02:27.079> be<00:02:27.140> trimming

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
this is this one won't be trimming

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.140 
this is this one won't be trimming

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
different that's taking time so that any

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.630 
different that's taking time so that any
string<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:50.290> hasn't<00:03:50.859> popped<00:03:51.010> out<00:03:51.280> in<00:03:51.549> a

that'll<00:05:54.200> work<00:05:54.230> on<00:05:54.560> edge<00:05:54.770> right<00:05:55.010> here<00:05:55.360> it's<00:05:56.360> as

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
that'll work on edge right here it's as

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.050 
that'll work on edge right here it's as
well<00:05:57.020> but<00:05:57.650> I<00:05:58.010> don't<00:05:58.190> know<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.400> just<00:05:58.460> always<00:05:58.820> do

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
well but I don't know I just always do

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.300 
well but I don't know I just always do
it<00:05:59.210> on<00:05:59.300> arm<00:06:00.110> straight<00:06:00.440> hair<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:01.190> that's

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
it on arm straight hair so that's

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.220 
it on arm straight hair so that's
basically<00:06:01.760> what<00:06:01.970> I<00:06:02.000> do<00:06:02.120> to<00:06:02.390> maintain<00:06:02.810> my<00:06:02.990> ears

once a month on straight hair when I use

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.320 
once a month on straight hair when I use
my<00:06:16.460> heat<00:06:16.610> pass<00:06:16.820> was<00:06:17.780> just<00:06:17.960> in<00:06:18.140> direct<00:06:18.500> heat<00:06:18.740> and

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
my heat pass was just in direct heat and

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.960 
my heat pass was just in direct heat and
it<00:06:20.330> really<00:06:20.870> helped<00:06:21.320> me<00:06:21.410> to<00:06:22.010> keep<00:06:22.550> my<00:06:22.730> ears
