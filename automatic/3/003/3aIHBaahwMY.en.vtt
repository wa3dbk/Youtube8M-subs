00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.960 
given to us in the ways that we want
them<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:32.260> we<00:04:33.260> don't<00:04:33.500> want<00:04:33.920> to<00:04:34.220> do<00:04:34.460> things<00:04:34.790> like

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
them and we don't want to do things like

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.820 
them and we don't want to do things like
anyone<00:04:35.450> else<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:35.870> we<00:04:36.140> don't<00:04:36.260> want<00:04:36.380> anyone

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
anyone else and we don't want anyone

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.480 
anyone else and we don't want anyone
else<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.190> do<00:04:37.340> things<00:04:37.610> like<00:04:37.790> us<00:04:39.340> so<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.370> think

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
else to do things like us so I think

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.820 
else to do things like us so I think
that<00:04:40.760> that's<00:04:40.880> all<00:04:41.120> I'm<00:04:41.210> going<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.390> share<00:04:41.830> for

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
that that's all I'm going to share for

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.620 
that that's all I'm going to share for
her<00:04:43.070> because<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:43.670> don't<00:04:43.910> like<00:04:44.030> speaking<00:04:44.360> for

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
her because I don't like speaking for

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.450 
her because I don't like speaking for
other<00:04:44.720> people<00:04:45.110> but<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.980> think<00:04:46.220> that<00:04:46.250> that's

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
other people but I think that that's

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:54.250 
other people but I think that that's
safe<00:04:46.790> to<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.630> say<00:04:48.550> for<00:04:49.550> me<00:04:49.760> I<00:04:52.600> yeah<00:04:53.600> safety<00:04:54.140> and

safe to to say for me I yeah safety and

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.560 
safe to to say for me I yeah safety and
freedom<00:04:54.380> it's<00:04:54.770> super<00:04:55.100> important<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.640> that

freedom it's super important and that

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.420 
freedom it's super important and that
