the land of the birds-of-paradise is
isolated<00:00:56.590> at<00:00:56.680> many<00:00:57.070> levels<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.670> that's<00:00:58.149> one

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
isolated at many levels and that's one

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.229 
isolated at many levels and that's one
of<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.899> important<00:00:59.290> reasons<00:00:59.559> why<00:00:59.879> 39<00:01:00.879> species

have evolved to be so different getting
to<00:01:05.920> these<00:01:06.040> difficult<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.940> reach<00:01:07.060> places<00:01:07.330> had

to these difficult to reach places had

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.120 
to these difficult to reach places had
to<00:01:07.990> go<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:08.440> many<00:01:08.500> different<00:01:08.619> mountain

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
to go to so many different mountain

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.440 
to go to so many different mountain
ranges<00:01:09.159> so<00:01:09.520> many<00:01:09.640> different<00:01:09.880> islands

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
ranges so many different islands

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.200

well that's one another advantage of
having<00:03:29.230> two<00:03:29.500> different<00:03:29.769> angles<00:03:29.830> because<00:03:30.100> I'm

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
having two different angles because I'm

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.610 
having two different angles because I'm
looking<00:03:30.430> up<00:03:31.300> like<00:03:31.570> that<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.810> have<00:03:32.080> like<00:03:32.350> bright

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
looking up like that I have like bright

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.320 
looking up like that I have like bright
eyes<00:03:33.250> like<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.580> right<00:03:33.760> in<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.940> background

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
eyes like that right in the background

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.740 
eyes like that right in the background
right<00:03:34.450> now<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:35.700> fundamental<00:03:36.700> motivation<00:03:37.450> for

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
right now a fundamental motivation for

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
our work is scientifically driven it's

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.440 
our work is scientifically driven it's
not<00:03:40.360> simply<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.410> have<00:03:42.070> beautiful<00:03:42.550> images<00:03:43.180> or

images that can be used to tell the

diverse evolution of these birds but

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.610 
diverse evolution of these birds but

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
that same isolation has made it really

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.880 
that same isolation has made it really

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
Eden I see our work as a way to make

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.250 
Eden I see our work as a way to make
