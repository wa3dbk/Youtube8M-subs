00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.119
 hi everyone amazed 100 case I hope that 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.509
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.099
 nickel 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.470
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.390
 new video on gta 5 online a 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.830
 new guide that will allow you in 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.109
 first makes a vehicle or what the 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.570
 fuck a vehicle completely destroyed and 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.920
 especially neon lights on your vehicle 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.089
 without having jailbreak consoles and 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.949
 that's really not bad with 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:35.900
 this glitch or so we could even say 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.470
 this hack so pretty parker has everything from 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.970
 started 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.280
 first of all we find ourselves in a 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.870
 online session and you will have to take the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.979
 same vehicle as later so 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.989
 that is to say that for example me there I 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.280
 take one earlier and later during 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.930
 that I also take pictures in my 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.739
 software 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.510
 then you will settle your point 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.159
 of appearance on last position 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.619
 and once you've done all that 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.790
 you can leave I was online you 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:58.610
 know you press the start key 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.830
 online tgt online and you confirm 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.119
 the little alert message so here we go 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.199
 have a little load time she 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.210
 will end up in the story mode 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.270
 with michael or franklin no matter 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.380
 I just do not have it work with Trevor 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.450
 and you will have to go to 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.100
 garage had to us so is right here 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.539
 I'm going to go there I'm doing a 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.109
 small cut for not that video 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.109
 be too long 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.700
 we see that we end up in the garage 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.679
 should we from there you go out of 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.240
 vehicle in which you are 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.460
 take out your phone you will do 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.229
 a little quick backup so the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.030
 sail has created a save on the map 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.380
 memory do not forget you can the 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.090
 do it on the hard drive years after 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.710
 go find the go 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.060
 search for the safeguard of the soil 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.479
 hard drive to put it back on the key 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.399
 usb 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.289
 that's what on playstation they will have to 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.819
 to do since on play we will not be able 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.289
 directly back up our 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.030
 backup on the usb key 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.130
 we can only save on the system 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.710
 and then you can copy so 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.539
 this backup this usb key vote then 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.039
 here we are on the pc for the 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.899
 party for the pc part 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.369
 here you are going to have to go open this 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.200
 software so I will put myself in the 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.600
 description for people who do not 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.359
 do not have it open yet we're just going 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.549
 wait for the software to open 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.840
 here you will click on open currencies 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.390
 so for people who are on 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.350
 xbox and open file for people who 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.480
 are on ps 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.550
 hopla open labs to select them your 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.690
 save so be careful 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.980
 time is the only thing that can 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.780
 tell you a little bit that she 'll have to keep herself 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.820
 take this for example me it was 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.650
 this one here I put it right in there 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.460
 bim the backup will open we will see 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.200
 a little bit of all the data from the 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.280
 backup in software and I'll get you 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.980
 show that it's really very very 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.840
 just hop there directly michael 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.370
 it's all good here you put the god 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.260
 fashion that is really essential for 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.340
 operate this beach and then 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.320
 which you go with more than just click 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.790
 here on garage and there you will see 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.560
 the amanita is really very very simple 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.790
 as I wanted to show just now 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.580
 and I insisted a little I had a 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.290
 picture in online mode is so it's 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.660
 party you take michael garage of life 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.070
 woods and watch first vehicle you 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.830
 put a fall to the second vehicle 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.150
 a fall so I have to show you 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.400
 first vehicle you put a picture 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.920
 and at level 2 of the armor you put 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.750
 02 or no, ie no you 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.410
 select in a second vehicle 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.330
 the same 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.520
 a picture at armor level you 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.630
 put nuns and you take back a 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.100
 other vehicle this time the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.100
 third you put a fighter 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.200
 the p 996 the same armor you put 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.240
 nuns and then here look at the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.650
 last so was early and this time 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.630
 this one you can improve it thoroughly 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.790
 and above all put the armor at 100% 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.980
 really very important if not the glitch 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.630
 will not work then once 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.860
 you have it all you do not have anymore 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.490
 than click here left on 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.620
 save 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.600
 here is your backup was done with 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.580
 success and now we have more than 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.410
 end up on the console to make 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.090
 so this is the last step of this 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.650
 little guide 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.150
 so here I just restart my game 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.410
 unfortunately I do not have the right 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.700
 backup so if you happen 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.330
 do like me you press the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.910
 start button 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.500
 here you go from loaded stakes and you 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.700
 recharge your last backup so 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.680
 look at me it was only who was 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.450
 just here on the flat hop there she's just 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.980
 here so I take it back so I have 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.360
 demonstrated it like that you can see 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.260
 that it's not patched if you ever have 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.850
 this little problem 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.860
 be careful of times when you 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.030
 restart the game it does not give you 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.380
 directly on your last 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.780
 backup must go get it 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.510
 manually in your in your 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.890
 settings next here so I 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.960
 reappeared in story mode with the 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.190
 good backup with michael he got 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.670
 then you will have to go back into 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.290
 the garage 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.910
 here when you go back into the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.950
 garage you'll see that vehicles 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.810
 are going to be a little weird so to little 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.520
 some vehicles or be shot 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.440
 while look at me my plane from 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.820
 hunt and roses a little weird ag 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.800
 to see going back in one of the cars 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.020
 flat then here you go out of your 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.770
 robbery of your garage one thing is to 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.360
 exit from sidings 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.830
 you do eight rounds and you 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.080
 go inside with the same 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.770
 vehicle to the plates he puts turn go 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.540
 to go inside 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.380
 alas once I was going back 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.780
 in you are going to see that there is going to be 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.630
 a big bug what the fuck the garage will have 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.910
 exploded look well hop there bim explodes 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.110
 and you end up here on the ground if 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.850
 this is the case when you when you 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.110
 go back into the garage located at that you 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.820
 come out directly and you do this 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.410
 that I 'm doing here is not it you pick up 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.170
 the car you bring out your earnings 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.280
 until that gives that so there 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.930
 then when you come out of your 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.460
 garage look good it's very 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.170
 important here you go out your 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.030
 phone and we'll have to make a 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.230
 small quick save except 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.280
 that attention and if we will not create a 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.230
 new backup 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.370
 we will indeed crush the old 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.020
 backup that we did just now 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.840
 then here you press the key 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.400
 charged game stars and you're charging so 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.380
 the last backup you just 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.150
 to do at the moment to the loaded dish these 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.530
 data you put him so is there 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.880
 normally if everything went well on 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.970
 glitch will have worked well you're going 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.960
 see it's really enough what the fuck 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.310
 I'm going to enjoy it for you 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.150
 invite to join us on our 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.100
 facebook group 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.020
 if you ever have any tips 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.730
 questions if you are looking for help from 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.860
 what do you think I put you 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.330
 links in the description would have it 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.220
 appears in story mode with michael 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.630
 as I say you get into your 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.790
 garage and there you will see that one of 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.350
 neon vehicles that it is a 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.360
 color a little what the fuck up the 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.740
 look it's right here so sometimes 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.490
 it does not work the first time 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.200
 did not give up 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.510
 I also did not succeed from the first 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.070
 shot then you press start in 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.200
 line directly and you launch a 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.670
 session on invitation and you go 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.020
 see that as I took a picture 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.210
 that's what I tried to do 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.340
 understand at the beginning of the video the future 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.960
 that I will have online mode there rather than 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.030
 I will have online mode will have the same 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.440
 characteristics that the future you 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.570
 come to see so with the neon lights and the 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.700
 color what the fuck and frankly I 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.110
 think it's really stylish so 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.610
 you too can have neon lights
