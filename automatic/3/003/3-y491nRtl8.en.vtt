 tg1 in 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.560
 we don't all know before the birth of our natural environment the water pulls 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.300
 that's why they have all the courses for children really start from 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.040
 we start again with 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.680
 newborns that grain how to pass by the six months amateur video contains for 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.690
 the diet 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.350
 and this is the whole band came sooner or later there are tabellini children edits 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.010

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.880
 facebook autonomy from sunset 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.360
 If you collect my school age 6 7 8 9 10 years and then the bike remembers 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.230
 teenagers when children are very small the big difference between one and 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.070
 the other is represented by fidenza milk proven to be the person it is 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.600
 major difficulty depends on how naturally they arrive if they arrive that 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.180
 have never stopped their head under the water greater difficulty 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.750
 3 to convince them to win the one at that sea port if they are in between 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.860
 do something naturally but it's the difficulty let's call it technical 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.640
 so let's hear what the parents who accompany their parents ask first of all 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.720
 children to vote 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.170
 first of all, the same number 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.970
 generally know high notarial ask that they are not afraid of 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.110
 exact theme have fun getting through that happens to you 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.440
 the best way to deal with fear is surely the teaching game is 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.010
 always the same is that of the zompo the child kinder and have fun 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.400
 in this way hopefully 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.480
 the fear of 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.500
 therefore it also plays relational peace with other children 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.580
 with the others 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.189
 the rules of the game within a context that can be so 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.879
 I have consequently said the buoyancy comes naturally 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.129
 can pass from the water of the didactic pool of mathematics lo 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.650
 slipping the first technique that children have to take the pass 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.249
 obliged to pass from the small pool to the larger one we begin in 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:31.249
 small pool with depth depth sense thrusts 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.950
 and subsequently we can intestinal 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.690
 larger and deeper where before they must acquire a frisbee angela depth 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.519
 and then spin tennis backstroke players even in large pools must 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.269
 be naturally 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.269
 first set small pool then denim 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.319
 with more than 6 years children are more or less able to slip can 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.469
 so the larger pool the across game continue their way 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.629
 opening up other techniques 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.909
 is a technique for specification 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.619
 proud of details 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.080
 d 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.709
 let's look at the finesse of the grandmother 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.699
 the frequency with 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.229
 general, the shark 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.139
 obviously the children are not 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.879
 here to train i'm here to play gliding damage the first ones 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.809
 movements with the lower limbs who we are 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:29.989
 olÃ¨ perfecting the open position on the belly down 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.749
 editalia floating position chased the mind and we follow the propulsion 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:36.259
 through the use of the legs 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:39.339
 we present end of the year to include also 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:42.559
 minimum coordination then insert the practice over the legs 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.999
 that after having had affectionate next rival around the 8 years the children 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:53.169
 are already set ready to learn the swimming technique in 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:54.509
 more complete way 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.509
 this thing to you children who have already arrived in the water 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:02.359
 they are ready to win because they are the limits of the technique 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.159
 have a much more conscious progression. profile of what will be 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.689
 the famous one
