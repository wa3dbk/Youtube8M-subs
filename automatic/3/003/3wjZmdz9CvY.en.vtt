00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.630
 the box we have this once 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.690
 new ipad2 second generation no taboo 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.380
 for but a retina display and her 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.980
 Of course you have the new a7 in there 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.019
 Of course, care will come again 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.519
 fun 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.320
 unfortunately could not so much that the 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:39.829
 display is really a lot 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:41.829
 better relatively spectacularly spectacular 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.390
 if you like the ipad of the first generation 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.739
 where does violence in any case the only 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.960
 if we are in the market yours 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.590
 Trust me and show you this display 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.879
 look at 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:01:01.789
 that's the next highlight on 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.260
 and i watch this cash register we 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.820
 have once the ipad of the fourth 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.760
 generation and that 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.650
 who as it is now that is the 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.220
 sixth generation so it is here 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.190
 once the differences in height that 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.540
 It is said to have become much younger what 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.670
 you can see it very well here 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.670
 the super narrow frame of the whole 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.820
 which is now in iphone 5 for example the 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:42.020
 the seven native drove properly 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:45.860
 Worry will be a bit of something of the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.060
 the ipad mini is very insane 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.649
 beautiful the light better 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.360
 I'm never really user needs 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:57.560
 to say that I actually that me 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.180
 I'm trapped in China but still 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.390
 Find a bigger tablet wants to run 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.920
 with that definitely in good and above all 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.380
 meanwhile much easier 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.170
 settle that I think mobile 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.330
 traveling is very important yes that 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.090
 was the first quick look 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.710
 on the new album which today from 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.910
 apple was presented and thank you 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.630
 See you for watching until next time 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.270
 look full box we have yes 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.280
 once the ipad and the ipad mini 2 in the 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.800
 comparative in the largest comparative as 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.600
 you probably can not think 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.590
 the ipad mini two above and not that 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.560
 he was again in weight clearly 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.020
 slimmed down now arrives and the ipad 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.740
 mini 2 has donated the retina display 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.020
 to get 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.710
 nevertheless 10 hours of battery life and that 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.120
 is for me that he really is 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.060
 spectacular I am a friend of 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.400
 little minis and that's how it looks 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.590
 stop in the overview of the display 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.459
 is a dream for the ipad 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.990
 generation has is of course 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.970
 an answer refers to mastering 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.380
 and so the two are compared, the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.280
 was here again just a thank you for 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.280
