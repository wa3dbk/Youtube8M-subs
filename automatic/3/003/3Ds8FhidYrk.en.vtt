00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.950
 after his tent to weaken then in 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.389
 our series my life my lab the 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.490
 webtele of agrosup dijon 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.760
 we are here in a mixed unit of 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.680
 rocks and shit in a mixed unit of 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.609
 search or if my memories are good 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.060
 we study the fat the lipids rather the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.900
 lipids 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.050
 rather so professor martin us 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.609
 So, it's me, it's benard blessed 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.400
 benard professor so we are in 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.230
 your team knox knox psychology 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.149
 of nutrition physiology of the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.579
 nutrition these topics said of the 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.710
 nutrition and toxicology within 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.050
 the Joint Lipid Research Unit 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.920
 cancer nutrition where we study so the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.510
 EPIDe 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.219
 yes here we try to demonstrate that the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.140
 lipids can be possibly a 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:02.079
 sixth taste flavors agree so 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:04.610
 fat what so well then good night 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:10.390
 can you just for the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:15.280
 placement of the camera not a bit short 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:18.200
 here it is the same place it goes 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.900
 that tone and that's how you got 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.579
 discovered the seddik receiver 36 all to 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.409
 done with my colleagues we first 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.990
 identify cd 36 at the intestinal level 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.520
 and then a few years ago we 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.430
 found it also at the level of 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.170
 taste buds in humans and at home 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.729
 the animal and I remember it and that's when 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.380
 including the links between this sensor 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.290
 surrendered 36 and the brain that can 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.189
 understand some cases of obesity 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.500
 in some obese people 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.240
 profession there is a deregulation of 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.310
 information transmitted by the sensor 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.360
 yielded 36 to the regulator that is the brain 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.250
 which translates into a 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.960
 overconsumption of gr 1 that's right 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.790
 until the brain say no 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.259
 it's a good the sensor itself 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.240
 gave up ouhlala it's good I have my dose 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.880
 what I want most is to eat and drink at 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.159
 the cap a little yes it's pretty much 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.969
 close that so mister martin me it's 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.320
 bénard bénard if I followed what is 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.090
 because of that sensor when that 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.920
 becomes big so we can say 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.900
 obese no but I was not there and 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.800
 is not likely but excuse me 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.380
 could stop making noise 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.480
 behind the ps2 thanks so in the case 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.490
 of obesity professor the sensor is 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.860
 disrupted by chronic inflammations 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.300
 microbial flora at the level of 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.370
 language we agree and and from 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.680
 the gut there exists as a kind of 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.370
 continuum along an oro axis 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.270
 intestinal 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.950
 it takes thalamus hypothalamus 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.450
 hypothalamus on which we find the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.310
 same type of receiver 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.660
 but and if their mechanisms of 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.240
 functioning its next the 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.660
 psychological consequences that 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.770
 physiological here that it entails are 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.930
 different according to their 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.340
 localization all that to say that 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.170
 unlike the five primary flavors 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.130
 1 that we know who are the sweetest the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.560
 salty bitter acid and lou grandma small 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.540
 Japanese sweets the fat it is not 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.190
 perceptible as a unique sensation 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.320
 yes you have roughly summarized the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.410
 situation actually we know that the 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.740
 wolf granny the sweet salty is rather 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.200
 perceived as something positive 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.290
 while all that is acidic and bitter 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.670
 is rather a yves rainy flavor this 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.160
 that we currently think is that 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.840
 for the fat and well this grain would be 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.630
 not necessarily perceived as a flavor 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.250
 primary as such and that would be 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.800
 rather perceived unconsciously 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.610
 but despite everything would make it possible 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.090
 a selection 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.890
 a beyond of foods according to the 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.280
 energy density that includes one 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.460
 could speak of one of a taste of 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.720
 energy what am I going to say to myself actually 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.730
 somehow the fact of being able 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.350
 have a system that from the outset 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.540
 mouth of a food would allow 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.920
 the man to guide him in his choice in 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.750
 function of the energy density that 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.760
 provides him could represent a 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.060
 evolutionary advantage that we would find 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.440
 through different animal species 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.300
 in the current context at least 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.670
 developed countries that could explain 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:13.130
 why obesity is steadily growing 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.750
 1 quite we know that obesity a 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.620
 a real public health problem in 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.239
 world level but actually the origin of 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.799
 multiparametric obesity 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.260
 extremely complex though 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.970
 currently we think that group e 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.790
 contribute to the establishment of this 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.710
 obesity too, even though you can stop 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.970
 day I'm not that big it's just 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.970
 that you pay attention to sensors 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.340
 it turns but so professor know if 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.230
 I'm good at understanding the 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.270
 malfunction of this sensor one can 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.610
 restore the body's metabolism and is 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.500
 so heal the big things finally I want 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.490
 tell people in situation 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.530
 obesity but in fact all the work 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.320
 we are currently conducting with our 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.400
 agrosup team and try to put 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.530
 highlight agonists systems 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.020
 who will be able to stimulate one these 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.790
 receptors or inhibit them and 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.260
 to try to see the impact that this can 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.390
 have on eating behavior he 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.660
 risk of obesity 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:18.560
 it's very clear, well, here's the 28 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.880
 guys 1 watch out for your sensors very good 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.050
 Well, we'll give you a little copy of 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.740
 movie guys fresh a copy to 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.740
 sir martin 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:39.150
 in profile chammartin thanks again a 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.870
 webinar that guys yes how do we do 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.870
 to have a coffee
