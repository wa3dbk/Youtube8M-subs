00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.310 
etc only bad thing about this box was
that<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.310> comes<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> wheel<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that it comes with the wheel on the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.389 
that it comes with the wheel on the
other<00:01:52.439> side<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.549> supposed<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.090> roll<00:01:54.860> but<00:01:55.860> it
