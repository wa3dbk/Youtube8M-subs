00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.130 
hi Jerri kayfetz here with Omega
Chemical<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.549> talk<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.120> some<00:00:06.569> more<00:00:06.629> today

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
Chemical to talk to you some more today

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.860 
Chemical to talk to you some more today
about<00:00:07.680> aluminum<00:00:08.400> brightener<00:00:08.849> what<00:00:09.750> is

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
about aluminum brightener what is

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.799 
about aluminum brightener what is
aluminum<00:00:10.440> brightener<00:00:10.830> well<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:12.420> could<00:00:12.599> say

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
aluminum brightener well you could say

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.839 
aluminum brightener well you could say
aluminum<00:00:13.349> brightener<00:00:13.799> brightens<00:00:14.309> aluminum

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
aluminum brightener brightens aluminum

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.460 
aluminum brightener brightens aluminum
and<00:00:15.000> leave<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.269> at<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.420> but<00:00:16.020> for<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.289> most

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
and leave it at that but for the most

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.490 
and leave it at that but for the most
part<00:00:16.850> you'd<00:00:17.850> be<00:00:18.060> wrong<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.660> practical<00:00:19.260> sense

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
part you'd be wrong in a practical sense

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.650 
part you'd be wrong in a practical sense
because<00:00:20.039> most<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.760> aluminum<00:00:21.240> brighteners

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
because most of the aluminum brighteners

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.810 
because most of the aluminum brighteners
that<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:22.050> out<00:00:22.230> there<00:00:22.310> really<00:00:23.310> shouldn't<00:00:23.730> be

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
that are out there really shouldn't be

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.060 
that are out there really shouldn't be
called<00:00:24.150> aluminum<00:00:24.840> brighteners<00:00:25.320> they<00:00:25.890> should

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
called aluminum brighteners they should

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.609 
called aluminum brighteners they should
be<00:00:26.189> called<00:00:26.460> aluminum<00:00:27.180> whiteners<00:00:27.840> because

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
be called aluminum whiteners because

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.259 
be called aluminum whiteners because
that's<00:00:28.859> what<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.310> they're<00:00:29.820> harsh

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
that's what they do they're harsh

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.290 
that's what they do they're harsh
they're<00:00:30.900> crude<00:00:31.289> they're<00:00:32.009> primitive<00:00:32.669> they're

they're crude they're primitive they're

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.020 
they're crude they're primitive they're

made as cheaply as possible they skimp

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.569 
made as cheaply as possible they skimp
on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.390> kind<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.960> ingredients<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.040> good

aluminum brightener needs to produce

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.010 
aluminum brightener needs to produce
what<00:00:41.070> we've<00:00:41.280> always<00:00:41.640> been<00:00:42.000> after<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.629> always

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
chemical and that is what we call a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.180

bleached out white and look that you

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.299 
bleached out white and look that you
find<00:00:54.180> most<00:00:54.809> aluminum<00:00:55.559> brighteners<00:00:55.949> leaving

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
find most aluminum brighteners leaving

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.580 
find most aluminum brighteners leaving
behind<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.969> truck<00:00:57.629> washing<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.350> fleet

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the kind of shine that you can look at

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.350 
the kind of shine that you can look at
and<00:01:07.470> say<00:01:07.590> that's<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.100> shine<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.090> just

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and say that's a shine that's not just

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.030 
and say that's a shine that's not just
clean<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.500> matter<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.799> having

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
clean it's not just a matter of having

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.580 
clean it's not just a matter of having
taken<00:01:11.490> off<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> road<00:01:12.000> film<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.470> a

taken off the road film but it's a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.890 
taken off the road film but it's a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
matter of having left behind a shine

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.620 
matter of having left behind a shine
that<00:01:16.710> really<00:01:17.280> brings<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.850> some<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that really brings out some of the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.190 
that really brings out some of the
