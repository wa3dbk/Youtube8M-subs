a big onion chopped up here no because I

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.180 
a big onion chopped up here no because I

there's<00:02:37.030> some<00:02:37.209> kind<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.510> gas<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.140> comes<00:02:38.500> off

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
there's some kind of gas that comes off

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.400 
there's some kind of gas that comes off
the<00:02:38.769> onions<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.489> causes<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.750> tier<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.320> I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
the onions that causes you to tier and I

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.259 
the onions that causes you to tier and I
chair<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.769> lot<00:02:41.950> so<00:02:42.580> if<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.760> keep<00:02:42.940> them<00:02:43.060> in<00:02:43.180> the

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
chair a lot so if I keep them in the

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.930 
chair a lot so if I keep them in the
fridge<00:02:43.300> they're<00:02:44.080> less<00:02:44.290> likely<00:02:44.320> to<00:02:44.800> off<00:02:45.459> gas

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
fridge they're less likely to off gas

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.270 
fridge they're less likely to off gas
because<00:02:46.269> they're<00:02:46.420> colder<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.860> works<00:02:48.040> I

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
because they're colder and it works I

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.190 
because they're colder and it works I
have<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.489> cut<00:02:48.640> them<00:02:48.760> fairly<00:02:48.940> quickly<00:02:49.239> but<00:02:49.540> it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
have to cut them fairly quickly but it

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.020 
have to cut them fairly quickly but it
works<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.519> learn<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.850> on<00:02:52.030> garden<00:02:52.300> fork

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
works so you learn that on garden fork

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.530 
works so you learn that on garden fork
