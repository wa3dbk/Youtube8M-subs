00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you have a similar mic like what we see

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.709 
you have a similar mic like what we see
here<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:37.730> then<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.600> have

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
here but then what we have is we have

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.540 
here but then what we have is we have
multiple<00:00:39.840> different<00:00:40.460> mounting<00:00:41.460> accessories

multiple different mounting accessories
for<00:00:42.329> example<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.350> guitar

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
for example this would be for the guitar

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.430 
for example this would be for the guitar
you<00:00:44.430> could<00:00:44.610> ratch<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.059> into<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> guitar<00:00:45.840> size

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
you could ratch it into the guitar size

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.490 
you could ratch it into the guitar size
you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.579> also<00:00:47.730> release<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.390> some<00:00:48.930> benefits<00:00:49.379> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
you can also release it some benefits to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.189 
you can also release it some benefits to
this<00:00:49.770> mic<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.850> has<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> very<00:00:51.809> smooth

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
this mic is it has a very smooth

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.520 
this mic is it has a very smooth
off-axis<00:00:52.770> response<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.300> handle<00:00:54.629> high<00:00:54.840> SPL

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530

so<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> never<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.370> worry<00:00:56.550> about

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so you never have to worry about

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
so you never have to worry about
clipping<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> microphone<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.590> really

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
clipping the microphone and it's really

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.950 
clipping the microphone and it's really
versatile<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.370> mounting<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.059> adjustment<00:01:00.180> so

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
versatile and mounting and adjustment so

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.689 
versatile and mounting and adjustment so
actually<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:01.980> see<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:02.520> this

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
actually you can see here this

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.820 
actually you can see here this
compression<00:01:03.120> ring<00:01:03.359> comes<00:01:03.660> off<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.229> can

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
compression ring comes off and you can

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.990 
compression ring comes off and you can
adjust<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.369> actual<00:01:06.170> gooseneck<00:01:07.170> height<00:01:07.530> as

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
adjust the actual gooseneck height as

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.580 
adjust the actual gooseneck height as
well<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.270> been<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> gooseneck<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.409> don't

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
well as been the gooseneck so we don't

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.230 
well as been the gooseneck so we don't
want<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.830> slide<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> maximum

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
want to slide it up to get the maximum

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.330 
want to slide it up to get the maximum
gooseneck<00:01:12.659> here<00:01:13.020> bring<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> compression

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
gooseneck here bring the compression

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.800 
gooseneck here bring the compression
ring<00:01:14.460> down<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.090> will<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.360> back<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:15.540> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
ring down and we now will go back up to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.190 
ring down and we now will go back up to
the<00:01:15.900> guitar<00:01:16.640> where<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.790> actually<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.360> simply

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the guitar where we actually can simply

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.280 
the guitar where we actually can simply
just<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.560> snap<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.250> mic<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.850> place<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.479> now

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
just a snap this mic in place and now

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.399 
just a snap this mic in place and now
bent<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.650> over<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.040> adjust<00:01:23.810> DPA<00:01:24.810> has<00:01:25.110> been<00:01:25.290> able

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
bent it over to adjust DPA has been able

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.219
