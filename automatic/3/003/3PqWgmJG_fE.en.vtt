00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
break from the conventions of past games

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.010 
break from the conventions of past games
and<00:00:44.190> Zelda<00:00:44.579> series<00:00:44.760> where<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.510> had<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> follow

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020

in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:49.620> order<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.430> believe<00:00:51.030> this

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
in the right order I believe this

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.209 
in the right order I believe this
departure<00:00:51.719> will<00:00:52.079> create<00:00:52.410> opportunities<00:00:53.190> for

can<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.340> quite<00:01:02.640> peaceful<00:01:03.120> however<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
can be quite peaceful however it is a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.800 
can be quite peaceful however it is a
Zelda<00:01:04.890> game<00:01:04.920> after<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.880> strong<00:01:06.360> enemies

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
Zelda game after all so strong enemies

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
Zelda game after all so strong enemies
will<00:01:07.049> certainly<00:01:07.439> appear<00:01:07.950> even<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
will certainly appear even in this

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.850 
will certainly appear even in this
setting<00:01:09.000> powerful<00:01:09.900> enemies<00:01:10.290> appearing<00:01:10.770> in

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
setting powerful enemies appearing in

setting powerful enemies appearing in
such<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> peaceful<00:01:11.400> world<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
such a peaceful world is one of the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.750 
such a peaceful world is one of the
defining<00:01:12.990> features<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.890> Zelda<00:01:14.220> series<00:01:14.250> I

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
defining features of the Zelda series I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.140 
defining features of the Zelda series I
think<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:16.470> convention<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.880> keep

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
think that one convention we can keep

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.930 
think that one convention we can keep
right
