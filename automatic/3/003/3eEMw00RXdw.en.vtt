situations or real life situations and
it<00:03:44.310> doesn't<00:03:44.549> even<00:03:44.609> seem<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.239> would<00:03:45.299> make

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
it doesn't even seem like it would make

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.750 
it doesn't even seem like it would make
any<00:03:45.569> sense<00:03:45.840> but<00:03:46.079> every<00:03:46.290> every<00:03:46.709> time<00:03:46.919> I<00:03:47.430> do

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
any sense but every every time I do

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.569 
any sense but every every time I do
something<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.389> want<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.599> justify<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.109> so<00:03:49.459> for<00:03:50.459> me

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
stuff so I think that's because other

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.850 
stuff so I think that's because other
people<00:06:12.720> have<00:06:12.750> been<00:06:12.930> unsubscribing<00:06:13.500> or<00:06:13.740> not

people have been unsubscribing or not

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.430 
people have been unsubscribing or not
