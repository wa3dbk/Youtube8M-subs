00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
of make a very simple organization

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
of make a very simple organization
system<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:32.880> my<00:00:32.969> ironing<00:00:33.239> FTB<00:00:33.780> there's<00:00:33.989> not

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
system for my ironing FTB there's not

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.389 
system for my ironing FTB there's not
going<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.380> too<00:00:34.559> complicated<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.160> i<00:00:35.219> can

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
going to be too complicated that i can

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.790 
going to be too complicated that i can
start<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.780> barrel<00:00:36.989> system<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.559> me<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
start with so the barrel system to me is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.110 
start with so the barrel system to me is
one<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.100> those<00:00:38.160> system<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:38.850> very

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
one of those system that it's very

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.720 
one of those system that it's very
simple<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:40.050> only<00:00:40.649> requires<00:00:41.010> wood<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
simple to do only requires wood and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270 
simple to do only requires wood and
that's<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.690> would<00:00:42.960> stone<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.770> some<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that's it would stone and some of the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.100 
that's it would stone and some of the
small<00:00:44.550> items<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> make<00:00:45.180> pneumatic<00:00:45.690> tubes<00:00:45.899> and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
small items to make pneumatic tubes and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.220 
small items to make pneumatic tubes and
you'll<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.350> good<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> go<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.489> nothing<00:00:48.230> special

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you'll be good to go so nothing special

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.350 
you'll be good to go so nothing special
to<00:00:49.410> actually<00:00:49.860> make<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.100> happen<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.300> we

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
to actually make this happen so there we

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.360 
to actually make this happen so there we
go<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.660> let's<00:00:51.840> let's<00:00:52.410> let's<00:00:52.710> try<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.129> put<00:00:53.340> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
go so let's let's let's try to put it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.100 
go so let's let's let's try to put it
together<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.600> are<00:00:54.629> many<00:00:54.899> other

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
together I know there are many other

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.470 
together I know there are many other
systems<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:55.770> better<00:00:55.980> out<00:00:56.190> there<00:00:56.399> yes<00:00:57.120> going

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
systems are better out there yes going

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.209 
systems are better out there yes going
to<00:00:57.629> apply<00:00:57.809> logistic<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> best<00:00:58.770> way<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> go

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
to apply logistic is the best way to go

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.369 
to apply logistic is the best way to go
going<00:00:59.699> that's<00:01:00.329> different<00:01:00.719> ways<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.079> chew

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
going that's different ways you can chew

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.630 
going that's different ways you can chew
the<00:01:01.440> medicalization<00:01:01.739> systems<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.550> are

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the medicalization systems that are

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.700 
the medicalization systems that are
going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> make<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.180> better<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.470> for

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
going to make it better but this is for

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.890 
going to make it better but this is for
simple<00:01:05.489> sake<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.479> people<00:01:06.780> who<00:01:06.810> just

as you want as many items that you want
to<00:01:28.650> organize<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.579> now<00:01:30.150> solely<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
to organize you can do now solely to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300 
to organize you can do now solely to
need<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:30.990> about<00:01:31.079> barrel<00:01:31.530> barrels<00:01:32.070> can

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
need to know about barrel barrels can

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.510 
need to know about barrel barrels can
only<00:01:32.520> fit<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.150> type<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.869> item<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:35.040> example

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
only fit one type of item for example

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.109 
only fit one type of item for example
you<00:01:35.700> cannot<00:01:36.630> put<00:01:37.049> grass<00:01:37.439> blocks<00:01:37.950> into<00:01:38.340> that

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
you cannot put grass blocks into that

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.020 
you cannot put grass blocks into that
barrel<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.350> only<00:01:40.500> fit<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.670> type

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
barrel you can only fit one of that type

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.010 
barrel you can only fit one of that type
that's<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.140> alright<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.340> don't<00:01:45.060> try<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.390> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that's it alright so don't try to is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.300 
that's it alright so don't try to is
that's<00:01:46.290> why<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.530> organization<00:01:47.040> because<00:01:47.189> it

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that's why it's organization because it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.210 
that's why it's organization because it
is<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.700> single<00:01:48.509> item<00:01:48.869> per<00:01:49.110> barrel<00:01:49.350> now<00:01:49.979> this

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
is one single item per barrel now this

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.429 
is one single item per barrel now this
could<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.869> you're<00:01:52.079> ready<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.350> go

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
could be you know if you're ready to go

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.870 
could be you know if you're ready to go
to<00:01:52.560> something<00:01:52.799> bigger<00:01:53.130> than<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.579> go<00:01:53.700> soon

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
to something bigger than you can go soon

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.160 
to something bigger than you can go soon
but<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.659> systems<00:01:55.020> it's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
but this is just like I systems it's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.590 
but this is just like I systems it's
simple<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.159> think<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.850> fun<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.450> guys

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
simple but I think it's fun and you guys

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.080 
simple but I think it's fun and you guys
are<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.930> enjoy<00:01:58.170> building<00:01:58.439> without<00:01:59.219> too

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
are going to enjoy building without too

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.639 
are going to enjoy building without too
much<00:02:00.240> complication<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.140> you're<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.469> putting

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
much complication so you're just putting

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
much complication so you're just putting
a<00:02:01.799> wall<00:02:01.979> over<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:03.180> other<00:02:03.270> thing<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> do

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
a wall over here the other thing to do

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.480 
a wall over here the other thing to do
now<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.079> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> take<00:02:04.350> pneumatic<00:02:05.250> tubes

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
now is it going to take pneumatic tubes

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.609 
now is it going to take pneumatic tubes
now<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> pneumatic<00:02:06.570> tubes<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:06.899> from<00:02:07.170> red<00:02:07.350> power

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
now a pneumatic tubes are from red power

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.669 
now a pneumatic tubes are from red power
they<00:02:08.009> are<00:02:08.250> great<00:02:08.819> they<00:02:09.720> are<00:02:09.899> freaking<00:02:10.470> great

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679

tools that you can use the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.210 
tools that you can use the
building<00:02:13.480> those<00:02:13.600> two<00:02:13.720> pretty<00:02:14.080> simple<00:02:14.530> here's

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
building those two pretty simple here's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.880 
building those two pretty simple here's
the<00:02:15.400> recipe<00:02:15.600> youzhny<00:02:16.600> brass<00:02:16.900> glass<00:02:17.500> and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
the recipe youzhny brass glass and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.640 
the recipe youzhny brass glass and
that's<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.340> brasen<00:02:18.820> glad<00:02:19.030> we<00:02:19.570> said<00:02:19.810> brass<00:02:20.470> you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
that's it brasen glad we said brass you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.170 
that's it brasen glad we said brass you
can't<00:02:20.860> really<00:02:21.040> make<00:02:21.280> by<00:02:21.490> using<00:02:21.670> an<00:02:21.880> alloy

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
can't really make by using an alloy

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.570 
can't really make by using an alloy
furnace<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.750> just<00:02:23.380> smell<00:02:23.860> some<00:02:24.040> copper<00:02:24.430> and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
furnace and just smell some copper and

furnace and just smell some copper and
some<00:02:24.760> 10<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.450> you'll<00:02:25.570> get<00:02:25.690> brass<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.200> you're

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
some 10 and you'll get brass and you're

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.960 
some 10 and you'll get brass and you're
good<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.440> go<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.280> there<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.460> go<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:27.760> then<00:02:27.880> you

good to go so there you go so then you

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.110 
good to go so there you go so then you
build<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.270> so<00:02:28.480> put<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.050> right<00:02:29.110> here<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:31.000> of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
build that so put it right here some of

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.840 
build that so put it right here some of
those<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.890> remember<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.980> barrels<00:02:33.340> filled

those and remember the barrels filled

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.330 
those and remember the barrels filled
from<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.540> top<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:35.080> cannot<00:02:35.500> bring<00:02:35.800> items<00:02:36.160> from

the bottom to the barrel has to be fed
from<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.830> top<00:02:39.120> there<00:02:40.120> we<00:02:40.210> go<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.660> now<00:02:40.750> we<00:02:40.810> got

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
from the top there we go so now we got

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.800 
from the top there we go so now we got
that<00:02:41.200> set<00:02:41.410> up<00:02:41.440> good<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.550> go<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:43.120> see<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.510> so

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
that set up good to go to see that so

am using in their chest you can use any
type<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.030> chip<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.510> reason<00:02:52.780> why<00:02:52.870> using<00:02:53.110> ender

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
type of chip the reason why using ender

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.530 
type of chip the reason why using ender
chest<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:54.100> because<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.550> can<00:02:54.730> have<00:02:54.970> either<00:02:55.209> an

me and i can send items over into my

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.210 
me and i can send items over into my
sorting<00:03:01.270> system<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.750> organize<00:03:02.200> without<00:03:03.040> me

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
sorting system to organize without me

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.699 
sorting system to organize without me
having<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.580> come<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:05.110> location<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.650> the

having to come to the location of the

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.199 
having to come to the location of the
organization<00:03:06.310> system<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.820> know<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.090> ask

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
organization system you know the to ask

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.940 
organization system you know the to ask
you<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.390> put<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.630> items<00:03:07.930> in<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:08.890> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
you to put the items in so this is the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.680 
you to put the items in so this is the
best<00:03:09.100> way<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.340> do<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.790> for<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.600> then

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
best way to do it for that and then

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.550 
best way to do it for that and then
we're<00:03:10.840> going<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.020> do<00:03:11.110> is<00:03:11.230> we're<00:03:11.380> going<00:03:11.470> to

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.720 
we're going to do is we're going to
actually<00:03:11.680> put<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.220> filter<00:03:12.780> right<00:03:13.780> next<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.320> the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
actually put a filter right next to the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.340 
actually put a filter right next to the
chest<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:15.940> can<00:03:16.150> pull<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.510> items<00:03:16.840> out<00:03:17.050> i'm

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
chest so you can pull the items out i'm

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.410 
chest so you can pull the items out i'm
using<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.950> filter<00:03:18.190> because<00:03:18.430> he<00:03:18.970> pulls<00:03:19.269> the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
using a filter because he pulls the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.060 
using a filter because he pulls the
stack<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.810> item<00:03:20.050> at<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.200> time<00:03:20.260> which<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.709> great

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
stack of item at a time which is great
