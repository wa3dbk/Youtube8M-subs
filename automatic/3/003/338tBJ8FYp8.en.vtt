one sentry gun the first challenge is

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.500 
one sentry gun the first challenge is
quite<00:01:49.860> obvious<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:50.700> require<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
have a locking launcher you can use the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.840 
have a locking launcher you can use the
law<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.140> low<00:01:55.350> level<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.370> you'll<00:01:56.610> get

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
law if you are low level but you'll get

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.480 
law if you are low level but you'll get
only<00:01:57.330> UAVs<00:01:58.170> since<00:01:58.500> they<00:01:58.650> don't<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.040> flares

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
only UAVs since they don't have flares

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.960 
only UAVs since they don't have flares
but<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.590> use<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> Strela<00:02:02.400> this<00:02:02.790> is

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
but if you can use the Strela this is

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.800 
but if you can use the Strela this is
the<00:02:03.120> most<00:02:03.299> effective<00:02:03.930> way<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.170> kill<00:02:04.650> aircraft

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
the most effective way to kill aircraft

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.359 
the most effective way to kill aircraft
this<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.990> mainly<00:02:07.200> because<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.860> has<00:02:08.070> two

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
this is mainly because it has two

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.280 
this is mainly because it has two
tracking<00:02:08.820> Rockets<00:02:09.239> which<00:02:09.420> will<00:02:09.630> kill<00:02:09.929> any

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
tracking Rockets which will kill any

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.100 
tracking Rockets which will kill any

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
kill streak in the game just make it

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.780 
kill streak in the game just make it
your<00:02:13.230> priority<00:02:13.440> on<00:02:13.980> shooting<00:02:14.250> down<00:02:14.549> any

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
your priority on shooting down any

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.550 
your priority on shooting down any
aircraft<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.450> pop<00:02:15.630> up<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.049> map<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
aircraft that pop up on the map and

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.050 
aircraft that pop up on the map and
you'll<00:02:16.799> get<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.130> challenge<00:02:17.519> dance<00:02:17.760> quite

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
you'll get this challenge dance quite

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.090 
you'll get this challenge dance quite
fast

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
fast

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.380 
fast
the<00:02:20.100> second<00:02:20.489> challenge<00:02:20.580> will<00:02:20.880> require<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.360> to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
a black bird or a spy plane acting it's

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.880 
a black bird or a spy plane acting it's
also<00:02:26.670> quite<00:02:27.060> self-explanatory<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:28.290> juliet's

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
also quite self-explanatory and juliet's

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.059 
also quite self-explanatory and juliet's
is<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.030> two<00:02:30.269> matches

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
is in one of two matches

is in one of two matches
the<00:02:32.579> third<00:02:32.849> challenge<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.629> most<00:02:33.840> tricky

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
the third challenge is the most tricky

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.920 
the third challenge is the most tricky
one<00:02:34.409> since<00:02:35.129> almost<00:02:35.340> nobody<00:02:35.939> uses<00:02:36.329> sentry<00:02:36.719> guns

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
one since almost nobody uses sentry guns
