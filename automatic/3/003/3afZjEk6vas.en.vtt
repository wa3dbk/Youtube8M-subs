easier to type ears have to press tab
which<00:01:08.690> is<00:01:08.720> minecraft<00:01:09.170> command<00:01:09.680> block<00:01:09.860> which

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
which is minecraft command block which

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.609 
which is minecraft command block which
gives<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.399> one<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.610> these<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.200> fun<00:01:12.200> fact<00:01:12.470> is

00:01:19.839 --> 00:01:19.849 
rabbit let me just get a button just to

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:23.880 
rabbit let me just get a button just to
activate<00:01:20.360> it<00:01:20.690> you<00:01:21.009> will<00:01:22.009> need<00:01:22.160> to<00:01:22.250> do<00:01:22.399> summon

don't you know do slash because command
blocks<00:01:27.020> don't<00:01:27.200> need<00:01:27.410> slash<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.039> then<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.220> go

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
blocks don't need slash and then you go

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.300 
blocks don't need slash and then you go
grab<00:01:29.780> it

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
to go squiggly line these are like the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.169 
to go squiggly line these are like the
coordinates<00:01:37.099> so<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:37.310> want<00:01:37.580> it<00:01:37.640> where<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:37.940> want<00:01:38.149> it

to spawn one block above the command
blocks<00:01:40.819> I<00:01:40.940> just<00:01:41.119> put<00:01:41.330> loops<00:01:41.599> but<00:01:42.319> but<00:01:43.280> one

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
blocks I just put loops but but one

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.270 
blocks I just put loops but but one
which<00:01:44.660> means<00:01:44.810> one<00:01:45.020> block<00:01:45.229> above<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.830> I<00:01:46.069> just

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.330 
which means one block above and I just
leave<00:01:46.489> this<00:01:46.849> to<00:01:47.119> be<00:01:47.920> now<00:01:48.920> this<00:01:49.099> will<00:01:49.250> just

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
leave this to be now this will just

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.309 
leave this to be now this will just
usually<00:01:49.700> spawn<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:50.179> normal<00:01:50.569> rabbit<00:01:50.869> but<00:01:51.050> the

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
usually spawn a normal rabbit but the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.990 
usually spawn a normal rabbit but the
type<00:01:51.800> of<00:01:51.920> rabbit<00:01:52.069> we<00:01:52.280> want<00:01:52.489> to<00:01:52.550> spawn<00:01:52.729> it's<00:01:52.910> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
type of rabbit we want to spawn it's the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.870 
type of rabbit we want to spawn it's the
killer<00:01:53.270> rabbit<00:01:53.539> so<00:01:53.929> we<00:01:54.080> go<00:01:54.489> squiggly<00:01:55.489> bracket

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
killer rabbit so we go squiggly bracket

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.449 
killer rabbit so we go squiggly bracket
like<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.239> and<00:01:56.450> we<00:01:56.539> go<00:01:56.660> rabbit<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.800> then<00:01:58.009> type

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
like this and we go rabbit and then type

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.169 
like this and we go rabbit and then type
and<00:01:58.789> then<00:01:59.750> you<00:01:59.869> go<00:02:00.050> colon<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.099> then<00:02:01.250> 99<00:02:01.700> and

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
and then you go colon and then 99 and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.760 
and then you go colon and then 99 and
then<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.750> close<00:02:02.959> it<00:02:03.020> off<00:02:03.259> with<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> squiggly

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
then you close it off with a squiggly

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.309 
then you close it off with a squiggly
bracket<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:04.550> again<00:02:05.360> command<00:02:05.780> block<00:02:05.959> physics

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
bracket so again command block physics

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.029 
bracket so again command block physics
there<00:02:06.470> has<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.649> be<00:02:07.720> equal<00:02:08.720> amounts<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.619> things

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
there has to be equal amounts of things

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.150 
there has to be equal amounts of things
so<00:02:10.369> like<00:02:10.520> two<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:10.789> these<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.840> know

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
so like two of these and you know

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.250 
so like two of these and you know
right<00:02:12.430> from<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.700> last<00:02:12.910> video<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:13.390> we<00:02:14.050> press

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
right from the last video so we press

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.670 
right from the last video so we press
done<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.210> since<00:02:16.210> he<00:02:16.390> put<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.870> button<00:02:17.500> here

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
done and since he put it a button here

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.160 
done and since he put it a button here
it<00:02:18.070> will<00:02:18.130> spawn<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:19.120> cable<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:19.960> look<00:02:20.020> at

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
it will spawn the cable a but look at

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.190 
it will spawn the cable a but look at
his<00:02:20.290> eyes<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.770> evil<00:02:21.430> look<00:02:22.180> at<00:02:22.330> those<00:02:22.480> eyes<00:02:22.810> he

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
see it's going to game-mode 0 he will do

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.550 
see it's going to game-mode 0 he will do
about<00:02:33.130> 4<00:02:33.370> hearts<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.670> damage<00:02:33.820> so<00:02:34.410> hold<00:02:35.410> on
