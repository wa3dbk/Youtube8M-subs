still using that hog rider sort of
trophy<00:00:09.780> hunting<00:00:10.230> bass<00:00:10.469> design<00:00:10.830> but<00:00:11.040> I

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
trophy hunting bass design but I

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.440 
trophy hunting bass design but I
switched<00:00:11.280> back<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.550> my<00:00:11.790> Pat's<00:00:12.030> playground

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
switched back to my Pat's playground

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.570 
switched back to my Pat's playground
design<00:00:12.780> -<00:00:13.259> I'll<00:00:13.320> protect<00:00:13.650> my<00:00:13.799> resources<00:00:14.429> and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
design - I'll protect my resources and

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.160 
design - I'll protect my resources and
you<00:00:14.969> can<00:00:15.089> see<00:00:15.269> everything's<00:00:15.630> pretty<00:00:15.839> much<00:00:15.990> set

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
you can see everything's pretty much set

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.630 
you can see everything's pretty much set
up<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.379> same<00:00:16.590> except<00:00:16.980> I've<00:00:17.100> built<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:17.490> my

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
up the same except I've built up my

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.970 
up the same except I've built up my
giant<00:00:17.880> bombs<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.570> really<00:00:18.840> didn't<00:00:19.170> make<00:00:19.710> use

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
giant bombs and I really didn't make use

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
giant bombs and I really didn't make use
of<00:00:20.010> those<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.460> my<00:00:20.580> original<00:00:20.820> base<00:00:21.119> design<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
of those in my original base design and

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.120 
of those in my original base design and
seeing<00:00:22.109> as<00:00:22.230> they're<00:00:22.410> pretty<00:00:22.619> expensive<00:00:22.859> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
seeing as they're pretty expensive to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.410 
seeing as they're pretty expensive to
reload<00:00:23.580> I'm<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> throw<00:00:24.240> those

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
reload I'm just going to throw those

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.330 
reload I'm just going to throw those
guys<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> top<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.800> try<00:00:26.010> not<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.220> use

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
guys on the top and I try not to use

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.740 
guys on the top and I try not to use
those<00:00:26.670> if<00:00:26.849> someone<00:00:27.150> drops<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.570> one

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
those if someone drops like one

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.179 
those if someone drops like one
barbarian<00:00:28.260> though<00:00:28.380> it'll<00:00:28.650> probably<00:00:28.830> set<00:00:29.070> them

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
barbarian though it'll probably set them

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.410 
barbarian though it'll probably set them
all<00:00:29.310> off<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.699> we'll<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> see<00:00:30.300> when

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
all off but we'll just have to see when

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.880 
all off but we'll just have to see when
that<00:00:30.539> happens<00:00:30.869> all<00:00:31.050> right<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.710> far<00:00:31.769> as

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
that happens all right as far as

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.470 
that happens all right as far as
upgrades<00:00:32.279> go<00:00:32.430> today<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> focus<00:00:33.090> on

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
upgrades go today I'm going to focus on

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.880 
upgrades go today I'm going to focus on
getting<00:00:33.540> my<00:00:33.780> cannon<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> next<00:00:34.649> level

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
getting my cannon to the next level

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.139 
getting my cannon to the next level
that's<00:00:35.040> only<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.489> another<00:00:35.910> eight

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
that's only going to be another eight

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.880 
that's only going to be another eight
hundred<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.630> twenty<00:00:36.989> thousand<00:00:37.410> gold<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
hundred and twenty thousand gold and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.889 
hundred and twenty thousand gold and
then<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.370> far<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.579> elixir<00:00:39.120> goes<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> still<00:00:39.719> have

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
then as far as elixir goes I still have

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.930 
then as far as elixir goes I still have
this<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> dark<00:00:40.829> elixir<00:00:41.040> drill<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> upgrade

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
this one a dark elixir drill to upgrade

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.639 
this one a dark elixir drill to upgrade
to<00:00:42.149> level<00:00:42.329> four<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.200> I'm<00:00:43.260> going<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> go<00:00:43.530> ahead

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
to level four so I'm going to go ahead

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.110 
to level four so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.950> that's<00:00:44.129> three<00:00:44.460> million<00:00:44.640> elixir

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and do that that's three million elixir

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.970 
and do that that's three million elixir
and<00:00:45.210> those<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.480> pretty<00:00:45.660> cheap<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.920> do

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and those are pretty cheap but if I do

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.010 
and those are pretty cheap but if I do
end<00:00:47.520> up<00:00:47.700> getting<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.090> little<00:00:48.239> bit<00:00:48.390> more<00:00:48.660> gold<00:00:48.840> I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
end up getting a little bit more gold I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
end up getting a little bit more gold I
can<00:00:49.050> probably<00:00:49.500> upgrade<00:00:49.920> something<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.579> my

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
can probably upgrade something like my

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.819 
can probably upgrade something like my
Tesla<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.420> I'm<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.660> gonna<00:00:51.780> go<00:00:52.410> ahead<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.680> see

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
Tesla so I'm just gonna go ahead and see

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.139 
Tesla so I'm just gonna go ahead and see
how<00:00:52.920> much<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.219> get<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.699> then<00:00:53.820> worry<00:00:54.090> about

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
how much I can get and then worry about

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.970 
how much I can get and then worry about
the<00:00:54.329> upgrades<00:00:54.719> at<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> end<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.260> video<00:00:55.500> all

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the upgrades at the end of the video all

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.080 
the upgrades at the end of the video all
right<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.219> let's<00:00:56.370> go<00:00:56.489> ahead<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.640> keep<00:00:56.820> farming

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
right so let's go ahead and keep farming

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.639 
right so let's go ahead and keep farming
like<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.539> said<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> last<00:00:57.930> video<00:00:58.379> I've<00:00:58.530> been

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
like I said in the last video I've been

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.830 
like I said in the last video I've been
starting<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.100> farm<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.609> Crystal<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.300> my<00:01:00.480> second

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
starting to farm in Crystal on my second

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.750 
starting to farm in Crystal on my second
account<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.770> been<00:01:01.920> working<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.370> really

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
account and it's been working out really

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.250 
account and it's been working out really
well<00:01:03.030> at<00:01:03.210> least<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.570> did<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> first<00:01:03.899> video

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
well at least it did in the first video

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
well at least it did in the first video
and<00:01:04.680> since<00:01:05.549> I've<00:01:05.760> been<00:01:05.790> doing<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.299> I've

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and since I've been doing that I've

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.149 
and since I've been doing that I've
actually<00:01:06.689> had<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> lot<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.409> success<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
actually had a lot of success and I

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
actually had a lot of success and I
don't<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.610> spend<00:01:08.850> ten<00:01:09.150> minutes<00:01:09.180> trying

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
don't have to spend ten minutes trying

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.690 
don't have to spend ten minutes trying

like<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.220> personally<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.360> struggling<00:01:15.570> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
like I was personally I was struggling a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.359 
like I was personally I was struggling a
little<00:01:15.869> bit<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.799> I'm<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:16.950> Crystal

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
little bit and now that I'm in Crystal

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.670 
little bit and now that I'm in Crystal
I've<00:01:17.460> been<00:01:17.610> finding<00:01:17.880> bases<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.960> raid<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.350> lot

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
I've been finding bases to raid a lot

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.080 
I've been finding bases to raid a lot
quicker<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.759> guy<00:01:20.909> right

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
quicker so you can see this guy right

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
quicker so you can see this guy right
here<00:01:21.119> first<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:21.869> when<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> found<00:01:22.320> him<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.590> saw

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
here first of all when I found him I saw

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
here first of all when I found him I saw
that<00:01:22.920> his<00:01:23.070> elixir<00:01:23.520> pumps<00:01:23.790> were<00:01:23.909> full<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.630> even

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that his elixir pumps were full so even

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.289 
that his elixir pumps were full so even
though<00:01:24.960> he<00:01:25.140> had<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> league<00:01:25.650> emblem<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.640> could

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
though he had a league emblem I could

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.999 
though he had a league emblem I could
tell<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:27.960> he<00:01:28.290> had<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> lot<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> shrubbery

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
tell that one he had a lot of shrubbery

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.679 
tell that one he had a lot of shrubbery
on<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> outside<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.880> he<00:01:29.970> hadn't<00:01:30.180> logged<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
on the outside so he hadn't logged on to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.300 
on the outside so he hadn't logged on to
clear<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.470> again<00:01:31.590> number<00:01:32.009> two<00:01:32.159> is

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
clear that and then again number two is

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
clear that and then again number two is
elixir<00:01:32.549> pumps<00:01:32.939> were<00:01:33.030> full<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> figured<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
elixir pumps were full so I figured that

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.630 
elixir pumps were full so I figured that
most<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:34.799> going<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> mines

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
most of it was going to be in the mines

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.550 
most of it was going to be in the mines
and<00:01:35.820> pumps<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> started<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> family<00:01:37.470> my

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and pumps so I started to family my

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.170 
and pumps so I started to family my
goblins<00:01:37.979> using<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> same<00:01:38.579> strategy<00:01:39.090> I've

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
goblins using the same strategy I've

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.359 
goblins using the same strategy I've
always<00:01:39.450> used<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.900> did<00:01:40.320> actually<00:01:40.500> add<00:01:40.829> two<00:01:41.130> wall

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
always used I did actually add two wall

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.980 
always used I did actually add two wall
breakers<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> found<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.720> was

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
breakers to it because I found out I was

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.410 
breakers to it because I found out I was
running<00:01:43.320> out<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.640> only<00:01:44.790> had<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> subtract

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
running out and I only had to subtract

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.240 
running out and I only had to subtract
like<00:01:45.570> four<00:01:45.780> goblins<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.350> my<00:01:46.439> composition<00:01:47.040> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
like four goblins for my composition and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.190 
like four goblins for my composition and
yeah<00:01:48.149> things<00:01:48.450> worked<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:48.750> pretty<00:01:48.810> well<00:01:48.990> for

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
yeah things worked out pretty well for

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.719 
yeah things worked out pretty well for
this<00:01:49.320> raid<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> hundred<00:01:50.280> thousand

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
this raid there is a hundred thousand

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.249 
this raid there is a hundred thousand
elixir<00:01:51.149> left<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.659> whatever<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.110> guys<00:01:52.200> are

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
elixir left and whatever you guys are

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.450 
elixir left and whatever you guys are
deciding<00:01:52.829> whether<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.130> want<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.369> continue

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
deciding whether you want to continue

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.460 
deciding whether you want to continue
attacking<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.180> base<00:01:54.360> when<00:01:55.020> I'm<00:01:55.140> looking<00:01:55.259> at

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
attacking a base when I'm looking at

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
attacking a base when I'm looking at
this<00:01:55.649> base<00:01:55.829> there's<00:01:56.100> still<00:01:56.340> four<00:01:56.670> storages

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
this base there's still four storages

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
this base there's still four storages
left<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.600> means<00:01:57.869> there's<00:01:58.079> 25,000<00:01:59.009> elixir

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
left so that means there's 25,000 elixir

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.039 
left so that means there's 25,000 elixir
and<00:01:59.549> each<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.880> those<00:02:00.030> storages<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.689> I'd

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
and each one of those storages and I'd

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.929 
and each one of those storages and I'd
probably<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.619> drop<00:02:01.920> most<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.759> rest

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
probably have to drop most of the rest

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.760 
probably have to drop most of the rest
of<00:02:03.030> my<00:02:03.119> army<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.439> I'm<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.649> going

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
of my army to get that so I'm just going

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.719 
of my army to get that so I'm just going
to<00:02:04.860> skip<00:02:05.040> out<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.520> I'm<00:02:05.579> actually

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
to skip out on that and I'm actually

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.310 
to skip out on that and I'm actually
going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> skip<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> Town<00:02:06.930> Hall<00:02:07.110> -

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
going to skip out on the Town Hall -

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.570 
going to skip out on the Town Hall -
because<00:02:07.680> I'm<00:02:07.799> really<00:02:07.950> not<00:02:08.129> focused<00:02:08.550> on

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
because I'm really not focused on

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.070 
because I'm really not focused on
trophies<00:02:08.849> I'm<00:02:09.270> going<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> go<00:02:09.810> ahead<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
trophies I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.320 
trophies I'm going to go ahead and
surrender<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.619> take<00:02:10.770> my<00:02:10.920> resources<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:12.209> in

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
surrender and take my resources so in

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.640 
surrender and take my resources so in
the<00:02:12.450> end<00:02:12.599> we<00:02:12.780> got<00:02:12.900> 400

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the end we got 400

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.559 
the end we got 400
steam<00:02:13.829> thousand<00:02:14.310> pretty<00:02:14.519> solid<00:02:14.849> raid<00:02:15.000> again

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
steam thousand pretty solid raid again

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.300 
steam thousand pretty solid raid again
we<00:02:15.750> lost<00:02:15.930> 26<00:02:16.349> trophies<00:02:16.769> because<00:02:16.920> I'm<00:02:17.159> not

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
we lost 26 trophies because I'm not

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.830 
we lost 26 trophies because I'm not
really<00:02:17.459> worried<00:02:17.819> about<00:02:17.939> those<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.569> let's<00:02:18.750> go

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
really worried about those and let's go

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.030 
really worried about those and let's go
ahead<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.049> move<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.439> next<00:02:19.590> one<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:19.950> do

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
ahead and move on to the next one and do

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.280 
ahead and move on to the next one and do
the<00:02:20.189> same<00:02:20.400> exact<00:02:20.760> thing<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.689> this<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.959> another

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the same exact thing so this is another

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.600 
the same exact thing so this is another
type<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.560> base<00:02:22.769> you're<00:02:22.950> going<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.129> find<00:02:23.310> up<00:02:23.459> in

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
type of base you're going to find up in

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.979 
type of base you're going to find up in
crystal<00:02:24.060> 3<00:02:24.329> you're<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.689> find<00:02:24.870> these

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
crystal 3 you're going to find these

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.690 
crystal 3 you're going to find these
bases<00:02:25.409> that<00:02:25.560> have<00:02:25.620> been<00:02:25.769> abandoned<00:02:26.370> they<00:02:26.579> have

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
bases that have been abandoned they have

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.670 
bases that have been abandoned they have
around<00:02:26.939> 600,000<00:02:27.780> resources<00:02:28.260> available

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
around 600,000 resources available

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.960 
around 600,000 resources available
probably<00:02:28.890> not<00:02:29.189> a<00:02:29.220> lot<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.489> its<00:02:29.700> going<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.879> be

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
probably not a lot of its going to be

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.849 
probably not a lot of its going to be
inside<00:02:30.299> of<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> storages<00:02:31.049> if<00:02:31.230> they<00:02:31.590> haven't

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
inside of the storages if they haven't

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.500 
inside of the storages if they haven't
logged<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.159> in<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> while<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.819> I've<00:02:33.239> really

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
logged on in a while and I've really

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.970 
logged on in a while and I've really
just<00:02:33.540> been<00:02:33.720> capitalizing<00:02:34.349> on<00:02:34.409> these<00:02:34.560> bases

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
just been capitalizing on these bases

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.979 
just been capitalizing on these bases
and<00:02:35.159> I<00:02:35.730> found<00:02:36.000> them<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.420> mean<00:02:36.599> you<00:02:36.689> can<00:02:36.840> find

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
and I found them I mean you can find

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.140 
and I found them I mean you can find
these<00:02:37.260> definitely<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.859> gold<00:02:38.189> and<00:02:38.489> mainly<00:02:39.120> for

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
these definitely in gold and mainly for

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.420 
these definitely in gold and mainly for
like<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.599> last<00:02:39.840> I'd<00:02:40.170> say<00:02:40.200> year<00:02:40.829> I<00:02:40.859> was<00:02:41.099> farming

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
like the last I'd say year I was farming

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.399 
like the last I'd say year I was farming
in<00:02:41.579> gold<00:02:41.819> 3<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.359> I<00:02:42.720> would<00:02:42.810> find<00:02:43.019> bases<00:02:43.319> like

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
in gold 3 and I would find bases like

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.050 
in gold 3 and I would find bases like
this<00:02:43.590> all<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.890> time<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.370> seems<00:02:44.549> recently

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
this all the time but it seems recently

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.059 
this all the time but it seems recently
with<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.269> new<00:02:45.299> updates<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.440> I'm<00:02:46.530> finding<00:02:46.799> in

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
with the new updates and I'm finding in

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.910 
with the new updates and I'm finding in
crystal<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.909> lot<00:02:48.120> more<00:02:48.359> often<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.500> instead<00:02:49.859> of

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
crystal a lot more often so instead of

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.830 
crystal a lot more often so instead of
finding<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.430> townhall<00:02:50.819> 7<00:02:50.849> Town<00:02:51.359> elates<00:02:51.690> I'm

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
finding like townhall 7 Town elates I'm

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.629 
finding like townhall 7 Town elates I'm
finding<00:02:52.139> Town<00:02:52.319> Hall<00:02:52.470> tends<00:02:52.709> like<00:02:52.889> this<00:02:53.099> and<00:02:53.310> it

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
finding Town Hall tends like this and it

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.979 
finding Town Hall tends like this and it
seems<00:02:53.849> that<00:02:53.970> I'm<00:02:54.090> finding<00:02:54.389> a<00:02:54.450> little<00:02:54.720> bit<00:02:54.840> more

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
seems that I'm finding a little bit more

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.449 
seems that I'm finding a little bit more
resources<00:02:55.409> but<00:02:55.680> I'm<00:02:55.769> definitely<00:02:55.950> finding

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
resources but I'm definitely finding

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.970 
resources but I'm definitely finding
them<00:02:56.609> more<00:02:56.790> quickly<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.329> for<00:02:58.319> this<00:02:58.439> guy<00:02:58.590> again

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
them more quickly and for this guy again

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.289 
them more quickly and for this guy again
I<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.129> took<00:02:59.400> care<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.609> the<00:02:59.730> mines<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.030> pumps

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
I just took care of the mines and pumps

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.059 
I just took care of the mines and pumps
and<00:03:00.480> once<00:03:01.109> again<00:03:01.230> I'm<00:03:01.439> not<00:03:01.470> really<00:03:01.739> worried

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
and once again I'm not really worried

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.649 
and once again I'm not really worried
about<00:03:02.099> anything<00:03:02.459> else<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.269> little<00:03:03.389> trick

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
about anything else so one little trick

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.119 
about anything else so one little trick

this and it doesn't take too long to

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.970 
this and it doesn't take too long to
find<00:03:36.449> a<00:03:36.569> base<00:03:36.720> either<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.260> again<00:03:37.680> while<00:03:37.859> you

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
find a base either so again while you

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.559 
find a base either so again while you
guys<00:03:38.099> are<00:03:38.159> raiding<00:03:38.699> make<00:03:38.909> sure<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.209> guys<00:03:39.359> have

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
guys are raiding make sure you guys have

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.390 
guys are raiding make sure you guys have
troops<00:03:39.870> being<00:03:40.079> trained<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:41.190> meantime

because<00:03:41.849> if<00:03:42.060> you're<00:03:42.180> using<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.540> strategy<00:03:43.019> like

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169

because if you're using a strategy like
this<00:03:43.280> let's<00:03:44.280> say<00:03:44.370> I'm<00:03:44.669> training<00:03:44.970> goblins<00:03:45.840> and

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
this let's say I'm training goblins and

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.289 
this let's say I'm training goblins and
by<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.769> time<00:03:47.069> my<00:03:47.250> raid<00:03:47.459> finishes<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.150> go

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.000 
by the time my raid finishes and I go
back<00:03:48.419> to<00:03:48.599> my<00:03:48.629> base<00:03:48.900> it's<00:03:49.470> only<00:03:49.590> gonna<00:03:49.739> take<00:03:49.949> me

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
back to my base it's only gonna take me

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.710 
back to my base it's only gonna take me
about<00:03:50.370> four<00:03:50.639> or<00:03:50.729> five<00:03:50.879> minutes<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.359> recoup

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.300 
about four or five minutes to recoup
this<00:03:51.870> army<00:03:52.199> and<00:03:52.319> attack<00:03:52.590> once<00:03:52.799> again<00:03:53.069> so

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
this army and attack once again so

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.949 
this army and attack once again so
that's<00:03:53.430> how<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.639> get<00:03:53.879> millions<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.449> resources

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
that's how you get millions of resources

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.960 
that's how you get millions of resources
per<00:03:55.109> hour<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.859> use<00:03:56.069> efficient<00:03:56.519> army

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
per hour you use efficient army

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.580 
per hour you use efficient army
compositions<00:03:57.629> you<00:03:57.720> attack<00:03:57.959> bases<00:03:58.290> like<00:03:58.440> this

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
compositions you attack bases like this

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.599 
compositions you attack bases like this
who<00:03:58.769> have<00:03:58.889> a<00:03:58.949> lot<00:03:59.069> of<00:03:59.190> stuff<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.579> outside

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
who have a lot of stuff on the outside

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.460 
who have a lot of stuff on the outside
and<00:04:00.180> then<00:04:00.750> from<00:04:00.930> there<00:04:01.049> you're<00:04:01.169> going<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.379> get

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
and then from there you're going to get

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.080 
and then from there you're going to get
a<00:04:01.500> ton<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.709> resources<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.489> your<00:04:02.609> armies<00:04:02.879> train

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
a ton of resources and your armies train

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.059 
a ton of resources and your armies train
up<00:04:03.180> super<00:04:03.419> quickly<00:04:03.449> all<00:04:04.440> right<00:04:04.530> same<00:04:04.739> same

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
up super quickly all right same same

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.439 
up super quickly all right same same
thing<00:04:05.099> for<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.459> space<00:04:05.639> right<00:04:05.819> here<00:04:06.000> turns<00:04:06.269> out

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
thing for the space right here turns out

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:07.849 
thing for the space right here turns out
he<00:04:06.569> actually<00:04:06.780> had<00:04:07.079> his<00:04:07.169> dark<00:04:07.349> elixir<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:07.799> the

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
he actually had his dark elixir on the

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.259 
he actually had his dark elixir on the
outside<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.430> was<00:04:08.579> able<00:04:08.699> to<00:04:08.819> steal<00:04:09.090> all<00:04:09.239> of

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
outside so I was able to steal all of

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.969 
outside so I was able to steal all of
that<00:04:09.449> pretty<00:04:09.690> quickly<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.229> did<00:04:10.739> end<00:04:10.919> up

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
that pretty quickly I did end up

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.619 
that pretty quickly I did end up
dropping<00:04:11.310> some<00:04:11.459> Giants<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:11.879> really<00:04:12.150> try<00:04:12.329> not<00:04:12.510> to

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
dropping some Giants I really try not to

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.780 
dropping some Giants I really try not to
drop<00:04:12.810> drop<00:04:13.290> Giants<00:04:13.769> if<00:04:13.889> I<00:04:14.010> don't<00:04:14.310> have<00:04:14.549> to

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
drop drop Giants if I don't have to

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.969 
drop drop Giants if I don't have to
because<00:04:15.209> they<00:04:15.359> do<00:04:15.419> cost<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:15.930> think<00:04:15.959> like<00:04:16.229> 3,000

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
because they do cost I think like 3,000

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.039 
because they do cost I think like 3,000
elixir<00:04:17.400> each<00:04:17.579> but<00:04:18.329> I<00:04:18.359> ended<00:04:18.570> up<00:04:18.690> dropping<00:04:18.840> a

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
elixir each but I ended up dropping a

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.210 
elixir each but I ended up dropping a
couple<00:04:19.289> of<00:04:19.380> those<00:04:19.470> just<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.799> make<00:04:19.949> it<00:04:19.979> a<00:04:20.099> little

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
couple of those just to make it a little

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.269 
couple of those just to make it a little
bit<00:04:20.370> easier<00:04:21.019> 660<00:04:22.019> dark<00:04:22.200> elixir<00:04:22.349> 300,000

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:23.279 
bit easier 660 dark elixir 300,000

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:24.920 
bit easier 660 dark elixir 300,000
resources<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.000> let's<00:04:24.180> move<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:24.690> next

resources and let's move on to this next
raid<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:25.950> for<00:04:26.159> this<00:04:26.250> guy<00:04:26.400> 530

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460

raid so for this guy 530
thousand<00:04:27.880> available<00:04:28.270> looks<00:04:28.870> like<00:04:29.020> there's<00:04:29.229> a

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
thousand available looks like there's a

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.260 
thousand available looks like there's a
couple<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.800> elixir<00:04:30.160> pumps<00:04:30.460> actually<00:04:30.880> inside

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
couple of elixir pumps actually inside

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.310 
couple of elixir pumps actually inside
of<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.449> base<00:04:31.630> so<00:04:31.810> I'm<00:04:31.900> probably<00:04:32.020> going<00:04:32.259> to

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
of the base so I'm probably going to

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.350 
of the base so I'm probably going to
have<00:04:32.380> to<00:04:32.530> focus<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:32.979> those<00:04:33.190> but<00:04:33.880> first<00:04:34.150> of<00:04:34.300> all

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
have to focus on those but first of all

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.640 
have to focus on those but first of all
once<00:04:34.570> again<00:04:34.780> we're<00:04:34.930> going<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.080> focus<00:04:35.289> on<00:04:35.560> the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
once again we're going to focus on the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.040 
once again we're going to focus on the
things<00:04:35.860> on<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.100> outside<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:37.570> like<00:04:37.720> I<00:04:37.810> said<00:04:37.990> in

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
things on the outside so like I said in

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.200 
things on the outside so like I said in
the<00:04:38.110> very<00:04:38.289> beginning<00:04:38.530> of<00:04:38.830> my<00:04:38.889> video<00:04:39.100> like<00:04:40.060> I

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
the very beginning of my video like I

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.730 
the very beginning of my video like I
did<00:04:40.419> in<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.660> guy<00:04:40.840> like<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.199> said<00:04:41.229> in<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:41.560> guide

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
did in the guy like I said in the guide

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.890 
did in the guy like I said in the guide
I<00:04:42.070> think<00:04:42.520> I<00:04:42.610> usually<00:04:43.030> bring<00:04:43.210> about<00:04:43.419> eight<00:04:43.660> wall

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
I think I usually bring about eight wall

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.480 
I think I usually bring about eight wall
breakers<00:04:44.259> when<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.860> first<00:04:45.070> started<00:04:45.340> playing

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
breakers when I first started playing

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.159 
breakers when I first started playing
clash<00:04:45.789> and<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.060> started<00:04:46.360> using<00:04:46.539> the<00:04:46.720> strategy<00:04:47.139> I

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
clash and I started using the strategy I

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.080 
clash and I started using the strategy I
brought<00:04:47.440> six<00:04:47.680> wall<00:04:47.919> breakers<00:04:48.280> then<00:04:48.729> I<00:04:48.759> figured

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
brought six wall breakers then I figured

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.370 
brought six wall breakers then I figured
out<00:04:49.240> that<00:04:49.419> wasn't<00:04:49.720> enough<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:49.960> I<00:04:50.110> went<00:04:50.169> to

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
out that wasn't enough so I went to

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.260 
out that wasn't enough so I went to
eight<00:04:50.530> wall<00:04:50.770> breakers<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.340> really<00:04:51.940> now<00:04:52.090> that

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
eight wall breakers and really now that

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.779 
eight wall breakers and really now that
I'm<00:04:52.389> Town<00:04:52.630> Hall<00:04:52.810> nine<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.380> I<00:04:53.500> have<00:04:53.650> 220<00:04:54.430> army

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
I'm Town Hall nine and I have 220 army

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.670 
I'm Town Hall nine and I have 220 army
camp<00:04:54.970> spaces<00:04:55.360> available<00:04:55.449> I've<00:04:55.870> switched<00:04:56.440> to

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
camp spaces available I've switched to

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.320 
camp spaces available I've switched to
ten<00:04:56.889> wall<00:04:57.100> breakers<00:04:57.460> because<00:04:57.759> sometimes<00:04:58.150> you

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
ten wall breakers because sometimes you

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.790 
ten wall breakers because sometimes you
find<00:04:58.509> bases<00:04:58.870> like<00:04:58.960> this<00:04:59.169> where<00:04:59.380> you<00:04:59.470> just<00:04:59.650> need

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
find bases like this where you just need

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.560 
find bases like this where you just need
a<00:04:59.830> couple<00:05:00.099> wall<00:05:00.340> breakers<00:05:00.699> to<00:05:01.180> break<00:05:01.360> into

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
a couple wall breakers to break into

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.719 
a couple wall breakers to break into
different<00:05:01.840> sections<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.440> it's<00:05:03.340> been<00:05:03.490> working

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
different sections and it's been working

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.070 
different sections and it's been working
out<00:05:03.910> really<00:05:03.940> well<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:04.539> even<00:05:04.840> though<00:05:04.930> you're

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
out really well so even though you're

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.290 
out really well so even though you're
sacrificing<00:05:05.289> I<00:05:05.979> guess<00:05:06.160> for<00:05:06.580> goblins<00:05:07.090> and

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
sacrificing I guess for goblins and

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.670 
sacrificing I guess for goblins and
maybe<00:05:07.810> you're<00:05:07.960> spending<00:05:08.259> a<00:05:08.320> little<00:05:08.440> bit<00:05:08.590> more

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
maybe you're spending a little bit more

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.350 
maybe you're spending a little bit more
elixir<00:05:09.070> on<00:05:09.430> those<00:05:09.550> wall<00:05:09.789> breakers<00:05:10.120> it

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
elixir on those wall breakers it

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.879 
elixir on those wall breakers it
definitely<00:05:11.050> helps<00:05:11.229> when<00:05:11.349> you<00:05:11.410> find<00:05:11.590> bases

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
definitely helps when you find bases

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:12.779 
definitely helps when you find bases
like<00:05:11.979> this<00:05:12.160> where<00:05:12.340> you<00:05:12.400> have<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:12.610> break

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
like this where you have to break

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.070 
like this where you have to break
through<00:05:12.940> a<00:05:13.000> couple<00:05:13.180> of<00:05:13.360> layers<00:05:13.509> and<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:13.960> makes

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
through a couple of layers and it makes

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.450 
through a couple of layers and it makes
it<00:05:14.199> a<00:05:14.259> lot<00:05:14.380> easier<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:15.009> the<00:05:15.099> point<00:05:15.310> where

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
it a lot easier to the point where

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.939 
it a lot easier to the point where
you're<00:05:15.580> not<00:05:15.699> focusing<00:05:16.169> on<00:05:17.169> your<00:05:17.289> goblins<00:05:17.770> to

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
you're not focusing on your goblins to

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.170 
you're not focusing on your goblins to
break<00:05:18.099> through<00:05:18.280> walls<00:05:18.490> for<00:05:18.759> you<00:05:18.820> because<00:05:18.970> I've

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
break through walls for you because I've

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.460 
break through walls for you because I've
had<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:19.330> lot<00:05:19.389> of<00:05:19.570> times<00:05:19.870> where<00:05:20.080> I've<00:05:20.169> run<00:05:20.320> out<00:05:20.349> of

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
had a lot of times where I've run out of

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.529 
had a lot of times where I've run out of
wall<00:05:20.740> breakers<00:05:21.070> and<00:05:21.280> I've<00:05:21.610> had<00:05:21.759> to<00:05:21.910> focus<00:05:22.419> on

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
wall breakers and I've had to focus on

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.659 
wall breakers and I've had to focus on
my<00:05:22.690> goblins<00:05:23.139> breaking<00:05:23.470> through<00:05:23.620> walls<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:24.160> if

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
my goblins breaking through walls and if

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.100 
my goblins breaking through walls and if
there's<00:05:24.880> a<00:05:24.940> wizard<00:05:25.210> tower<00:05:25.389> or<00:05:25.630> mortar<00:05:25.930> there

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
there's a wizard tower or mortar there

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.140 
there's a wizard tower or mortar there
it's<00:05:26.349> definitely<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:26.800> pain<00:05:27.039> so<00:05:27.789> seeing<00:05:28.030> as

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
it's definitely a pain so seeing as

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.430 
it's definitely a pain so seeing as
there's<00:05:28.330> 2<00:05:28.479> elixir<00:05:28.690> pumps<00:05:29.020> right<00:05:29.169> here<00:05:29.320> I'm

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
of that arch or that a lick sir pump and

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:45.330 
of that arch or that a lick sir pump and
then<00:05:44.440> I'll<00:05:44.530> be<00:05:44.650> able<00:05:44.680> to<00:05:44.889> surrender<00:05:45.159> after

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
that again there's not really too much

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.960 
that again there's not really too much
inside<00:05:47.289> of<00:05:47.530> these<00:05:47.680> sorge's<00:05:48.250> I<00:05:48.430> think<00:05:48.849> there

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
inside of these sorge's I think there

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.339 
inside of these sorge's I think there
might<00:05:49.090> be<00:05:49.150> one<00:05:49.479> of<00:05:49.510> Luxor<00:05:49.870> storage<00:05:50.169> on<00:05:50.260> the

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
might be one of Luxor storage on the

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.689 
might be one of Luxor storage on the
bottom<00:05:50.590> that<00:05:50.680> I<00:05:50.740> can<00:05:50.889> actually<00:05:51.070> take<00:05:51.400> care<00:05:51.610> of

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
bottom that I can actually take care of

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.399 
bottom that I can actually take care of
at<00:05:51.789> the<00:05:51.820> very<00:05:51.909> end<00:05:52.210> of<00:05:52.270> this<00:05:52.389> but<00:05:53.139> you<00:05:53.229> can<00:05:53.380> see

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
at the very end of this but you can see

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:54.899 
at the very end of this but you can see
my<00:05:53.830> goblins<00:05:54.250> finally<00:05:54.580> broke<00:05:54.729> through<00:05:54.880> that

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
my goblins finally broke through that

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:55.920 
my goblins finally broke through that
wall<00:05:55.180> and<00:05:55.300> they're<00:05:55.419> going<00:05:55.539> to<00:05:55.599> take<00:05:55.750> care<00:05:55.900> of

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
wall and they're going to take care of

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.020 
wall and they're going to take care of
that<00:05:56.080> pump<00:05:56.320> so<00:05:57.070> looking<00:05:57.310> at<00:05:57.430> that<00:05:57.460> goldmine<00:05:57.909> on

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
that pump so looking at that goldmine on

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.460 
that pump so looking at that goldmine on
the<00:05:58.120> left<00:05:58.300> it's<00:05:58.509> under<00:05:58.690> construction<00:05:58.930> so<00:05:59.409> I'm

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
the left it's under construction so I'm

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.960 
the left it's under construction so I'm
not<00:05:59.590> going<00:05:59.740> to<00:05:59.800> worry<00:05:59.919> about<00:06:00.039> that<00:06:00.250> and<00:06:00.520> like<00:06:00.880> I

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
not going to worry about that and like I

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.640 
not going to worry about that and like I
said<00:06:01.210> there<00:06:01.330> was<00:06:01.509> a<00:06:01.539> storage<00:06:01.990> down<00:06:02.139> here<00:06:02.199> so

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
said there was a storage down here so

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.170 
said there was a storage down here so
since<00:06:02.889> it<00:06:03.039> is<00:06:03.099> so<00:06:03.310> open<00:06:03.490> I'm<00:06:03.729> just<00:06:03.849> gonna<00:06:03.970> drop

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
since it is so open I'm just gonna drop

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.999 
since it is so open I'm just gonna drop
some<00:06:04.210> goblins<00:06:04.479> and<00:06:04.870> that'll<00:06:05.590> wrap<00:06:05.710> it<00:06:05.800> up<00:06:05.889> for

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
some goblins and that'll wrap it up for

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.820 
some goblins and that'll wrap it up for
that<00:06:06.099> alright<00:06:06.430> so<00:06:06.699> we're<00:06:06.849> at<00:06:07.110> 41%<00:06:08.110> and<00:06:08.320> since<00:06:08.710> I

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
dark elixir so pretty much I'm just

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.260 
dark elixir so pretty much I'm just
keeping<00:06:36.130> up<00:06:36.219> with<00:06:36.310> these<00:06:36.430> good<00:06:36.669> efficient

keeping up with these good efficient
Ray's<00:06:37.450> and<00:06:37.750> that's<00:06:37.990> what's<00:06:38.229> been<00:06:38.380> able<00:06:38.500> to<00:06:38.620> get

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
Ray's and that's what's been able to get

Ray's and that's what's been able to get
me<00:06:39.010> the<00:06:39.219> maximum<00:06:39.610> amount<00:06:39.760> of<00:06:39.909> resources

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.410 
me the maximum amount of resources
that's<00:06:41.040> worked<00:06:41.250> out<00:06:41.340> really<00:06:41.550> well<00:06:41.940> all<00:06:42.330> right

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
actually saved just enough to upgrade

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.800 
actually saved just enough to upgrade
one<00:07:02.190> of<00:07:02.280> my<00:07:02.400> Tesla's<00:07:02.880> so<00:07:03.060> I<00:07:03.090> was<00:07:03.270> deciding

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
one of my Tesla's so I was deciding

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.720 
one of my Tesla's so I was deciding
between<00:07:03.900> the<00:07:04.230> cannon<00:07:04.590> and<00:07:04.740> the<00:07:04.800> Tesla<00:07:05.220> but

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730 
between the cannon and the Tesla but

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.220 
between the cannon and the Tesla but
it's<00:07:05.850> always<00:07:06.000> more<00:07:06.270> epic<00:07:06.540> to<00:07:06.690> max<00:07:06.900> out<00:07:07.050> one<00:07:07.200> of

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230 
it's always more epic to max out one of

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.420 
it's always more epic to max out one of
your<00:07:07.320> defenses<00:07:07.860> so<00:07:07.980> I'm<00:07:08.040> going<00:07:08.190> to<00:07:08.220> go<00:07:08.310> ahead

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
your defenses so I'm going to go ahead

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.580 
your defenses so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:07:08.610> do<00:07:08.730> that<00:07:08.760> it's<00:07:09.300> gonna<00:07:09.450> take<00:07:09.630> 14<00:07:10.110> days<00:07:10.380> so

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
and do that it's gonna take 14 days so

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.410 
and do that it's gonna take 14 days so
definitely<00:07:10.920> a<00:07:10.980> long<00:07:11.130> period<00:07:11.520> of<00:07:11.550> time<00:07:11.760> but

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:12.420 
definitely a long period of time but

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.490 
definitely a long period of time but
I've<00:07:12.480> been<00:07:12.600> a<00:07:12.630> little<00:07:12.690> bit<00:07:12.990> inactive<00:07:13.410> with

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
I've been a little bit inactive with

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.960 
I've been a little bit inactive with
this<00:07:13.620> account<00:07:13.830> so<00:07:14.070> it<00:07:14.190> shouldn't<00:07:14.460> really<00:07:14.520> hold

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:14.970 
this account so it shouldn't really hold

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.340 
this account so it shouldn't really hold
me<00:07:15.030> up<00:07:15.180> too<00:07:15.330> much<00:07:15.450> all<00:07:15.900> right<00:07:16.020> so<00:07:16.170> we're<00:07:16.290> gonna

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
me up too much all right so we're gonna

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.440 
me up too much all right so we're gonna
end<00:07:16.500> that<00:07:16.740> on<00:07:17.010> over<00:07:17.520> just<00:07:17.910> a<00:07:18.000> little<00:07:18.030> bit<00:07:18.330> over

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.450 
end that on over just a little bit over

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.540 
end that on over just a little bit over
900<00:07:19.020> gold<00:07:19.200> and<00:07:19.440> I<00:07:19.800> think<00:07:19.980> that'll<00:07:20.220> do<00:07:20.340> it<00:07:20.460> for
