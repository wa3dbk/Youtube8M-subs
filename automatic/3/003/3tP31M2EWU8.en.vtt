00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
the plugin is pretty large because as

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.830 
the plugin is pretty large because as

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
because of this special module it mounts

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.330 
because of this special module it mounts
in<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.590> jail<00:00:33.050> how<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> update<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.590> I'll<00:00:35.100> try<00:00:35.280> to

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
in the jail how to update it I'll try to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.970 
in the jail how to update it I'll try to
show<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.680> then<00:00:38.059> if<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.870> restart<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.829> you

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
show that and then if you restart if you

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.410 
show that and then if you restart if you
reboot<00:00:41.309> FreeNAS<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> restart<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
reboot FreeNAS you have to restart the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.639 
reboot FreeNAS you have to restart the
plugin<00:00:42.600> manually<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.230> that's<00:00:43.350> because<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
plugin manually and that's because that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.729 
plugin manually and that's because that
module<00:00:44.129> isn't<00:00:44.340> automatically<00:00:44.910> mounted<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
module isn't automatically mounted and

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.799 
module isn't automatically mounted and
then<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.219> kind<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.700> explained<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> best<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.719> my

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
then I kind of explained the best of my

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
then I kind of explained the best of my
knowledge<00:00:48.840> how<00:00:49.320> users<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.520> groups<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
knowledge how users and groups and

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.209 
knowledge how users and groups and
passwords<00:00:51.300> working<00:00:51.690> -<00:00:52.559> basically<00:00:53.039> it's

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
passwords working - basically it's

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.670 
passwords working - basically it's
connected<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> actual<00:00:54.809> accounts<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
connected to the actual accounts in that

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.090 
connected to the actual accounts in that
jails<00:00:56.780> user<00:00:57.780> lands<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.859> don't<00:00:58.980> wanna

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
jails user lands so if you don't wanna

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.139 
jails user lands so if you don't wanna
mess<00:00:59.250> with<00:00:59.280> any<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.940> use<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.050 
boots you're going to have to manually
turn<00:01:46.680> shut<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.159> service<00:01:47.460> off<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.820> turn<00:01:48.030> it

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
turn shut this service off and turn it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.240 
turn shut this service off and turn it
back<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:48.780> because<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> that

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
back on and that's because of that

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.609 
back on and that's because of that
special<00:01:50.250> loan<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.020> think<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.170> mounted<00:01:52.470> in

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
special loan I think that's mounted in

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:52.910 
special loan I think that's mounted in
there

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
there

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.679 
there
so<00:01:53.369> now<00:01:53.430> notice<00:01:53.670> sometimes<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> logs<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.570> in

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
so now notice sometimes it logs you in

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.020 
so now notice sometimes it logs you in
automatically<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> won't<00:01:55.649> work<00:01:55.969> so<00:01:56.969> you

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
automatically but it won't work so you

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.780 
automatically but it won't work so you
have<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.270> click<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.810> guy<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.049> log<00:01:58.439> out

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
have to click on this guy and log out

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.459 
have to click on this guy and log out
like<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.880> little<00:02:00.030> bug<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.630> think<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.290> because

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
like a little bug I think it's because

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.940 
like a little bug I think it's because
I've<00:02:01.590> been<00:02:01.619> testing<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.530> like<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
I've been testing this so like that a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.669 
I've been testing this so like that a
cookie<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.579> my<00:02:06.210> browser

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.250 

so<00:02:08.950> MC<00:02:09.310> survives<00:02:09.640> that's<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.090> default<00:02:10.269> so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
so MC survives that's a default so

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.929 
so MC survives that's a default so
here's<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.620> actual<00:02:11.890> interface<00:02:12.099> you're<00:02:12.790> going

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:12.939 
here's the actual interface you're going

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.000 
here's the actual interface you're going
to<00:02:13.060> want<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.870> create<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.079> profile<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.980> can

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
to want to create a profile you can

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.259 
to want to create a profile you can
create<00:02:15.129> a<00:02:15.280> custom<00:02:15.579> one<00:02:15.700> or<00:02:15.879> I'm<00:02:15.970> just<00:02:16.120> going<00:02:16.239> to

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
create a custom one or I'm just going to

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.119 
create a custom one or I'm just going to
pick<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> stock<00:02:16.720> line<00:02:16.930> then<00:02:17.829> you<00:02:17.950> have<00:02:18.040> to

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
pick the stock line then you have to

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.009 
pick the stock line then you have to
update<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.610> profile<00:02:19.090> in<00:02:19.299> order<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.689> grab<00:02:19.870> the

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
update that profile in order to grab the

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.380 
update that profile in order to grab the
latest<00:02:20.290> jar<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.610> if<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.760> update<00:02:21.909> it<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.180> can

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
latest jar so if you update it you can

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.149 
latest jar so if you update it you can
get<00:02:22.480> them<00:02:22.629> a<00:02:22.810> newer<00:02:23.110> jar<00:02:23.379> if<00:02:23.530> like<00:02:23.680> they<00:02:23.799> update

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
get them a newer jar if like they update

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.960 
get them a newer jar if like they update
it<00:02:24.359> one<00:02:25.359> that<00:02:25.540> 8.1<00:02:26.109> or<00:02:26.140> something<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.980> then<00:02:27.939> I

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
it one that 8.1 or something and then I

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.059 
it one that 8.1 or something and then I
went<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.269> got<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.629> this<00:02:28.780> check<00:02:29.049> mark<00:02:29.079> all

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
went and got it this check mark all

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.500 
went and got it this check mark all
right<00:02:30.189> you<00:02:30.519> can<00:02:30.640> see<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:30.909> little<00:02:31.120> there's<00:02:31.420> a

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
right you can see this little there's a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.360 
right you can see this little there's a
little<00:02:31.689> green<00:02:31.920> notification<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.040> corner

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
little green notification in the corner

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.039 
little green notification in the corner
I'm<00:02:33.970> not<00:02:34.150> sure<00:02:34.299> if<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.420> showed<00:02:34.810> up<00:02:34.900> not

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
recording it's not going to create a

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.500 
recording it's not going to create a

server I'm going to use the default port

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.910 
server I'm going to use the default port
but<00:02:40.750> if<00:02:40.840> you're<00:02:40.959> running<00:02:41.079> multiple<00:02:41.470> minecraft

servers on your - instance you can pick

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.069 
servers on your - instance you can pick
different<00:02:44.109> ports<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.480> then<00:02:46.480> I'm<00:02:46.900> going<00:02:47.049> to

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
different ports and then I'm going to

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.660 
different ports and then I'm going to
pick<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.440> profile<00:02:47.859> that<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:48.489> created

and I'm going to increase thing on a ram

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.220 
and I'm going to increase thing on a ram
because<00:02:53.280> 256<00:02:54.280> seems<00:02:54.489> kind<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.790> low<00:02:54.939> and<00:02:55.269> then

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
should work at this point so you can see

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.180 
should work at this point so you can see
here<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:35.139> can<00:03:35.169> see<00:03:35.379> here<00:03:35.500> is<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.620> console<00:03:36.040> for

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.229 
to auto refresh I don't think it does -

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.920

just<00:03:41.440> press<00:03:41.680> something<00:03:41.949> in<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.280> show<00:03:42.930> it'll

so whenever my no s updates you have to

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.300 
so whenever my no s updates you have to
