00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.840
 and good morning to all of you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.040
 gentlemen 3 me today in this 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.839
 video i'm going to show you how 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.090
 free up space on your mac 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.950
 if like me you have opted for a mac 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.259
 with a low capacity hard drive 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.049
 you are probably already wondering how 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.119
 to recover some gigas see 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.029
 some media that might have missed you 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.140
 to install this or that software 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.970
 what I want to do is I'm going 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.930
 show you two software that works 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.840
 particularly well 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.150
 this is cleanmymac version 2 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.750
 for my part and the knicks which is a 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.090
 free software so both have a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.440
 a pretty similar feature 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.219
 since they will allow you to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.129
 free up space that is currently 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.500
 unnecessarily clutter book on go 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.059
 start with jean my mac imagine that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.530
 I want to delete all the elements 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.750
 that I have in my basket in 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.309
 the occurrence there I have almost 15 giga of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.350
 files stored in the trash that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.449
 I have not deleted yet that I did not 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.340
 not taken so much so in fact you have 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.010
 just started a small a little 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.890
 analysis with the software is by the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.799
 clicked on empty and at that moment 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.390
 the software will perform the cleaning and 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.520
 will allow you to recover some 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.080
 extra gigas it's not 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.580
 negligible when we see that I have 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.259
 a released almost 15 gigabytes it's huge 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.610
 this is already the first thing 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.680
 then you can do a cleaning 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.210
 system that will allow you to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.799
 delete everything there is file 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.450
 cache etc 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.780
 if we rework name like this makes you 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.119
 analyze then cleaned take 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.860
 now to the knicks so the software 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.939
 free 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.229
 I would put you in any case the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.479
 rare download link 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.250
 description if you wish to perform 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.350
 cleaning your mac 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.450
 you have several possibilities in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.970
 the occurrence the basket that already comes 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.860
 to make a clip my mac 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.729
 imagine the internet history I 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.439
 done execute 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.570
 there it is looking for the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.520
 files that are used we will say 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.829
 unnecessarily faljic to use 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.009
 unnecessarily and will allow me to 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.790
 free up a little bit of space 2 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.790
 let you do 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.960
 no we see that it was done named 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.820
 young people still recover a few small 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.400
 additional spaces that go 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.770
 allow to add other files to 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.500
 the place of those there so there are several 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:26.380
 cleaning kits you have a whole bunch 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.390
 of possibilities and then I left 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.190
 you can also uninstall 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.590
 properly your apps that I had 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.300
 already present and hamza afraid a 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.800
 first time in another video 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.480
 so in fact that allows you to 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.580
 delete an app while 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.300
 deleting all the files associated with 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.890
 this application 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.680
 imagine that I want to delete 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.450
 basic teamviewer I'm removing 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.670
 just this flatter app 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.989
 classic green jersey that weighs 45 my 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.700
 guy but I would have forgotten all 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.500
 associated files so it does this this 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.080
 application allows you to delete them 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.790
 at the same time surkin my mac you have 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.010
 also the possibility of doing it in 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.630
 going into eliminator and select 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.860
 the files 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.570
 so that's so it was just about all 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.280
 to show you how to release a 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.380
 little bit of space on your mac 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.100
 I do not say that it will be madness but that 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.750
 will at least allow you to 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.420
 release some few mails ya 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.340
 some jcat that will allow you to 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.120
 re install other software or 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.549
 other videos 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.530
 so here is no hesitation in leaving a 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.090
