 With keyboard shortcuts, the speed of working with 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.350
 Windows 7 to speed up a lot 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.350
 for example the windows button is the opens the start menu there is one 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.170

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.190
 media-player 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.140
 also from what was that if I like more programs below

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.230
 in the example on the eleventh of Popwolf then the taskbar fifth position that 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.850
 is called Windows and 5

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.770
 Acquirer key combination 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.710
 Notebook user 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.180
 on notebooks netbooks Kai Schmidt Windes and XX Mobility Center go where 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.960
 I can immediately emerge in Energy Mode and and the presentation Celtics 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.040
 Keyword presentation windows &amp; p so that's safe from external monitor to 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 Speak or just the projector 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.510
 if you are not active anymore 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.940
 a little hint 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.730
 maybe one keyboard shortcut a day appointed then that too someday 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.150
