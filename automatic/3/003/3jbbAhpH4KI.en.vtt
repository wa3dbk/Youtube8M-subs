00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.769
 in the first quarterfinal were the foxes Berlin and the TSV 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.150
 Hannover-Burgdorf opposite 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.650
 It should not be too easy for the Lower Saxony against the easy 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.779
 favored German B youth champion coached by Bob Hanning 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.180
 This year, many chances for the victory of the rookie Kabst be granted 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.830
 and the local heroes also started the first attack first 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.000
 hit 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.240
 but also the answer of the opponents did not wait long compensation 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.250
 one to one 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.170
 but if now expects a lively exchange of the had 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.940
 deceived 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.540
 the third goal of the game was to fall in the sixth minute of play 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.550
 with responsible for the young man who had to get behind page 4 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.890
 again and again the foxes failed at the keeper of the Burgdorf already in the 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.809
 Last year in Tripoli, for example, he had shown outrageous performance 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.300
 and then was voted the best goalkeeper of the tournament 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.640
 he kept his team in the game for a long time but could not prevent that 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.370
 The foxes set themselves goal by goal during the game while the foxes showed 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.200
 every now and then game joke and overview as well as many simple ones 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.030
 fast goals 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.300
 five raised with a determination to fight against it but only found 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.550
 rarely so the train to the gate as here her left wing Julius Benz 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.000
 In the end, they were not enough for ten matches 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.590
 To enter the semi-final 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.100
 The foxes from Berlin have endoscopy after 19 goals 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.210
 now expensive furniture with four hits each will protect the most successful 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.750
 for the defeated Burgdorf are also four times 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.870
 b he is semi-final opponent was subsequently between the offspring of the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.710
 VfL Gummersbach and the still reigning German a-youth champion of the HSG 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.210
 Dusseldorf played out 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.530
 and as with the World Cup against Burgdorf should also be in this semi-final 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.890
 at first hardly coincidence 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.240
 free chances were awarded and the throws from the backcourt many times 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.050
 blocked 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.770
 Gradually, however, the teams remembered each other more and more often 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.590
 playful solutions are increasingly drawing customers' dwindling results 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:16.009
 especially attractive this despite the multitude of Thomas h 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.769
 also entertaining but rather curious this hit resulted in the balance 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.369
 through the HSG 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:26.009
 and even if eggs adjust better on foot like the Dusseldorf 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.009
 if you can forbid us this in the angle 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.829
 With this hit, the HSG had the edge again and this had them too 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.959
 at 7 to 6 at half time and at the crucial time the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:37.799
 finale 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.049
 Dusseldorf decided the game with 19 to 15 for themselves because they are mainly in 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.260
 the second half went 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.459
 could gain clearer opportunities 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.159
 The most successful scorer on the side of the HSG, he was Captain Alexander Felde 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.069
 drag relatives also met seven times on the Gummersbacher would have been 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:57.599
 besides the already mentioned and master and the german b-jugendmeister could 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.799
 Last year's and pickups also won out for the semifinals 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.039
 qualify the green-white beat Eintracht Hildesheim with 17 to 15 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.969
 now had already led to the break with 8 to 6 and was able to follow this lead 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.669
 Rebreak quickly to 12 2 8 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.419
 Hildesheim coach reacted with a break but then had to watch 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.929
 as his team later on, so clearly leaves opportunities to connect 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.269
 In the middle of the second half he could be through this nice goal but 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.550
 back to 2 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.050
 and a little later, after those Münden strikers full even on one 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.099
 Shorten hits 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.459
 but it should not be any closer because the mouths are beautiful for him, too 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.459
 Individual performance were good 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.209
 as the Hildesheimerin one of their last attack a Stürmerfoul 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.049
 begin and take in turn converted a seven-meter was the game 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.279
 decided 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:53.040
 now a quick counterattack in return of the seven-yard line only on 17 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.729
 shorten to 15 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.369
 most successful scorer in the duel of junior teams Rafi 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.060
 Pitts Bamberg with five goals 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.920
 Hildesheim met dying Kaka and Cold War four times each 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.379
 in the fourth quarterfinal game was decided whether with Magdeburg also 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.420
 the last of the teams often called Tournament Favorite 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.649
 should make the semi-final 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:19.249
 Opponent of the Magdeburg was Bayer Dormagen and here with a clear 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.789
 Matter expects that had deceived Dormagens started like that 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.159
 Fire Department and led after a short time with 14 0 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:29.409
 Magdeburg could but advisor and took goal after goal 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.310
 Reliable support in catching up has IPA Felix Storbeck the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.219
 how his played a great first half 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.999
 the game was balanced and so it was after 20 minutes at the stand of 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.999
 10 10 10 in the break 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.720
 and also in the second half the game remained balanced 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.720
 16 to 16 countries thirties minute 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.099
 after Magdeburg could also two paragraphs and forgave it 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.099
 numerous chances for a preliminary decision 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:05.279
 so Dormann could mark only twice the connection hit and then to 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:07.240
 Compensate 19 10 19 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.150
 Johannes Clausen scored all three hits in the series at the end with ten 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.120
 Tore was also the most successful bowler of his team 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.680
 Johannes Klauser marked a goal more than math so Nils grew 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.409
 Kretschmer 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:23.509
 its 21 to 20 from the seven-meter line Kantor but still on meeting 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.099
 in return, do not compensate 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.969
 in the following attack then many things had to be taken from outside for the decision 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.029
 Ending 22 to 20 for the markets whereby the blind together with the 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.319
 form second semi-final pairing 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.469
 the semifinal encounters of the second round are reduced by a son 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.699
 GWD Minden against Magdeburg 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.699
