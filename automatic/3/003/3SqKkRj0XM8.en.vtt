00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
so go ahead and do this like I said this

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.840 
so go ahead and do this like I said this
is<00:01:58.510> pretty<00:01:58.690> heavy<00:01:59.100> 16<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.250> half<00:02:00.400> pounds

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.880 
thing that doesn't work with it is
internet<00:04:39.070> radio<00:04:39.270> it's<00:04:40.270> kind<00:04:40.450> of<00:04:40.480> a<00:04:40.570> pain<00:04:40.890> it

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
would be nice to be able to street it

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.580 
would be nice to be able to street it
but<00:04:43.360> for<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.840> most<00:04:43.990> part<00:04:44.260> you're<00:04:44.380> probably

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
but for the most part you're probably

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.630 
but for the most part you're probably
not<00:04:44.890> going<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.070> want<00:04:45.220> to<00:04:45.250> listen<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.580> the

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.940 
something like that so all you do is you
control<00:04:52.240> it<00:04:52.360> from<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.540> iPod<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.500> can<00:04:53.650> adjust

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
the volume up and down you can do the

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.270 
the volume up and down you can do the
adjust<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.169> volume<00:04:56.440> on<00:04:56.500> here<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:56.950> will<00:04:57.070> adjust

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
adjust the volume on here it will adjust

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.820 
adjust the volume on here it will adjust
it<00:04:57.490> too<00:04:57.720> so<00:04:58.720> let<00:04:58.870> me<00:04:58.930> turn<00:04:59.080> this<00:04:59.290> so<00:04:59.440> I<00:04:59.500> can<00:04:59.650> see

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
it too so let me turn this so I can see

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.530 
it too so let me turn this so I can see
it<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.100> we'll<00:05:00.669> go<00:05:00.850> ahead<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.120> turn<00:05:01.240> it<00:05:01.300> on

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.270 

there<00:05:04.540> and<00:05:05.110> so<00:05:05.350> it<00:05:05.410> just<00:05:05.590> comes<00:05:05.770> on<00:05:05.950> like<00:05:06.130> that

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
there and so it just comes on like that

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.130 
there and so it just comes on like that
it<00:05:06.520> actually<00:05:06.640> fades<00:05:07.090> in<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.390> out<00:05:07.510> just<00:05:07.990> like

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
it actually fades in and out just like

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.490 
it actually fades in and out just like
your<00:05:08.320> iPhone<00:05:08.440> one<00:05:08.860> where<00:05:09.610> iPod<00:05:10.020> it<00:05:11.020> fits<00:05:11.260> every

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
your iPhone one where iPod it fits every

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.230 
your iPhone one where iPod it fits every
single<00:05:11.650> iPod<00:05:12.070> except<00:05:12.340> maybe<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.640> shuffle<00:05:13.030> but

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
single iPod except maybe the shuffle but

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.020 
single iPod except maybe the shuffle but
you<00:05:13.300> could<00:05:13.450> use<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:13.750> exhilaration<00:05:14.020> for<00:05:14.590> that

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
you could use the exhilaration for that

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.240 
you could use the exhilaration for that
No

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.330 

so<00:05:19.990> you<00:05:20.990> know<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.230> salad<00:05:21.470> actually<00:05:21.680> fills<00:05:22.160> the

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
so you know the salad actually fills the

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.240 
so you know the salad actually fills the
room<00:05:22.460> very<00:05:22.520> well<00:05:23.050> for<00:05:24.050> an<00:05:24.140> iPod<00:05:24.440> dock<00:05:24.680> it's<00:05:25.010> by

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
room very well for an iPod dock it's by

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.210 
room very well for an iPod dock it's by
far<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.550> best<00:05:25.730> I've<00:05:26.060> used<00:05:26.650> in<00:05:27.650> it<00:05:27.920> ought<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.100> be

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
far the best I've used in it ought to be

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.590 
far the best I've used in it ought to be
I<00:05:28.460> mean<00:05:28.640> the<00:05:28.760> price<00:05:28.970> is<00:05:29.150> pretty<00:05:29.390> substantial

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
I mean the price is pretty substantial

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.380 
I mean the price is pretty substantial
but<00:05:30.320> that<00:05:31.220> said<00:05:31.520> it<00:05:31.700> is<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:31.940> Bowers<00:05:32.240> and

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
but that said it is the Bowers and

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.950 
but that said it is the Bowers and
Wilkins<00:05:32.420> product<00:05:33.140> so<00:05:33.350> as<00:05:34.310> far<00:05:34.580> as<00:05:34.690> iPod<00:05:35.690> docks

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
Wilkins product so as far as iPod docks

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.840 
Wilkins product so as far as iPod docks
go<00:05:36.200> it's<00:05:36.650> the<00:05:36.830> best<00:05:37.040> but<00:05:37.250> it<00:05:37.340> is<00:05:37.460> you<00:05:37.730> know

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
go it's the best but it is you know

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.030 
go it's the best but it is you know
compared<00:05:38.390> to<00:05:38.450> the<00:05:38.540> Bose<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:39.440> say<00:05:39.680> it's<00:05:39.830> a<00:05:39.890> lot

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
compared to the Bose and say it's a lot

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.540 
compared to the Bose and say it's a lot
better<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.550> lot<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.540> lot<00:05:41.690> better<00:05:41.930> but<00:05:42.350> again<00:05:42.620> it's

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
better a lot a lot better but again it's

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.060 
better a lot a lot better but again it's
about<00:05:43.700> double<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.150> price<00:05:44.360> so<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:45.830> sound

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
about double the price so the sound

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.390 
about double the price so the sound
fills<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.550> room<00:05:46.700> really<00:05:47.120> nicely<00:05:47.330> you<00:05:48.290> do<00:05:49.250> get

spare a little bit older but it's I
believe<00:06:23.150> it's<00:06:23.300> the<00:06:23.390> S<00:06:23.540> 101<00:06:24.200> model<00:06:24.560> but<00:06:25.310> you

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
believe it's the S 101 model but you

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.090 
believe it's the S 101 model but you
know<00:06:25.550> it's<00:06:25.730> it's<00:06:26.330> three<00:06:26.660> times<00:06:26.810> or<00:06:27.260> double<00:06:28.070> the

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
know it's it's three times or double the

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.130 
know it's it's three times or double the
cost<00:06:28.280> of<00:06:28.550> this<00:06:28.640> rather<00:06:28.850> and<00:06:29.180> I<00:06:29.720> found<00:06:29.990> myself

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
cost of this rather and I found myself

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.480 
cost of this rather and I found myself
listening<00:06:30.620> to<00:06:30.740> this<00:06:30.890> more<00:06:31.100> often<00:06:31.430> just

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
listening to this more often just

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.310 
listening to this more often just
