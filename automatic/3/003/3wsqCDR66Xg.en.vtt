00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
think are odd when they see especially

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.670 
think are odd when they see especially
if<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.510> see<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.690> Rottweiler<00:02:57.080> herding<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.470> duck

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
if you see a Rottweiler herding a duck

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.650 
if you see a Rottweiler herding a duck
you<00:02:58.310> think<00:02:58.519> that's<00:02:58.670> pretty<00:02:58.850> funny<00:02:59.180> but

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
you think that's pretty funny but

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.030 
you think that's pretty funny but
actually<00:02:59.989> they're<00:03:00.109> very<00:03:00.140> talented<00:03:00.440> at<00:03:00.859> and

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
actually they're very talented at and

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
very finessing at it so if I had a herd

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.300
