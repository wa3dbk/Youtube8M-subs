 Ours now how to remove the device 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:12.269
 securely for example pendrive or 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:16.890
 hd a camera when you get to the unit of your 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:21.210
 computer via usb is very important 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:26.670
 remember that it is good that this is done 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.189
 removal of the device because it 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.700
 corrupt files that we are on 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.340
 pendrive or hd is avoided to burn too 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.010
 to damage them once he is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.820
 connected it is passing energy and 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.110
 sending energy and receiving energy 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.129
 send information to the information 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.370
 even if you 're not stirring 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.590
 happened, it is connected and then it is 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.649
 It is important that you remove 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.190
 Are you disconnecting a USB flash drive? 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.409
 a machine pulling without removing the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.159
 device in the correct way can 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.020
 play as I said it is 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.990
 time for the same goal you pick up the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.040
 disconnect the computer from the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.560
 is working 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.140
 You go there and the power goes off. 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.030
 same effect that your piece feels 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.689
 hd from your device any 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.520
 So I'm going to teach you how to 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.439
 easy to do the removal in this 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.140
 device and insurance 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.369
 Ok, let's go and I'll connect the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.369
 device that I like 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:49.950
 the device has already been connected to the machine 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:53.420
 where they will be charged note that they have 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:58.250
 these three pass here jumped from a hd 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:03.690
 three participations that we will remove 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:09.600
 You click the little set here in the bar 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:12.540
 bottom of the operating system you see 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.910
 a kind of strike and the green you have 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.940
 right click on it and he 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:22.410
 will show the list of devices 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:27.330
 usb that are connected to your machine there 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:30.120
 have to refuse to eject the date of the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.060
 We will not accept this because it is now 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.930
 so let's reject the free agent goal 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.130
 flex 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.920
 This is the name of hd, noting that neither 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.010
 always have a device name 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.860
 sometimes it's just usb 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.459
 sometimes only drive remove then goes 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.810
 vary 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.209
 so let's go by clicking here it goes 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.489
 remove and windows is the message the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.070
 radio can be safely moved 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.420
 the usb style can already be moved with 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.000
 computer security 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:08.450
 then you disconnect from your computer 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.450
 this is it people
