 a saga that we sell the studies that there is technique the ex tronista ar is 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.300
 obvious that we are in front of possibly the most powerful game to 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.210
 graphic and technical level of the world and to endorse these affirmations we are going to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.670
 happen to see in the images of the game and know some details more let's 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.670
 it 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.280
 it is evident that the great game developers try 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.680
 prove who is the king of the track 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.980
 i she has all the ballots to speak with that post after showing 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.800
 crisis 2 is also evident that when talking about crisis we are facing a 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.560
 that exploits the possibilities of any projectile practice in this 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.150
 list I love what I do all your heavy artillery in this game that 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.460
 it will come out for pc it's dessert 60 inaccuracy 3 but that only a huge 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.610
 graphic such as those designed for a draft will be able to exploit the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.610
 maximum this type 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.380
 this installment is located three years after the end of its sequel no 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.490
 Apocalyptica New York City 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 where we will find an urban environment with large buildings and where you will see 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.630
 the power and quality of both graphics and lighting that offers transit 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.259
 in crisis 2 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.700
 the nanosuit will be the protagonist thanks to him our character will be able to 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.670
 fight your enemies with the powers that your armor gives you as the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.670
 invisibility speed and your regret 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.510
 the action of transits combined with the enormous technical quality of the game 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.440
 will again demand a powerful computer in its PC version but as craig t 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.460
 he said recently we want to overcome the technical limit of current games 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:18.010
 In this title, the script is practically the least of 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:22.549
 put ourselves in situation to say that our character will have to face 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.299
 the aliens and as a squad of street agents entrepreneurs where 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.299
 we roll in the note 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:36.119
 and to finish this previous deal with both sides effectively will only be 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:40.490
 possible if we combine perfectly the skills of our suit 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.490
 with the weapons that we have 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:54.709
