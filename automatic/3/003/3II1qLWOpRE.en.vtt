a<00:00:12.420> real-world<00:00:12.870> example<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.880> bench<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.540> was

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
a real-world example of a bench that was

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.710 
a real-world example of a bench that was
built<00:00:16.139> directly<00:00:16.560> from<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.609> plans<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.539> are

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
built directly from the plans that are

David uh is the guy who drew the plans
up<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.640> me<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> put<00:00:30.240> him<00:00:30.359> into<00:00:30.480> CAD<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.140> they

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
up for me and put him into CAD and they

those of you who haven't seen this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.060 
those of you who haven't seen this
before<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:40.079> are<00:00:40.110> two<00:00:40.379> scissors<00:00:40.770> jacks

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
before there are two scissors jacks

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.150 
before there are two scissors jacks
inside<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:41.850> one<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.899> them<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.350> unweighted

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
inside of here one of them is unweighted

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.619 
inside of here one of them is unweighted
by<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.430> screw<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:46.100> one<00:00:47.100> adjusts<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
by this screw and that one adjusts the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.049 
by this screw and that one adjusts the
vent<00:00:49.140> height<00:00:49.379> up<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.950> down<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.489> wherever<00:00:50.969> you

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
vent height up and down to wherever you

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.330 
vent height up and down to wherever you
would<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.510> be<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.770> second<00:00:53.160> one

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
would like it to be and the second one

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.939 
would like it to be and the second one
is<00:00:53.730> operated<00:00:54.270> from<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> other<00:00:54.629> side<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.230> it

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
is operated from the other side and it

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.650 
is operated from the other side and it
could<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.250> upward<00:00:56.520> from<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.820> side<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
could be upward from this side but so

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.029 
could be upward from this side but so
happens<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.530> side<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> this

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
happens it's on that side of this

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.060 
happens it's on that side of this
particular<00:00:59.219> bench<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.410> one<00:01:01.410> picks<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
particular bench and that one picks the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.270 
particular bench and that one picks the
whole<00:01:02.430> bench<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.210> off<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.690> floor<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.199> sets<00:01:05.159> it

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
whole bench up off the floor and sets it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800 
whole bench up off the floor and sets it
on<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> roll<00:01:05.729> base<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.479> move<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.750> around

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
on a roll base you can move it around

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.070 
on a roll base you can move it around
your<00:01:07.140> shop<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.659> operate<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:11.659> just<00:01:12.659> loosen

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
your shop so to operate this just loosen

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.580 
your shop so to operate this just loosen
up<00:01:13.200> these<00:01:13.380> pipe<00:01:14.040> clamps<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.580> little<00:01:14.820> bit<00:01:15.590> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
up these pipe clamps a little bit and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.640 
up these pipe clamps a little bit and
take<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.880> use<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> cordless<00:01:18.600> drill<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.409> could

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
take a I use a cordless drill you could

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.429 
take a I use a cordless drill you could
use<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> crank<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.729> came<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.570> trunk

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
use a crank that came out of the trunk

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.350 
use a crank that came out of the trunk
of<00:01:22.590> your<00:01:22.680> car<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:23.130> stole<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> scissor<00:01:23.880> jacks

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of your car we stole the scissor jacks

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
of your car we stole the scissor jacks
promise<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:26.900> ratchet<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.140> lot<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.470> different

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
promise or a ratchet a lot of different

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.560 
promise or a ratchet a lot of different
things<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.310> cordless<00:01:29.700> drill<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> great<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
things but cordless drill is great and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:45.160 
things but cordless drill is great and
put<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.390> operator<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.060 

so<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> bench<00:01:46.560> adjusts<00:01:47.450> from<00:01:48.450> 29<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.799> about

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
so the bench adjusts from 29 up to about

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.340 
so the bench adjusts from 29 up to about
44<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.150> high<00:01:51.330> when<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.200> where

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
44 is just high when you get it where

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.370 
44 is just high when you get it where
you<00:01:52.380> want<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.640> take<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.390> height

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you want it you just take your height

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:06.530 
you want it you just take your height
class<00:01:55.740> back<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:58.430> this<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:03.240> finches<00:02:05.540> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
class back up this and the finches the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.720 
class back up this and the finches the
bench<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.290> solid<00:02:07.850> so<00:02:09.319> that's<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.619> one<00:02:11.610> of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
bench is really solid so that's a one of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.890 
bench is really solid so that's a one of
the<00:02:11.790> things<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.090> real<00:02:12.330> happy<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
the things that's real happy with the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.420 
the things that's real happy with the
weight<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.200> designed<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.770> our<00:02:13.860> knowledge<00:02:14.250> no

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
weight is designed to our knowledge no

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.820 
weight is designed to our knowledge no
matter<00:02:14.850> what<00:02:15.239> tightens<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.410> no<00:02:16.500> matter<00:02:16.650> what

the<00:02:16.920> position<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:18.060> bench<00:02:18.269> is<00:02:18.450> still<00:02:18.690> a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the position is the bench is still a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.360 
the position is the bench is still a
nice<00:02:19.019> solid<00:02:19.590> work<00:02:19.800> surface<00:02:21.110> then<00:02:22.110> if<00:02:22.590> you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
nice solid work surface then if you

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.470 
nice solid work surface then if you
wanted<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:25.100> move<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.310> thing<00:02:27.060> around<00:02:27.180> your

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
wanted to move the thing around your

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.900 
wanted to move the thing around your
