00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.809 

I<00:03:02.540> thought<00:03:03.409> sonic<00:03:03.920> would<00:03:04.069> move<00:03:04.280> much<00:03:04.550> more

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
I thought sonic would move much more

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.180 
I thought sonic would move much more
quickly<00:03:04.879> than<00:03:05.540> he<00:03:05.750> does<00:03:09.099> something's<00:03:10.099> not

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
quickly than he does something's not

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.850 
quickly than he does something's not
right<00:03:10.610> Sonic's<00:03:11.480> not<00:03:11.659> moving<00:03:11.989> as<00:03:12.140> fast<00:03:12.170> as<00:03:12.739> he

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
right Sonic's not moving as fast as he

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:22.620 
right Sonic's not moving as fast as he
usually<00:03:13.040> does

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.260 

this<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.380> impossible<00:03:23.770> no<00:03:24.460> matter<00:03:24.670> how<00:03:24.910> hard<00:03:25.210> we

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
this is impossible no matter how hard we

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.750 
this is impossible no matter how hard we
hit<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.570> thing<00:03:25.990> she's<00:03:26.350> going<00:03:26.620> you'll<00:03:27.610> have
