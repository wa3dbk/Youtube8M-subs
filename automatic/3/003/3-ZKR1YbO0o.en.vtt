00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 good 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.820
 We are in the city of Lujan 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.820
 again and now we find ourselves with 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.500
 mills a friend who many years ago 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.710
 that has the stubble but this 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.490
 machine has something special is a button 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.199
 of the 488 you have to forget the 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.359
 engine and have but has something to have 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.490
 money not open a bit the capote think 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.490
 in what is this dragged ship 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.890
 but it's a little dirty says mill 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.890
 but look 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.680
 bonino being that then 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.809
 88 11 a turbo let's say what speed 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.809
 end of every two hours 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:02.040
 but the more 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.340
 Of course he does not dare to prove what the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.150
 final speed but let's say the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.150
 very good performance 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.510
 good 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.140
 but with the turbo let's say like 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.700
 and let's say it 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.700
 how many years we have 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.320
 more than ten years, he knew how to be 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.140
 green color otherwise now yours 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.250
 a little 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.410
 I put some 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.420
 to whom what escaped and the rest 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.420
 has a beach house of what 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.440
 one box one can carry box 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.700
 molyneux a man who walks who knows 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.790
 do you know how to ride a motorcycle has a 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.860
 wave 1100 and has six cylinders and 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.330
 I only charge because I tell him he has a 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.180
 motorbike with a motor file composed of 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.100
 coast 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.260
 but that does not have the stubble too 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.270
 He knows how to walk very well and does very little to 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.860
 do a training course to the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.020
 Honda factory because it works in a 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.820
 honda official dealer and there was 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.280
 many cars there when you went to 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.020
 event to training and you were between 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.240
 half of all that auto with the stubble 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.790
 and all the car imported and ground with 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.849
 the trail 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:33.640
 88 of the models 75 in very good condition 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.590
 never taxi this this stubble and it's a 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.599
 mother story we have with all 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.760
 These machines here in the city of Lujan 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.099
 money not something that you can tell me 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.000
 some history of the stubble something that 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:48.730
 you have done or something that has happened to us 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.500
 past you've always been walking 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.910
 you had problems and weapons only once 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.910
 better than the pipes 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.490
 where it was frozen from the cold 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.190
 he had a kind of syndrome 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.900
 titanic the pipes froze 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.700
 copper with the like see that he had 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.710
 armed behind and stopped the stubble 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.320
 how did you get it or feel misfortune 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:34.720
 in him I had to wait and then not 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.720
 We had clear temperature 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.130
 so, well, the pipes froze 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.400
 of copper by not having the box and stopped 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.250
 in 488 he got a very good machine 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.730
 thank you very much mill 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.090
 it rims me too someone told me 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.090
 the brake 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.340
 has 1 perforated brake disc and see 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.840
 if you can see 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.840
 that is, it brakes very well 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.829
 an album too 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.659
 the pump and the falcon servo also 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.659
 it came very well from ahead 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.980
 I think a complication in the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.680
 stubble that sometimes happens half of 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.420
 long in some situations so I 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.489
 put brake disc is very good 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.180
 informed 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:29.310
 that surrounded by 600 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:31.050
 66 50 x 16 and the back one of 700 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.770
 that gives a little more speed to the 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.530
 final is very nice the spacecraft a 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.570
