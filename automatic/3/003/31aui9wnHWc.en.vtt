paper okay you starting you start with

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.580 
paper okay you starting you start with
folding<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.740> sheet<00:00:26.449> in<00:00:27.449> half<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.170> as

fingernails<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.050> make<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> folds<00:00:34.739> really

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
fingernails to make the folds really

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:46.069 
fingernails to make the folds really
sharp<00:00:37.910> like<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:42.360> can't<00:00:42.629> fold<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:45.079> like

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
sharp like that you can't fold it like

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.670 
sharp like that you can't fold it like

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
that then you fold one half to the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.229 
that then you fold one half to the
middle<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.430> don't<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:55.610> all<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.879> way<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
middle I don't do all the way to the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.790 
middle I don't do all the way to the
middle<00:00:57.480> I'll<00:00:57.600> make<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> slight<00:00:58.410> gap<00:01:00.620> but<00:01:01.620> it's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
middle I'll make a slight gap but it's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.390 
middle I'll make a slight gap but it's
like<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> very<00:01:03.059> subtle<00:01:03.300> yeah<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.129> but<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> can

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
like a very subtle yeah so but you can

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.250 
like a very subtle yeah so but you can
do<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> middle<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> way<00:01:07.110> if

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
do it in to the middle all the way if

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.050 
do it in to the middle all the way if
you<00:01:07.380> want<00:01:09.290> like<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.400> and<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.640> other<00:01:11.760> side

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
slightly slight gap just tiny bit you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.880 
slightly slight gap just tiny bit you
forget<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.820> helps<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.869> actually<00:01:21.900> then

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
forget just helps if you actually then

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.429 
forget just helps if you actually then
light<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.159> fold<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.700> half<00:01:23.869> it's<00:01:24.869> not<00:01:25.080> isn't

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
light up fold it in half it's not isn't

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.980 
light up fold it in half it's not isn't
too<00:01:25.590> much<00:01:26.210> paper<00:01:27.619> accumulated<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.640> again<00:01:30.150> make

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
too much paper accumulated so again make

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.410 
too much paper accumulated so again make
the<00:01:31.110> force<00:01:31.439> field<00:01:31.740> sharp<00:01:33.079> like<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:35.420> then

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the force field sharp like that then

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.289 
the force field sharp like that then
take<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:38.220> top<00:01:38.490> corner<00:01:39.240> fold<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:41.180> into<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
take the top corner fold it in into the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:53.110 
take the top corner fold it in into the
middle<00:01:45.470> like<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.500 

take<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.990> other<00:01:54.140> corner<00:01:55.300> toilet<00:01:56.300> in<00:01:56.450> the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
take the other corner toilet in the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.670 
take the other corner toilet in the
middle

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.050 

like<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:06.220> then<00:02:07.570> little<00:02:08.570> bit<00:02:09.170> tricky<00:02:09.530> part

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
like that then little bit tricky part

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.680 
like that then little bit tricky part
take<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.260> where<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.130> finishes<00:02:13.700> kind

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
take that and where that finishes kind

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.000 
take that and where that finishes kind
of<00:02:14.750> hold<00:02:14.990> it<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.940> where<00:02:16.940> bottom<00:02:17.420> finishes<00:02:18.020> you

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
of hold it and where bottom finishes you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.290 
of hold it and where bottom finishes you
want<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:20.380> make<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:21.530> fold<00:02:22.870> where<00:02:23.870> then<00:02:25.300> kind

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
want to make this fold where then kind

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.070 
want to make this fold where then kind
of<00:02:26.330> match<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:26.990> this<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:28.700> bit<00:02:28.940> where<00:02:29.930> is

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
of match this this this bit where is

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.530 
of match this this this bit where is
this<00:02:30.350> fall<00:02:30.620> finishes<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.370> all<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.150> way<00:02:32.270> open

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
top like that and make the fold again

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.770

to make its really sharp there's a fair

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.570 
to make its really sharp there's a fair
bit<00:04:04.600> of<00:04:04.750> paper<00:04:04.990> accumulated<00:04:05.560> but<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.280> that

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
bit of paper accumulated but that that

nice and neat then take this bit and

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330 
nice and neat then take this bit and
fold<00:05:00.330> it<00:05:00.540> that's<00:05:01.230> all<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.590> way<00:05:01.710> all<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.310> way

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
fold it that's all the way all the way

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.550 
fold it that's all the way all the way
down<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:02.880> meet<00:05:03.330> in<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.080> middle<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.870> know<00:05:06.960> not

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
down and meet in the middle you know not

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.450 
down and meet in the middle you know not
like<00:05:07.710> that<00:05:07.890> not<00:05:08.070> like<00:05:08.100> that

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
like that not like that

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.070 
like that not like that
just<00:05:08.790> in<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.090> middle

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:27.360 

Oh<00:05:17.419> like<00:05:18.419> that

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.100 

that's<00:05:28.090> what<00:05:28.270> he<00:05:28.360> didn't<00:05:28.570> end<00:05:28.690> up<00:05:28.780> with<00:05:31.110> now

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
that's what he didn't end up with now

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:43.860 
that's what he didn't end up with now
you<00:05:32.169> can<00:05:33.419> fold<00:05:34.419> it<00:05:34.660> in<00:05:35.139> half<00:05:38.280> like<00:05:39.280> this<00:05:42.870> like

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
you can fold it in half like this like

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.520 
you can fold it in half like this like
that<00:05:44.130> can<00:05:45.130> flip<00:05:45.580> it<00:05:45.760> just<00:05:46.000> to<00:05:46.960> make<00:05:47.080> it<00:05:47.229> easier

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
that can flip it just to make it easier

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.070 
that can flip it just to make it easier
for<00:05:47.800> you<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:49.139> start<00:05:50.139> bending<00:05:51.180> kind<00:05:52.180> of<00:05:52.300> in<00:05:52.540> in

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
for you and start bending kind of in in

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.030 
for you and start bending kind of in in
this<00:05:53.320> corner<00:05:53.710> so<00:05:54.010> that<00:05:54.040> and<00:05:54.930> roughly<00:05:56.040> more

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
this corner so that and roughly more

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.460 
this corner so that and roughly more
than<00:05:57.220> halfway<00:05:57.460> from<00:05:58.300> this<00:05:58.479> bit<00:05:58.720> so<00:05:58.750> somewhere

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
than halfway from this bit so somewhere

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.800 
than halfway from this bit so somewhere
here<00:05:59.740> where<00:05:59.979> you<00:06:00.310> make<00:06:00.460> them<00:06:00.610> but<00:06:01.540> you<00:06:01.630> make

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
here where you make them but you make

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:10.670 
here where you make them but you make
things<00:06:02.350> a<00:06:02.650> default<00:06:05.070> so<00:06:06.070> something<00:06:06.760> like<00:06:06.940> that

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.260 

it's<00:06:11.680> not<00:06:11.830> an<00:06:11.919> easy<00:06:12.130> one<00:06:12.430> but<00:06:12.880> pretty<00:06:13.150> cool

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
it's not an easy one but pretty cool

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.659 
it's not an easy one but pretty cool
wonder<00:06:13.600> is<00:06:13.690> fast<00:06:14.220> like<00:06:15.220> that<00:06:15.400> you<00:06:15.910> flip<00:06:16.240> it<00:06:16.270> you

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
wonder is fast like that you flip it you

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.879 
wonder is fast like that you flip it you
don't<00:06:18.669> ask<00:06:18.820> next<00:06:19.120> one<00:06:19.470> exactly<00:06:20.470> the<00:06:20.590> same

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.850 

match<00:06:24.030> the<00:06:25.030> opposite<00:06:25.419> side<00:06:25.660> make<00:06:26.410> sure<00:06:26.680> it

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
match the opposite side make sure it

you your airplanes almost finished just
kind<00:06:40.150> of<00:06:40.440> make<00:06:41.440> it<00:06:41.470> nice<00:06:41.770> and<00:06:41.800> even<00:06:42.160> so<00:06:42.639> the

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
kind of make it nice and even so the

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.490 
kind of make it nice and even so the
wings<00:06:43.330> should<00:06:43.510> be<00:06:43.660> straight<00:06:43.960> the<00:06:44.110> corners

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500
