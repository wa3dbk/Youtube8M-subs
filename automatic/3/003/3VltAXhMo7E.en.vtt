00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.660 
the first one was really about bringing
them<00:05:41.710> together<00:05:41.830> this<00:05:42.220> was<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:42.490> reunion

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
them together this was the reunion

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.220 
them together this was the reunion
working<00:05:43.180> together<00:05:43.300> again<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:43.930> seeing<00:05:44.140> them

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
working together again and seeing them

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.230 
working together again and seeing them
on-screen<00:05:44.560> together<00:05:45.070> again<00:05:45.550> and<00:05:45.790> it's<00:05:45.910> cool

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
on-screen together again and it's cool

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.540 
on-screen together again and it's cool
but<00:05:46.870> I<00:05:46.930> almost<00:05:47.260> feel<00:05:47.620> like<00:05:47.680> we<00:05:47.920> could<00:05:48.100> just<00:05:48.130> do

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
but I almost feel like we could just do

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.670 
but I almost feel like we could just do
more<00:05:48.940> like<00:05:49.240> shorter<00:05:49.720> Avenger<00:05:50.230> movies<00:05:50.500> and

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
more like shorter Avenger movies and

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.900 
more like shorter Avenger movies and
just<00:05:50.770> keep<00:05:50.950> doing<00:05:50.980> those<00:05:51.370> so<00:05:51.580> they're<00:05:51.700> making

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
just keep doing those so they're making

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.400
