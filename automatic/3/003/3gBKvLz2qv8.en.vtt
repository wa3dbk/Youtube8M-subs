fixed blades you have a drop-point model

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.230 
fixed blades you have a drop-point model
and<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.540> tanto<00:00:16.109> model<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.310> price<00:00:17.550> tag<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:18.000> these

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
and a tanto model the price tag on these

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.660 
and a tanto model the price tag on these
between<00:00:18.720> twenty-five<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.470> thirty<00:00:20.310> dollars

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
between twenty-five and thirty dollars

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.939 
between twenty-five and thirty dollars
and<00:00:21.270> what<00:00:21.990> I'm<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.350> be<00:00:22.560> doing<00:00:22.710> with

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
and what I'm going to be doing with

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.439 
and what I'm going to be doing with
these<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.160> basically<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> very<00:00:24.180> simple

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
these is basically a very simple

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.080 
these is basically a very simple
three-part<00:00:25.380> test<00:00:26.570> slicing<00:00:27.619> thrusting<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
three-part test slicing thrusting and

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.650 
three-part test slicing thrusting and
chopping<00:00:30.109> right<00:00:31.109> now<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.349> chopping<00:00:32.660> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
chopping right now the chopping you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.160 
chopping right now the chopping you
wouldn't<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.110> chop<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:35.210> small<00:00:36.210> fairly

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
wouldn't really chop with small fairly

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.209 
wouldn't really chop with small fairly
lightweight<00:00:37.440> knives<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> chopping<00:00:39.899> is

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
lightweight knives so the chopping is

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.560 
lightweight knives so the chopping is
basically<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.700> test<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.300> if<00:00:42.390> they

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
basically just a test to see if they

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.610 
basically just a test to see if they
break<00:00:42.899> okay<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.829> pure<00:00:44.219> durability<00:00:45.000> testing

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
break okay it's pure durability testing

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.580 
break okay it's pure durability testing
the<00:00:46.620> thrusting<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.329> also<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the thrusting that is also to see if the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.500 
the thrusting that is also to see if the
tip<00:00:49.829> will<00:00:50.100> break<00:00:50.340> off<00:00:50.610> if<00:00:50.850> you've<00:00:51.059> ever<00:00:51.239> had<00:00:51.449> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
tip will break off if you've ever had a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.260 
tip will break off if you've ever had a
cheap<00:00:51.870> knife<00:00:52.170> where<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> tip<00:00:52.800> broke<00:00:53.039> off<00:00:53.370> you

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
cheap knife where the tip broke off you

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.639 
cheap knife where the tip broke off you
know<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.539> I'm<00:00:54.690> talking<00:00:55.110> about

as<00:00:55.710> far<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.940> slicing<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:59.039> these<00:00:59.280> are

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
as far as the slicing you know these are

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.210 
as far as the slicing you know these are
advertised<00:01:00.840> as<00:01:02.390> survival<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.220> tactical

blades<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.790> know<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.150> they're<00:01:06.630> advertised

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
blades you know they they're advertised

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.600 
blades you know they they're advertised
as<00:01:07.770> fit<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.030> combat<00:01:09.260> well<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:11.189> they're<00:01:11.490> gonna

as fit for combat well if they're gonna

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.390 
as fit for combat well if they're gonna
go<00:01:11.939> there<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.450> their<00:01:12.840> advertising<00:01:13.500> I'm<00:01:14.040> gonna

go there in their advertising I'm gonna

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.880 
go there in their advertising I'm gonna
go<00:01:14.640> there<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.450> testing<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.290> Filipino

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
go there in the testing in Filipino

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.710 
go there in the testing in Filipino
martial<00:01:17.220> arts<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.820> probably<00:01:18.240> most<00:01:18.479> other

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
martial arts and probably most other

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.679 
martial arts and probably most other
blade<00:01:19.020> arts<00:01:19.350> -<00:01:19.560> they<00:01:20.100> teach<00:01:20.159> angles<00:01:21.030> all<00:01:21.420> right

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
blade arts - they teach angles all right

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.630 
blade arts - they teach angles all right
so<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.310> nine<00:01:23.640> angles<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:25.020> two<00:01:25.680> three

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so you have nine angles one two three

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.420 
so you have nine angles one two three
four<00:01:27.210> five<00:01:27.960> six<00:01:28.710> seven<00:01:29.700> eight<00:01:30.119> nine<00:01:31.430> alright

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
four five six seven eight nine alright

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.420 
four five six seven eight nine alright
so<00:01:32.880> we're<00:01:33.600> gonna<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:34.020> some<00:01:34.290> marshall<00:01:34.770> slicing

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so we're gonna do some marshall slicing

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.569 
so we're gonna do some marshall slicing
right<00:01:35.689> to<00:01:36.689> test<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.170> grip<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
right to test the grip and as for the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.060 
right to test the grip and as for the
thrusting<00:01:39.210> that's<00:01:39.990> also<00:01:40.409> gonna<00:01:40.530> test<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
thrusting that's also gonna test the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.710 
thrusting that's also gonna test the
grip<00:01:41.340> because<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.030> doesn't<00:01:42.299> give<00:01:42.540> me<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
grip because if this doesn't give me a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.440 
grip because if this doesn't give me a
good<00:01:43.020> grip<00:01:43.320> I'll<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:44.399> cutting<00:01:44.640> myself<00:01:44.909> won't

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
good grip I'll be cutting myself won't

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.450 
good grip I'll be cutting myself won't
die<00:01:45.689> alright<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:46.979> go

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
die alright so here we go

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.210 
die alright so here we go

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
and the chopping okay well did first of

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.590 
and the chopping okay well did first of
all<00:03:26.270> did<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.690> tip<00:03:26.960> survive<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.970> know<00:03:29.120> being

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
all did the tip survive you know being

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.500 
all did the tip survive you know being
jammed<00:03:30.560> into<00:03:30.800> that<00:03:31.040> log<00:03:31.280> I'm<00:03:31.670> happy<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.300> say
