across the bag that you can carry the
unit<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.970> why<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.240> need<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> handle<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.140> a

that<00:02:07.409> those<00:02:07.680> cables<00:02:08.069> themselves<00:02:08.220> were<00:02:08.670> quite

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
that those cables themselves were quite

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.410 
that those cables themselves were quite
overpriced<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.590> won't<00:02:10.800> go<00:02:10.950> into<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.420> and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
overpriced but we won't go into that and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.240 
overpriced but we won't go into that and

the box is quite a unique why a unique
system<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.640> should<00:02:16.820> say<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:18.110> box<00:02:18.320> itself

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
system I should say the box itself

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.280 
system I should say the box itself
nothing<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.910> really<00:02:20.090> move<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:20.810> slight

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
nothing to really move this slight

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.810 
nothing to really move this slight
movement<00:02:21.830> here<00:02:22.070> from<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> front<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.640> back

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
movement here from the front the back

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.820 
movement here from the front the back
but<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.090> whole<00:02:23.270> idea<00:02:23.420> is<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:24.230> front<00:02:24.530> panel

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
but the whole idea is this front panel

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.890 
but the whole idea is this front panel
opens<00:02:25.460> up<00:02:25.640> it's<00:02:26.120> gonna<00:02:26.240> show<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.540> how<00:02:26.690> that's

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
opens up it's gonna show you how that's

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.340 
opens up it's gonna show you how that's
done

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
done

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.710 
done
okay<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.760> bottom<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.270> device<00:02:29.390> here

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
okay on the bottom of the device here

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.449 
okay on the bottom of the device here
we've<00:02:29.900> got<00:02:30.050> a<00:02:30.110> lock<00:02:30.380> here<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.040> slide

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
we've got a lock here that you slide

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.850 
we've got a lock here that you slide
across<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.330> front<00:02:32.630> panel<00:02:33.050> moves<00:02:33.290> forward

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
across and the front panel moves forward

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.420 
across and the front panel moves forward
just<00:02:34.340> over<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.700> centimeter<00:02:35.980> now<00:02:36.980> as<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.250> can

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
just over a centimeter now as you can

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.130 
just over a centimeter now as you can
see<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.760> front<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.180> unit<00:02:38.450> has<00:02:38.630> come<00:02:38.959> out

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
see the front of the unit has come out

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.350 
see the front of the unit has come out
slightly<00:02:39.560> there<00:02:39.920> what<00:02:40.640> we<00:02:40.760> do<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.120> be<00:02:41.209> them

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
slightly there what we do to be them

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.630 
slightly there what we do to be them
pull<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:41.990> open<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.860> front<00:02:43.100> panel<00:02:43.400> comes

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
pull that open and the front panel comes

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.760 
pull that open and the front panel comes
off<00:02:43.850> it's<00:02:44.150> got<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.330> four<00:02:45.110> tier<00:02:45.350> locking

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
off it's got a four tier locking

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.350 
off it's got a four tier locking
mechanism<00:02:46.310> there<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:46.610> there's<00:02:46.760> no<00:02:46.940> chance<00:02:47.180> of

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
mechanism there so there's no chance of

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.270 
mechanism there so there's no chance of
it<00:02:47.450> coming<00:02:47.510> off<00:02:47.870> accidentally<00:02:48.440> even<00:02:49.160> when

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
it coming off accidentally even when

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.729 
it coming off accidentally even when
it's<00:02:49.400> unlocked<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:50.300> quite<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.570> rugged<00:02:51.080> system

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
it's unlocked it's quite a rugged system

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.720 
it's unlocked it's quite a rugged system
there<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.220> we've<00:02:52.430> got<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.820> there<00:02:53.590> now<00:02:54.730> drive

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
there so we've got that there now drive

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.520 
there so we've got that there now drive
access<00:02:56.150> itself<00:02:56.540> gear<00:02:56.870> comes<00:02:57.170> down<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.500> a
