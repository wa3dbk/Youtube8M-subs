 I was not wondering how he praised leather we're going to do one thing 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.110
 Per hundred we're supposed to talk to people who do not understand 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.690
 A) Yes 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.100
 not for the personalized and neither is he accustomed and has his own 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.510
 customs we have a carved beta leather 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.150
 see how they sound 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.800
 c percent yes yes good 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.440
 foto karel hype and almost potocar the hype 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.799
 there is going to be a general panning 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.310
 I was going to see how it's bricked 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.780
 the leather was changed 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.200
 efe per hundred after the carneada 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.100
 and only sees it very well the oti deserves leather 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.890
 and after its rescue in pineta screens there are several ways is here 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.180
 to July 1 yes some track that on the floor 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 yes 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.250
 it can be along the two essential ways 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.130
 even though 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.439
 in the institutions for the estanciero that had written in this step 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.130
 Andes 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.390
 he said he could do 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.109
 narrow is understood round yes 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.910
 and narrow natural 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.190
 because in that way flight 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.570
 the orders that came from outside the outside 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.880
 you had to fill out how you should leather cue 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.350
 in cameros another not to save your home varies moss 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.750
 if you're going to be a job and want to get peanuts I love yes 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.290
 that is to cut the leather in spiral in round we are going to look for to detail it hills 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.749
 possible round 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:01.799
 well suited 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.460
 will do if you're not going to rub on a machine to so many sobe 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.629
 in auctions like sohar a whole leather then 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.849
 you have to be here I talk like this is throughout 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.440
 in this way because 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.219
 because we are going to take the reins, enjoy everything you do along 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.519
 some wonder why he did not take it seriously with hair there are several maria 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.629
 detail it 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.379
 one of the way as I said monte come cool leather to do the 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.359
 low well lavadito p 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.119
 but ChÃ¡vez takes the knee and with the knife 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:32.499
 while she looked 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.009
 he does a little while he explained to me how biarritz lodge good 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:38.300
 Let's explain what we were going to do 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.629
 is the explanation 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.350
 the nuclear if the meaning 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.669
 to report is to affect 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.699
 when there was a leather short you want and that leather aquariums ja 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.080
 in plm in 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.750
 in which the pampa voice 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.419
 he has the different editions according to the context 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:58.889
 with what one is going to say 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.329
 so one can what good women in different way 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:08.189
 he praises him cool and he is yes yes when they are not lying yes even in the 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.319
 ground p 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.619
 there are some diversity with hair up others with hair down 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:19.639
 p there are different ways of seeing some bury the leather and that way 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.110
 loosen the leather 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.839
 percent buried 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:26.849
 when rotting bytes and opened a little hair bulb then 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.849
 that generates that the pri does not leave more easily 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:34.739
 right but I am honored to honor myself, particularly I do not like it because 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.570
 because I will not be able to 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.940
 p use especially in jumps 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.570
 they feel that area after 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.410
 the leather is made by means of a chemical process 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.349
 peratta in the province buenos aires our custom 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.069
 Soa natural leeks have no chemistry at all 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.700
 the mind is rejected a little salt 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.359
 and nothing more 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.600
 basically July this is what it does is affected 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.750
 and it is that although the leather can be lorgia art that echo p you will always take it away 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.280
 a little bit of the flower, although later I decided to stay with manzarek and theology 2 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.600
 it would not be what the leather is already dry 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.420
 it is always preferable 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.970
 percent he got to do it and colloquial or cool and zas 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.540
 for that way 20 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.430
 the leather there is much better smoother 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.930
 without roughness and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.750
 and it goes what is called velvety art 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.960
 silvio and as if that finds in the best quality of the leather which they demand 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.850
 better let's say good undoubtedly what we are seeing here is a 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.380
 leather pampas and but people know what it is and of a pampa leather always the best 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.430
 and the most beautiful aspect although there are other leather that its very good 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.419
 because the black villages the leather coats the limousine hides are also 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.190
 good maybe p leathers 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.639
 The redoubt of dairy animals are not so good 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:05.689
 although generally the field is used what there is but if you do not want something good from 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:06.400
 appearance 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.110
 and hardness the people pampa all the towns that serve to 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.330
 percent for the luso for the field for work but I still credentials and 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.620
 the pampa leather the best 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.940
 Pampa leather is always looked for by the appearance by color for a certain degree of 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.759
 hardness that has 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.630
 the conformation of your fiber 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.850
 and although alves is a hundred people use more 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.539
 by blind black leather and they are very good 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.539
 that the important thing is to know that Julio Cobos questioned 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.340
 the town if it is fat is good 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.110
 and it's easier to sobar 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.289
 what would be the ideal weight usually bit the ideal weight 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.840
 steer three years 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.150
 3 400 grandchildren kilo he ideally because the leather is big we have a thickness yes 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.900
 there are times that with other things as an example things indicate 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.150
 they are not so good because why are they too udeso 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.600
 that of abortion or tea and very thin of the or in the neck 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.409
 on the other hand pampa hides only more even leather 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.819
 and still the process 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:09.990
 distanced 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.509
 you can help that town be even though it will be made as a tata 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:16.889
 that even the ideal would be 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:22.139
 this workshop upside down the part the Guri went out to arrive at part of the goal 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:23.460
 couple of minutes down 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.080
 when one is wet, the city accumulates a little and then 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.540
 in the fira founded up and down and is paired 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.919
 but the pampa leather 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.900
 I will sing he said so even 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.370
 that had achieved the same tenacity almost the neck to the end so as 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.300
 luxury 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.280
 it is indescribable the color is very nice 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.320
 percent 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.520
 It also depends on what I do 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.650
 how do you do it 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.139
 massa achieved a good color 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.569
 although also the color varies according to 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:55.710
 to the intensity of the hair color and to the area there where the hair more 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.509
 dark and there area where he but he clarified me the color so much does not interest 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:02.189
 but what does interest 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:05.320
 in the quality of the leather especially to make it natural 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.279
 we apply again we do not 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:09.729
 what goes on the other hand 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.069
 do not use loose mind 

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:16.039
 no chemicals yes absolutely no chemicals 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:17.800
 a little salt 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.580
 and machines there is no other thing or more eta as it became native 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.990
 we many times 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.590
 when you have to do a very fine job or when you present a job 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.729
 to expose it for example in Palermo to a possible pressure it is preferable that 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:37.660
 what the leather and the massey eta can silvia a flight we go to to the 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.440
 advertising round and then we continue 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.440
 wind worked and a half 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.050
 now also 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.639
 Hahaha
