well<00:01:53.159> his<00:01:53.670> heading<00:01:53.939> was<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> particularly

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
well his heading was a particularly

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.090 
well his heading was a particularly
impressive<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.290> me<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.439> was<00:01:55.530> good<00:01:55.890> but

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
impressive for me it was good but

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.219 
impressive for me it was good but
nothing<00:01:56.310> amazing<00:01:56.880> he<00:01:57.420> wasn't<00:01:57.719> winning<00:01:57.869> every

very high jumping and strength SATs but

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.940 
very high jumping and strength SATs but
he's<00:02:02.549> not<00:02:02.790> bad<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> air<00:02:03.659> at<00:02:03.780> all<00:02:03.899> for<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> DK

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
he's not bad in the air at all for a DK

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.109 
he's not bad in the air at all for a DK
I<00:02:04.979> was<00:02:05.189> hoping<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.520> someone<00:02:05.790> who<00:02:05.880> would<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.090> a

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
I was hoping for someone who would be a

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.300 
I was hoping for someone who would be a
bit<00:02:06.360> more<00:02:06.509> dominant<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.290> air<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:08.190> be

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
bit more dominant in the air and to be

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.669 
bit more dominant in the air and to be
honest<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.759> don't<00:02:08.849> think<00:02:09.479> he's<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> huge<00:02:10.349> amount

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
honest I don't think he's a huge amount

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.280 
honest I don't think he's a huge amount
better<00:02:10.890> than<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> 85<00:02:12.150> version<00:02:12.569> one<00:02:13.080> thing

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
better than the 85 version one thing

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.830 
better than the 85 version one thing
that<00:02:13.470> is

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
that is

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.479 
that is
definitely<00:02:14.349> definitely<00:02:14.470> better<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.220> his

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
definitely definitely better is his

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.089 
definitely definitely better is his
distribution<00:02:15.970> his<00:02:16.480> passing<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:16.989> excellent<00:02:17.920> on

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
distribution his passing is excellent on

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.550 
distribution his passing is excellent on
the<00:02:18.220> third<00:02:18.640> form<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.810> means<00:02:19.989> he<00:02:20.170> can<00:02:20.319> start

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
the third form and it means he can start

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.589 
the third form and it means he can start
attacks<00:02:20.980> on<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.250> back<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.730> definitely<00:02:22.420> give

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
attacks on the back and definitely give

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.350 
attacks on the back and definitely give
him<00:02:22.690> props<00:02:22.900> for<00:02:23.019> that<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.250> good<00:02:24.700> skill

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
him props for that that is a good skill

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.030 
him props for that that is a good skill
to<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.569> but<00:02:26.110> apart<00:02:26.319> from<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.739> don't

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
to have but apart from that I don't

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.640 
to have but apart from that I don't
think<00:02:27.220> he's<00:02:27.400> way<00:02:28.180> better<00:02:28.450> than<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:29.260> night

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
think he's way better than the night

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.740 
think he's way better than the night
inform<00:02:30.040> he<00:02:30.370> does<00:02:30.519> have<00:02:30.640> 99<00:02:31.120> aggression<00:02:31.569> and

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
inform he does have 99 aggression and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.210 
inform he does have 99 aggression and
yet<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.170> dives<00:02:32.379> in<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.590> tackle<00:02:32.980> straight

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
yet the dives in to tackle straight

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.770 
yet the dives in to tackle straight
which<00:02:33.700> means<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.030> he's<00:02:34.209> probably<00:02:34.420> going<00:02:34.660> to

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
which means that he's probably going to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.720 
which means that he's probably going to
be<00:02:34.930> giving<00:02:35.260> away<00:02:35.379> a<00:02:35.470> few<00:02:36.010> penalties<00:02:36.310> for<00:02:36.610> you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
be giving away a few penalties for you

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.000 
be giving away a few penalties for you
even<00:02:37.209> if<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.510> want<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.930> just<00:02:38.110> hold<00:02:38.349> contain<00:02:38.739> or

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
even if you want to just hold contain or

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.559 
even if you want to just hold contain or
hold<00:02:39.220> Chucky<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:40.060> he's<00:02:40.180> probably<00:02:40.330> still

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
hold Chucky and he's probably still

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.270 
hold Chucky and he's probably still
going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.810> be<00:02:40.870> giving<00:02:41.140> away<00:02:41.230> penalties<00:02:41.500> so

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
going to be giving away penalties so

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.770 
going to be giving away penalties so
that<00:02:42.519> could<00:02:42.700> be<00:02:42.730> simply<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.120> watch<00:02:43.269> out<00:02:43.510> for

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
that could be simply to watch out for

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.420 
that could be simply to watch out for
and<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.500> be<00:02:44.590> honest<00:02:44.799> if<00:02:44.920> you're<00:02:45.040> building<00:02:45.220> a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
that he is a good amount better than

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.369 
that he is a good amount better than
Pepe<00:02:57.549> so<00:02:58.150> move<00:02:58.360> on<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:58.660> very<00:02:58.780> gently<00:02:59.140> view

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
Pepe so move on to the very gently view

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.670 
Pepe so move on to the very gently view
this<00:02:59.530> guy<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.010> eight<00:03:00.489> out<00:03:00.910> of<00:03:00.970> 10<00:03:01.599> because<00:03:01.989> his

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
this guy and eight out of 10 because his

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.039 
this guy and eight out of 10 because his
pace<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.280> pretty<00:03:03.700> good<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.510> defending

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
pace is pretty good so this is defending

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.509 
pace is pretty good so this is defending
and<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:05.769> be<00:03:05.799> a<00:03:05.950> little<00:03:06.190> bit<00:03:06.400> better

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
and it can be a little bit better

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.000 
and it can be a little bit better
distribution<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:07.690> good<00:03:07.989> but<00:03:08.349> like<00:03:08.799> I<00:03:08.950> said

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
distribution is good but like I said

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.490 
distribution is good but like I said
while<00:03:09.670> these<00:03:09.849> areas<00:03:10.599> are<00:03:10.629> growing<00:03:11.230> in<00:03:11.379> my

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
while these areas are growing in my

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.949 
while these areas are growing in my
opinion<00:03:11.739> they're<00:03:12.160> not<00:03:12.280> great<00:03:12.640> his<00:03:13.450> passing<00:03:13.840> is

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
opinion they're not great his passing is

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.140 
opinion they're not great his passing is
very<00:03:14.260> nice<00:03:14.440> for<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.709> cinema<00:03:15.099> but<00:03:15.459> I<00:03:15.519> find<00:03:15.910> that

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
very nice for a cinema but I find that

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.729 
very nice for a cinema but I find that
that<00:03:16.569> doesn't<00:03:16.780> matter<00:03:16.989> too<00:03:17.230> much<00:03:17.260> for<00:03:17.590> me<00:03:17.709> but

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
that doesn't matter too much for me but

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.099 
that doesn't matter too much for me but
I<00:03:18.130> guess<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.579> depends<00:03:18.880> on<00:03:19.120> what<00:03:19.840> kind<00:03:19.870> of

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
I guess it depends on what kind of

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.319 
I guess it depends on what kind of
player<00:03:20.319> you<00:03:20.350> are<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.859> like<00:03:21.579> i<00:03:21.730> said<00:03:21.790> before<00:03:22.060> i

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
player you are and like i said before i
