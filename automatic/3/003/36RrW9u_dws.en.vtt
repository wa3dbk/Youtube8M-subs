hey there own paradise gamer 13 here

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.610 
hey there own paradise gamer 13 here
about<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.970> do<00:00:03.090> metalhead<00:00:03.659> Wario<00:00:04.020> can<00:00:04.230> move<00:00:04.380> and

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
about to do metalhead Wario can move and

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.920 
about to do metalhead Wario can move and
what<00:00:04.799> is<00:00:04.920> one<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.220> my<00:00:05.430> least<00:00:06.089> favorite<00:00:06.600> levels

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
what is one of my least favorite levels

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.879 
what is one of my least favorite levels
of<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.410> game<00:00:07.620> hazy<00:00:08.010> maze<00:00:08.400> cave<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.889> really

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
of the game hazy maze cave and really

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.330 
of the game hazy maze cave and really
this<00:00:11.010> one<00:00:11.570> yeah<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.320> not<00:00:13.769> really<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.309> of

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
this one yeah this is not really one of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.640 
this one yeah this is not really one of
the<00:00:14.490> more<00:00:14.700> difficult<00:00:14.880> ones<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.660> level

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
the more difficult ones in this level

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.960 
the more difficult ones in this level
first<00:00:17.010> day<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.400> guess<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.640> shouldn't<00:00:17.850> really

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
first day so I guess I shouldn't really

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.220 
first day so I guess I shouldn't really
complain<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.810> nonetheless<00:00:21.050> there's<00:00:22.050> just

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
complain but nonetheless there's just

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.290 
complain but nonetheless there's just
something<00:00:22.500> about<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.830> level<00:00:23.160> mainly<00:00:23.789> via

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
something about this level mainly via

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.800 
something about this level mainly via
the<00:00:24.960> maze<00:00:25.170> part<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.769> I'll<00:00:25.890> get<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.250> later<00:00:26.810> in

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
the maze part that I'll get to later in

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.290 
the maze part that I'll get to later in
theory<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.289> should<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> maze<00:00:30.060> in

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
theory I should have to do the maze in

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.240 
theory I should have to do the maze in
the<00:00:30.330> next<00:00:30.660> level<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.470> there's<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> good<00:00:32.070> way

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the next level but there's a good way

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.819 
the next level but there's a good way
around<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> DS<00:00:34.230> version<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
around that here in a DS version of the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.780 
around that here in a DS version of the
game<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:36.050> that'll<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.200> nice<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.800> actually<00:00:38.760> I

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
game so that'll be nice and actually I

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.660 
game so that'll be nice and actually I
want<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.180> way<00:00:40.280> amazes<00:00:41.280> over<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.579> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
want to go this way amazes over there to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.830 
want to go this way amazes over there to
the<00:00:41.760> right<00:00:42.030> by<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.360> way<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.690> future

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
the right by the way for future

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.979 
the right by the way for future
reference<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.640> this<00:00:44.640> area<00:00:45.000> should<00:00:45.780> be

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
reference and this area should be

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.029 
reference and this area should be
somewhat<00:00:46.260> familiar<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.620> know<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.860> been<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
somewhat familiar I know it's been a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.529 
somewhat familiar I know it's been a
while<00:00:47.100> since<00:00:47.340> I've<00:00:47.520> done<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> hazy<00:00:48.000> maze<00:00:48.270> cave

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
while since I've done a hazy maze cave

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.619 
while since I've done a hazy maze cave
level<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.289> um<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.510> elevator<00:00:51.510> that

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
level but um this is the elevator that

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.439 
level but um this is the elevator that
leads<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.820> underground<00:00:53.820> lake<00:00:54.149> area

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
leads up to the underground lake area

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.819 
leads up to the underground lake area
well<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.260> go<00:00:55.320> through<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.559> first

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
well you have to go through this first

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.380 
well you have to go through this first
but<00:00:56.039> after<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.430> I'll<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
but after that I'll be in the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.889 
but after that I'll be in the
underground<00:00:57.780> lake<00:00:58.020> area<00:00:58.260> which<00:00:59.219> is

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
underground lake area which is

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.799 
underground lake area which is
incidentally<00:01:00.899> where<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.350> need<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
incidentally where we need to go and

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
incidentally where we need to go and
that<00:01:03.809> came<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.589> little<00:01:04.710> too<00:01:04.860> close<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.339> hitting

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that came a little too close to hitting

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.310 
that came a little too close to hitting
me<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.939> one<00:01:06.510> didn't<00:01:06.860> but<00:01:07.860> uh<00:01:09.170> yeah

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
me that one didn't but uh yeah

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.830 
me that one didn't but uh yeah
so<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.560> star<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so that star that is the one for the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.359 
so that star that is the one for the
next<00:01:13.049> level<00:01:13.290> technically<00:01:14.130> you're<00:01:14.280> supposed

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
next level technically you're supposed

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.710 
next level technically you're supposed
to<00:01:14.610> go<00:01:14.700> around<00:01:14.820> through<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> maze<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.570> it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
to go around through the maze and get it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.230 
to go around through the maze and get it
but<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.860> see<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> fence

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
but as you can see there is a fence

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.060 
but as you can see there is a fence
guarding<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.869> way<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.320> actually<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.830> come

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
guarding that way we actually just come

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.179 
guarding that way we actually just come
back<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:21.240> D<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.500> use<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> power<00:01:22.950> flower

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
back here as we D and use a power flower

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.219 
back here as we D and use a power flower
to<00:01:23.340> get<00:01:23.460> through<00:01:23.610> there<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.229> basically

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
to get through there so basically

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.350 
to get through there so basically
avoiding<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.280> unnecessary<00:01:26.549> romping

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
avoiding all the unnecessary romping

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.630 
avoiding all the unnecessary romping
through<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> maze<00:01:28.770> unfortunately<00:01:29.490> though

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
through the a maze unfortunately though

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.920 
through the a maze unfortunately though
you<00:01:30.090> will<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.479> through<00:01:30.509> there

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
you will have to go through there

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.810 
you will have to go through there
eventually<00:01:31.640> as<00:01:34.430> we're<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
eventually as we're going for the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.950 
eventually as we're going for the
hundred<00:01:36.030> point<00:01:36.270> star<00:01:36.479> because<00:01:36.750> there's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
hundred point star because there's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.300 
hundred point star because there's
really<00:01:37.170> no<00:01:38.420> no<00:01:39.420> other<00:01:39.600> way<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.710> coins<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.220> here

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
really no no other way the coins in here

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.289 
really no no other way the coins in here
are<00:01:41.430> pretty<00:01:41.549> limited<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.890> unfortunately<00:01:44.299> not

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
are pretty limited so unfortunately not

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.300 
are pretty limited so unfortunately not
much<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:45.869> about<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.340> but<00:01:47.720> basically

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
much to do about that but basically

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.200 
much to do about that but basically
we're<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.610> stay<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.970> switch

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
we're just going to stay on the switch

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.260 
we're just going to stay on the switch
here<00:01:51.540> yeah<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.740> should<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.970> about

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
here yeah so you should have just about

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.209 
here yeah so you should have just about
like<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.899> right<00:01:55.259> amount<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.649> time<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.130> get

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
like the right amount of time to get

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.240 
like the right amount of time to get
over<00:01:56.280> there

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
over there

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.430 
over there
and<00:01:59.800> yeah<00:02:00.800> just<00:02:01.340> avoid<00:02:01.730> that<00:02:01.760> guy<00:02:02.440> because

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
and yeah just avoid that guy because

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.420 
and yeah just avoid that guy because
he's<00:02:03.800> completely<00:02:03.980> unnecessary<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:06.430> despite

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
he's completely unnecessary and despite

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.790 
he's completely unnecessary and despite
the<00:02:07.580> fact<00:02:07.790> that<00:02:07.880> warriors<00:02:08.509> jumping<00:02:09.020> is<00:02:09.259> pretty

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
the fact that warriors jumping is pretty

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.980 
the fact that warriors jumping is pretty
subpar<00:02:10.460> you<00:02:11.030> can<00:02:11.180> still<00:02:11.360> easily<00:02:11.510> make<00:02:11.810> those

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
subpar you can still easily make those

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.440 
subpar you can still easily make those
long<00:02:12.260> jumps<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:13.670> wonder<00:02:14.150> if<00:02:14.240> they<00:02:14.330> actually

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
long jumps I wonder if they actually

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.760 
long jumps I wonder if they actually
shortened<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.170> from<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.530> original<00:02:16.340> game<00:02:17.770> of

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
shortened it from the original game of

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.050 
shortened it from the original game of
course<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.070> don't<00:02:19.160> know<00:02:19.280> how<00:02:19.400> much<00:02:19.550> shorter<00:02:19.910> war

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
course I don't know how much shorter war

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.140 
course I don't know how much shorter war
is<00:02:20.210> long<00:02:20.390> jump<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.780> or<00:02:21.020> if<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.380> at<00:02:21.530> all

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
is long jump is or if it is at all

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.580 
is long jump is or if it is at all
knowing<00:02:23.150> me<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.510> probably<00:02:23.720> isn't<00:02:24.140> but

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
knowing me it probably isn't but

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.380 
knowing me it probably isn't but
probably<00:02:25.250> just<00:02:25.310> imagining<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.940> but<00:02:26.090> anyways

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
probably just imagining that but anyways
