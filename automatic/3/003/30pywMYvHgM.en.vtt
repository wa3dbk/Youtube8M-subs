00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.120 
make soda bread and it releases carbon
dioxide<00:04:02.370> makes<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.090> little<00:04:03.210> bubbles<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:04.500> so

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
dioxide makes it little bubbles and so

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.840 
dioxide makes it little bubbles and so
this<00:04:05.610> is<00:04:06.710> so<00:04:07.710> to<00:04:07.770> kind<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.130> wrap<00:04:08.310> everything<00:04:08.610> up

the reason that they're so strange here

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.700 
the reason that they're so strange here
is<00:04:58.640> because<00:04:59.180> they<00:04:59.480> have<00:04:59.690> different<00:05:00.050> flavors<00:05:00.170> I

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
is because they have different flavors I

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.760 
is because they have different flavors I
haven't<00:05:01.220> seen<00:05:01.460> grape<00:05:01.790> to<00:05:02.270> speak<00:05:02.540> of<00:05:02.720> but<00:05:03.500> I

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.000 
believe and yep in Dublin and it's way
better<00:05:58.790> than<00:05:59.030> American<00:05:59.420> chocolate<00:05:59.840> I'm<00:06:00.680> not

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
better than American chocolate I'm not

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.420 
better than American chocolate I'm not
sure<00:06:01.280> what<00:06:01.520> Hershey's<00:06:01.940> is<00:06:01.970> doing<00:06:03.190> but<00:06:04.190> it's

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
sure what Hershey's is doing but it's

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.550 
sure what Hershey's is doing but it's
definitely<00:06:04.820> not<00:06:05.180> making<00:06:05.690> chocolate<00:06:06.140> whatever

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
definitely not making chocolate whatever

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.650 
definitely not making chocolate whatever
it<00:06:06.860> is<00:06:07.390> and<00:06:08.390> I<00:06:08.930> guess<00:06:09.620> that's<00:06:10.180> pretty<00:06:11.180> much<00:06:11.330> it

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
it is and I guess that's pretty much it

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.240 
it is and I guess that's pretty much it
other<00:06:11.990> than<00:06:12.140> some<00:06:12.350> of<00:06:12.440> the<00:06:12.530> strange<00:06:12.920> things

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
other than some of the strange things

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.130 
other than some of the strange things
that<00:06:13.430> I've<00:06:13.550> heard<00:06:13.790> a<00:06:14.000> few<00:06:14.090> people<00:06:14.870> have<00:06:15.110> been

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
that I've heard a few people have been

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.020 
that I've heard a few people have been
correcting<00:06:15.830> me<00:06:15.980> on<00:06:16.010> the<00:06:16.310> things<00:06:16.520> that<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.730> use

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
correcting me on the things that I use

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.820 
correcting me on the things that I use
like<00:06:17.060> I<00:06:17.420> you<00:06:17.540> don't<00:06:17.870> order<00:06:18.110> fish<00:06:18.410> and<00:06:18.590> fries

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
like I you don't order fish and fries

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.810 
like I you don't order fish and fries
you<00:06:19.100> order<00:06:19.310> fish<00:06:19.490> and<00:06:19.700> chips<00:06:21.610> pickles<00:06:22.610> or

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
you order fish and chips pickles or

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.880 
you order fish and chips pickles or
gherkins<00:06:23.240> I<00:06:23.690> don't<00:06:24.020> know<00:06:24.200> what<00:06:24.350> a<00:06:24.380> gherkin<00:06:24.740> is

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.260 
gherkins I don't know what a gherkin is
but<00:06:25.160> apparently<00:06:25.280> that's<00:06:25.760> what<00:06:26.000> you<00:06:26.060> call<00:06:26.240> a

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
but apparently that's what you call a

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.830 
but apparently that's what you call a
pickle<00:06:26.660> here<00:06:26.900> um<00:06:28.180> what<00:06:29.180> else<00:06:29.210> there's<00:06:29.690> all

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
pickle here um what else there's all

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.660 
pickle here um what else there's all
kinds<00:06:30.170> of<00:06:30.230> just<00:06:30.440> strange<00:06:30.890> little<00:06:31.160> things<00:06:31.460> that

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
kinds of just strange little things that

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.430 
kinds of just strange little things that
I've<00:06:31.760> noticed<00:06:32.150> about<00:06:32.300> the<00:06:32.930> way<00:06:33.080> that<00:06:33.290> they

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
I've noticed about the way that they

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.720 
I've noticed about the way that they
speak<00:06:33.770> in<00:06:33.920> the<00:06:34.010> way<00:06:34.100> that<00:06:34.280> they<00:06:34.400> order<00:06:34.700> food

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730 
speak in the way that they order food

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.180 
speak in the way that they order food
here<00:06:35.240> that<00:06:35.420> is<00:06:35.600> very<00:06:36.110> very<00:06:36.380> surprising<00:06:36.980> but<00:06:37.100> I

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
here that is very very surprising but I

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.040 
here that is very very surprising but I
think<00:06:37.400> you<00:06:37.520> get<00:06:37.700> used<00:06:37.940> to<00:06:38.120> relatively<00:06:38.810> quickly

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
think you get used to relatively quickly

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.460 
think you get used to relatively quickly
so<00:06:39.730> I'll<00:06:40.730> try<00:06:41.090> to<00:06:41.120> send<00:06:41.480> some<00:06:41.630> more<00:06:41.870> tips<00:06:42.140> in

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
so I'll try to send some more tips in

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.100 
so I'll try to send some more tips in
the<00:06:42.530> food<00:06:42.770> business<00:06:43.010> this<00:06:43.430> way<00:06:44.110> unfortunately
