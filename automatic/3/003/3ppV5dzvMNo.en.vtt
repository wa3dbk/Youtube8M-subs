00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
we start working with it we kind of like

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.380 
we start working with it we kind of like
to<00:00:55.620> stretch<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.370> little<00:00:56.670> bit<00:00:56.940> because

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
I'm gonna stretch it just a little bit

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
I'm gonna stretch it just a little bit
so<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.950> work<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> little<00:01:20.610> bit

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
so that I can work with it a little bit

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.060 
so that I can work with it a little bit
okay<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.600> I've<00:01:22.020> laid<00:01:22.229> my<00:01:22.259> design<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
okay and I've laid my design out on the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.340 
okay and I've laid my design out on the
board<00:01:23.280> already<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:25.229> we

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
board already so that we know what we

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.050 
board already so that we know what we
want<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> look<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.430> go<00:01:26.580> around<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
want it to look like as we go around and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.550 
want it to look like as we go around and
again<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.869> simple<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.439> you're

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
again it's so it's simple because you're

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.289 
again it's so it's simple because you're
just<00:01:28.770> repeating<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.369> pattern<00:01:29.640> over<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.150> over

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
just repeating the pattern over and over

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.060 
just repeating the pattern over and over
again<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.780> you're<00:01:30.900> doing<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.619> your<00:01:31.829> wrist

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
again and you're doing it up your wrist

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
again and you're doing it up your wrist
until<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.490> decide<00:01:32.850> how<00:01:33.240> long<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.689> really

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
until you decide how long you really

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.719 
until you decide how long you really
want<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.950> already<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.549> bead

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
want it so you already have your bead

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
want it so you already have your bead
design<00:01:35.909> right<00:01:36.360> out<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.810> right<00:01:37.140> okay<00:01:37.500> but

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
design right out for you right okay but

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.319 
design right out for you right okay but
before<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.880> want<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.150> do

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
before we do that we want to do

before we do that we want to do
something<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.229> don't<00:01:40.530> go

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
something so that they all don't go

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.980 
something so that they all don't go
flying<00:01:40.890> off<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.310> end<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.270> you'll<00:01:42.570> see<00:01:42.840> how

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
really all I'm doing is keeping the hook

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.800

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
on there until it doesn't fly off

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.600 
on there until it doesn't fly off
because<00:02:07.560> we're<00:02:07.799> gonna<00:02:07.890> put<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.160> pretty<00:02:08.429> little

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.430 
because we're gonna put a pretty little
dangle<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> end<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.629> we're<00:02:10.050> gonna<00:02:10.140> fix

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
dangle on the end of it we're gonna fix

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.230 
dangle on the end of it we're gonna fix
that<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.800> make<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.009> pretty<00:02:11.280> okay

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
that and make it pretty okay

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.000 
that and make it pretty okay
and<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:12.990> of<00:02:13.140> course<00:02:13.410> you're<00:02:13.530> gonna<00:02:13.650> start

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and then of course you're gonna start

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.440 
and then of course you're gonna start
with<00:02:14.100> your<00:02:14.160> pattern<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.970> you're<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.300> gonna

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
with your pattern and you're just gonna

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.810 
with your pattern and you're just gonna
start<00:02:15.780> stringing<00:02:16.740> your<00:02:16.980> beads<00:02:17.040> on<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.700> you

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
start stringing your beads on and you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.220 
start stringing your beads on and you
don't<00:02:18.000> need<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.210> needle<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.840> one<00:02:19.080> of

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
don't need a needle in this one of

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.190 
don't need a needle in this one of
course<00:02:19.740> because<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:20.550> already<00:02:21.060> strong<00:02:21.450> which

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
course because it's already strong which

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.830 
course because it's already strong which
is<00:02:22.230> cool<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.130> just<00:02:23.310> start<00:02:23.670> stringing<00:02:24.030> until

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
is cool so we just start stringing until

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.470 
is cool so we just start stringing until
you<00:02:24.930> get<00:02:25.140> as<00:02:25.320> many<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:26.970> want<00:02:27.180> and

you get as many on that you want and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.690 
you get as many on that you want and
when<00:02:27.990> you're<00:02:28.080> finished<00:02:28.410> doing<00:02:28.500> getting<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.610> as

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
when you're finished doing getting it as

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.850 
when you're finished doing getting it as
wide<00:02:30.540> as<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.930> want<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:31.740> even

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
wide as you want you and you can even

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.200 
wide as you want you and you can even
cut<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.460> middle<00:02:32.700> if<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.880> decide

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.720 
cut this in the middle if you decide
that<00:02:33.240> oh<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:34.410> would<00:02:34.650> started<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.220> six<00:02:35.610> or

seven and it's way bigger when the beads

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.490 
seven and it's way bigger when the beads

bracelet<00:04:38.540> I<00:04:38.660> decided<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.260> do<00:04:39.410> this<00:04:39.590> one<00:04:39.800> very

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
bracelet I decided to do this one very

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.810 
bracelet I decided to do this one very
elegant<00:04:40.670> so<00:04:41.360> I<00:04:41.390> made<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.840> very<00:04:42.320> heavy<00:04:42.770> bead<00:04:43.250> now

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
elegant so I made a very heavy bead now

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.430 
elegant so I made a very heavy bead now
you<00:04:43.880> understand<00:04:44.450> that<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:44.720> memory<00:04:45.020> wire<00:04:45.200> is

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
you understand that the memory wire is

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.710 
you understand that the memory wire is
kind<00:04:45.740> of<00:04:45.830> tight<00:04:46.130> but<00:04:46.370> if<00:04:46.970> it's<00:04:47.210> heavy<00:04:47.450> it's

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
kind of tight but if it's heavy it's

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.300 
kind of tight but if it's heavy it's
gonna<00:04:47.870> bring<00:04:48.200> that<00:04:48.380> down<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:48.800> knot<00:04:48.950> which<00:04:49.280> is

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
gonna bring that down and knot which is

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.100 
gonna bring that down and knot which is
good<00:04:49.760> because<00:04:49.910> that's<00:04:50.270> always<00:04:50.480> my<00:04:50.690> concern<00:04:51.080> I

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
good because that's always my concern I

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.230 
good because that's always my concern I
think<00:04:51.260> with<00:04:51.650> using<00:04:52.280> it<00:04:52.400> for<00:04:52.760> a<00:04:52.790> necklace

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
think with using it for a necklace

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.580 
think with using it for a necklace
because<00:04:53.480> you<00:04:53.600> think<00:04:53.810> it's<00:04:53.930> gonna<00:04:54.050> just<00:04:54.320> choke

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
because you think it's gonna just choke

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.500 
because you think it's gonna just choke
you<00:04:54.770> right<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.400> it<00:04:55.520> won't<00:04:55.760> if<00:04:56.150> we<00:04:56.300> were<00:04:56.390> gonna

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
you right and it won't if we were gonna

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.240 
you right and it won't if we were gonna
work<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:56.990> band<00:04:57.200> that's<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.500> good<00:04:57.650> tip<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:57.920> use

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
work the band that's a good tip to use

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.250 
work the band that's a good tip to use
maybe<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.550> heavier<00:04:58.910> vite<00:04:59.120> talked<00:04:59.900> about<00:05:00.140> the

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
maybe a heavier vite talked about the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.780 
maybe a heavier vite talked about the
center<00:05:00.620> how<00:05:00.740> did<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:01.010> do<00:05:01.130> that<00:05:01.160> one<00:05:01.490> is<00:05:01.640> that<00:05:01.760> a

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
center how did you do that one is that a

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.610 
center how did you do that one is that a
little<00:05:02.030> different<00:05:02.420> it<00:05:02.600> is<00:05:02.630> because<00:05:03.260> we<00:05:03.410> had

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
little different it is because we had

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.650 
little different it is because we had
this<00:05:03.830> one<00:05:04.040> the<00:05:04.370> bracelet<00:05:04.850> laid<00:05:05.030> out<00:05:05.180> where<00:05:05.540> we

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
this one the bracelet laid out where we

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.570 
this one the bracelet laid out where we
went<00:05:06.110> from<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.380> end<00:05:06.530> out<00:05:06.830> because<00:05:07.400> we're

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
went from the end out because we're

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.340 
went from the end out because we're
starting<00:05:07.820> in<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.120> middle<00:05:08.480> I<00:05:08.660> actually<00:05:09.020> just

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
starting in the middle I actually just

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.530 
starting in the middle I actually just
took<00:05:09.560> tape<00:05:09.860> after<00:05:10.790> I<00:05:10.820> got<00:05:10.970> might<00:05:11.180> be<00:05:11.300> in<00:05:11.450> the

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
took tape after I got might be in the

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.540 
took tape after I got might be in the
center<00:05:11.900> my<00:05:12.050> life<00:05:12.260> should<00:05:12.410> be<00:05:12.470> didn't<00:05:12.680> tape<00:05:13.340> the

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
center my life should be didn't tape the

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.120 
center my life should be didn't tape the
other<00:05:13.730> end<00:05:14.060> made<00:05:14.660> my<00:05:14.870> pattern<00:05:15.380> uh-huh<00:05:15.830> and

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
other end made my pattern uh-huh and

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.440 
other end made my pattern uh-huh and
then<00:05:16.310> I<00:05:16.430> did<00:05:16.580> a<00:05:16.610> mirror<00:05:16.850> image<00:05:17.180> on<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.420> other

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
then I did a mirror image on the other

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.170 
then I did a mirror image on the other
side<00:05:17.810> so<00:05:18.590> once<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:18.950> was<00:05:18.980> hit<00:05:19.280> satisfied<00:05:19.820> with<00:05:20.030> it

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
side so once I was hit satisfied with it

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.970 
side so once I was hit satisfied with it
you<00:05:20.810> don't<00:05:20.990> want<00:05:21.140> to<00:05:21.230> try<00:05:21.410> to<00:05:21.470> string<00:05:21.770> from

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
you don't want to try to string from

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.500 
you don't want to try to string from
both<00:05:22.130> ends<00:05:22.400> because<00:05:22.760> you<00:05:22.850> would<00:05:22.970> get<00:05:23.120> lost<00:05:23.300> in

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
both ends because you would get lost in

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.640 
both ends because you would get lost in
right<00:05:23.690> if<00:05:23.780> you<00:05:23.870> didn't<00:05:24.110> like<00:05:24.230> it<00:05:24.260> it<00:05:24.470> wouldn't

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
right if you didn't like it it wouldn't

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.170 
right if you didn't like it it wouldn't
you<00:05:24.770> would<00:05:24.860> have<00:05:24.980> to<00:05:25.070> do<00:05:25.160> it<00:05:25.280> over<00:05:25.460> again<00:05:25.490> right

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
you would have to do it over again right

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.910 
you would have to do it over again right
so<00:05:26.570> that's<00:05:26.780> a<00:05:26.900> good<00:05:27.020> tip<00:05:27.230> yeah<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.710> then<00:05:27.830> you

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
so that's a good tip yeah and then you

complete set right to justice and it

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.570 
complete set right to justice and it
wasn't<00:05:32.930> very<00:05:33.200> difficult<00:05:33.380> at<00:05:33.770> all<00:05:33.860> right<00:05:34.160> and

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
wasn't very difficult at all right and

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.310 
wasn't very difficult at all right and
look<00:05:34.820> at<00:05:34.940> that<00:05:35.030> gorgeous<00:05:35.270> turquoise<00:05:35.600> necklace

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
look at that gorgeous turquoise necklace

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.170 
look at that gorgeous turquoise necklace
now<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.830> turquoise<00:05:37.220> one<00:05:37.490> is<00:05:37.670> a<00:05:37.700> little<00:05:38.060> bit

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
now the turquoise one is a little bit

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.700 
now the turquoise one is a little bit
different<00:05:38.540> and<00:05:38.600> the<00:05:38.720> reason<00:05:38.840> I<00:05:39.110> showed<00:05:39.380> it<00:05:39.560> to

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
different and the reason I showed it to

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.350 
different and the reason I showed it to
you<00:05:39.860> is<00:05:39.950> because<00:05:40.310> most<00:05:40.520> people<00:05:40.910> think<00:05:41.150> in

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
you is because most people think in

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.270 
you is because most people think in
memory<00:05:41.660> where<00:05:41.840> you<00:05:42.200> have<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:42.620> keep<00:05:42.800> the<00:05:42.950> coils

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
memory where you have to keep the coils

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.380 
memory where you have to keep the coils
going<00:05:43.550> around<00:05:43.820> and<00:05:44.000> round

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
going around and round

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.480 
going around and round
you<00:05:44.780> really<00:05:45.080> don't<00:05:45.260> if<00:05:45.560> you'll<00:05:45.710> see<00:05:45.980> that<00:05:46.310> is

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
you really don't if you'll see that is

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.240 
you really don't if you'll see that is
that's<00:05:46.820> why<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:47.060> clasp<00:05:47.510> is<00:05:47.810> showing<00:05:48.250> we've

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
that's why the clasp is showing we've

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.910 
that's why the clasp is showing we've
used<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:49.970> turquoise<00:05:50.420> and<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:51.350> spacer<00:05:51.710> bars

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
used the turquoise and the spacer bars

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.490 
used the turquoise and the spacer bars
there<00:05:52.250> but<00:05:52.880> we've<00:05:53.210> clipped<00:05:53.480> the<00:05:53.690> memory<00:05:54.320> wire

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
there but we've clipped the memory wire

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.100 
there but we've clipped the memory wire
and<00:05:54.830> added<00:05:55.370> a<00:05:55.460> separate<00:05:56.180> wire<00:05:56.390> you<00:05:56.660> separate

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
and added a separate wire you separate

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.290 
and added a separate wire you separate
strands<00:05:57.470> and<00:05:57.770> it<00:05:58.070> but<00:05:58.340> what<00:05:58.640> it<00:05:58.760> does<00:05:58.940> is<00:05:59.150> it

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
strands and it but what it does is it

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.390 
strands and it but what it does is it
keeps<00:05:59.510> its<00:05:59.690> shape<00:05:59.720> mm-hmm<00:06:00.770> which<00:06:01.040> is<00:06:01.220> really

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
keeps its shape mm-hmm which is really

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.850 
keeps its shape mm-hmm which is really
nice<00:06:01.700> that's<00:06:01.940> what<00:06:02.210> the<00:06:02.360> memory<00:06:02.690> does<00:06:02.870> is

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
nice that's what the memory does is

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.930 
nice that's what the memory does is
because<00:06:04.220> you<00:06:04.310> would<00:06:04.400> think<00:06:04.430> of<00:06:04.640> that<00:06:04.700> was<00:06:04.910> a

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
because you would think of that was a

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.180 
because you would think of that was a
different<00:06:05.270> right<00:06:05.630> exactly<00:06:06.290> and<00:06:06.500> what<00:06:07.040> about

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
different right exactly and what about

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.040 
different right exactly and what about
the<00:06:07.310> bracelet<00:06:07.700> the<00:06:08.150> bracelets<00:06:08.630> I<00:06:08.720> think<00:06:08.930> are

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
the bracelet the bracelets I think are

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.600 
the bracelet the bracelets I think are
just<00:06:09.290> fun<00:06:09.440> I<00:06:09.470> wanted<00:06:09.860> you<00:06:09.980> to<00:06:10.130> see<00:06:10.460> them

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
just fun I wanted you to see them

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.340 
just fun I wanted you to see them
because<00:06:10.910> that's<00:06:11.120> usually<00:06:11.360> what<00:06:11.690> people<00:06:11.990> start

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
because that's usually what people start

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.510 
because that's usually what people start
with<00:06:12.530> huh

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
with huh

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.520 
with huh
the<00:06:13.760> very<00:06:13.940> first<00:06:14.270> one<00:06:14.540> believe<00:06:14.960> it<00:06:15.080> or<00:06:15.200> not<00:06:15.290> was

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
the very first one believe it or not was

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.230 
the very first one believe it or not was
a<00:06:15.560> necklace<00:06:16.070> that<00:06:16.280> I<00:06:16.310> found<00:06:16.550> in<00:06:16.700> a<00:06:16.790> garage<00:06:16.970> sale

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
a necklace that I found in a garage sale

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.090 
a necklace that I found in a garage sale
that<00:06:17.630> I<00:06:17.660> just<00:06:17.930> cut<00:06:18.200> apart<00:06:18.500> and<00:06:18.710> they're<00:06:18.860> very

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
that I just cut apart and they're very

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.730 
that I just cut apart and they're very
heavy<00:06:19.520> so<00:06:20.450> you<00:06:20.690> can't<00:06:20.960> use<00:06:21.170> nothing<00:06:21.560> out<00:06:21.710> of

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
heavy so you can't use nothing out of

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.540 
heavy so you can't use nothing out of
every<00:06:22.130> yeah

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
every yeah

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.550 
every yeah
and<00:06:22.760> you<00:06:22.880> can't<00:06:23.120> use<00:06:23.360> them<00:06:23.540> all<00:06:23.690> the<00:06:23.810> time<00:06:23.990> on

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
and you can't use them all the time on

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.200 
and you can't use them all the time on
threads<00:06:25.040> because<00:06:25.250> it<00:06:25.520> is<00:06:25.640> too<00:06:25.850> heavy<00:06:26.030> they're

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
threads because it is too heavy they're

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.850

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
can because the memory wire is very

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.240 
can because the memory wire is very
strong<00:06:29.630> right<00:06:29.900> and<00:06:30.200> the<00:06:30.710> one<00:06:30.860> in<00:06:30.950> the<00:06:30.980> center
