one shot which ties with all three are

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.500 
one shot which ties with all three are
the<00:03:06.709> other<00:03:06.860> two<00:03:06.950> teams<00:03:07.310> that<00:03:07.519> did<00:03:07.790> this<00:03:07.970> map<00:03:08.209> so

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
the other two teams that did this map so

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.580 
the other two teams that did this map so
what<00:03:08.720> we're<00:03:08.840> gonna<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.230> do<00:03:09.379> is<00:03:09.560> a

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
what we're gonna have to do is a

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.580 
what we're gonna have to do is a
tiebreaker<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.849> how<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.989> going<00:03:12.079> to<00:03:12.379> work

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
tiebreaker and how that is going to work

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.500 
tiebreaker and how that is going to work
is<00:03:12.829> we're<00:03:13.099> gonna<00:03:13.190> get<00:03:13.340> two<00:03:13.670> players<00:03:14.000> from<00:03:14.269> each

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
is we're gonna get two players from each

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.940 
is we're gonna get two players from each
team<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:14.900> i<00:03:14.959> believe<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.350> first<00:03:15.530> team<00:03:15.769> that

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
team so i believe the first team that

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.309 
team so i believe the first team that
did<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.190> on<00:03:16.280> this<00:03:16.430> map<00:03:16.639> was<00:03:16.819> faith<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.450> then<00:03:18.139> it

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
did it on this map was faith and then it

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.289 
did it on this map was faith and then it
was<00:03:18.560> x<00:03:18.889> JM<00:03:19.160> x<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.489> then<00:03:19.579> it<00:03:19.670> was<00:03:19.760> flaw<00:03:20.030> so<00:03:20.209> we're

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
was x JM x and then it was flaw so we're

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.819 
was x JM x and then it was flaw so we're
gonna<00:03:20.389> have<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.569> get<00:03:20.660> two<00:03:20.989> players<00:03:21.319> from<00:03:21.590> each

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
gonna have to get two players from each

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.340 
gonna have to get two players from each
of<00:03:22.069> these<00:03:22.340> teams<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.120> they<00:03:23.810> are<00:03:23.989> going<00:03:24.230> to

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
of these teams and they are going to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.319 
of these teams and they are going to
face<00:03:24.560> off<00:03:24.859> in<00:03:25.069> a<00:03:25.160> sudden<00:03:25.430> death<00:03:25.579> sort<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.269> a

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
face off in a sudden death sort of a

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.240 
face off in a sudden death sort of a
thing<00:03:26.359> and<00:03:26.870> i<00:03:27.260> believe<00:03:27.319> how<00:03:27.769> I'm<00:03:27.859> gonna<00:03:27.980> do<00:03:28.130> the

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
thing and i believe how I'm gonna do the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.729 
thing and i believe how I'm gonna do the
tiebreaker<00:03:28.730> is<00:03:29.139> two<00:03:30.139> players<00:03:30.380> are<00:03:30.530> gonna<00:03:30.650> play

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
tiebreaker is two players are gonna play

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.430 
tiebreaker is two players are gonna play
when<00:03:31.130> one<00:03:31.340> player<00:03:31.489> hits<00:03:31.849> a<00:03:31.970> shot<00:03:32.269> then<00:03:33.109> that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
when one player hits a shot then that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.110 
when one player hits a shot then that
player<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:33.769> out<00:03:34.099> and<00:03:34.310> it's<00:03:34.519> down<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:34.849> one

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
player is out and it's down to one

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.000 
player is out and it's down to one
player<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.630> hit<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.780> shot<00:03:35.989> so<00:03:36.139> once<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.470> first

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
player to hit a shot so once the first

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.520 
player to hit a shot so once the first
sort<00:03:37.400> of<00:03:37.489> like<00:03:37.579> my<00:03:37.700> other<00:03:37.819> series<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:38.359> I<00:03:38.389> do

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530

sort of like my other series that I do
is<00:03:39.530> sort<00:03:39.769> of<00:03:39.829> how<00:03:39.980> I'm<00:03:40.040> gonna<00:03:40.160> do<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
is sort of how I'm gonna do the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.849 
is sort of how I'm gonna do the
