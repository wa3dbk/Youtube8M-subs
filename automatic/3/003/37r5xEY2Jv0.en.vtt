00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.799
 Peter you already indicated prior to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.700
 this match that you and of course 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.260
 would like to become third 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.660
 ultimately you can go for that 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.820
 Dependent on others you become fact 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.089
 yes how do you like that feeling 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.089
 rub you 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.220
 Well, of course we knew we were from 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.990
 were indeed dependent on others 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.039
 to the ornamental with her move that then win 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.420
 it is a pity that there is no win 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.490
 because there was still 4th 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.440
 so stepped 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.850
 that is not a natural order here 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.890
 for third place 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.989
 yes you were independent of from today 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.170
 others and wishes if I am not enough 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.030
 been alone try there left a lot 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.610
 you can almost get more babies line 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.400
 This can go on that course had 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.920
 we are concerned that we now go solution and 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.800
 Start if you press 0 so we are satisfied 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.820
 we cannot yet be of course 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.230
 along the side 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.269
 calls wisecracking we saw that 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.580
 always been ahead of 2 0 after 5 minutes 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.230
 and you knew that too 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.780
 well i hear that they are in peace 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.320
 before it knew it was already concerned 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.690
 I did not get that so yes I hear 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.860
 against rest and it matter what I am after 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.180
 the match 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.820
 but otherwise it was not that we each 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.110
 get an update on the bank based once 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.020
 from the first half first half an hour then 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.330
 do you think of 2 0f doing vitesse in each 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.470
 what they should do and offer 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.990
 thenels also did not play well then 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.659
 don't actually see the whole match 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.130
 two and two chances also got good ones 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.810
 moments of bertram especially the second 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.920
 in which it scores 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.420
 and then you stand in front of my you give it that way 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.679
 colorful way just before rest in two 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.119
 minutes time 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.859
 yes that is of course a good team 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.750
 never happened and it happened to me 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.240
 us and of course what behind the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.079
 facts and that actually have not 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.390
 know how to convert 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.450
 maybe a little too easy 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.219
 more will come out of dough again 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.869
 some more with people walking from it 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.579
 midfield play 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.539
 and actually have twice there whole 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.399
 much trouble with that 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.289
 make them use treckels for that 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.520
 maybe they had too 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.200
 two dangerous things had been black 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.819
 even the stop is not possible 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.479
 he falls completely out of the blue 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.350
 themselves for the rest 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.299
 just before the break the weena stands for 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.640
 of course you can do it yourself 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.140
 We started charging the second half 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.250
 again not good at the lessons again not 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.470
 really in control of the competition 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.850
 After the switch I found that we did 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.780
 get a handle that we then reported it 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.520
 in your hands 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.780
 without opening it up to very large 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.459
 can lead them 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.810
 He would be a good team that happens now 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.640
 those two two but it is also not des 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.650
 vitesse this season something like that 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.900
 no that's true but today we were 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.100
 so not that good team and 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.780
 other competitions have shown that 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.580
 we think that it is a very good team 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.350
 that is not the case today 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.600
 the playoffs that start upcoming 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.550
 Thursday with a match against pec 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.980
 what do you think of takes then you still had 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.420
 preference does not matter at all no that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.950
 it doesn't matter if you want those play-offs 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.530
 and we want that then you have to 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.180
 so any opponent can win 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.790
 goes against us we start going 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.440
 actually no no preference we knew 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.920
 it still went different ways and could 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.800
 We have preferences and preferences 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.620
 this had to be or from ourselves 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.569
 click sounds a little embarrassed to have 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.030
 but you have to get rid of yourself 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.670
 have to go and lately quite 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.830
 good series put down and leave today 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.040
 than the incident, it's a little less 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.610
 but I think if we had the 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.890
 the club would enter as the last time 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.630
 and have played then 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.630
 then we will continue that from round
