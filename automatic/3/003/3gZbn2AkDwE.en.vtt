makes<00:03:15.130> sense<00:03:15.340> then<00:03:15.700> once<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.120> get<00:03:16.300> out<00:03:16.330> of

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
makes sense then once I get out of

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.600 
makes sense then once I get out of
shower<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.140> I'm<00:03:17.230> all<00:03:17.440> done<00:03:17.680> at<00:03:17.920> removing<00:03:18.220> my

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
dead skin cells I'll dry myself off and

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.479 
dead skin cells I'll dry myself off and

it's<00:03:43.870> kind<00:03:44.140> of<00:03:44.230> clung<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.800> my<00:03:44.890> knuckles<00:03:45.340> which

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
it's kind of clung to my knuckles which

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.760 
it's kind of clung to my knuckles which
I'm<00:03:46.209> still<00:03:46.480> figure<00:03:46.870> out<00:03:46.989> how<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.200> get<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.739> to

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
I'm still figure out how to get it to

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.500 
I'm still figure out how to get it to
not<00:03:48.070> do<00:03:48.250> that<00:03:48.459> but<00:03:48.730> it's<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:48.970> lot<00:03:49.120> better<00:03:49.270> than

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
not do that but it's a lot better than

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.570 
not do that but it's a lot better than
what<00:03:49.600> it<00:03:49.720> used<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:50.080> be<00:03:50.110> then<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.739> like<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.280> sit

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
what it used to be then I like to sit

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.490 
what it used to be then I like to sit
for<00:03:51.610> a<00:03:51.850> good<00:03:52.030> hour<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:52.690> make<00:03:52.930> sure<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:53.380> that

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
for a good hour and make sure that that

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.050 
for a good hour and make sure that that
moisturizer<00:03:53.980> has<00:03:54.250> settled<00:03:54.580> in<00:03:54.880> and

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
moisturizer has settled in and

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.729 
moisturizer has settled in and
especially<00:03:55.570> after<00:03:55.870> being<00:03:56.110> in<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.260> hot<00:03:56.470> shower

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
especially after being in a hot shower

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.530 
especially after being in a hot shower
and<00:03:57.130> exfoliating<00:03:57.820> your<00:03:57.850> pores<00:03:58.180> are<00:03:58.360> going<00:03:58.480> to

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
and exfoliating your pores are going to

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.390 
and exfoliating your pores are going to
be<00:03:58.630> wide<00:03:59.020> opening<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.800> not<00:03:59.980> want<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.160> 10

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
be wide opening you not want to 10

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.100 
be wide opening you not want to 10
because<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.120> 10<00:04:01.360> is<00:04:01.450> going<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.660> settle<00:04:01.900> inside

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
because a 10 is going to settle inside

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.750 
because a 10 is going to settle inside
those<00:04:02.470> paws<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:02.950> even<00:04:03.130> have<00:04:03.280> dots<00:04:03.550> all<00:04:03.730> over

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
those paws and even have dots all over

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.630 
those paws and even have dots all over
you<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.390> it's<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:04.720> not<00:04:04.930> pretty<00:04:05.640> typically

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
you and it's just not pretty typically

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.790 
you and it's just not pretty typically
when<00:04:06.820> you're<00:04:07.030> tanning<00:04:07.360> you<00:04:07.720> want<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.170> probably

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
when you're tanning you want to probably

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.520 
when you're tanning you want to probably
do<00:04:09.100> one<00:04:09.580> pub<00:04:10.000> for<00:04:10.330> each<00:04:10.450> section<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:11.200> feel<00:04:11.410> like

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
do one pub for each section I feel like

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.560 
do one pub for each section I feel like
that's<00:04:11.680> probably<00:04:12.010> enough<00:04:12.340> so<00:04:12.910> like<00:04:13.090> one<00:04:13.269> pump

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
that's probably enough so like one pump

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.110 
that's probably enough so like one pump
from<00:04:13.810> here<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.350> here<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:14.890> here<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.610> here<00:04:15.850> and

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
from here to here and here to here and

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.940 
from here to here and here to here and
just<00:04:16.390> doing<00:04:16.600> like<00:04:16.780> section<00:04:17.230> by<00:04:17.350> section<00:04:17.380> you

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
just doing like section by section you

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.830 
just doing like section by section you
do<00:04:18.039> not<00:04:18.160> want<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.400> do<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.520> lot<00:04:18.820> because<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.660> feel

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
do not want to do a lot because it feel

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.719 
do not want to do a lot because it feel
like<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.289> does<00:04:20.470> settle<00:04:20.919> and<00:04:21.100> dry<00:04:21.370> quite

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
like it does settle and dry quite

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:22.320 
like it does settle and dry quite
quickly

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
quickly

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.420 
quickly
fun<00:04:22.449> so<00:04:23.050> just<00:04:23.229> doing<00:04:23.439> section<00:04:23.830> by<00:04:23.949> section<00:04:23.979> is

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
fun so just doing section by section is

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.460 
fun so just doing section by section is
going<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.669> make<00:04:24.819> sure<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.509> doesn't<00:04:25.930> dry

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
going to make sure that it doesn't dry

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.559 
going to make sure that it doesn't dry
and<00:04:26.710> you're<00:04:26.830> left<00:04:27.039> with<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:27.909> know<00:04:27.939> patches

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
and you're left with you know patches

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.689 
and you're left with you know patches
everywhere<00:04:28.689> so<00:04:29.379> I<00:04:29.409> doing<00:04:29.830> use<00:04:30.039> this<00:04:30.220> tan<00:04:30.490> on<00:04:30.669> my

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
everywhere so I doing use this tan on my

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.820 
everywhere so I doing use this tan on my
face<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.360> does<00:04:31.509> not<00:04:31.750> break<00:04:31.930> me<00:04:32.199> out<00:04:32.229> at<00:04:32.620> all

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
face it does not break me out at all

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.950 
face it does not break me out at all
doesn't<00:04:33.639> make<00:04:33.729> my<00:04:33.939> makeup<00:04:34.300> look<00:04:34.479> really<00:04:34.780> gross

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
doesn't make my makeup look really gross

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.929 
doesn't make my makeup look really gross
or<00:04:35.199> anything<00:04:35.319> like<00:04:35.590> that<00:04:35.740> so<00:04:36.159> I<00:04:36.219> do<00:04:36.280> find<00:04:36.669> it<00:04:36.789> is

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939 
or anything like that so I do find it is

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.450 
or anything like that so I do find it is
quite<00:04:37.240> safe<00:04:37.509> to<00:04:38.259> use<00:04:38.289> on<00:04:38.530> your<00:04:38.800> face<00:04:39.069> and<00:04:39.370> with

quite safe to use on your face and with

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.490 
quite safe to use on your face and with
this<00:04:39.580> 10<00:04:39.909> I<00:04:39.939> do<00:04:40.120> feel<00:04:40.479> like<00:04:40.599> the<00:04:40.780> technique<00:04:41.319> is

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
this 10 I do feel like the technique is

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.589 
this 10 I do feel like the technique is
to<00:04:41.590> rub<00:04:42.189> it<00:04:42.310> in<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.729> then<00:04:42.819> go<00:04:43.090> in<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.389> like

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
to rub it in and then go in and like

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.080 
to rub it in and then go in and like
push<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.139> and<00:04:44.409> kind<00:04:44.889> of<00:04:44.949> Pat<00:04:45.129> it<00:04:45.250> down<00:04:45.490> and
