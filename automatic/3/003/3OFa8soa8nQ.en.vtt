00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
mistake so the cake will bake a little

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.240 
mistake so the cake will bake a little
bit<00:03:38.700> more<00:03:38.910> too<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:39.630> when<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:39.989> first<00:03:40.290> pull<00:03:41.130> it

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
bit more too so when you first pull it

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.190 
bit more too so when you first pull it
out<00:03:41.370> let<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.700> cool<00:03:41.790> off<00:03:41.970> kind<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.750> let<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:42.989> alone

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
out let it cool off kind of let it alone

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.990 
out let it cool off kind of let it alone
for<00:03:43.739> about<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.070> first<00:03:44.280> five<00:03:44.579> or<00:03:44.640> six<00:03:44.790> minutes

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
for about the first five or six minutes

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.210 
for about the first five or six minutes
it's<00:03:45.450> going<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.660> continue<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.170> bake<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.860> then

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
it's going to continue to bake and then

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.340 
it's going to continue to bake and then
eventually<00:03:47.910> what<00:03:48.239> we'll<00:03:48.390> do<00:03:48.570> is<00:03:48.870> we'll<00:03:49.019> get<00:03:49.230> it

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
eventually what we'll do is we'll get it

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.620 
eventually what we'll do is we'll get it
out<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:49.769> pan<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:50.400> put<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.269> like<00:03:51.450> on<00:03:51.600> a

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
out of this pan and put it like on a

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.449 
out of this pan and put it like on a
rack<00:03:51.870> or<00:03:51.900> something<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.440> cool<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:53.070> this<00:03:53.190> case

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
rack or something to cool in this case

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.620 
rack or something to cool in this case
I'm<00:03:53.640> gonna<00:03:53.730> probably<00:03:53.880> just<00:03:54.060> leave<00:03:54.329> it<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.570> the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
I'm gonna probably just leave it in the

falling<00:04:29.400> apart<00:04:30.860> let's<00:04:31.860> give<00:04:32.070> this<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.280> taste

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.440 

hmm<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:37.080> tastes<00:04:37.350> good<00:04:38.030> it's<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.150> little<00:04:39.360> bit

curbing the texture is not cakey oh I
didn't<00:04:42.990> ice<00:04:43.110> this<00:04:43.320> because<00:04:43.590> I<00:04:43.650> normally<00:04:43.710> don't

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
didn't ice this because I normally don't

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.500 
didn't ice this because I normally don't

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
like that and then just add some Nutella

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.590 
like that and then just add some Nutella
where<00:04:48.360> necessary<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:50.220> can<00:04:50.250> take<00:04:50.520> anything<00:04:50.850> to

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
where necessary you can take anything to

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.150 
where necessary you can take anything to
put<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.870> jello<00:04:52.110> on<00:04:52.290> it<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.650> then<00:04:52.920> it<00:04:53.010> tastes

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
put the jello on it and then it tastes

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.660 
put the jello on it and then it tastes
better<00:04:53.570> so<00:04:55.430> there<00:04:56.430> might<00:04:56.550> have<00:04:56.580> been

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
better so there might have been

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.540 
better so there might have been
something<00:04:56.910> funky<00:04:57.360> going<00:04:57.570> with<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.780> recipe

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550

one<00:04:59.550> thing<00:04:59.700> about<00:04:59.730> bacon<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.720> got<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:00.990> try<00:05:01.140> it

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
one thing about bacon you got to try it

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.040 
one thing about bacon you got to try it
more<00:05:01.410> than<00:05:01.560> once<00:05:01.770> because<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.760> humidity

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
more than once because the humidity

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.180 
more than once because the humidity
temperature<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.200> day<00:05:04.380> a<00:05:04.620> lot<00:05:05.070> of

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
temperature of the day a lot of

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.790 
temperature of the day a lot of
different<00:05:05.460> factors<00:05:05.810> also<00:05:06.810> this<00:05:07.200> time<00:05:07.410> I<00:05:07.590> did

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
different factors also this time I did

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.580 
different factors also this time I did
use<00:05:08.480> Betty<00:05:09.480> Crocker<00:05:09.780> rather<00:05:10.080> than<00:05:10.290> Duncan
