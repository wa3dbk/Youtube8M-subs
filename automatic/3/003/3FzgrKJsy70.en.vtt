00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.240
 miner is afraid they named him because he was found in an area 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.380
 where mines abound is only a year and a half and a few weeks ago the 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.120
 The performance of some residents of calatrava argamasilla was decisive 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.820
 to save this podenco dog's life 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.990
 It's hard to imagine how someone can do something like that to an animal 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.769
 miner has a very special history 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.800
 they read it we find 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.529
 in calatrava argamasilla and thanks to some neighbors 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.800
 from the world of when 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.529
 everything was out there was going when we can be thriller calatrava whose shattered 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.610
 with an incrustrated rope in pto 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.410
 and logically they were all the symptoms 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.100

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.560

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.300
 the woman broke the rope does not know presents all the signs of having 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.850
 tried to hang but managed to escape 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.100
 unfortunately there are many hunting dogs that suffer this situation after 20 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.650
 days roaming and several operations now is already recovered and looking for home 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.280
 if type of animals that used for hunting in particular the breed podenco 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.239
 and all work is not generally used for home 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.619
 when they do not serve as am problems, there are some undesirables that 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:09.650
 misfortune 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.120
 they are hanged 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.130
 is the case of the miner who luckily was well highlight the family and is 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.950
 here with us in the social center 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.650
 well delighted eaten all well but fully recovered and wanting the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.460
 NATO 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.610
 so you already know in the shelter and more than 200 dogs as a miner 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.770
 each with its own history of neglect abuse but is that despite 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.350
 everything wants to give us a second chance 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.030
 this family was the first to notice the presence of miners 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.650
 I had been wandering in this wasteland outside of Argamasilla for 20 days 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.750
 of calatrava 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.140
 he was very scared and at first they could only feed him the same is a 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.830
 day of railing for equipment is set was the animal and the 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.700
 your 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 i antia penal tc we started to lose him eating 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.040
 I realized that he was wearing something on his neck after seeing that he was wearing a 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.229
 cordon wounding in the neck the second objective that was marked was to capture it 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.860
 It was not an easy task for this worker who also contributed to his diet 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.190
 he tried in vain trying to devote himself to breaking was a little 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.539
 17 because I had 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.679
 because that moment the man tried a character he ran away 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.569
 and river tag behind him being beaten 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.420
 roger but stir a day may already be the flour catching confidence enters enters 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.159

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.300
 we tied more outside when it was already inside pulling strong remained buried 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.479
 in the yard it is given to the shelter and 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.830
 and they took him 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.240
 it was as well as mining it undertook its way towards the refuge 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.330
 now they assure that they miss him but all are satisfied by 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.260
