it's<00:03:46.900> actually<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.920> small<00:03:48.430> one<00:03:48.610> which<00:03:48.790> i

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
it's actually a small one which i

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.280 
it's actually a small one which i
thought<00:03:49.120> was<00:03:49.269> pretty<00:03:49.420> cool<00:03:49.570> when<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.900> first<00:03:49.930> saw

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
thought was pretty cool when I first saw

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.039 
thought was pretty cool when I first saw
it<00:03:50.320> so<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:52.360> is<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:53.220> seagate<00:03:54.220> goflex<00:03:55.049> satellite

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
it so this is a seagate goflex satellite

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.180 
it so this is a seagate goflex satellite
i'll<00:03:56.620> have<00:03:57.070> a<00:03:57.100> full<00:03:57.640> review<00:03:57.790> i<00:03:58.530> say<00:03:59.530> within<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.920> a
