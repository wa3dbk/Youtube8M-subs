00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
what so guys I mentioned that wasn't

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.690 
what so guys I mentioned that wasn't
really<00:00:10.500> gonna<00:00:10.679> do<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> trailer<00:00:11.340> breakdown

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
really gonna do a trailer breakdown

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.220 
really gonna do a trailer breakdown
because<00:00:12.030> there<00:00:12.210> wasn't<00:00:12.509> really<00:00:12.599> much<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:13.110> go

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
because there wasn't really much to go

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.720 
because there wasn't really much to go
off<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.040> trailer<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.549> thought<00:00:14.700> I

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
off of in the trailer so I thought I

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
what your coming out has become and you

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.100 
what your coming out has become and you
know<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:35.310> were<00:01:35.430> asking<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.509> how

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
know they were asking like you know how

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.590 
know they were asking like you know how
we<00:01:37.170> are<00:01:37.470> coming<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.829> shape<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.520> now<00:01:38.939> my

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
we are coming to shape up to be now my

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990 
we are coming to shape up to be now my
thought<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.320> they're<00:01:40.710> actually<00:01:41.000> taking

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
thought is that they're actually taking

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.440 
thought is that they're actually taking
our<00:01:42.270> feedback<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.939> toys<00:01:45.119> have

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
our feedback in that the toys have

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.740 
our feedback in that the toys have
really<00:01:45.689> matter<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.619> many<00:01:46.799> episodes<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
really matter in not many episodes so

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.240 
really matter in not many episodes so
definitely<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:49.290> should<00:01:49.560> actually<00:01:50.009> actually

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
definitely they should actually actually

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.280 
definitely they should actually actually

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.030 
have a pretty much bad coming time so
hopefully<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.600> have<00:03:37.630> more<00:03:38.170> variations<00:03:38.829> to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
hopefully you have more variations to

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.830 
hopefully you have more variations to
endings<00:03:39.519> which<00:03:39.880> would<00:03:40.090> kind<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.329> be<00:03:40.450> different

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
endings which would kind of be different

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.289 
endings which would kind of be different
because<00:03:41.670> season<00:03:42.670> three<00:03:42.819> is<00:03:42.880> already

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
because season three is already

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.110 
because season three is already
confirmed<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.109> we<00:03:44.350> should<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:45.700> shouldn't

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
confirmed so we should you shouldn't

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.940 
confirmed so we should you shouldn't
definitely<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.989> know<00:03:47.109> bring<00:03:47.410> those<00:03:47.590> choices

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
definitely you know bring those choices

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.670 
definitely you know bring those choices
over<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.819> season<00:03:49.120> three<00:03:49.299> why<00:03:49.930> not<00:03:50.170> have<00:03:50.410> come

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
over the season three why not have come

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.349 
over the season three why not have come
up<00:03:50.799> why<00:03:51.010> have<00:03:51.220> these<00:03:51.519> two<00:03:51.760> seasoned<00:03:52.209> with

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
up why have these two seasoned with

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.020 
up why have these two seasoned with
lemon<00:03:52.480> thyme<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.139> then<00:03:53.859> just<00:03:54.100> throw<00:03:54.370> away<00:03:54.730> the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
lemon thyme and then just throw away the

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.020 
lemon thyme and then just throw away the
two<00:03:55.389> seasons<00:03:55.690> of<00:03:56.079> choices<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.340> then

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
two seasons of choices and then

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.789 
two seasons of choices and then
basically<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:58.959> have<00:03:59.170> season<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.739> start

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
basically you have season you start

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.789 
basically you have season you start
fresh<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.609> basically<00:04:01.389> season<00:04:01.810> two<00:04:02.079> was<00:04:02.560> like

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
fresh and basically season two was like

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.940 
fresh and basically season two was like
you<00:04:03.010> know<00:04:03.190> wasn't<00:04:03.970> really<00:04:04.470> too<00:04:05.470> much<00:04:05.709> so

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
you know wasn't really too much so

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.520 
you know wasn't really too much so
basically<00:04:06.340> if<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.329> season<00:04:07.870> two<00:04:08.079> types<00:04:08.290> could

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
basically if the season two types could

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.470 
basically if the season two types could
actually<00:04:08.709> affect<00:04:09.190> season<00:04:09.549> three<00:04:09.730> that<00:04:10.389> would

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
actually affect season three that would

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.809 
actually affect season three that would
be<00:04:10.540> great<00:04:10.959> to<00:04:11.290> look<00:04:11.440> actually<00:04:11.650> do<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.400> great<00:04:12.609> job
