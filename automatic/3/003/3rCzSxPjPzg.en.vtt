00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
each gear now the clutch pedal is a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.090 
each gear now the clutch pedal is a
pretty<00:01:12.180> scary<00:01:12.299> thought<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:12.840> some<00:01:13.619> people<00:01:13.979> who

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
pretty scary thought for some people who

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.520 
pretty scary thought for some people who
learn<00:01:14.280> how<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.460> drive<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.060> an<00:01:15.240> automatic<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
learn how to drive in an automatic the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.710 
learn how to drive in an automatic the
reason<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.250> there's<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.610> whole<00:01:18.030> extra<00:01:18.540> pedal

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
reason is is there's a whole extra pedal

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.350 
reason is is there's a whole extra pedal
in<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> car<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.950> very<00:01:20.159> intimidating<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
in the car so it's very intimidating the

has a bunch of stop signs you're not

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.199 
has a bunch of stop signs you're not
bothering<00:03:04.670> anybody

you're<00:03:05.570> not<00:03:05.690> stalling<00:03:06.049> out<00:03:06.170> in<00:03:06.320> front<00:03:06.470> of

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
you're not stalling out in front of

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.710 
you're not stalling out in front of
anybody<00:03:06.799> you're<00:03:07.549> just<00:03:07.790> learning<00:03:08.120> at<00:03:08.420> your<00:03:08.570> own

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
anybody you're just learning at your own

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.229 
anybody you're just learning at your own
pace<00:03:09.049> alright<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.220> next<00:03:10.250> step<00:03:10.579> is<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.120> go

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
pace alright so the next step is to go

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.940 
pace alright so the next step is to go
from<00:03:11.450> first

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
from first

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.490 
from first
to<00:03:13.950> second<00:03:14.459> now<00:03:15.239> going<00:03:15.599> into<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.989> next<00:03:16.170> gear

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
to second now going into the next gear

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.300 
to second now going into the next gear
is<00:03:16.830> just<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:19.140> did<00:03:19.349> for<00:03:19.650> your<00:03:19.739> first<00:03:20.010> gear

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
is just like you did for your first gear

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.660 
is just like you did for your first gear
you<00:03:20.549> just<00:03:20.790> repeat<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.480> process<00:03:21.799> so<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:23.340> put

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
you just repeat the process so you put

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.660 
you just repeat the process so you put
the<00:03:23.790> clutch<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:25.470> pull<00:03:25.799> down<00:03:26.099> the<00:03:26.430> stick

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
the clutch in you pull down the stick

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.059 
the clutch in you pull down the stick
shift<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:27.060> your<00:03:27.090> second<00:03:27.540> gear<00:03:27.780> which<00:03:27.989> is

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
shift to your second gear which is

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.190 
shift to your second gear which is
basically<00:03:29.069> always<00:03:29.370> just<00:03:29.730> straight<00:03:30.120> down<00:03:30.200> and

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
basically always just straight down and

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.619 
basically always just straight down and
you<00:03:31.799> repeat<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.340> clutch<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.819> gas<00:03:32.879> process

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
you repeat the clutch and gas process

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.690 
you repeat the clutch and gas process
and<00:03:33.870> you'll<00:03:33.989> just<00:03:34.110> be<00:03:34.230> moving<00:03:34.680> first<00:03:35.159> gear<00:03:35.519> is

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
and you'll just be moving first gear is

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.910 
and you'll just be moving first gear is
always<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.480> hardest<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.140> learn<00:03:37.349> but<00:03:37.620> once<00:03:37.799> you

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
always the hardest to learn but once you

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.069 
always the hardest to learn but once you
have<00:03:38.069> learned<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.730> first<00:03:39.090> gear<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.870> other

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
have learned that first gear the other

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.890 
have learned that first gear the other
other<00:03:40.650> gears<00:03:41.069> their<00:03:41.250> gravy<00:03:41.549> they're<00:03:42.000> easy<00:03:42.209> or

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
other gears their gravy they're easy or

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.559 
other gears their gravy they're easy or
in<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.079> stop<00:03:43.319> sign<00:03:43.730> put<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.359> car<00:03:45.599> in<00:03:45.720> first<00:03:46.220> go

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
in a stop sign put the car in first go

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.839 
in a stop sign put the car in first go
then<00:03:49.370> clutch<00:03:50.370> in

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
then clutch in

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.229 
then clutch in
pull<00:03:51.090> down<00:03:51.299> repeat<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.410> process<00:03:53.239> another

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
pull down repeat the process another

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.280 
pull down repeat the process another
thing<00:03:54.510> learning<00:03:54.870> how<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:54.989> drive<00:03:55.230> a

stick-shift is your rpm gauge or your
tachometer<00:03:58.319> is<00:03:58.500> much<00:03:59.159> more<00:03:59.400> important<00:03:59.879> when

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
tachometer is much more important when

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.599 
tachometer is much more important when
