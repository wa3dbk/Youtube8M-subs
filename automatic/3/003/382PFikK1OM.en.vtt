i'm filming this is my kitchen is

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.490 
i'm filming this is my kitchen is
because<00:00:17.450> it's<00:00:17.600> got<00:00:17.780> much<00:00:17.990> better<00:00:18.170> lighting

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
because it's got much better lighting

because it's got much better lighting
than<00:00:18.890> upstairs<00:00:19.160> let's<00:00:19.940> start<00:00:20.090> with<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.390> g4

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
than upstairs let's start with the g4

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.250 
than upstairs let's start with the g4
cube<00:00:21.040> this<00:00:22.040> here<00:00:22.310> was<00:00:22.340> originally<00:00:23.090> a<00:00:23.270> 500

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
cube this here was originally a 500

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.550 
cube this here was originally a 500
megahertz<00:00:24.560> g4<00:00:25.130> cube<00:00:25.180> with<00:00:26.180> 128<00:00:27.110> megs<00:00:27.380> of<00:00:27.500> ram

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
megahertz g4 cube with 128 megs of ram

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.019 
megahertz g4 cube with 128 megs of ram
and<00:00:27.760> leave<00:00:28.760> a<00:00:28.790> 20<00:00:29.030> gig<00:00:29.390> hard<00:00:29.570> drive<00:00:29.890> I<00:00:31.029> took

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
and leave a 20 gig hard drive I took

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.410 
and leave a 20 gig hard drive I took
this<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:32.689> had<00:00:32.989> it<00:00:33.110> totally<00:00:33.410> upgraded<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:34.760> a

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
this and had it totally upgraded to a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.680 
this and had it totally upgraded to a
dual<00:00:36.109> core<00:00:36.350> or<00:00:36.890> dual<00:00:37.399> 1.2<00:00:38.300> gigahertz

ram and a 120 gig hard drive considering

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.829 
ram and a 120 gig hard drive considering
they<00:00:45.350> can<00:00:45.499> only<00:00:45.649> see<00:00:46.219> up<00:00:46.429> to<00:00:46.519> 128<00:00:47.210> gigabytes

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
they can only see up to 128 gigabytes

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.220 
they can only see up to 128 gigabytes
and<00:00:48.760> it's<00:00:49.760> got<00:00:49.969> a<00:00:49.999> super<00:00:50.569> Drive<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:50.960> here<00:00:51.079> now

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
and it's got a super Drive in here now

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.619 
and it's got a super Drive in here now
too<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:51.710> it<00:00:52.519> took<00:00:52.670> some<00:00:52.879> upgrading<00:00:53.359> but<00:00:53.480> it<00:00:53.539> was

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
too so it took some upgrading but it was

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.319 
too so it took some upgrading but it was
not<00:00:53.719> a<00:00:53.780> big<00:00:53.989> deal<00:00:54.789> the<00:00:55.789> only<00:00:56.059> reason<00:00:56.300> that

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
not a big deal the only reason that

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.880 
not a big deal the only reason that
keeps<00:00:56.600> things<00:00:56.929> just<00:00:57.140> because<00:00:57.289> it<00:00:57.530> looks<00:00:57.559> so

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
keeps things just because it looks so

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.540
