box that should be shipped in a box it

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.240 
box that should be shipped in a box it
should<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.960> shifting<00:02:01.710> something<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.070> this

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
should be shifting something like this

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.149 
should be shifting something like this
that's<00:02:02.610> that's<00:02:03.240> crazy<00:02:03.409> but<00:02:04.409> let<00:02:04.920> me<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.009> what
