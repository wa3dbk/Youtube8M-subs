00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.280
 hello in this first video we are going to 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.010
 teach how to disassemble a trapeze 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.170
 suspension we will start lifting and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.939
 fixing the car safely 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.270
 then we will begin to dismantle the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.270
 wheel 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.769
 we are using a gun 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.000
 impact although this operation can be 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.480
 perform with a wheel wrench 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.480
 conventional 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.660
 once we bring the wheel we have left 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.500
 enough space to be able to work 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.500
 with food 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.420
 first of all let's disassemble the 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.920
 breakage of direction to release the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.300
 movement of the stub axle and so on 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.060
 to be able to better extract the kneecap 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.250
 load suspension 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.070
 as we will observe after this nut rule 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.170
 the break does not come out easily so 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.640
 to be able to hit with a hammer what 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.800
 What we will do is replace the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.750
 nut on the screw head for 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.390
 be able to hit on it without distorting 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.309
 tip of the tournament so after will not give us 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.440
 problems when reassembling the same 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.960
 Turkish 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.030
 the trapeze is joined by three points to the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.980
 vehicle we will start releasing the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.780
 Breakage of the load suspension for 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.430
 to extract it we will have to dismantle 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.650
 the through screw that blocks the 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.570
 break and then helping us with 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.640
 an extra lever we will break the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.830
 your accommodation doing strength 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.270
 necessary to remove it since it does not 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.490
 they always come out easily 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.470
 now let's release the two supports 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.960
 trapeze interiors to be able 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.220
 release the right blog sinem we will have 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.220
 to remove the through bolt 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.800
 we already have the screw loosened and we're going 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.230
 to remove it next to that piece that also 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.390
 is going to hold 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.520
 we only have one support this last 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.230
 joined by two screws one that one of 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.370
 will stand like a seed so let's go 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.020
 to remove now the other screw we have 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.480
 to hold it from above to avoid 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.400
 to turn the head this screw one in 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.170
 arm support and support the bar 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.340
 stabilizer to the cell or it 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.409
 distance 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.259
 once we have the loose arm with 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.879
 much care we will proceed to extract it 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.410
 we have our arm out to go back to 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.610
 assemble the arm not only shall we 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.610
 follow the reverse process 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.950
 or not
