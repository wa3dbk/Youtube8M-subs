all<00:02:53.709> pictures<00:02:53.889> of<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.220> door<00:02:54.459> just<00:02:55.000> different

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
all pictures of the door just different

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.129 
all pictures of the door just different
looks<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.159> the<00:02:57.220> door<00:02:57.370> i<00:02:57.430> guess<00:02:57.579> you<00:02:57.700> could<00:02:57.819> say

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
looks of the door i guess you could say

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.020 
looks of the door i guess you could say
and<00:02:59.139> if<00:02:59.650> we<00:02:59.799> look<00:02:59.920> over<00:03:00.069> here<00:03:00.340> we<00:03:00.489> can<00:03:00.519> see<00:03:00.849> that

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
and if we look over here we can see that

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.539 
and if we look over here we can see that
there's<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:04.139> little<00:03:05.139> instructions<00:03:05.739> which<00:03:06.430> I'm

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
there's a little instructions which I'm

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.009 
there's a little instructions which I'm
assuming<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.940> for<00:03:07.180> as<00:03:07.269> little<00:03:07.389> platform<00:03:07.720> we

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
assuming is for as little platform we

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.440 
assuming is for as little platform we
stand<00:03:08.230> on<00:03:08.379> and<00:03:09.129> I<00:03:09.519> get<00:03:09.639> there<00:03:09.849> it<00:03:10.000> says<00:03:10.209> enter

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
stand on and I get there it says enter

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.080 
stand on and I get there it says enter
pin<00:03:10.870> so<00:03:13.019> no<00:03:14.019> one<00:03:14.170> knows<00:03:14.349> what's<00:03:14.590> back<00:03:14.709> there<00:03:15.090> so

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
pin so no one knows what's back there so

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.210 
pin so no one knows what's back there so
