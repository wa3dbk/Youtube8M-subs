see a close-up I've basically rolled up
the<00:00:38.969> sleeves<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> equipment<00:00:39.930> blouse<00:00:40.350> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the sleeves on the equipment blouse and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.190 
the sleeves on the equipment blouse and
I've<00:00:41.100> let<00:00:41.340> them<00:00:41.579> stick<00:00:42.360> out<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.600> little<00:00:42.840> bit

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
I've let them stick out a little bit

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.470

underneath<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.860> Blazer<00:00:44.730> sleeves<00:00:45.210> because

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
underneath the Blazer sleeves because

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.240 
underneath the Blazer sleeves because
the<00:00:45.750> Blazers<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.320> three-quarter<00:00:46.920> sleeves

and<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.090> think<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:49.050> bit<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.649> nice

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and I think that's just a bit of a nice

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.229 
and I think that's just a bit of a nice
touch

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
touch

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.569
