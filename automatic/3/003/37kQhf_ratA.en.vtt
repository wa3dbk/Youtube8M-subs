00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.889 
climbing nice and easy this one cast it
off<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.429> bar<00:01:59.639> it<00:01:59.909> strikes<00:02:00.179> an<00:02:00.389> enemy<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.809> then

off the bar it strikes an enemy and then

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.899 
off the bar it strikes an enemy and then
changes<00:02:01.289> often<00:02:01.439> huge<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.069> and<00:02:02.309> however<00:02:02.729> many

changes often huge you and however many

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.909 
changes often huge you and however many
allies<00:02:03.299> actually<00:02:03.809> gets<00:02:03.989> to<00:02:04.079> it's<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.649> really

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:04.919 
allies actually gets to it's a really

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:06.739 
allies actually gets to it's a really
really<00:02:05.189> useful<00:02:05.429> healed<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.059> it<00:02:06.359> will<00:02:06.479> also

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
really useful healed and it will also

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:09.020 
really useful healed and it will also
electrifly<00:02:07.619> anything<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.399> touches<00:02:08.550> which

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
electrifly anything it touches which

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.720 
electrifly anything it touches which
works<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.630> conjunction<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:10.439> electro<00:02:11.159> bus

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
works in conjunction with electro bus

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.979 
works in conjunction with electro bus
so<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.330> reason<00:02:12.390> I'm<00:02:12.780> going<00:02:12.930> to

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
so it's for this reason I'm going to

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.199 
so it's for this reason I'm going to
move<00:02:13.140> on<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.319> electro<00:02:13.800> bus<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.370> what<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.730> does

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
move on to electro bus so what that does

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.640 
move on to electro bus so what that does
is<00:02:15.239> as<00:02:15.569> soon<00:02:15.690> as<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.840> cast<00:02:16.019> off<00:02:16.260> at<00:02:16.379> the<00:02:16.409> bar

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
is as soon as you cast off at the bar

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.100 
is as soon as you cast off at the bar
you<00:02:16.830> stamp<00:02:17.129> your<00:02:17.220> foot<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.730> cause<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.569> burst<00:02:18.900> of

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
you stamp your foot and cause a burst of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.009 
you stamp your foot and cause a burst of
electric<00:02:19.560> energy<00:02:19.650> now<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:21.299> have<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.690> hit<00:02:21.810> an

electric energy now you have to hit an

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.050 
electric energy now you have to hit an
enemy<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.530> order<00:02:23.159> for<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.430> work<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.879> give

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
enemy in order for it to work and give

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.789 
enemy in order for it to work and give
you<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.209> heel<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:25.170> enemy<00:02:25.470> must<00:02:25.680> be

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
you a heel and that enemy must be

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.070 
you a heel and that enemy must be
electrified<00:02:26.610> now<00:02:27.120> once<00:02:27.330> you've<00:02:27.480> hit<00:02:27.659> this<00:02:27.840> if

electrified now once you've hit this if

it aves like galvanized only its range

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.630 
it aves like galvanized only its range
is<00:02:30.330> smaller<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.260> will<00:02:31.500> leave<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:32.099> heal<00:02:32.400> over

time on your allies for 40 seconds but

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.520 
time on your allies for 40 seconds but
I've<00:02:36.090> be<00:02:36.360> warned<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.810> not<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> massive<00:02:37.200> heal

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
I've be warned it's not a massive heal

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.500 
I've be warned it's not a massive heal
over<00:02:37.799> time<00:02:37.829> like<00:02:38.549> I<00:02:38.700> said<00:02:38.879> before<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.329> more

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
over time like I said before it's more

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.960 
over time like I said before it's more
of<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.780> residual<00:02:40.410> effect<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:41.159> is<00:02:41.430> useful

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
of a residual effect but it is useful

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.059 
of a residual effect but it is useful
and<00:02:42.269> when<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.540> stack<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:42.900> with<00:02:43.230> other<00:02:43.560> heel<00:02:43.860> /

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
and when you stack it with other heel /

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.309 
and when you stack it with other heel /
times<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.579> really<00:02:44.910> helped<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.239> here<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:46.110> your

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
problem with the heel at the end is it's

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.479
