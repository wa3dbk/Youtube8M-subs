it's<00:02:51.989> just<00:02:52.200> visually<00:02:52.799> seeing<00:02:53.100> them<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:55.069> maybe

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
it's just visually seeing them so maybe

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.350 
it's just visually seeing them so maybe

California decided to upgrade old 99
from<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.079> four-lane<00:03:10.500> road<00:03:11.120> where<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.209> would<00:03:12.359> go

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
from a four-lane road where it would go

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.380 
from a four-lane road where it would go
through<00:03:12.750> each<00:03:12.959> one<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.230> these<00:03:13.410> little<00:03:13.739> towns

down through Merced and Manteca it would

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.729 
down through Merced and Manteca it would
bypass<00:03:25.350> all<00:03:25.859> these<00:03:26.040> towns<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:27.620> even<00:03:28.620> though

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
bypass all these towns and even though

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.550 
bypass all these towns and even though
some<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.069> these<00:03:29.480> places<00:03:30.480> would<00:03:30.989> try<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.319> move

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
some of these places would try to move

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.030 
some of these places would try to move
their<00:03:32.780> establishments<00:03:33.780> toward<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.470> new

their establishments toward the new
freeway<00:03:35.480> you'd<00:03:36.480> have<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.720> take<00:03:36.989> your<00:03:37.140> freeway

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
freeway you'd have to take your freeway

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.830 
freeway you'd have to take your freeway
off-ramp<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.459> real<00:03:38.700> estate<00:03:39.060> was<00:03:39.359> getting

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
off-ramp and the real estate was getting

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.599 
off-ramp and the real estate was getting
too<00:03:39.989> expensive<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.160> lot<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.459> these

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
too expensive and so a lot of these

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.360 
too expensive and so a lot of these
places<00:03:41.910> started<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.510> die<00:03:42.720> out<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.859> buildings

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
places started to die out the buildings

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.160 
places started to die out the buildings
are<00:03:44.579> still<00:03:44.609> there<00:03:45.090> some<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.660> signs<00:03:45.900> are

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
are still there some of the signs are

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.860 
are still there some of the signs are
even<00:03:46.440> still<00:03:46.650> there<00:03:46.889> and<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.790> show<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.450> show

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
even still there and the show I show

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.930 
even still there and the show I show
some<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.530> old<00:03:49.829> signs<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.489> how<00:03:50.609> they<00:03:50.790> are

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
some of the old signs and how they are

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.410 
some of the old signs and how they are
today<00:03:51.380> but<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.410> do<00:03:52.639> take<00:03:53.639> some<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.970> those<00:03:54.090> old

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
today but I do take some of those old

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.440 
today but I do take some of those old
signs<00:03:54.959> old<00:03:55.290> buildings<00:03:56.010> and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.570 

exhume<00:03:59.450> them<00:03:59.720> if<00:03:59.900> you<00:04:00.050> will<00:04:00.260> from<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.310> past

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
exhume them if you will from the past

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.380 
exhume them if you will from the past
and<00:04:02.800> try<00:04:03.800> to<00:04:03.860> show<00:04:04.130> you<00:04:04.190> what<00:04:04.550> they<00:04:05.090> look<00:04:05.120> like

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
and try to show you what they look like

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.870 
and try to show you what they look like
at<00:04:05.870> least<00:04:06.260> in<00:04:06.470> my<00:04:06.620> mind's<00:04:07.010> on<00:04:07.130> what<00:04:07.490> they<00:04:07.640> look

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
at least in my mind's on what they look

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.590 
at least in my mind's on what they look
like<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:09.580> sprinkle<00:04:10.580> them<00:04:10.610> with<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.880> few<00:04:11.150> people

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
like and sprinkle them with a few people

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.930 
like and sprinkle them with a few people
to<00:04:11.959> bring<00:04:12.260> them<00:04:12.410> alive<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.490> I<00:04:14.470> think<00:04:15.820> it'll<00:04:16.820> be

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
to bring them alive and I think it'll be

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.780 
to bring them alive and I think it'll be
for<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.560> very<00:04:18.560> interesting<00:04:19.070> show<00:04:19.280> I<00:04:19.459> can't<00:04:19.700> wait

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
for a very interesting show I can't wait

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:42.999 
for a very interesting show I can't wait
to<00:04:19.910> see<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.180> myself

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.069 

you
