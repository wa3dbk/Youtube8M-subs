putting the in the Blues logo on there
is<00:01:18.590> great<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.280> this<00:01:19.430> pedal<00:01:19.700> could<00:01:19.820> be<00:01:19.880> used<00:01:20.119> in

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
is great so this pedal could be used in

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.880 
is great so this pedal could be used in
a<00:01:20.420> number<00:01:20.659> of<00:01:20.690> different<00:01:21.110> ways<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.500> first<00:01:21.740> way

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
a number of different ways the first way

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.710 
a number of different ways the first way
is<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.250> conventional<00:01:22.759> volume<00:01:23.180> boost<00:01:23.479> or

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
is the conventional volume boost or

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.200 
is the conventional volume boost or
preamp<00:01:24.470> boost<00:01:24.740> style<00:01:25.399> which<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.850> what<00:01:26.000> I<00:01:26.030> was

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
preamp boost style which is what I was

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.910 
preamp boost style which is what I was
just<00:01:26.450> using<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:26.840> as<00:01:26.960> straight<00:01:27.409> into<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.740> amp

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
just using it as straight into the amp

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.130 
just using it as straight into the amp
or<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.880> can<00:01:29.000> use<00:01:29.119> it<00:01:29.149> before<00:01:29.540> your<00:01:29.659> pedals<00:01:29.960> to

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
or you can use it before your pedals to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.169 
or you can use it before your pedals to
push<00:01:30.320> all<00:01:30.590> your<00:01:30.770> other<00:01:30.920> pedals<00:01:31.369> either<00:01:31.910> with

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
push all your other pedals either with

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.389 
push all your other pedals either with
more<00:01:32.390> game<00:01:32.600> before<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:33.200> or<00:01:33.590> after<00:01:33.649> depending

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
more game before it or after depending

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.430 
more game before it or after depending
on<00:01:34.610> how<00:01:34.759> you<00:01:34.820> like<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.149> run<00:01:35.539> it<00:01:35.690> if<00:01:35.929> you<00:01:36.229> use

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
on how you like to run it if you use

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.290 
on how you like to run it if you use
this<00:01:36.649> pedal<00:01:36.979> at<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.280> end<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.670> your<00:01:37.759> chain<00:01:37.820> will

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
this pedal at the end of your chain will

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.270 
this pedal at the end of your chain will
actually<00:01:38.660> act<00:01:38.869> as<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.170> treble<00:01:39.649> boost<00:01:39.860> which<00:01:40.130> is

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
actually act as a treble boost which is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.370 
actually act as a treble boost which is
pretty<00:01:40.490> cool<00:01:40.700> as<00:01:41.210> well<00:01:41.450> as<00:01:41.690> pushing<00:01:42.289> the

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
pretty cool as well as pushing the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.770 
pretty cool as well as pushing the
volume<00:01:42.770> but<00:01:42.979> it<00:01:43.070> will<00:01:43.130> act<00:01:43.460> or<00:01:44.149> as<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.360> treble

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
volume but it will act or as a treble

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.810 
volume but it will act or as a treble
boost<00:01:45.020> in<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:45.470> situation<00:01:46.130> which<00:01:46.310> is<00:01:46.460> really

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
boost in that situation which is really

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.060 
boost in that situation which is really
cool<00:01:47.000> using<00:01:47.660> it<00:01:47.780> before<00:01:47.899> a<00:01:48.140> fuzz<00:01:48.560> pedal<00:01:48.920> will

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
cool using it before a fuzz pedal will

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.279 
cool using it before a fuzz pedal will
give<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:49.340> just<00:01:49.640> epic<00:01:50.030> fuzz<00:01:50.360> sustain<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.170> we're

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
give you just epic fuzz sustain so we're

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.749 
give you just epic fuzz sustain so we're
going<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.440> try<00:01:51.619> that<00:01:51.649> as<00:01:51.890> well<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:52.429> the<00:01:52.520> way<00:01:52.640> I'm

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
going to try that as well so the way I'm

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.520 
going to try that as well so the way I'm
running<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.149> is<00:01:53.360> basically<00:01:53.840> into<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.320> amp

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
running it is basically into the amp

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.040 
running it is basically into the amp
just<00:01:55.310> pushing<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.820> as<00:01:56.060> hard<00:01:56.270> as<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.630> can<00:01:56.720> go<00:01:56.899> and

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
just pushing it as hard as it can go and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.719 
just pushing it as hard as it can go and
that<00:01:57.140> was<00:01:57.319> with<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.560> pedal<00:01:57.860> on<00:01:57.950> max<00:01:58.280> in<00:01:58.550> that

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
that was with the pedal on max in that

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.639 
that was with the pedal on max in that
clip<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.600> let's<00:01:59.630> give<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.140> shot<00:02:00.440> I'm

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
clip so let's give this a shot I'm

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.010

65 deluxe reverb and I'm going to show
you<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:05.930> difference<00:02:06.320> without<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.710> backing

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
you the difference without the backing

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.440 
you the difference without the backing
track<00:02:07.189> just<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.460> show<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:07.729> how<00:02:07.909> it<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.179> pedal

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
track just to show you how it the pedal

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.609 
track just to show you how it the pedal
sounds<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:08.929> here<00:02:09.110> we<00:02:09.200> go

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
sounds so here we go

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.140 
sounds so here we go
you<00:02:09.799> might<00:02:09.950> also<00:02:10.190> notice<00:02:10.579> that<00:02:10.729> there's<00:02:11.000> no

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
you might also notice that there's no

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.060 
you might also notice that there's no
marking<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.110> I've<00:02:12.290> got<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.560> pedal<00:02:12.860> all<00:02:13.040> the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
marking so I've got the pedal all the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.280 
marking so I've got the pedal all the
way<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.579> left<00:02:13.730> right<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:14.720> it's<00:02:14.870> as<00:02:15.019> low

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
way to the left right now so it's as low

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:36.399 
way to the left right now so it's as low
as<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.739> will<00:02:15.829> go

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:49.100 

at<00:02:37.409> about<00:02:37.709> halfway<00:02:46.970> at<00:02:47.970> about<00:02:48.239> three-quarters

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
at about halfway at about three-quarters

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:57.130 
at about halfway at about three-quarters
of<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.290> way<00:02:49.379> up

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.839 

so<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.470> hear<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.739> starting<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.040> push<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
so you can hear it starting to push the

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:34.770 
so you can hear it starting to push the
sound<00:03:00.120> now<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.860> all<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.890> way<00:03:02.040> out
