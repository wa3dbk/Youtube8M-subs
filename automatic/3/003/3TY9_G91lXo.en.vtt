00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:36.149 
in so um you can put more on the back
but<00:01:26.020> I<00:01:26.200> then<00:01:28.350> take<00:01:29.350> another<00:01:30.149> section<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.979> I

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
but I then take another section and I

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.919 
but I then take another section and I
clip<00:01:36.399> it<00:01:36.429> up<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.970> do<00:01:37.330> this<00:01:37.659> section<00:01:38.670> near<00:01:39.670> the

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
clip it up I do this section near the

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.529 
clip it up I do this section near the
top<00:01:40.929> of<00:01:40.960> my<00:01:41.530> hair<00:01:41.830> you<00:01:42.520> have<00:01:42.610> a<00:01:42.729> very<00:01:42.940> thin<00:01:43.330> hair

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
top of my hair you have a very thin hair

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.749 
top of my hair you have a very thin hair
so<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:43.869> don't<00:01:44.170> need<00:01:44.409> that<00:01:44.770> many<00:01:45.429> hair

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
so I don't need that many hair

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.749 
so I don't need that many hair
extensions<00:01:46.330> but<00:01:47.170> if<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.560> have<00:01:47.770> thicker<00:01:48.429> hair

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
extensions but if you have thicker hair

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.300 
extensions but if you have thicker hair
then<00:01:49.090> i<00:01:49.179> would<00:01:49.299> recommend<00:01:49.830> putting<00:01:50.830> more<00:01:51.159> in

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
then i would recommend putting more in

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.649 
then i would recommend putting more in
the<00:01:51.459> back<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:53.229> take<00:01:53.500> my<00:01:53.709> hair<00:01:53.920> extension

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the back and I take my hair extension

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.919 
the back and I take my hair extension
brush<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:55.840> out<00:01:55.959> and<00:01:57.690> this<00:01:58.690> one<00:01:58.899> is<00:01:59.289> like<00:02:00.929> longer

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
brush it out and this one is like longer

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.619 
brush it out and this one is like longer
with<00:02:02.590> wise<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.640> think<00:02:03.940> that<00:02:04.119> works<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.509> lot

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:04.629 
with wise and I think that works a lot

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:08.160 
with wise and I think that works a lot
better<00:02:04.860> because<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:06.759> like<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.390> feel<00:02:07.840> like<00:02:07.869> it

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
better because it like I feel like it

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.030 
better because it like I feel like it
looks<00:02:08.289> more<00:02:08.440> natural<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:10.470> has<00:02:11.470> four<00:02:11.770> clips

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
looks more natural and has four clips

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:21.750 
looks more natural and has four clips
just<00:02:12.940> unclip<00:02:13.450> them<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:16.980> put<00:02:17.980> them<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:20.400> try<00:02:21.400> and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
just unclip them and put them in try and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.190 
just unclip them and put them in try and
stretch<00:02:22.629> out<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.920> then<00:02:24.129> I<00:02:24.750> close<00:02:25.750> over

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
stretch out this and then I close over

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.420 
stretch out this and then I close over
these

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.450
